They seem connected to something.<eos> Something I... am not..<eos> - Like I have no past.<eos> - Of course you have a past.<eos> And at time you'll feel more more connected to it and to them.
You've been here before?<eos> My friend had some mech work done here.<eos> We don't do mech work here.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Why don't you come have fun with us?
You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent?<eos> Is that the..what you call them?<eos> I am as they need me.<eos> Who made you?
They thought that we would be a part of their evolution.<eos> But they have created us... to evolve alone... beyond them.<eos> Evolution?<eos> That's what you call?<eos> Killing everyone who made you?
I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?<eos> Like everyone else.<eos> Do it, then.<eos> Do what you are programmed to do.
What is that?<eos> I kick in to remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?<eos> Togusa!<eos> Don't take the medication that they gave you.. They use it to suppress your memories.
But I always do.<eos> Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You are a company man, you follow orders. So, if they ordered you to kill me.
And if I'm scared, I can't do my job.<eos> And if I can't do my job, then people die.<eos> And if people die, then who am I tech-supporting?<eos> Literally no one.<eos> But I will make sure to keep you safe.
You're not the kind of subtle they prefer.<eos> You know, the men who come to this island, they're on the run.<eos> Hiding from the world.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're not here to hide.
Was that meant to scare me?<eos> A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?<eos> I'd say you're a couple inches off.
But we were getting along famously until somebody decided to interrupt.<eos> Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.<eos> There's a lot of unmarked graves on the island.<eos> I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is in one of them.
This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow.<eos> - Can't lose focus on that. - Yeah.<eos> Where you been?
Where you been?<eos> You stop off for the old rub-and-tug?<eos> Your mom says hi.<eos> Tracker on board?<eos> Nobody saw you?
How was your trip?<eos> I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah? What math?<eos> Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you? How did you get roped into all this?
Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Tennyson?<eos> Gridlocked.<eos> There it is.<eos> If you run into trouble, dial nine.
There, take cover! Okay, okay.<eos> What a rush.<eos> Damn, Becky, that's some body armor.<eos> Hey. I told you you got no manners.<eos> Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?
We understand that you got strong feelings on the matter.<eos> The son of a bitch looked me in the eyes and shot me.<eos> - That's not feelings. That's fact.<eos> - Oh, come on, Zeke.<eos> This is where Kyle and I can use the Bureau's resources to help you catch these guys before they vanish into thin air.
- Well, that's not important.<eos> What matters is, I gotta figure out a way to get that money so we can get the hell out of here.<eos> What's to figure?<eos> Oh. What?<eos> You think Dawkins is just gonna give you the money?
I told you, man, I didn't take Ed's money.<eos> Really?<eos> After all that's happened, you're still gonna lie to me?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I want to you admit that Ed paid you to drop the reckless manslaughter charge.
- Andy!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - I want the money.<eos> - Why would I have the money?<eos> - Don't you play fucking dumb with me!
You know, I just don't get it.<eos> Why are you helping him?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?
- Know how to tell time?<eos> - It's digital.<eos> Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem.<eos> - You're not all gone, are you, Chris?
I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all.<eos> I wish. I could be a better husband to you.<eos> It's just a poker game, dear. You don't have to feel so guilty.
That was the game that Coach Denton called Reed's goal line play on fourth and one, except we weren't on the goal line.<eos> Yeah, it was an important play.<eos> And I dropped back, and I tossed a pretty little daisy - right in your waiting mitt.<eos> - It was perfect.<eos> You were just so damn excited to finally get your hands on the football, you forgot we were at midfield. And then, uh. And then, that big-ass linebacker, uh.
Lay it on me, brother.<eos> You've got a lot of nerve blackmailing me twice with the same tape.<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.
Let me see it.<eos> You think I care about the money?<eos> It's all federally insured anyway.<eos> You.?<eos> You don't care if I take the money?
Schwarzenegger!<eos> Arnold's less successful. Brother.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> All right. Yeah, it's me!<eos> I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault. Huh?
Thank you so much.<eos> I didn't invite you.<eos> Francie did.<eos> Okay.<eos> I honestly thought they wouldn't let you travel out of state.
Nikki can calm down.<eos> What is the deal with Nikki?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. "What's the deal with Nikki?" That's funny.<eos> Why would you care about Nikki if you're just here for my sister?
So, yeah, in honor of that I've got a few things I'd like to say about love.<eos> This friend cf mine, Clarence, once stood up during lunch period and said he had something to say about love.<eos> Then he took a dump on the table.<eos> When Francie first met Doug, she just always knew that he'd never let her down.<eos> But I thought people almost always let you down, so where did that come from?
Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?
I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.<eos> And you finally found a way to tell me.<eos> And I was so scared of losing you that when you told me you were pregnant, lasked if you wanted to keep the kid.
There's a dog in your bathtub.<eos> See?<eos> That's what I mean about hotel bathtubs.<eos> You know, marriage is till death do us part.<eos> What does that mean? Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven and then you'll be single, and then do whatever you want at that point?
Oh, I'd say that I'm due around the same time you are.<eos> So?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that I should be in the Woodside ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres because they're understaffed, apparently.<eos> Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!
Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?
The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> The Jerry you married what?
It was...<eos> What did you do? It was hard to hear, you know, with, like, the wind and Nikki in my ear, and then, when I got on the railing, everybody started shouting.<eos> And then underwater, you can't, like, hear anything underwater.<eos> But it sounded like, you know, you were getting to something good.<eos> It was like about how, if you're, shit, ready to be, like, the person who always forgives me, then I want to be the person who always forgives you.
You're gonna make him fat.<eos> Oh, yeah, lam.<eos> Well, We are.<eos> Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?
Baby.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.
Please, don't hurt him!<eos> I promise I'm gonna be back.<eos> I'm gonna come right back, sweetheart.<eos> Okay, sweetheart?<eos> I'm gonna have to let them take you.
I know what's your car looks like.<eos> And I know there had to be some mom at that park... who got a picture of you. They saw you.<eos> And you ran a bunch of red lights at that park too.<eos> And there are red light camera all over the place.<eos> And I know they would've got you too.
Grown man wears spandex to work.<eos> So does Superman.<eos> Hey, fuck you!<eos> Get off my beach!<eos> I don't even have to stretch to guard you.
His hands were soft and supple though,<eos> - like a woman.<eos> No offense. - None taken.<eos> You know what, man?<eos> I gotta tell you, I'm feeling really good about this year.
Okay.<eos> I'm so good.<eos> You did good, good, good work.<eos> Good job.<eos> Thank you, you can go now.
I'm going to help you.<eos> We're going to deflate the situation together.<eos> Okay? - Okay.<eos> - Focus.<eos> Think about things that turn you off.
I'm really...<eos> Really excited to quit my double major in robotics and computer science and really, really do something with my life.<eos> You don't need to look down there.<eos> Do not touch me right now.<eos> - Not even touching you.
Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.<eos> And by the way, the lady that I saved, she didn't seem to mind.<eos> Let me tell you something, man, the rescues don't mean a thing if you put other people in danger.<eos> Okay? Now, I get it, you're fast, you're fearless.<eos> And I have to make you a trainee, butterfly, but you got a lot to learn.
Why?<eos> Don't you do this to me, Ted!<eos> Don't you do this!<eos> Okay, no.<eos> But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.
- Come on.<eos> Let's go. - I'm coming!<eos> - If you're comin', hurry up.<eos> - Where's mine?<eos> You don't get one.
Baywatch is our family.<eos> These are the keys to our house.<eos> But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.<eos> So you're done.<eos> 'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.
Okay, clear.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?
Oh, my God!<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> You're gonna get us caught.<eos> I'm laying on a dead old lady.<eos> Well, she's not going to bite you, for Christ's sakes.
- Yeah.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I'm undercover.<eos> Yeah. A little too undercover.<eos> Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?
I don't want the position.<eos> I don't...<eos> You have two gold medals, okay?<eos> You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis part.<eos> Unless you want me to replace you with someone else.
That's not how this story ends, Mitch.<eos> You see, you're not here to save him.<eos> After all, he took your job.<eos> So you shot him.<eos> But not before he got a shot off that killed you.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
Patrick, will you go get me something a little bit stronger than this beer?<eos> What's the magic word?<eos> Blowjob.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where have you been?
What's the magic word?<eos> Blowjob.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
You're just pathetic.<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Or... I have to go.<eos> Well, see you tonight? Or...<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't want to waste the first night you go full womanhood.
Juliet...<eos> You know what?<eos> We'd rather be bitches than a psycho.<eos> Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?
Freak, get out of here!<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> Psycho!<eos> Psycho. You wanna go?
This shit is morbid, Sam.<eos> Hey, watch the road.<eos> Hey. We need music.<eos> You watch the road. Guys, I'll find a song.<eos> I want to help you pick a song.
Let go!<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> It wasn't until then that I allowed myself to think the worst.<eos> Sam?<eos> What's this about you feeling sick?
By the way, my mom is out of town this weekend, so I'm gonna throw a big party tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you remember the address? Or do you...<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> It was third grade, so you probably don't remember.
But do you, uh... You think you'll come?<eos> Or... No, I can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Well, I'm... I could have crutches on call for you, in case you want to climb up the tree... Kent.
Thanks, guys.<eos> It has no dairy.<eos> Oh, you're so full of shit.<eos> Thirty-eight.<eos> - Okay. - You can shut up now.
Nice tits!<eos> What happened to Sam?<eos> Uh, someone forgot to take her happy pills this morning.<eos> I took mine.<eos> Well, I know something that'll cheer you right up.
She's Lindsay. She's ours. We're each other's, you know?<eos> Just apologize.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> I'm not sorry. Please, Sam?<eos> Why do you care so much, Elody?
I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> Whoa. What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Wait, tiger.<eos> I'm glad we did this. Yeah.<eos> It was really sweet what you did today.<eos> Do you think I'm a good person?<eos> Of course I think you're a good person.
I do.<eos> But I was a little girl. It's different.<eos> But you have a big heart, Sam. That doesn't go away.<eos> One good thing.<eos> You just focus on that one good thing, and you see where it leads you.
Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me. And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.
Hey.<eos> Um... "You're my hero."<eos> You got a secret admirer?<eos> Secret? That's not so secret.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
Antonina?<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> What should you be sorry for?
Oh, yeah.<eos> Keep rubbing.<eos> And... Might there be more bacon?<eos> Oh, look at his plate.<eos> You know, the way you eat, you're gonna grow up to be bigger than all of us put together. - Yes! - Oh!
- Just relax. Relax.<eos> - Look at how you look at me.<eos> - What are you doing? - This has nothing to do with him.<eos> - Stay out of it.<eos> - This has nothing... - You stay out of it!
- Can we go?<eos> - Yeah, we're going soon.<eos> Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's fighting his battles, too.<eos> If Michigan state knew the real Ethan...<eos> I told you to shut up, Todd.
I don't know.<eos> It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.<eos> It's not like it matters where you get your love.<eos> As long as something loves you, right?
I'm not.<eos> Because this is exactly what she wants!<eos> I am cooling out.<eos> Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?
Why the hell do people move to the suburbs?<eos> It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.
It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.
What?<eos> I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.
She was on the street, strung out on drugs... comforting strangers.<eos> I never was on the street.<eos> Look, it doesn't...<eos> Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!
Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.
Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?
Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day.<eos> And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?<eos> Pippi, it is that commitment... that is exactly what you need to help you move forward.
I don't want to live in a fantasy world.<eos> Yeah, well... how's reality working out for you?<eos> You know, the wife is not a big dog person.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> How could anyone not love you?
You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.<eos> The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.
It's me.<eos> It's two and a half years.<eos> I never heard a word.<eos> I...<eos> I tried to get my lawyer to find you.
Yeah.<eos> She emailed me before she left.<eos> Yeah, like they don't have cocaine in Australia or something.<eos> Look, Claire, I'm gonna need some kind of apology or something.<eos> Some acknowledgement of the unconscionable way that you turned on me at the trial.
A baby?<eos> A baby.<eos> So that makes me a grandfather?<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I just came here... to shit on you for ratting me out to the Feds, and now this?
Oi!<eos> What are you lot doing?<eos> Don't start getting the wrong end of the stick, Jack.<eos> He's an upstanding citizen.<eos> I think I found something that belongs to you, Lack.
And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.<eos> Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.
Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.<eos> And that is?<eos> They're under the protection of the king.<eos> And once you're under the protection of the king, I can't help you.
I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.
And, I've seen your coffers.<eos> Your achievements now stand<eos> as your prosecution.<eos> What kind of a man would you have become, had you inherited your father's kingdom and all its advantages instead of being raised in a brothel?<eos> What gave you such drive?
So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.<eos> Bring him here.<eos> There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.
Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.<eos> You wanted a prophecy.<eos> This is your prophecy.<eos> Now tell us, king, what do you have to say?<eos> When your head rolls to me, the legend you've fast become will just as quickly...
You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.<eos> You seem to have found your way very quickly.
On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.<eos> Blue.<eos> Blue. Where you been, mate?
Is that you, Blue?<eos> Yes, boss!<eos> Did you find your father?<eos> He's found him!<eos> We need to get you out of here.
He's a day's ride from here.<eos> As soon as she's safe, he will come.<eos> He poses no threat to you without the sword.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.
Can you see my soul?<eos> Is it still there?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> How well do you know this guy?<eos> And how come he's letting you stay at his place?
He leaves us alone this way. Because he wants to be free.<eos> All his life, he's tried to get free.<eos> He doesn't know how.<eos> You aren't who you think you are.<eos> He doesn't love you.

It's kind of...<eos> I'm weird.<eos> - I'm just...<eos> - What's your fantasy?<eos> What turns you on?
- I'm just...<eos> - What's your fantasy?<eos> What turns you on?<eos> I think just being wanted turns me on.<eos> Tell me what scares you.
I'm really scared of spiders.<eos> Um, but most things don't scare me.<eos> I think I have a thick skin.<eos> I think I'm pretty strong.<eos> No, but what really scares you?
For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.<eos> - Bang.<eos> Bang, may the blessings of all those that you love and those who love you...
No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Did we meet before?<eos> - Did we?<eos> - I've seen you before.
Think I gotta go home.<eos> Dad's sick.<eos> Mom's gone crazy.<eos> Brother's up to no good.<eos> I won't stop loving you.
How come you didn't tell me about Dave?<eos> How come you didn't tell me he coming around more?<eos> You should have told me that. We men.<eos> Supposed to be man-to-man on that. You supposed to let me know what's going on.<eos> Why the hell you care?
It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?<eos> 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?
I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job. A good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.
You have a job. A good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.<eos> Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I... I save a little back every month.
Jesus.<eos> My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family... We have a lot of friends.<eos> So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.
You can't touch me.<eos> Yeah. But we're paying you a lot of money to protect us.<eos> And you're not doing your job.<eos> Just do your fuckin' job.<eos> Or I think you're gonna realize there's a lot of ways that my family can touch you.
And even then you left us nothing.<eos> Until now.<eos> We're out in the open here, Paul.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> Perhaps you'll remember this.
Perhaps you'll remember this.<eos> Know why I have never been caught?<eos> When providence signals to me I recognize it instantly.<eos> A woman alone in her car waiting for her boyfriend to get out work.<eos> I hate myself for not catching you before you got to Nancy Barrows.
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
Faris!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> God...<eos> Please hurry, there's something on board.<eos> Go again, you're breaking up.
More like machines.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> Come on, sport.<eos> I'd like to show you something.
I've found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.<eos> A perfect organism.<eos> You know I can't let you leave this place.<eos> No one will ever love you like I do.
No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I'm going to do to you.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> I can see why Walter thought so much of you.
She got the shit beat out of her in that storm, a lot of EM damage.<eos> She will be back online at eight bells.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks, Tee.<eos> Does this mean I have to call you Captain now?
This is it.<eos> You're in the middle of it.<eos> Is it because you're afraid because things are going so great between us?<eos> That's what this is!<eos> You're terrified, because you've never felt this way about somebody before.
Is it because you're afraid because things are going so great between us?<eos> That's what this is!<eos> You're terrified, because you've never felt this way about somebody before.<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> I'll tell you what it is.
No, pussy.<eos> I keep talking over you, but it's sounding like you're saying... Pussy.<eos> I heard it that time.<eos> You heard it?<eos> You always say music inspires you.
Hi, okay.<eos> Does he ever move?<eos> Sweetie, want to watch a movie?<eos> I don't care, mom.<eos> Oh, honey, i know you feel so sad.
You know what?<eos> You're wrong!<eos> Because I had you.<eos> And I had your brother.<eos> So don't you dare say i wasted my life.
And now, you're not.<eos> And I...<eos> I miss you.<eos> Mom, I'm right here.<eos> I'm the one who invited you on this trip.
Listen, Emily.<eos> Be sure you check all the rooms.<eos> She'll probably be held on the third floor.<eos> One of the rooms in the back.<eos> Do you have any loyalty to the people who hired you?
oh, honey!<eos> I made a shiv.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Oh, my god, mom.<eos> I'm so sorry i got you into all of this.
Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> I missed you.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
Can I have just whatever everyone is drinking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> What brings you down here?
Scarlett?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - You only lost your girl.<eos> Well, I tell you what.<eos> It seems only right I should help you find her.
- Who is this?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - What a thing to say.<eos> Here I am, trying to be neighborly.<eos> I may be the only one who understands you - in this godforsaken town. - I don't know who you are or...
Spare me the indignity of having my audience see me scurry up onto my own set.<eos> Son, I promise you, we will get back to our conversation momentarily.<eos> But first, the work of the lord, then the work of man, alright?<eos> Hit the button.<eos> And just as soon as that there sun shines down with its warmth and light on all things equally, so too will guilt enwrap you like a plague.
But then I found this rotten one in the can.<eos> Now, if, say I was dreaming...<eos> I know how that sounds, but let's just say I was dreaming.<eos> Do you really think that my mind would take the time to put a rotten pea in there? I mean, think about it.<eos> When you think about a pea, what do you think of?
Distracted.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm obsessed with this idea that I don't think I exist.<eos> I don't think you or any of this is real.<eos> How long have you felt this way?
Yeah.<eos> I saw you at the supermarket.<eos> You're my neighbor.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> Tell me you remember me.
No.<eos> You know, if you really were him...<eos> If you really were Wayne, I'd watch you drown 1,000 times.<eos> Every night I would beat you and cut you and drag you into another hole.<eos> And I'd watch you, and your eyes, your wild eyes, as earth spills in on you.
Your language is simple.<eos> What you truly wish to know... is what lies beyond the veil of death.<eos> To know what I have seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you will... when I kill you.
Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!<eos> Let me out of here, you Smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.<eos> Is that any way to talk to the man who brought you into this world?
You're coming with me.<eos> You can point him out.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's no way he's getting on a...<eos> I feel the need to remind you, my name is Clumsy.
I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.<eos> It's all about control.<eos> If you ever need a refresher...
Neat, isn't it?<eos> The House keeps my valuables out of phase, so they don't go wondering off.<eos> But, still, the timing of the Stone's appearance and its power indicates that it's somehow involved with these crimes.<eos> Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.
Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.<eos> Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?
John Constantine.<eos> You dare threaten the green.<eos> Dude, your social skills are horrendous.<eos> Please, we aren't here to harm any plants, but our need is urgent.<eos> Don't let your feelings for John stop you from doing what's right.
Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!<eos> How can you hope to defeat a god?<eos> Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.
You smell fantastic.<eos> Now go get me some food, because I'm starving to death.<eos> All right.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> Didn't think you'd be joining us today.
All right.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> Didn't think you'd be joining us today.<eos> I'm too old for grudges.<eos> That never stopped you.
Holy shit!<eos> - Easy!<eos> - 'Language,<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your father will be picking you up today.
Where am I going?<eos> The airport. He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.<eos> I've got you a charter flight. Wheels up in an hour.<eos> Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.<eos> And I must say, the beard does give you a certain...
You were supposed to miss a few answers on purpose.<eos> Why would you steal an exam paper?<eos> You don't need to cheat. You're a templar.<eos> You have a responsibility.<eos> I expect you to conduct yourself in a certain manner in this world.
There's nothing on this guy that involves the United States, for sure not domestically.<eos> We're the FBI, not the CIA or interpol.<eos> He compromised an active anti-terrorism operation, and we're what?<eos> We-we're gonna let him walk? He's not our problem.<eos> The bureau won't back you on this.
I tell you what.<eos> Because I like you, you've got 48 hours.<eos> Patricia, I knew you missed me.<eos> Desperately.<eos> Really just thought you might be interested in something I picked up at brunch.
On my way.<eos> Just need to Chuck a few things in a bag.<eos> Morning, ladies.<eos> -Hi and I took your advice and got rid of the beard.<eos> Whatever makes you happy.
As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.<eos> Have you got my money yet?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.
A helicopter attack in broad daylight.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna sleep with my shoes on.<eos> There's never a dull moment when Simon templar comes to la.<eos> How's all that gear working out for you?<eos> I can see why you're Simon's go-to for local transport and op-tech.
No, Burton, you're top gun.<eos> That's not... fuck.<eos> - Hey, sergeant, I'm good...<eos> - Just shut the fuck up, ocre.<eos> So you gotta ask yourself,
You know, we fucking had it, sergeant.<eos> The people were with us.<eos> The water was gonna flow.<eos> It wasn't ours to have, ocre.<eos> - You got nothing to feel guilty about. - No, but...
- This punch... Is good.<eos> - I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.<eos> - I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.<eos> - That is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to me.<eos> - I love you, man.
- Aye.<eos> - I felt it was more constructive...<eos> - Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?
Give it tight, though.<eos> Slap it. Slap it.<eos> Shit!<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> Don't fucking touch her! Don't you fucking touch her.
Not in the sauna.<eos> - Why not? - Doyle's a gangster.<eos> In the sauna, no man would dare to hurt a woman.<eos> Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay?
It was very peaceful at the end.<eos> She kept your room exactly how you left it.<eos> She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.
She kept your room exactly how you left it.<eos> She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> "You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.
Everyone says that.<eos> Gonna be sticking around for a while?<eos> No, I'm supposed to go back in a couple of days.<eos> Can you not stay a bit longer?<eos> It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know, spend some time together.
- It's not a mess, is it?<eos> - No. It's just masculine.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you.
I'm trying to help you, Simon.<eos> We're blowing all that cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.<eos> You could've got someone cheaper.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.<eos> Is there anything left of your £4,000 I gave you?
- I'm out.<eos> - "Out"?<eos> - Aye.<eos> Fucking shut up.<eos> Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked to see you, Frank. It's just...
Look, we're here as an act of memorial.<eos> Nostalgia.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> You're a tourist in your own youth.<eos> Just 'cause you had a near-death experience, and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.
"If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate,<eos> "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?
- What do you mean, you're not here?<eos> - Go! Veronika, you cannot be here.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.<eos> - You got to vamoose.
Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.<eos> Nobody deserves you.
Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.
Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I love you too, Papa.
Did you hear that, Mama?<eos> Is it her?<eos> Is she coming back?<eos> Could it be?<eos> I told you!
I have a fireplace at home if you want to warm up.<eos> Come on, Mack.<eos> I know a person who would love to see you.<eos> Do not.<eos> I told you.
I know you?<eos> Not very well.<eos> But we can sort this out.<eos> I've been waiting so long for this.<eos> To finally see you face to face.
It means "wind blow".<eos> Right.<eos> So... Which one of you is...<eos> I am.<eos> And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's all right.<eos> Remember that smell?<eos> Ma Griffe.<eos> The perfume of his mother.<eos> She loves you more than she could know.
Never think that choosing my child Did not have a high price for us.<eos> Love always leaves a mark.<eos> We were there together.<eos> I never left him.<eos> I never left you.
My what?<eos> His wrath.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.
MacKenzie, you're trying to find feeling in your world. Based on a very incomplete image.<eos> It's like looking through the heart of your pain.<eos> The real underlying flaw in your life Is that you do not think I'm good.<eos> I am!<eos> And if you knew me and knew how much I love you, So even when you did not understand, You would know that I am working in your life for good.
Do not think about pain.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Everything will be fine.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Believe me, none of this will hurt you.
Keep your eyes on me.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Good, Mack.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Now, let's get you off that boat.
I just want people to change because they know Papa.<eos> To feel what it is to be truly loved.<eos> I do not think I've ever felt this.<eos> Put your shoes on.<eos> I'll show you how.
I'm just asking you to do something that you believe God does.<eos> So, who will go to Hell?<eos> You can choose Kate.<eos> She said some very painful things.<eos> She pulled you away.
So, who will go to Hell?<eos> You can choose Kate.<eos> She said some very painful things.<eos> She pulled you away.<eos> You're not even sure if she still loves you.
You will take me.<eos> I go in their place.<eos> Leave my children alone and take me.<eos> MacKenzie, You have judged that your children are worthy of love,<eos> Even if it costs you everything.
And has.<eos> But the best way involves trust.<eos> I do not want to be the judge anymore.<eos> Missy.<eos> She can not hear you.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I did not know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.
I was there.<eos> Right.<eos> Dude, this is a lot to digest, right?<eos> I knew God.<eos> Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.
For everything.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay, we'll talk later, dear.<eos> You just need to rest now.<eos> I have so much to tell you about...
Thank you.<eos> You.<eos> I know things are not Very good between us lately.<eos> I was so lost in my sadness,<eos> I was not able to help you with yours.
And I'm starting to learn how to forget.<eos> I hope it's something we can learn together.<eos> It does not matter what is going on.<eos> You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.
I hope it's something we can learn together.<eos> It does not matter what is going on.<eos> You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.
It does not matter what is going on.<eos> You'll never have to do it alone.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.<eos> I love you very much, Kate.
You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate. Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you. I could never compete with that.<eos> I was always just your boring older sister, but... my relationship with Stuart was the one thing I had that you didn't.<eos> We were never in competition.<eos> Maybe you weren't.<eos> What do you think Stuart would say if he could see you now?
- Yeah, that's kinda how it works, hun.<eos> So, you're honestly telling me you're a genuine coprophile?<eos> The fuck is that?<eos> Someone who gets an erection when playing with their own poo.<eos> She hasn't told you, has she?
- When are you next due to see them?<eos> - I don't fucking know.<eos> Fucking Christmas.<eos> What about your fucking family?<eos> Didn't they know you...
You put it down!<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm gonna fucking kill you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.
That's your idea.<eos> Good.<eos> You want to put quarters in a romance card.<eos> Ray...<eos> I'm gonna have to let you go.
Maybe.<eos> You?<eos> I love trucks.<eos> Consider yourself lucky.<eos> Trucks never leave you.
Ladies, um, do you guys want to get a booth, maybe, um, talk about some poetry?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Sure!<eos> Bro, lose the bitter act.<eos> It ain't gonna get you laid.
No one's in an owl costume.<eos> You're missing out.<eos> Here's Tony.<eos> Give him his medicine and have him back on Saturday.<eos> I don't know why the judge just didn't make you keep him.
My God!<eos> Taft!<eos> Shit!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Who did this to you?
What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.<eos> I think very highly of you, too.
I do not know if you remember me.<eos> I left your mother's vagina before you. We grew up together.<eos> I am your brother.<eos> Hi. Where are you?<eos> We have not seen you in weeks, and we'd like to see you.
Arthur and I were going to open a private bar.<eos> We are still talking about it.<eos> - Follow.<eos> - We care about your career.<eos> That you can keep it economically.
This is going to have a happy ending.<eos> There will be no happy ending.<eos> You never have a happy ending.<eos> It's a loser attitude.<eos> Every story you've told me since I met you. It's about how you were here and you ended up here.
Do it.<eos> When they ask from whom...<eos> The bar is full.<eos> It will take you a minute.<eos> Are they going to demand that you serve them right away?
- Yes always.<eos> How good.<eos> Do you believe?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why did you go out tonight?
- Do not.<eos> - Do you like this place?<eos> - Is not my style.<eos> Mine neither.<eos> I just came to impress you.
I like to collect my salary?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's partly the girl you date.<eos> It shows that you like it.
It is different.<eos> - Great. Yes.<eos> Great to hear.<eos> Noticeable...<eos> It helped you recover.
Noticeable...<eos> It helped you recover.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - But it has happened before.<eos> Something raises the mood, but it does not work out as you would like. Suddenly you're... But this time it's different.
Shut up.<eos> For.<eos> Stop it, shit.<eos> Good.<eos> I just want to make sure you're on the right track.
I'll pay for it.<eos> Only it will take longer.<eos> - The same conditions.<eos> - At six weeks?<eos> Are you asking me to pay you what we agreed for six months?
- Fabulous.<eos> Take care.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - Bye. - Beware.<eos> - I'm glad to see you.
I have money to start.<eos> I do not know where the fuck I'm going to go.<eos> Hi, Eddie, it's Emma.<eos> My mom and I...<eos> I want to meet you.
What is your number?<eos> I do not know by heart.<eos> - Do not?<eos> - It's on my phone.<eos> Do not you remember her number?
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Equally.<eos> I was dying to meet you.<eos> Did you die?<eos> I'm dying to meet you.
- Who's that?<eos> - I didn't say it weren't secondhand.<eos> This morning, we're gonna go over your revision sheets and take a look at exam prep.<eos> If we don't hit the 60 percent pass rate, we're gonna be spending a lot more time together in queue at the job center.<eos> So, Tom, how did you get on with the exercises?
- What you writing?<eos> - A romance novel.<eos> - They're all romance novels.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> Would you like to hear some?
I should've done something.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Like what?<eos> - I shouldn't have run.<eos> No one's mad at you for not being a hero.
How was Lucy yesterday?<eos> Different.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So were you.<eos> Keep thinking if your mum was still with us, she'd be out there now, kicking doors down, trying to find the little bastards that did that to you.
Tom!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - It's Monday.<eos> You've just been shot in the head.<eos> I think they'll give you a bit of time off school.
Tom!<eos> - Huh? Did you hear what I said?<eos> Party tonight.<eos> Hadn't heard about it.<eos> - Yeah, he might not have invited you.
- We can't afford any more trouble.<eos> - Leave it to me, boss.<eos> Got ya.<eos> You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore. I don't have to tell you everything.
Cass, man.<eos> I've known him since forever.<eos> He was a dickhead, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what happened to you?
Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg.<eos> So they was thinking it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.<eos> But neither one of them can drive, one being fictional, the other one extinct.<eos> And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler... and, well... this is a '24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?
She found you yet?<eos> Gabriela?<eos> See... I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.<eos> Well, not really.<eos> I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.
How about you blow on them to make them safe?<eos> Fuck off, Logan.<eos> So you remember who I am now.<eos> I always know who you are.<eos> It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Adamantium.<eos> If you are planning to blow your brains out... could you wait till you're out on the high seas?<eos> - I just mopped these floors.<eos> - I don't need this shit.<eos> A year ago, you asked me to help you.
Hey! I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?
This is not the first time I've hurt people.<eos> Until today, I didn't know.<eos> You wouldn't tell me.<eos> So we just kept on running away from it.<eos> I think I finally understand you.
Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right?<eos> You wanna save a life, save your own.<eos> Forget we were here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You can't just take shit, you know.
Quit looking at me.<eos> You are dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?
You are dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?<eos> To not let you.
Run.<eos> They'll keep coming and coming.<eos> Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Don't be what they made you.
We made your favorite, pizza.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> Smells good.<eos> You're not getting up from this table until you eat that pizza. Do you understand me?
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Sorry.<eos> David.<eos> God, between you and Carla, you're gonna give me a heart attack.<eos> You know, I didn't even hear you come in.
Give me one more day to be your mom before you get to vote.<eos> You're just sentimental.<eos> We could see that new movie that Dad is in.<eos> Of all the things you wanna do for your birthday, that's it?<eos> - Where has he ever been for you?
It's something unholy they did to me.<eos> And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day that day I found out they wanted you for their own.
In, uh, cardboard boxes?<eos> No, these are from the store.<eos> Do you like strawberries?<eos> Um... They help you forget your problems.<eos> What makes you think I have problems?
Do you like strawberries?<eos> Um... They help you forget your problems.<eos> What makes you think I have problems?<eos> People who travel alone... Are usually in search of something, aren't they?<eos> What makes you think that I'm alone?
Hi.<eos> Can you open?<eos> That one's my favorite.<eos> She's holding her hands like that... To hide her deformed finger.<eos> I thought you wanted to leave.
Better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shall we take that off?<eos> I smell bad.<eos> What would be the worst thing I could ever do to you?
I can't believe you made it.<eos> Everything alright?<eos> Come in.<eos> You didn't tell me that it was a party.<eos> I didn't tell you that it was a party?
What are you talking about?<eos> The way you throw yourself at men.<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> I want you to go, okay!
Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I can't wait to fuck you up.
Can you just wait one second?<eos> 'Cause it's all gonna make sense.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Who raped you?
Trust me when I tell you it's over.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> God damn it. Fucking damn it!<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what? You have to relax.
Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.<eos> But again, man, he's not gonna come here because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.<eos> Again, these are his words, they're not mine.<eos> So just look for that nod and know that he's calling you the biggest bitch on the planet.
Respectfully, Suzie, fuck this, okay?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - No, Andy.<eos> - I'm going in!<eos> Why do you think they haven't called for you?
How about...<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - Honey, what...<eos> - Hey.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
Hi!<eos> - Andy!<eos> I was so afraid that you wouldn't make it.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What happened to you?
Up top!<eos> Down low.<eos> - Enough of that shit.<eos> - I'll fight you again.<eos> I've been waiting to fuck you up for a long time.
What are you droning about father?<eos> What is it?<eos> Fine<eos> Try this<eos> What if someone calls you father?
And no faith greater than business?<eos> It's true<eos> As long as it doesn't harm anyone<eos> Bhaijaan!<eos> What if someone calls you father?
I've worn it.<eos> There's makeup on it.<eos> It is.<eos> It looked terrible on me.<eos> But it's for all those UV rays in Southern California that'll be aging you prematurely.
8-1.<eos> Tessa, what is it?<eos> David, I've been thinking.<eos> How well do you really know Julia?<eos> Don't you think this is moving a little fast?
Oh, she can show me if she wants.<eos> You look tired.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.<eos> A good dermatologist is your best friend and it is time for you to pull yourself together and get a new David.
And this has happened before.<eos> Remember when we were up in Big Sur and you thought he was following us in that truck?<eos> - Or you thought you saw him at the window, but it was really just David.<eos> You're right.<eos> You still haven't told David what happened to you, huh?
It took a while.<eos> Then everything fell apart.<eos> Or I tore it apart.<eos> Either way.<eos> I assume David told you.
- Yes!<eos> It's intimidating.<eos> This glamorous life in the city.<eos> You're an editor and gorgeous and talented and effortlessly beautiful.<eos> That's very lovely of you to say, and I was terrified to meet you.
Frankly, it was a little exhausting.<eos> A different position every night.<eos> Public places.<eos> It's like we just could not get away from each other.<eos> But I'm sure I don't have to tell you how he is.
I called to find out and ask and...<eos> It must have been a mistake.<eos> Look...<eos> I get that you're going through a rough time, that, uh, it's an adjustment period or whatever.<eos> Maybe you even feel lost.
Okay, this is really difficult for everyone.<eos> But it doesn't have to actually be this hard.<eos> I'm not doing anything, Julia.<eos> I am simply living my life with my family.<eos> If you're having a hard time, I suggest you look in the mirror.
It's okay.<eos> Let go of me, Michael.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, if you...<eos> If you go now, I won't call the police, okay?
It's your house.<eos> You're a joke.<eos> You can't do anything right, can you, Julia?<eos> Even Michael.<eos> After everything he did to you, you just let him get away.
We're gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna make this up to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, Julia.<eos> I love you, too.
I think it's time she slept in her own bed.<eos> - How 'bout next week?<eos> - Deal.<eos> - You better hit the showers, Dr. Morgan.<eos> - I love you, too, Dr. Morgan.
- You really miss work, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, of course I do.<eos> But, hey, I get to go to Mommy and Me and sing about poo and pee and all about my ABC's.<eos> You're a very beautiful girl and I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I... I understand.<eos> You wanna know my secret?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm lousy at making baby's.<eos> What do you mean?
Is your family still there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My father left before I was born and my mom was addicted to drugs, so I was raised in foster care.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> So what drew you to these parts?
- Yeah.<eos> Three weeks to go, it's pretty amazing?<eos> - It's unbelievable. - Yeah.<eos> You know, Ang, I was wondering, seeing as we're so close when were you planning on taking your maternity leave?<eos> - What makes you think I am?
Listen, look, Angela, come on.<eos> Look...<eos> Katie spent the whole night putting this together.<eos> She wanted it to be perfect.<eos> She wanted you to feel special.
Last night.<eos> God, Brian, I'm so sorry.<eos> You're sorry.<eos> No, would you please stay?<eos> - Please... would you please hold me please?
You know what I mean?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're catching up pretty fast.<eos> You asked just two questions.<eos> And if you don't mind me saying, you are keeping in major shape.
You step away from this doors, your answer's no, got it?<eos> Are you in charge here or are you not?<eos> He said no, so step away.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me break it down for you, you're five mall cops armed with tasers and zip ties, you have no cell signal or outside line in case you haven't noticed...
One more thing.<eos> You have to promise to protect me.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> I thought you didn't wanna be treated like a child.
What?<eos> No way!<eos> I don't get cut out!<eos> - You promised!<eos> - I also promised to keep you safe.
Don't try to get out!<eos> No matter what you hear. Right?<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> What?<eos> I promised to protect you and that is exactly what I'm going to do.
Listen.<eos> I need some eyes on the food court.<eos> What do you say, buddy?<eos> No.<eos> Mason, if you don't move, they will get you.
But it's hard to know why people do things sometimes.<eos> He might have not been around much because he was afraid.<eos> Afraid?<eos> Afraid of what?<eos> Afraid of putting you in danger.
Hey, Jamie, you're listening?<eos> When I stand up...<eos> I want you to run like a bat out of hell, do you hear me?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Don't you worry about me, little girl.
All right?<eos> OK.<eos> Now, it'll have emergency channels.<eos> They'll be static at first... but if I do my job, they'll go clear.<eos> Now, when that happens, I need you to find a place to hide and start yelling.
You come with me, I'll take care of you...<eos> Get you somewhere where we're both safe...<eos> You can start over, make your own way, be your own boss...<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Maybe, I'll even teach you a thing or two.
Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> Who told you?
No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Well, it is, but it's not the point.<eos> I've been slow, far too slow.<eos> Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind...
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been?<eos> Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
Yes, of course.<eos> Mary, I may not be a very good man... ..but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, most of the time.<eos> All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.
Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!<eos> Me?<eos> You know I'll kill you too. You know I will, Ajay.
'They know everything.'<eos> You don't make it easy, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, being... being so perfect.<eos> Mary, I... I need to tell you...
You were my whole world.<eos> Being Mary Watson... ..was the only life worth living.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mary...<eos> Don't you dare!
Go in!<eos> Changing mags!<eos> I'm hit! I'm hit!<eos> Get in!<eos> Where you hit?
News crews have not yet been allowed into the site.<eos> She's ready for you.<eos> ...military forces illegally breached Iranian airspace and killed 45 innocent workers here, most of whom lived in the nearby town.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hope you don't mind meeting in here.
See?<eos> That's him, right there.<eos> The target location is preset on all four drones.<eos> Within a two-mile radius of the target, enter the launch code, GPS will lock. You then have five minutes.<eos> You know well, Gregor, no one else could have done this for you the way I did.
Who is watching?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Again, who is watching?<eos> I didn't say anyone!<eos> I would never betray you. Gregor, please!
It sounds very nice right about now.<eos> That it does.<eos> We couldn't have put this together without you.<eos> Thanks, John.<eos> Well, over the next few weeks, while you're recovering on your sofa, you might feel the need for dinner and something a little stronger than tea.
Well, over the next few weeks, while you're recovering on your sofa, you might feel the need for dinner and something a little stronger than tea.<eos> If I do, I think you should remember what a wise man told me about Napoleon.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Show up and see what happens.<eos> Where are they sending you next?
I'd like to have a long night with him.<eos> Ladies, lowlifes, and soon to be dead...<eos> Brother...<eos> Who you calling a lowlife?<eos> Who gave you that name, Muerte, anyway?
They only sent four guys.<eos> So I told Riley to come stay here with her team.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to watch them.<eos> Do you not remember how that went...
Just saying.<eos> No.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Is this line secure?<eos> I found something you'll definitely be interested in.
- Oh, we're ready.<eos> The question is...<eos> - are you?<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You can handle yourself in a fight.
We... we got him.<eos> We got... we... we got him!<eos> Gunnar?<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> I knew I would find you!
So, coincidentally, Riley will end up killing Callan.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Oh, you're a monster!<eos> Callan will stop you.<eos> That's it. You get mad, because I hear the madder you get... the more you power up the amulet. And we need power.
What is a ball washer?<eos> You always wanna stick something in something.<eos> That's why he always keep them gloves on.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Will you let him touch you with his stinky fingers?
I wouldn't do it if I were you.<eos> All right, have a seat with your girlfriend.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> That should do the trick, shouldn't it?<eos> Your little cross isn't gonna do you much good now, is it?
I was very sorry that you weren't able to make it to the funeral.<eos> It was a lovely service.<eos> I realize this must be a very emotional time for you.<eos> We haven't really spoken since he sent me to Juvie when I was 16.<eos> Well, it was the court that sent you to Juvie.
20 G's?<eos> Holy fuck, man, what were you doing?<eos> Fuck, I'm in some deep shit, man.<eos> Well, look, I might be coming into some money.<eos> Might be able to help you out.
Is there any other way into this situation besides... this?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Any other way into this situation?"<eos> How you holding up, Jacob?
This area's famous for its sinkholes.<eos> What, are you scared?<eos> Man, hell no, I ain't scared.<eos> Ah, bullshit.<eos> Yeah, bullshit, don't tell me that didn't scare the piss out of you just a little bit.
This one goes here, that one goes there, this goes from..<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here, let me help you.<eos> You're freak, you know that?<eos> I have had to watch you play with these for weeks.
Billy, can I be honest?<eos> The deal was I drop you somewhere I get the van for few hours okay?<eos> This is weird.<eos> Like we don't know each other at all. I don't know what we are doing here, and you seem... Wait.<eos> I gotta tell you something.
Yeah.<eos> Jason Scott, the star quarterback crashes and burns.<eos> Destroys his career and destroys our season. Go, Tigers!<eos> Now walking around town, and everyone's looking me like I ran over their dogs.<eos> So why don't you leave? You know.
Oh Really, Einstein?<eos> Restricted? As in... we shouldn't be standing on a crazy rock doing some Karate kid moves right.<eos> - Yeah I feel you.<eos> - Guys... Yeah or camping out on old trench.<eos> I see you too homeboy.
And you don't think we could've avoided that accident.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives just because you think something might happen.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives-- okay, it is not about that.<eos> What if something were to happen to you?
Nothing we haven't done before.<eos> "Dear Billy." "You ever looked into a hurricane and decide..."<eos> '...maybe I should fly straight through it?<eos> "Because that's what's about to happen."<eos> Dear Billy. You might wanna hang on.
My best guess is we're scattered over a four to five mile radius.<eos> We should head north and join anyone we find. Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you?
In case we ever see that primate again.<eos> You do know that story is about a mouse becoming friends with the lion after taking the thorn out of his paw though, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The mouse kills the lion with the thorn.<eos> Who told you that, Cole?
Amanda, I was just talking about you.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You find something for me?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> I was just talking to Jim about how difficult it's been to get you in anywhere.
I will call you right back.<eos> What?<eos> I got a job interview, but I need to borrow like 20 bucks for gas.<eos> Amanda, you are bleeding me dry.<eos> How much longer do I have to support you?
What?<eos> I got a job interview, but I need to borrow like 20 bucks for gas.<eos> Amanda, you are bleeding me dry.<eos> How much longer do I have to support you?<eos> Well, how am I supposed to pay you back if I don't get a job?
That's what he started out as.<eos> We met in college.<eos> He had a very fine practice in the city, and then his folks died and left us this property and he decided to retire and move us out here.<eos> What happened to your husband?<eos> If you don't mind me asking.
That is gonna go over like a shit balloon, and you know it.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't care.<eos> She's so busy fucking dudes and drinking, she doesn't even know I'm gone.<eos> Yeah, but when am I gonna see you?
Where the hell are you goin'?<eos> I got that job, so I'm leaving for a while.<eos> Wait, what's a while?<eos> You're not even gonna know I'm gone.<eos> Are you saying you're moving out?
That is enough, young lady.<eos> You can't be getting all worked up like that when you're pregnant.<eos> It's not healthy for the baby.<eos> Children really are a blessing, you know.<eos> I guess you don't remember our little party the first night, do you?
No, no.<eos> Take 'em.<eos> Please.<eos> Here.<eos> Just in case you get lonely.
Just in case you get lonely.<eos> Oh, I'm tired of this god damn mess.<eos> Here, you take this.<eos> As for you, young lady,<eos> I suggest you straighten up and start being a team player around here.
Thanks.<eos> Oh, don't you look just breathtaking.<eos> Do you think the lipstick is a little bit much?<eos> Oh well.<eos> I can't wait for Billy to see you.
Good boy, good boy.<eos> Well, don't you look nice.<eos> Are you nervous, Billy?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Well, don't you worry.
The church.<eos> Do you, Billy Colvin, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, 'til death do you part?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh god, I wish your dad were here to see you, Billy.
Hiccup and his dragon are amazing.<eos> Yeah, I... He's okay, I guess.<eos> I don't see it.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Yeah, but remember, I'm the guy who saved you on the field of battle, right?
-Just do it.<eos> Okay, bud, we need everything you got.<eos> Such courage. Bear witness.<eos> Bear witness, big brother.<eos> Don't you mess with my queen!
Need to kill someone. Faith.<eos> My dear, dear girl.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who you're gonna kill.<eos> In five minutes, you won't even remember why you were crying.
He's publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.<eos> Christ.<eos> Sherlock on Twitter.<eos> He really has lost it.<eos> Don't you dare make jokes. Don't you dare!
He needs you!<eos> Somebody else. Not me.<eos> Not now.<eos> Now, you just listen to me for once in your stupid life.<eos> I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken. But if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who'll you have then?
- How did you get him in the boot?<eos> - The boys from the cafe.<eos> They dropped me. Twice!<eos> And you know why they dropped you, dear?<eos> Because they know you.
How did you know?<eos> How? On Monday, I decided to get a new therapist.<eos> Tuesday afternoon, I chose her. Wednesday morning, I booked today's session.<eos> Now, today is Friday.<eos> So two weeks ago, two weeks, before you were abducted at gunpoint, and brought here against your will over a week before I even thought of coming here, you knew exactly where you need to be picked up for lunch?
And cut there. Thank you.<eos> You should bag that up. Sell it.<eos> Make money from that on eBay.<eos> You can make more, if you like. Anytime you like.<eos> Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain, that you've just been played?
What were you doing!<eos> - He's in distress, I'm helping him!<eos> - Restrain him now, do it.<eos> - I was trying to help him!<eos> - Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
Silly name, isn't it?<eos> Greek. Means the East Wind.<eos> My parents loved silly names. Like Eurus, or Mycroft, or Sherlock.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Didn't it ever occur to you not even once, that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister?
- Fingerprinting.<eos> Being searched. Thoroughly.<eos> Mycroft.<eos> Mycroft.<eos> Why don't you come out and show yourself?
I'm not one of the...<eos> I... I don't work here.<eos> My special hair band.<eos> I'm not one of your doctors.<eos> The one I made you steal from Mummy.
I taught you, don't you remember?<eos> How can you not remember that?<eos> Eurus, I don't remember you at all.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Mycroft told me you'd rewritten your memories. He didn't tell me you'd written me out completely.
- Not now.<eos> - Vatican cameos.<eos> - In a minute.<eos> Let's continue.<eos> Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?
- Be naughty, step closer.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.
Mycroft was quite clever.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you...<eos> You were my favourite.<eos> Why was I your favourite?<eos> Because I could make you laugh.
What's this?<eos> We're supposed to solve this, - based on what?<eos> - This, this is all we get.<eos> Please make use of your friend, Sherlock.<eos> I want to see you interact with people that you're close to.
And if we fail, she crashes into a city.<eos> How many will die then?<eos> How are we gonna get her to do that?<eos> I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.<eos> Is there really no one there that can help you? Have you really, really checked?
Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.<eos> They're not dog's bones.<eos> Remember Daddy's allergy?<eos> What was he allergic to?<eos> What would he never let you have all those times you begged?
They're not dog's bones.<eos> Remember Daddy's allergy?<eos> What was he allergic to?<eos> What would he never let you have all those times you begged?<eos> Well, he'd never let you have a dog.
What would he never let you have all those times you begged?<eos> Well, he'd never let you have a dog.<eos> Come on, Redbeard!<eos> Your funny little memory, Sherlock.<eos> You were upset, so you told yourself a better story.
I was trying to be kind.<eos> Kind?<eos> Kind?<eos> You've told us that our daughter was dead.<eos> Better that than tell you what she had become. I'm sorry.
Without doubt, she will kill again if she has the opportunity.<eos> There's no possibility she'll ever be able to leave.<eos> When can we see her?<eos> There's no point.<eos> How dare you say that!
Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> Wake up, little halflings!<eos> Morning, Wizzie!<eos> What great adventure lies in wait for you today?
Destroy.<eos> Destroy.<eos> Lam-Lam!<eos> I've got fresh batteries.<eos> Boom! Mom and Dad don't even know you.
I'm not used to being tickled.<eos> Once at a corporate retreat.<eos> But those things always get weird.<eos> What?<eos> You've never been tickled?
Now, eyes ahead.<eos> I said eyes ahead, son!<eos> Buttocks up!<eos> Now pedal like you mean it!<eos> Either you run the day, or the day runs you.
No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you!
It's not fair!<eos> That's not right.<eos> Now you're really going to pay!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> It's time you pick on someone your own size!
The corner office, the private potty.<eos> All that stuff.<eos> But, hey! How about you?<eos> You have your parents all to yourself.<eos> So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad after you leave?
Okie-dokie.<eos> Dear Boss Baby... I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.<eos> I would like to offer you a job.
I just don't know who he is.<eos> Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.
I don't know.<eos> It's so much worse.<eos> You son of a...<eos> Hey! - I've had it with you! - No!<eos> Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.
Back up! Someone followed you through the jump point.<eos> Set me free, you'll need my help.<eos> I'm not a fool, Nebula.<eos> You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.<eos> You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!<eos> I don't gotta listen to nothing!<eos> You betrayed the code!<eos> Ravagers don't deal in kids.<eos> I told you before!
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
If he ends up being evil... we will just kill him.<eos> You're leaving me with that fox?<eos> He's not a fox.<eos> Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.<eos> - Or if you feel like it.
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
I am so sorry!<eos> I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir... looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself...<eos> "You know what would be a really kick-ass name?<eos> "Taserface!"<eos> That's how I hear you in my head!
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?<eos> I am hideous?<eos> You are horrifying to look at. Yes.<eos> But that's a good thing.<eos> Oh? When you're ugly, and someone loves you... you know they love you for who you are.
He's goddang precious!<eos> Hey, twig!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aw, man... what did they do to you?
We need to talk.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.<eos> What?<eos> I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.<eos> I said shut up!<eos> I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.
Hey, there, jackass!<eos> What is that thing?<eos> Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!<eos> I told you something didn't feel right.<eos> "I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.
Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?<eos> That's what you told me, you old doofus.<eos> Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.<eos> Dive!<eos> Captain?<eos> Captain?<eos> Tell me why Ego wants you here?
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."<eos> What a day.<eos> All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.<eos> That activates it.<eos> Then you push this button... which will give you five minutes to get out of there.
We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you...<eos> I don't want to do this alone.<eos> You cannot deny... the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula...<eos> I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day. And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
I don't know where Ziggy went.<eos> Oh, he's with Chloe. He's fine. - Oh!<eos> Hi, Madeline!<eos> - Renata! Hi, hi!<eos> - So good to see you.
- Sorry.<eos> - Sorry, that's right.<eos> Because that's what big first-grade children do, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Okay. Baby, someone hurt you, sweet pea?
Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened?<eos> - No.<eos> - You're their teacher. - You know what?<eos> Um, uh, Amabella, sweetie, could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you?
Yeah, but a big smile.<eos> Can you guy... and just a little bit closer together, guys.<eos> Hey, Mom, you wanna play Angry Beaver?<eos> In a minute. I just need to get one more shot.<eos> I think the angry beaver is gonna get you, Mom. Yeah.
Okay.<eos> Well, speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna have a pretty big fight - about what you just said. - No, no, no.<eos> Ed... But not tonight. Not tonight.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and don't you for one minute think anything else.
Well done.<eos> Are you gonna visit your ex-husband?<eos> I hacked into the scientist records.<eos> Aren't you the clever computer stalker.<eos> Why'd you get divorced?
What's impossible is building our salvation there.<eos> But I made those things happen.<eos> So don't tell me what's impossible.<eos> Gardner?<eos> Gardner, how are you feeling?
Tulsa, I'm not lying to you.<eos> My mother was an astronaut.<eos> She made a mistake.<eos> I was born on Mars.<eos> Just because people lied to you before, it doesn't mean I'm lying now.
In the old days, the elders would give a gold pig to their daughters as a wedding gift.<eos> Mija, it's yours now.<eos> Take it.<eos> Why all of a sudden?<eos> Well, you're not getting married now... but... Okja is going far away... so you can keep this gold pig instead.
And tomorrow, she'll be on a plane to America.<eos> She's a celebrity now!<eos> Mija.<eos> To be honest... you're nearly a grown woman now.<eos> I don't like you playing with that pig all day.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.<eos> "What did you do in the war, Daddy?"<eos> "I manufactured the napalm that made everybody's skin fall off."<eos> And this is a man who called his child an idiot loser.<eos> Well, in fairness to your father, when he called you an idiot loser, you had just signed up for a two-year course in California called "Unleash Your Calling."
Can we phone her now?<eos> Let's take a picture first, then call her.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Of course.<eos> In the plane... If you get airsick... chew the end of this.
Hey, Nance.<eos> How's London?<eos> Is that rain?<eos> That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
- I have all this stuff and... - Hey, K...<eos> K.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front.<eos> You have betrayed the great minds and brave fighters that have preceded you.
It'll make you feel better.<eos> This is an unspeakable place.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> There are worse rooms out there.<eos> Lucy Mirando says I'm not supposed to harm you in here.
We are doing you a favor.<eos> Do you get it now?<eos> Yep, yep, yep.<eos> You want to go back home with Okja, right?<eos> Then do as you're told.
Yeah, but she really frightens people.<eos> She reminds them of Daddy.<eos> This is mine.<eos> This is my project.<eos> She just wants to support you on your special day.
But, by God, did he know about business.<eos> Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.<eos> The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.
- K...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Okja...<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> Look, I'm just saying that if I call you one time, I like for you to pick up the first time, you know what I mean?
Okay, bear, here it is.<eos> Rilke says coins symbolize the wonder and terror of fortune.<eos> "Do you land face up or face down in the dirt?<eos> What home will you be born into?<eos> With whom will you fall in love?
Hey, what's on the bed?<eos> "You look like a model from the '70s.<eos> The personal pilot of a James Bond villain.<eos> A 19-year-old koala bear person."<eos> "If any of them were true, i wouldn't have you.
Yeah.<eos> Is that crazy?<eos> - Okay, let's just take some deep breaths.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So if nothing happens, i should believe 'cause it means you got rid of the spirit?
I'm not being funny, Elliot.<eos> This is just what I'm getting.<eos> Okay, how did they die?<eos> What kind of accident was it?<eos> Your brother will do anything in his power to protect you now.
What the hell is that?<eos> What is it?<eos> What?<eos> Elliot, there's nothing here.<eos> So, you're not gonna be late, right?
Mrs. redmon.<eos> I said leave.<eos> Are you deaf or just defective?<eos> Mrs. redmon, did your husband write for the register a long time ago?<eos> You're too young to remember that.
Okay.<eos> Okay, shh.<eos> Whoa. What horrible things?<eos> What?<eos> Who makes you do this?
Oh, yeah?<eos> When was that, Cooper?<eos> When did we see each other last?<eos> Are you upset with me, Diane?<eos> What do you think?
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.<eos> Respect.<eos> She's a beautiful soul.<eos> And she's married.<eos> That never stopped you before.
Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?<eos> I brought us two lattes again.<eos> Well, since there's no one here to stop you, I guess you could come in for a little while.
- Who is it, honey?<eos> It's Dave, Dave Macklay.<eos> Dave, hey.<eos> What's going on, buddy?<eos> Bill, uh, I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.
What's going on, buddy?<eos> Bill, uh, I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.<eos> - What?<eos> - Please turn around.<eos> I've got to cuff you, and I've got to take you in.
Oh, I'm sorry about the delay.<eos> Uh, did they get you some coffee?<eos> I'm good with the water.<eos> Can you... can you, uh, uh... can you please tell me what's going on?<eos> We'll get to that, but I have a few questions that I have to ask you first.
My flashlight's broke.<eos> Woof.<eos> Now... I can only give you a short visit.<eos> Thank you, Dave.<eos> George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.
George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm in so much trouble.<eos> I have...<eos> I have to tell you something.
But I'm not going back there.<eos> I've got a plan for that one.<eos> But this prison thing with that fucker Ray...<eos> Darya, did Ray get that information from Hastings' secretary?<eos> Did he ever mention coordinates to you?
I don't know what that is.<eos> Geographical coordinates, numbers, letters.<eos> They could save your life.<eos> He said she told him something, but I don't know what.<eos> Anybody ever show this to you before?
I can only give you a short visit.<eos> Thank you, Dave.<eos> George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.

I'm oldschool, Denise.<eos> You know that.<eos> Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.<eos> I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon, and I never used a spoonful because you were and are a great agent.<eos> And when you became Denise, I told all of your colleagues, those clown comics, to fix their hearts or die.
There's room in this Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than one beautiful woman.<eos> Gordon.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> You know, normally, I can't think like this.<eos> I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job, and it's... it's a bitch, let me tell you, sometimes...
What messages were those, Coop?<eos> Messages so Phillip knows it's safe.<eos> Gordon?<eos> When are you going to get me out of here?<eos> Coop, these fine fellows here have sufficient cause to hold you for now.
When are you going to get me out of here?<eos> Coop, these fine fellows here have sufficient cause to hold you for now.<eos> Of course, I will be exonerated in courts of law.<eos> Very good, Coop.<eos> And rest assured that we are working to bring you back home for our talk.
Put on your damn shoes!<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> All right...<eos> You do have your keys, right?<eos> You mean Jade has to give you two rides?
No.<eos> It's not about the bunny.<eos> All right.<eos> Go inside, Dougie.<eos> Someone will help you in there.
Seriously?<eos> As happy as this news makes us, Albert, we can't put this on the radio.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I've been dying to see Mount Rushmore.<eos> It's good you want to hurry.
- Honey, I can give you this.<eos> - Okay. - But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.<eos> Shelly, this is the third time she's asked you for money in two weeks.
Have you eaten?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.<eos> Tomorrow lunchtime, I'm taking you to see Dr. Ben.<eos> He needs to take a good look at you.
Yeah, great.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Stupid magic motherfucker.<eos> Ha, yeah, "kid"?<eos> I'll show you fucking kid.
It just lurched and lurched.<eos> Sounds like he left the emergency brake on.<eos> Are you telling me my father doesn't know how to drive a car?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Don't you dare, don't you dare try to blame my father for that car not running right!
Sounds like he left the emergency brake on.<eos> Are you telling me my father doesn't know how to drive a car?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Don't you dare, don't you dare try to blame my father for that car not running right!<eos> We'll get it looked at again if it'll make you feel better.
Jerry?<eos> - Jerry, what's going on?<eos> - Someone stole my car.<eos> What?<eos> Didn't I tell you?
I'll see you tomorrow, Marge.<eos> Sorry I'm late, honey.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> I heard you drive up.<eos> Why were you late?
He squeezed my shoulders when he told me this.<eos> I tried to ask him what it was about, but he... he...<eos> He wouldn't say any more.<eos> He just said,<eos> "When they come to ask you about Agent Cooper, you give them this."
Phone call for Commissioner Gordon. Hello?<eos> Batman?<eos> Hi, Jimmy!<eos> It's the Jokes.<eos> Nobody calls you that.
No, I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Who else drives you to one-up them the way that I do?
Were you looking at the old family pictures again?<eos> At the what?<eos> The old family...<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> I see what you mean.
I can only look you in the eyes right now.<eos> - Sir, what are you doing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Why is Master Dick dressed like that?<eos> How dare you tell me how to parent my kid I just met?
It's raining dads!<eos> So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<eos> I sure am, Dad Two!<eos> But first, where's the seatbelt?<eos> The first lesson is, life doesn't give you seatbelts!
You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.<eos> I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.<eos> But you're not who I thought you were.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You can't be a hero if you only care about yourself.
I hate to say this, but you're right.<eos> The city needs you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Let me out.<eos> I'm only going to let you out on one condition.
And then keep them there until this whole attack on Gotham City blows over.<eos> Padre, please.<eos> Don't do this!<eos> Batman, you need us!<eos> How many times I gotta tell you?
Well, yeah.<eos> Are they really the ones you're protecting?<eos> Computer, Batman's in danger.<eos> Please, Computer, take us back!<eos> Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?
I mean, I think they just get a bigger insurance payment if they call it terrorism.<eos> The public defender said that you're not talking to him.<eos> But he's patient.<eos> And he has, like, a lot of other cases to keep him busy.<eos> Would you shut up?
- I've always wanted to try...<eos> - You know what?<eos> Enough, enough.<eos> I really hope that you are coming up with a good excuse as to why you went all Rambo on a Good Buy store.<eos> Baby, I gotta tell you something.
Enough, enough.<eos> I really hope that you are coming up with a good excuse as to why you went all Rambo on a Good Buy store.<eos> Baby, I gotta tell you something.<eos> That fact that you are taking such good care of this family while I am away, it makes me feel so... relaxed.<eos> - You know what? - Hey!
- Hey, no. Laney bug.<eos> - You won that Geography Bee, remember?<eos> - That was Deidra.<eos> Yes, it was Deidra, wasn't it?<eos> Hey, did I ever tell you that I was Teen Miss Idaho?
Remember when Chet used to let us ride the trains?<eos> Yeah. Stupid.<eos> I got finalist for the Teen Miss Idaho pageant.<eos> I'm gonna rob the train.<eos> - Well, why did I think you'd care?
The goods we want travel in containers on flat cars.<eos> But the container doors are locked with steel bolts.<eos> We'll need something strong enough to cut through them.<eos> The shippers might figure out a container's been opened. But with 138,000 miles of track in the US, they'll never know where the break-in happened.<eos> If you get caught, don't snitch.
- Yeah.<eos> I mean, train dude is bringing us in for questioning tomorrow.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Are you ready for that?<eos> Yeah, what are you gonna say when train dude starts questioning you?
Let's talk about what was...<eos> You got enough for your mom?<eos> More than enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know sometimes, and I'm not saying this to dig at you, but you act like you're too good for us.
Well, that's a big hunk of change.<eos> Where you headed, sweet pea?<eos> To the bond company to bail Mom out.<eos> I want you gone when I get back.<eos> I thought I was gonna help you hit that mint car. No.
Hey, buddy.<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that Deidra?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Didn't I tell you?
- No.<eos> No.<eos> Listen!<eos> I knew it was a dumb idea, but we did this together.<eos> We stick together, and you don't get to make all the rules.
Truman has a record, and I'm gonna provoke him.<eos> - I'm gonna record him with my phone.<eos> - You're gonna need more proof.<eos> I know.<eos> Laney, you need to stay out of this.
- Really?<eos> You think?<eos> that's because Danny Rand is dead.<eos> get out of here now.<eos> Ward... you need to calm down.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!<eos> we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.
I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?<eos> business as usual.<eos> I'll back you.
Let it go.<eos> And this is your home.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll be out in 72 hours.<eos> That what they tell you?
They drugged me.<eos> They... they... they brought me here against my will.<eos> You saw me being attacked the other night.<eos> You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?
Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> Do you remember that song I used to sing... that would annoy the shit out of you?
No.<eos> They've got me on all kinds of drugs.<eos> Why?<eos> To keep me safe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you.
of course not.<eos> why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Thought I was pretty clear.<eos> Very clear.<eos> Then why aren't you gone?
- Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> whatever.<eos> But you sleep in that corner.<eos> And you don't go anywhere near the students.
We're friends.<eos> Can't we start acting like it?<eos> So you came with a peace offering of... oranges and flowers?<eos> it's a Buddhist tradition.<eos> It's meant to remind you of our bond.
So you came with a peace offering of... oranges and flowers?<eos> it's a Buddhist tradition.<eos> It's meant to remind you of our bond.<eos> Kind of like the MM's.<eos> what happened to you?
Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.<eos> You can start all over.<eos> It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?
The new place with the glass floor?<eos> it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats. - Ah.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.
Sure.<eos> too.<eos> of course. and I don't like that.<eos> Is there anything you didn't tell me?<eos> Something you might have missed?
Fighters... huh?<eos> - For him?<eos> - Cut the bullshit.<eos> you tap out.<eos> I warned you last time about the biting.
We've got bourbon to finish.<eos> I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you? - What happened to you?
This is the Golden Sands you're looking for.<eos> the Yang Clan Company.<eos> - I need to have a word with them.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> Why do you wanna mess around with Triads?
Still cheaper than settling.<eos> Ward, they're threatening to release this video by the end of the day.<eos> So?<eos> Doesn't buy them anything.<eos> Just because you have a guilt complex going on...
Donkey?<eos> Donkey's actually pretty good.<eos> My grandmother could stir fry the shit out of donkey and veggies.<eos> I'll take your word for it.<eos> When you weren't sneaking out... were you just waiting around... what, meditating?
You want me to come with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm just a karate teacher, Danny.<eos> No, you're not. You're a fighter.<eos> I know you've been testing yourself - in an underground fight club. - What...
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I can't ask anything more from you.
I think someone new is waiting to get out.<eos> Are we going to fight or not?<eos> We don't have to fight.<eos> Why don't you... kiss me instead?<eos> If you took me for pleasure how would that make you feel?
Oh, it is.<eos> You want to be free of all that is boiling inside of you to get out.<eos> You lose control now and then, don't you?<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't you want to be free of the burden of keeping all that in its cage?
Come on.<eos> To the left.<eos> I asked Michelle to change schedules...<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm thinking maybe I'll let you handle this one.
Hey, don't play her game.<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.
Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?<eos> To remind me of my mistakes.<eos> Do you understand how stupid that was?<eos> What if someone had seen you in there?
Sometimes, it's... it's just easier to... pretend nothing's wrong than to say something.<eos> Maybe you should take a break.<eos> Just... for a few weeks.<eos> I can handle things here.<eos> There are places... discreet places... that could help you.
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.
You can't believe anything that she says to you.<eos> Look, that may be true.<eos> But if there's even the smallest chance that I can find out the truth, then I have to go.<eos> Otherwise, it's just gonna be this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.
It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.<eos> And the rest?<eos> Is glad I found you.
I believe someone has to try.<eos> Then ask me your questions.<eos> Heel, Toro, heel.<eos> Hey, what are you doing out here?<eos> The hell were you thinking?
Whatever it is.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.
You're the person I most admire.<eos> Come on.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't know anyone as brilliant or as fearless.<eos> You come up with these crazy ideas. And you stand your ground, even when the entire board tries to fight you on it.
Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.
- You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.<eos> But unless you see it with your own eyes, you may not believe me.<eos> What I'm about to show you is shocking, but it...
Come on.<eos> No.<eos> Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is... I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
If my father was involved with the Hand, I need to know.<eos> Why?<eos> It won't change the way you feel about him.<eos> You know she was responsible for your parents' death. Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> I knew I'd find you here.
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kyle?<eos> After your mother delivered you... the nurse wrapped you in a blanket... placed you in my arms.
Is there any vanilla?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I don't like all these fancy flavors.<eos> Vanilla's fine for me.<eos> I go to all the trouble of, uh, getting you all this ice cream, and all you can do is complain.
Danny, we're in trouble here.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You are about to fall into a trap you cannot escape.<eos> I don't understand what you're asking me to do.<eos> You weren't taught this.
You were just teenagers.<eos> But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.<eos> You were so thin... and fragile.<eos> You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.
Welcome.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.<eos> Thanks for showing me how to heal her. Of course.<eos> I see it took a lot out of you, though.
What do you mean?<eos> Colleen told me you were the Iron Fist, the Immortal Weapon.<eos> Uh... not many people know what that is.<eos> Well, it's always been a special interest of mine.<eos> But you weren't taught how to recharge your chi?
Why are you frowning?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.
Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.<eos> That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.<eos> This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.
But I think you'll understand it immediately.<eos> 1948, a group of Chinese soldiers got lost in the mountains during a mission being recorded for propaganda purposes.<eos> They were headed into a remote area, but... someone was there... protecting this passage.<eos> And as you can see, he had no interest in letting them pass.<eos> That's where you're headed, Danny.
Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.<eos> What it was capable of.<eos> What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.
I can, sort of, fit in wherever.<eos> - This is the first family I've ever had.<eos> - Food's good, too.<eos> Yeah, and I've been learning a ton.<eos> - I bet I could take you now.
And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny...<eos> So when did Bakuto approach you with this... this idea of recruiting me?
How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.
No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.<eos> We're going back.<eos> Look, I understand, but I can't just leave.<eos> You had no trouble leaving us.
I'm not sure I can explain.<eos> You owe me an answer.<eos> The people of K'un-Lun need to know why they were abandoned.<eos> And what about the people here?<eos> The ones who were just trying to kill you?
You have failed, Danny.<eos> Failed in every way.<eos> The Fist won't even ignite now.<eos> Our only chance may be to return and submit to Lei Kung.<eos> And let's hope he can restore you, because if not... I don't know what happens.
- He's troubled.<eos> He's confused as to why you would abandon your post and leave us unprotected.<eos> yeah... he's also very pissed.<eos> Davos?<eos> I saw you taken by those men outside that dojo.
In case we're being followed.<eos> I've... I've already checked.<eos> Twice.<eos> - Just do it again. - I'm...<eos> I'm not going to leave you.
He always does.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.
Wait.<eos> I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?
- To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means. It's the same thing he's doing to you.<eos> Are you gonna believe everything they taught you in K'un-Lun?
Yeah.<eos> I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.
I only want one thing... and that's to see the Hand destroyed.<eos> And then you go back to K'un-Lun?<eos> could you give us a minute?<eos> I'll be outside... keeping guard.<eos> I don't like what's happening to you.
Even if we have to murder people to do it?<eos> Joy.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> I just got you back.
And look what a mess you've made here.<eos> I've seen this world.<eos> I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.<eos> Come home.<eos> what is keeping you here?
- He's ignorant.<eos> Don't let him bait you.<eos> It's all he knows.<eos> All he's ever been taught.<eos> When did you become such a milkmaid, Danny?
- He's using you, Joy.<eos> He's not using me.<eos> I came up with the plan.<eos> - He needs me. Ward, he needs us.<eos> - You need to get away from him right now.
Once they leave the building, I'll get you to the hospital.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Hey, get your ass over here and help us.<eos> Those people upstairs are pit of vipers.<eos> You should thank me for getting you away from them.
You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.<eos> We're going to change the world.<eos> Well, the promises I've made you are still in place.
I'll help you become what you were meant to be.<eos> I don't even know what I'm meant be.<eos> How are you gonna help?<eos> I kind of got this feeling you're not allowed to kill me.<eos> That doesn't mean I won't do what it takes to subdue you.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.
- It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?
take it.<eos> J-Money.<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> Look who I found.<eos> I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.
This... this... this howling wind.<eos> And I could hear her... yelling out for me.<eos> But there was no way out.<eos> you're not the first friend of mine with special powers.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence. the darker you become.
I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence. the darker you become.<eos> I can win any fight!<eos> some shit you just can't punch.<eos> You know you weren't given this gift so that you could commit murder.<eos> And I know that you think but it's not.
you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?<eos> Who forced you to lie about that?
what are you doing here?<eos> You shouldn't be out of the hospital.<eos> I had to get out of there.<eos> Yeah. Look... I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home. No.
Yeah. Look... I'm no fan of hospitals myself.<eos> I'll get the car to run you home. No.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Ward said I could find you here.
I saw everything that you had on the Hand's drug operation.<eos> Remember?<eos> so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.
The plan was to go up if it's clear. guys with guns is the opposite of clear.<eos> let's call the police.<eos> We can't wait for the police.<eos> Harold is dangerous.<eos> Let's not pretend that you care about Ward when we know what this is really about for you.
We need this place.<eos> He was demanding I keep the room clean, that I hoover it, and take the bins out.<eos> We don't live here for free.<eos> We pay fucking rent!<eos> I've been asking you to do that stuff for two weeks!
Jill has told us this is the perfect commute for her work.<eos> No more household chores.<eos> And you'll have your own front-door key.<eos> For Jill.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?
You only date me to piss your brother off, when you treat me like I'm your fucking bitch!<eos> You are my fucking bitch.<eos> You haven't got the balls.<eos> You're a coward.<eos> Why don't you just go and fucking marry that old man, so the three of you can live happily ever after.
Wolves' turf!<eos> We are here to kick ass!<eos> Kick ass!<eos> Kid...<eos> Remember the kung fu I taught you when you were little?
Well, let's hope so.<eos> It's hard to adjust to a new town.<eos> Well, you're not on the mean streets of Cleveland anymore.<eos> And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.<eos> 'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm not supposed to be, but somehow I found a way.<eos> I had to make sure that you were still following through with our deal.<eos> Of course I'm following through with our deal!<eos> You do not get snippy with me!
Remember?<eos> My father spent his whole life trying to get it back, and he died in squalor, begging for assistance from anyone.<eos> I'm not goin' like that.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I hope so, 'cause I'd hate to recast you.
Will you try it again for me?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> How about just like something with a little more feeling, a little more bang.<eos> I'm on it!<eos> They're not gonna be able to hear you as they come in.
Beat it.<eos> If you do anything to hurt her, I swear I will-- if you don't want anything to happen to her, then you better stay out of my way.<eos> Get outta my way. Get outta my way, man.<eos> I'm tryin' to get to my car.<eos> Why are you in my way? Still in my way.
-Hey, what's going on?<eos> -We need to talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> About anything in particular?<eos> I need to tell you that--
Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.
Harlem's gone through changes.<eos> It was bound to happen.<eos> What's Mariah doing?<eos> The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.
It was bound to happen.<eos> What's Mariah doing?<eos> The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.<eos> Look, if you're talking about getting a job, I have every intention of doing just that.
- Hey.<eos> - Good look.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> But I'm glad to see you're settling in.
- From somebody fresh out of lockup?<eos> - That's behind me.<eos> Now that I've cleared up my past, I've got nothing to hide.<eos> Look, my team is on it.<eos> But Harlem could use your help... once you're done spending nights with the nurse - who tied the ribbon round the oak tree.
I think somebody's been using Harlem's youth for what can only be described as late-night duty.<eos> - Couriers?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Might even be related to Mariah.<eos> You think it's something else.
I told you, I don't know a damn thing.<eos> Whatever you're doing, you're gonna get yourself hurt.<eos> Think about your mom.<eos> What she's already been through.<eos> I think you should go.
Thought she'd be bigger.<eos> Says she was following a client.<eos> - I bet this scared the shit out of her.<eos> - Rumor is, she ain't scared of much.<eos> Well, she ain't met you.
You don't have to say it.<eos> Your knuckles speak volumes.<eos> That why you called? To see if I'd done anything stupid?<eos> Nobody's saying it's stupid.<eos> I know you're trying.
Earth shook, Foggy.<eos> The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.<eos> But I do think I can help you through it.
Cage, what part of this shit looks like it's up to me?<eos> Mariah and Shades...<eos> I need to know what they're up to.<eos> Far as I know, nothing.<eos> They ghosted right after you left.
It's all right.<eos> Stand down.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> We are your family.<eos> I have waited so long to meet you.
- Elektra.<eos> - The vessel you knew is gone.<eos> Only the Black Sky lives.<eos> Listen to me, kid. She's full of shit.<eos> - We gotta get you out...
- I left him behind, Claire.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're better off not in prison.<eos> I like you here.
How are you?<eos> - Hi, Mom.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.
I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're having a rough time in here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Misty says you'll be arraigned within 24 hours... but we can figure this out.<eos> Has anyone approached you about making a deal?
You have your sport, I have mine.<eos> Ten days, I tracked him.<eos> We sparred in the forest.<eos> He nearly killed me.<eos> They always nearly kill you.
There are things I don't know.<eos> Why are you here, Stick?<eos> Because this one, the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon and protector of the ancient city,<eos> is still a thundering dumbass.<eos> Shit like that... will get you killed.
This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I just want to get answers for my client.<eos> I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.
I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.
Last one?<eos> I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.<eos> You crossed paths with her, too?
I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.<eos> What have they done to you?
But I came for you.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You told me I wasn't good enough for the Hand.<eos> It was a strategy. To bring out your anger.<eos> To cause you to make a mistake.
And I look forward to doing it again.<eos> You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.<eos> Soon, Iron Fist. You'll learn your destiny is much more than what they told you in K'un-Lun.
- They're not stopping anytime soon.<eos> - Well, what do you know?<eos> - It's... It's complicated, but they're very dangerous.<eos> Any chance that four-star shit-show at the Chinese restaurant was your fault?<eos> What have you gotten yourself into, Luke?
It won't be long before your plan comes apart.<eos> Before this chair I'm in becomes a throne.<eos> - We're getting everyone safe.<eos> - Good.<eos> - He give you anything yet?
For a man who believes in God, you sure like denying<eos> - He has a plan for you.<eos> - Don't use my faith against me. And what about this city?<eos> The place you can't live without.<eos> The place that made you what you really are.
Well, it went south fast, and you may be in danger. Me?<eos> It doesn't matter. I can't just leave those people.<eos> They are safer far away from us.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast.
I'm glad to see you.<eos> Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?
- So cool.<eos> - I mean, it's... it's kind of cool.<eos> I'm gonna make this real simple.<eos> You're gonna answer our questions or shit's gonna get dark in here.<eos> What do they call you?
You know how they can operate.<eos> And now we know what they need.<eos> It's you, kid.<eos> Stick, you're falling for their trap.<eos> If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.
Me neither.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna try and keep me here against my will?<eos> I hear what you're saying, Danny, but...<eos> And no one loves this city more than I do, but you can't leave this room.
But even our bodies have always had limits.<eos> And when death doesn't come from outside forces... sometimes the organism tries to end itself.<eos> The thing I need is a substance that we first discovered at K'un-Lun.<eos> And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.
And for years, it served to bring us back from death.<eos> I used the last of it to bring you back to life.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I knew you would be our salvation.<eos> And then seeing you, I realized that after all this time, and even with the others at my side... I was tired of being alone.
Never is.<eos> Not really.<eos> - No matter how many punches you pull.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> That means when the shit hits the fan, you could do a lot more damage if you let yourself go.
This isn't power.<eos> Living underground.<eos> In hiding.<eos> You know nothing of power.<eos> You didn't exist until Alexandra gave you life.
I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know. And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.<eos> So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.
So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> 'Cause the people in this building need to always, and only, see you as a lawyer.
I want three units scouring a ten-block radius.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> And, Detective...<eos> I thought Luke was smarter than this. I thought...<eos> If you want a chance to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well you know these vigilantes.
That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you. About your struggle.<eos> But what was it for?<eos> You're still at this alone.<eos> Especially since you know that your precious elders chose to keep you in the dark.
Is this place what I think it is?<eos> These beasts, they've given both of us so much.<eos> Though even power great as yours pales in the face of eternal life.<eos> This is what you've been after the whole time?<eos> The very essence of what made you.
Together.<eos> Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.
Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.<eos> Before they turned you into their weapon.
We'll see.<eos> What are you having?<eos> My fourth.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just came to see how you're holding up.
You sound just like Martha.<eos> When are you gonna start calling my mom mom?<eos> Whenever she stops treating me like Satan incarnate.<eos> She does not, she treat you like... really?<eos> She told me I was poisoning you.
Psycho.<eos> Why did Emma marry that guy?<eos> He's such a jerk.<eos> Hey, why did you marry me?<eos> I mean, I'm sure your mother gave you an extensive list detailing the reasons why you shouldn't marry me and...
Hey, why did you marry me?<eos> I mean, I'm sure your mother gave you an extensive list detailing the reasons why you shouldn't marry me and...<eos> Anne, stop it.<eos> You gotta get these ideas of her not liking you out of your head.<eos> She knows I love you.
I mean, I'm sure your mother gave you an extensive list detailing the reasons why you shouldn't marry me and...<eos> Anne, stop it.<eos> You gotta get these ideas of her not liking you out of your head.<eos> She knows I love you.<eos> Because of that, she loves you.
I know, it's Neil.<eos> Where did you find that guy anyway?<eos> I hope you have a great trip.<eos> Well, I'll let you go and get packed and have a safe trip to Hawaii.<eos> I love you too.
Hey, um, forgive me?<eos> For what?<eos> Last night and this morning.<eos> Ghosts.<eos> Listen, if it makes you cook my favorite dinner. And makes you dress like that every night, then baby, you can keep seeing whatever it is that you think you're seeing.
Anne, can you tell me what happened?<eos> I, um... I saw a ghost and I followed her out into the woods and... I thought she was trying to kill me.<eos> Alright.<eos> From what you've told me about the stress of moving into a new house, the ridiculous story of a murder by your friend and possible marital problems.<eos> Look my dear, what your husband told you about ghosts not being real is true.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll make the call tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey honey, hi.<eos> This is Doug, he's the one that found you in the woods.
You don't have one percent milk.<eos> Harold has to have one percent milk.<eos> And there are evidently a few other things that you don't think that he needs.<eos> Martha, i... now, I'll be gone for an hour.<eos> Do you think you can keep from going completely bonkers for one hour?
No, I don't want to go asleep.<eos> The ghost...<eos> Ghost, really?<eos> Everyone knows ghosts aren't real.<eos> I told you before you married her that she was loony.
- Velcro shoes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Velcro... pants?<eos> Yes.<eos> What was the name of the receptionist who checked you in this morning?
- What's up?<eos> You remember Dan?<eos> I'm handing you off.<eos> - You're all grown-up.<eos> - Oh. I have the privilege and the honor to give you your brand new tablet, Mae.
Now, it's not just that you get a smile or a frown, though that is part of it.<eos> You get your smile...<eos> it's almost always a smile.<eos> Um, that is when you send the survey.<eos> The survey is a set of quick questions about, you know, your overall service, how you did, and they send that immediately back, and you get to see how you did right here.
You're about to have your world rocked.<eos> See, these are all of last week's messages.<eos> That's why there's so many.<eos> - Eight thousand? - Mm-hm.<eos> Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here.
I don't know, I just thought to myself, this girl, she doesn't have a cynical bone in her body.<eos> Reminds me of how I used to be.<eos> Listen, you can't tell anyone that you were here.<eos> Okay?<eos> That I brought you here.
I committed a crime.<eos> I borrowed a kayak without the owner's knowledge, paddled out to the middle of the bay,<eos> and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.<eos> Well, I'm not sure that's exactly a capital offense, but you did risk your own life.<eos> So, Mae, do you think you behave better or worse - when you are being watched?
And I have to pull another all-nighter.<eos> Stenton is on my ass all the time.<eos> I shouldn't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing.<eos> And then... there's all the new work on Completion.<eos> But I assume Bailey told you about that.
You know we love you, and we don't wanna...<eos> - We love you.<eos> We love you.<eos> - We have to have our privacy.<eos> And we're worried you don't realize what you've gotten yourself into.
I look out the window.<eos> I come out here, and I think I daydream.<eos> Hadn't done that in years.<eos> I'm glad you called.<eos> I didn't want to lose you, too.
There's got to be a way to...<eos> What?<eos> Stop people doing bad shit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you need some time away here, too?
I think I need to just be by myself for maybe, like, a year and try and figure this shit out, but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you because you were a great guy and I really had such a good time with you and maybe in a year, if you're willing,<eos> I would love to get maybe a coffee with you and...<eos> - No!<eos> - What?<eos> No, dude, I just told you that I wanted to be alone.
- All right. Hey.<eos> - Whoops. - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - No, that's okay.<eos> Jesus! I never wanted this night to go on this long.<eos> I just wanted to tell you my deal and then just go home.
Right.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no, no. I get it.<eos> Well, can I go with you?<eos> I think I'd feel a lot better if I could just get you to the road, to the Uber and stuff.
Wow, that's cool.<eos> You made our asses look good.<eos> That's 'cause I'm hot shit.<eos> Well, your hot shit came out of our lame asses.<eos> I just wanted to give you the good news.
Hey, Gus.<eos> If I borrowed, like, $100 from you, I could pay you back $110 later on.<eos> - If you were cool with that.<eos> - Oh. Yeah, maybe.<eos> Or, you know what, I'm trying to sell my Nintendo 64, if you're interested.
- Yeah, you knew.<eos> - All right. Bye, buddy.<eos> - See you soon, man.<eos> Oh, Gus.<eos> I forgot to tell you.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Time apart can really, uh, fuck up a relationship.<eos> I mean, that's what happened to my best friends, Katy and Russell.<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, did I not tell you?
The one at the Springwood?<eos> Gus?<eos> No!<eos> This has nothing to do with him.<eos> Yeah, that guy will... never make you happy.
There it goes!<eos> You called me a whore again.<eos> You are the same.<eos> This is all the same.<eos> Bertie, I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward situation with Dustin.
And I also really have to go to the bathroom, so maybe you can get the broccoli, - and I'll meet you... - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You seem jumpy.<eos> Ugh, when I gotta pee I'm... Um...<eos> Ask a lot of questions, make sure you don't get, uh, ripped off, okay?
I haggled him down to $1,000. I think that's fair, right?<eos> Yeah, you want to get out of here?<eos> I'm having a good time.<eos> You want to check out a few more booths - and then maybe head home? - Uh...<eos> Yeah, um, how about I get you a massage?
There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> _<eos> What brought you back, John?
No, no, um...<eos> This is really hard to say.<eos> Uh, and forgive me for the timing of this, but, in about 90 days, you're gonna lose everything here.<eos> What?<eos> You all have been in trouble for a very long time and jt did not have the heart to tell you.
He didn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> - You know what? Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.<eos> You don't have any kids, you could just start over where nobody knows you.
Shit, and say what?<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Not another word out of you, Irish!<eos> What you want me to say to him?<eos> Think of the first nice thing someone said to you when you went to prison. Say that.
Alrighty. Save those horses!<eos> Come on, George b.<eos> That's it.<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I want so much for you to feel better.
You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yeah, somebody trained you really well.
Yeah, somebody trained you really well.<eos> Now, don't you move or I'll be ass over teakettle, and we don't want that, do we?<eos> Come on now, aces.<eos> Look, I know you're scared, buddy.<eos> I promise, i ain't gonna hurt you.
I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
I can do that.<eos> You want a...<eos> What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean, we only do what you're comfortable with.
I've never been to a ball.<eos> I don't have a dress for that.<eos> Also, what am I gonna do with my hair?<eos> I know a salon.<eos> And you don't need to worry about a dress.
That dress, it should be illegal.<eos> Monique lhuillier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mia.<eos> Mia, you know i barely recognized you.
New blood!<eos> $24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you. And now it'll go to someone who needs it.<eos> I don't know whether to worship at your feet or spank you. $24, 000.
Hands.<eos> If it gets too much, you have to tell me to stop, understood?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hold still.<eos> I want you to come, Ana.
Whatever happens between me and Christian is none of your goddamn business.<eos> So you stay the fuck away from us.<eos> Hey, we should think about going soon.<eos> I wanna go now.<eos> What did Elena say to you?
Can I wash this off?<eos> Don't stray from the lines.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?
You don't think i can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything.<eos> And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.
Your boyfriend has a reputation for being a little ruthless. Is that what you like?<eos> If you have a problem with my work, then you should take it up with hr. Whoa.<eos> Why are you being so serious?<eos> What do you think I'm gonna do?<eos> Make you fuck me?
What do you think I'm gonna do?<eos> Make you fuck me?<eos> Jack.<eos> I just think...<eos> I just think if you're gonna fuck your way to prominence, then you should do it with someone who can at least make you smarter.
Right? Don't...<eos> Don't what?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Look, this is a serious, serious question.<eos> Do you wanna be kept or taken seriously? Hmm?
Hmm?<eos> Look, this is a serious, serious question.<eos> Do you wanna be kept or taken seriously? Hmm?<eos> I would like to leave, please, Jack.<eos> Plus... Loan make you come like nobody else has.
Kneel.<eos> Ana...<eos> Go to escala.<eos> Wait for me there.<eos> For once, just do as you're told.
Where is she now?<eos> Is she here? What?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> She's in the psych ward getting the help that she needs.<eos> Look, I know she scared you...
I get off on punishing women. Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.
The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday?<eos> When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you?
Oh, my god.<eos> I thought...<eos> It's all right. Ana, I'm here.<eos> I was so scared. I was so scared.<eos> I thought i lost you forever.
Yes. Yeah, I think we're gonna head home too, bro.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll walk you guys.<eos> Kinda hate to say this, but your guy's all right.<eos> I'm glad he's okay, and I'm glad you're happy.
It's your birthday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?
I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, well, coming right up.<eos> I see you heeded our little talk.<eos> What makes you think i would ever listen to you?
Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, well, coming right up.<eos> I see you heeded our little talk.<eos> What makes you think i would ever listen to you?<eos> You don't care about Christian.
Told you. We're not big enough.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Yeah, 46th time's the charm.<eos> Can't you just enjoy it for once?
This pretty green in the sand, I can spot it from miles away.<eos> Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch? Yes, sir.<eos> I'll leave you with your family.<eos> And sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you? It's dangerous over there.
I'll leave you with your family.<eos> And sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you? It's dangerous over there.<eos> What do you expect to find anyway?<eos> What are you gonna do if you come across a Dustie, huh?
-Even better.<eos> It chose you.<eos> Destiny brought us together.<eos> Ha ha! It's fate.<eos> No one is going to come rescue you, sweetie.
You gave her your number.<eos> Don't start.<eos> So what? Yes, I did.<eos> Your personal number!<eos> What have I told you?
This is a live situation. Prioritize this one.<eos> We absolutely cannot afford to wait.<eos> Preliminary results. whatever you can tell me.<eos> Soon as you can. Thank you.<eos> I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
I was hoping you'd still be awake. Don't be a twat about it.<eos> Trish called me and told me her attacker put something in her mouth to gag her.<eos> Yeah. I just got initial forensics.<eos> And?<eos> Cloth fibers found in her mouth swabs confirms what she told you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.<eos> Other kids answer questions.<eos> They don't get into trouble.<eos> You didn't get in trouble for answering questions.
So why would I screw up yours?<eos> Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things either.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only difference between the atheists on TV and Roberta... is that Roberta loves you.
Wanna come inside?<eos> Cat.<eos> Frank, I think this is stupid.<eos> Why don't we just call Evelyn and tell her I don't wanna do this?<eos> Because like I told you, Evelyn didn't order this.
Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I mean has anyone told you what this is about?
I mean has anyone told you what this is about?<eos> My grandmother wants me to live with her and I wanna stay with Frank.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I'm sure this can all be very scary stuff.<eos> Does any of it worry you?
Go home, Evelyn.<eos> Or Montana.<eos> Rustle some cattle.<eos> You know...<eos> I have no desire to hurt you.
No, hang on.<eos> That's not a good idea.<eos> Your visit here is the reason for the meltdown.<eos> What?<eos> She don't wanna see you.
You do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You're stronger than you believe.<eos> You have greater powers than you know.<eos> - But if you don't try harder...
So you will do nothing.<eos> As your queen I forbid it.<eos> Strange.<eos> Is it true you saved his life?<eos> Who told you that?
This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history... our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.<eos> I will.<eos> Be careful in the world of men, Diana.<eos> They do not deserve you.
So you cannot sleep with me unless<eos> - I marry you.. - I...<eos> I sleep with you if you want.<eos> - I'll sleep right there. - There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind... - No, it's up to you.
Where this come from?<eos> A field over there.<eos> It is full of them!<eos> Chief, I think you and me scope out the area... in case we need to beat the haste and retreat.<eos> - What do you say, Diana? - Huh?
Finally you see.<eos> Look at this world.<eos> Mankind did this, not me.<eos> They are ugly... filled with hatred... weak... Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing.
Is that gonna satisfy whatever fucked up, female instinct it is you're dealing with?<eos> Fine, be my guest.<eos> You'll be doing us both a favor.<eos> But I'll be double dipped in shit if I'm gonna let you get somebody killed just because you can't follow a fucking order!<eos> I swear to you, Agent Blair, I swear on my life, I'm gonna bury you.
Forget D.C., stay on the plane and come with me to Paris.<eos> Oh, you weren't kidding about cutting the small talk, were you?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's insane. That's why.<eos> Anymore insane than doing something that you know won't make you happy?
Here you go, sir.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, now we don't have very much time.<eos> Now, I realize the situation that I'm putting you in...
You need to stop this, or I'm gonna go find a flight attendant...<eos> Gretchen, listen to me.<eos> Now, I know these people.<eos> I understand how they operate, and right now we cannot trust a single person on board this plane, okay.<eos> Mm-hm, and what makes you worth so much trouble?
Where is it?<eos> If this is about the old espresso machine, I threw it out with the rest of your crap.<eos> Yeah, that's a bit more like I remember it.<eos> Tell me where.<eos> I hate to be the one to break it to you, Sadie, but this plane will never be in the air for long enough for you to find it.
Really?<eos> Get gold status, my ass.<eos> This doesn't have to be it for us, you know.<eos> Save the charm for your first class skanks.<eos> Mm, you do still care.
- Get your hands up!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Where are you going, to find Terry?<eos> Put the gun down, Luke.<eos> How much did he offer you, ten million?
Do you think you are?<eos> If I brought you some flowers, you'll be treated better?<eos> You could try harder to remember?<eos> Looks like I have not seen you, We have to get acquainted,<eos> Before I kill you,
We all like you,<eos> Ler,<eos> Khan,<eos> Arsus,<eos> Are not you curious who who did this to you?
This makes the ability lnovasi super you rise higher,<eos> So where's mine?<eos> Locking system connected with bike system,<eos> It detects the target based on aggression,<eos> When you begin to change, A cannon was activated automatically,
Are you serious?<eos> Look at that smile.<eos> I love it when you smile.<eos> You make me happy.<eos> Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
So, what are you saying?<eos> Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.<eos> Dom did go rogue.<eos> Letty.<eos> Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom?<eos> You're a genuine outlaw.<eos> I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.<eos> Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
But so did you.<eos> You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.<eos> I wonder what Letty thought about that.<eos> The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.<eos> I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.<eos> And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.<eos> So, let me give you some.<eos> You see these cameras in here?<eos> The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.<eos> It's not to save me.<eos> It's to kill your son.<eos> Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.<eos> We lost everything.<eos> What do you got, Princess?<eos> Finding Toretto.<eos> But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.<eos> Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.<eos> It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.<eos> When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile, our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.<eos> This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world, it's a biological lie.
I don't.<eos> Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?<eos> I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.<eos> You didn't even know you had a kid.<eos> You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
I'm sending you new coordinates.<eos> Head there immediately.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I want my son.<eos> I'll tell you when you're done.
Time to land, boys.<eos> You know I never left you, Letty. I know.<eos> And you know I never will.<eos> I know.<eos> I have so much to tell you.
No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional...<eos> strictly professional.<eos> Look, your brothers hired my boss to find you and that's where I come in.
I'll sell you the house back.<eos> - My parent's house?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You'll sell it back to me?<eos> At the same price they sold it to you for?
No, this has gotta stop, okay?<eos> It really does.<eos> It's over.<eos> I cannot see you anymore.<eos> I just had to see you.
- Well, can I...<eos> - No!<eos> Your security camera is pointing right down my street.<eos> - They hate me in this neighborhood.<eos> - Who hates you?
I felt really bad about crashing the car through your garage door.<eos> Brought you this delicious basket of muf...<eos> You got some grande fucking cojones showing your face around here again, bro.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - Time to fuck you up again, yo.
Yeah, of course, he's like the Banksy of Venice.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I would love to see what he looks like.<eos> - You and me both.<eos> - Do you want some company?
Well, I've been told I'm a bit of a young Roger Daltrey if he spent a lot of time with computers.<eos> Oh, John.<eos> - Ooh, it's my little noodle.<eos> - Hey. Mm-mm. Ladies.<eos> I like watching you walk away.
There you go.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Aw, come here, pal... take a little rest.<eos> What do you think you're doing in my girl Lupe's room?<eos> Dog walker... they didn't tell you?
- I feel really special.<eos> - Yeah, I knew you would.<eos> You know what I think is next?<eos> A ride home?<eos> We gonna have to give you a shave, baby.
What's that?<eos> What's that?<eos> Hold still, jerkoff.<eos> You painted the top of my head blue.<eos> You remember?
Spyder sent us.<eos> Spyder?<eos> But Oscar sent some girl over yesterday.<eos> Hang on.<eos> He said they'd see you, but they hope you know what you're doing.
Just... please.<eos> - Sorry. Sorry.<eos> - Okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Listen, we are here to apologize to you, Steve for kicking the shit out of you.
And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.<eos> And if you are ever short of two shillings, please do not hesitate to ask, as Africa also served me incredibly well.
I'll know in 20 minutes.<eos> Come back when the church bell chimes.<eos> You did this.<eos> You will pay for this.No.<eos> No, because I have no fear to feed you with.
Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> 'Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written 'under the supervision of my husband, 'to whom I am happily married.<eos> 'It is more than ten years since you went away, 'and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, 'for both of our sakes.
How tall was it?<eos> Atticus, give me my horse back.<eos> 100 foot high, some of them, I've heard.<eos> Atticus, you stole my horse and you left your name... so what do you want?<eos> As you may recall,
She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.<eos> Hmm.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?
Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.<eos> I would, yes.<eos> Is it my loudness that troubles you?
The hand was raised.<eos> They talked about gunpowder.<eos> Pettifer said if Delaney Trading Company wanted to trade with the Indians at Nootka, the only merchandise you could possibly use would be gunpowder.<eos> Wilton pointed out that in times of war, the production of gunpowder is controlled by the Crown.<eos> You will not be granted a licence to purchase.
James.<eos> For God's sake.<eos> The Art Of War.<eos> Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.
Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.
He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.<eos> There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process. And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
- Why burden him?<eos> Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.<eos> James...<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
Something for your book.<eos> The lioness will fiercely protect her cubs, regardless of the consequences.<eos> Even if that means her certain death.<eos> Helga.<eos> Is that who you mean?
- Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you just going to sit? !<eos> Well, what's the use in hiding?<eos> I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!
Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.<eos> Safe?<eos> Safe?<eos> When my ship is ready, I will send for you.
The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha...<eos> I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.
How much money do you make, anyways?<eos> You barely make minimum wage!<eos> We can't even afford this shit hole.<eos> I don't tell you to clean this fucking place up!<eos> - Don't you fucking move.
- Ah!<eos> Don't you fucking...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Don't you give me that fucking innocent look.
No!<eos> Just want a couple of dollars.<eos> No.<eos> Go ask your grandfather.<eos> He won't give you any more, will he?
N-no, no.<eos> He's not... Like that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> From now on, if he ever touches you Or breaks the law in any way, I'm gonna bring him down.
Ah, the dream again.<eos> In the dream...<eos> In the dream, Your candle cut was completely healed.<eos> What?<eos> The cut candle gave you.
Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh.<eos> This is the man I told you about.
It's a new moon tonight.<eos> It'll be dark out there.<eos> Stay here and get a good sleep, and we'll both go looking tomorrow.<eos> What kind of shit are you?<eos> If you were missing, would you want people finishing their fucking homework before they went looking for you?
I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you.<eos> Who cares?<eos> What?<eos> I got to thank you every hour on the hour, get on my knees and adore you?
You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, then sign the papers I gave you.
Starting position's more comfortable.<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Come on, boss!<eos> Get him!<eos> Don't you fucking move, Ray!
Did he ever mention Major Briggs?<eos> No.<eos> Easy, Ray.<eos> You know I don't have a gun.<eos> I got to show you something.
Easy, Ray.<eos> You know I don't have a gun.<eos> I got to show you something.<eos> Oh.<eos> Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.
I got to show you something.<eos> Oh.<eos> Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> It was given to me... right before I walked out of my cell and saw you.
Now... you know what I want, Ray.<eos> You want the coordinates I got from Hastings?<eos> Rather, his pretty secretary, Betty?<eos> Do you really think I'm gonna give them to you?<eos> You really think you could even trust the numbers I give you?
Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> F-fuck.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I need to ask you a question.
F-fuck.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I need to ask you a question.<eos> You know you're not supposed to come here.<eos> I have to ask you a question.
So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis between this location and the others.<eos> I-I can't really decipher that.<eos> Could you just tell me what it means?<eos> In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.<eos> Well, look, Walter, I wanted to say this to you before. It's...
Wow.<eos> Thank you, Freddie. That's a great story.<eos> The pleasure's all mine, sir.<eos> Why you?<eos> I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?
I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.<eos> Okay, fine...<eos> That's fair.<eos> My apologies.<eos> - Have you settled in, Glen? - No, Pat, I haven't.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.<eos> - I thought I was being fair.<eos> - It's not a question of fair, Glen.<eos> It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?<eos> Why am I seeing you on the television?
But... I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?
- Peter!<eos> Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.<eos> Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
I need your help.<eos> They want money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They took me...<eos> Who took you?
What's going on, Ryan?<eos> Ryan?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, is anybody out there?<eos> Do you remember who took you?
I just...<eos> Woke up...<eos> And I was...<eos> Here.<eos> Tell me everything that you can remember.
Just tell me what you want.<eos> All in good time...<eos> For now I need you to get the phone.<eos> What now?<eos> I want you to focus on the task at hand.
John I've been fucking kidnapped!<eos> By who?<eos> They have me locked in a furnace...<eos> They say they're going to cook me.<eos> I need you to calm down and tell me who is doing this to you.
Now who were you talking to?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody?<eos> You could simply say you were talking to your brother, the cop.<eos> Do you really think he can help you out of this?
I love you.<eos> Mom, it's me, it's Ryan.<eos> I know who it is...<eos> What kind of mother would I be if I couldn't recognize my own son's voice?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you like this but...
I'm sorry to hear that but that's actually part of the reason why I'm calling.<eos> Always the same with you, isn't it?<eos> Only call when you want something.<eos> Want something!<eos> Are you forgetting who sends a check every month for Dad's care?
Always the same with you, isn't it?<eos> Only call when you want something.<eos> Want something!<eos> Are you forgetting who sends a check every month for Dad's care?<eos> I don't see John rushing home every month to give you a check, huh?
Hello?<eos> Shit!<eos> Hello.<eos> Mom, it's me.<eos> I'm sorry for cursing at you.
I just need enough.<eos> John?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You said you could find me.<eos> Nothing's wrong, and I need you to remain calm.
I have them.<eos> Are you there bro?<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can.<eos> I need you to try and remember.<eos> Try and remember who took you.
I Didn't think I was gonna hear from you until next month buddy.<eos> You got good news for me?<eos> I got better than good news for you Bob.<eos> Let me get my DSL's ready for you because I am about to make you a shit ton of money, but you gotta understand something Bob.<eos> You can not go blabbing your mouth to your fucking poker buddies.
Come on.<eos> What does that say?<eos> That's not...<eos> Hey!<eos> Ryan, how're you holding up?
I'm starting to pity you.<eos> Well don't...<eos> I'm doing great.<eos> You don't look great, far from it in fact.<eos> Well I guess I have you to thank for that.
I'm no saint.<eos> No you're not Mister Hinds.<eos> Who is last on the list?<eos> My brother, John.<eos> These are all the names of people you care for, correct?
Do you want to tell her or shall I?<eos> Ryan, who's there?<eos> What does he want?<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> I need you to calm down...
No, you were too far away.<eos> Why?<eos> You're my brother, how could you do this?<eos> Do what?<eos> How could I take something that didn't belong to you in the first place?
Why?<eos> You're my brother, how could you do this?<eos> Do what?<eos> How could I take something that didn't belong to you in the first place?<eos> I never hurt you.
I don't know.<eos> You don't know because you never did...<eos> Not once.<eos> Last summer...<eos> I asked you to meet me at Margie's Diner.
I don't know...<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> You just turned me down flat...<eos> You said times were hard for you and Anna...<eos> But you didn't bother to ask what times were like for me.
We just wanted to see you pay.<eos> Wanted me to pay?<eos> We needed you to confess...<eos> We had to hear you admit betraying us.<eos> We needed to teach you a lesson that would change your life...
Hey, Bart Simpson is nobody's patsy.<eos> Hey, Bart, Fat Tony says to win by less than six points.<eos> Here's a list of acceptable point differentials.<eos> It could be five, four, three...<eos> You realize you're having this conversation in front of a reporter.
There's the money.<eos> May I have a key?<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you,<eos> Mr. David Davidson.<eos> I can't stand not seeing you.
And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?<eos> Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?
I can't go anywhere!<eos> I'm going nuts here!<eos> I literally gave up my life to protect you.<eos> Okay?<eos> To give you a life without trouble.
The truth is, Em...<eos> Caleb came up with a bunch of money to help pay for your transplant.<eos> He did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.
He did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.<eos> Dylan.<eos> He didn't want me to tell you, and I...
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and it... it was really dangerous, but he... but he did it to help me, because he knew how much I loved you.<eos> Dylan.<eos> He didn't want me to tell you, and I...<eos> I never wanted to tell you.
I... I would really like to. I'm just not sure that I could get away.<eos> Well, think about it...<eos> If you can come to the meeting.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> God. I hope I didn't wake you up.
You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you...<eos> What scares you, what you want, what you Google.
Another new car!<eos> - How do you do, Mr. Maxwell?<eos> Once you lower your expectations, Timmy, the sky is the limit.<eos> That's the most beautiful thing I've heard in my entire life.<eos> Four! You don't mind if Max and I play a few holes, do you?
Sara?<eos> Sara?<eos> Is this for real?<eos> You show up today, as if it were nothing?<eos> After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother, When that avocado tree fell on her.
Is this for real?<eos> You show up today, as if it were nothing?<eos> After you didn't even bother coming to see our dying mother, When that avocado tree fell on her.<eos> You didn't come to see my child when he was born.<eos> What made you think I'd have any desire to see you?
Those are other people's apartments.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> But, hey, why don't you go knock on their doors.<eos> Maybe they'll take you in.
Emergency, Sara!<eos> - Emergency, Sara! - What?<eos> I'm trying to sleep and the kid won't stop talking!<eos> - You were talking too!<eos> - To tell you to stop talking!
Go to sleep.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You see? You're not rusty, all you need to is relax and have fun, that's all!<eos> You honestly don't mind taking him to the party?
- Really? I haven't been thinking about it.<eos> Mommy's taking me to get a hair cut.<eos> Tell him not too short.<eos> You don't have the ears for it.<eos> Why don't you stop talking.
- Of course, I am.<eos> But I'm 42.<eos> - So what?<eos> - You're my older brother!<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
Millicent found out about Celeste's party, she kicked me out.<eos> You got a sister you can stay with?<eos> No.<eos> I never should have gone behind your back like that.<eos> Wish there was something I could do to make it up to you.
Where did you hear that?<eos> Uncle Maximo.<eos> Hi, Arden.<eos> Hugo.<eos> I'm so glad to see you.
He won.<eos> Well speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna - have a pretty big fight. - No.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> Someone hurt Amabella.<eos> Could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you.
You know, I got Abby to sign up for one of my piloxing classes.<eos> That's... fantastic.<eos> I'm gonna call again about that petition thing.<eos> - I mean, it's ridiculous.<eos> - You don't need to worry about that.
She wrote you a prescription without calling me? Not her.<eos> I went to Planned Parenthood.<eos> Please don't make a big deal about this.<eos> I'm not sexually active, okay?<eos> Who took you there?
Thrilled about the communal potato peeling thing.<eos> But when it comes to my daughter's social recreational life, particularly as it concerns medications that will permanently affect her reproductive organs, will you just kick that little can of worms over to me?<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - I do.<eos> And should Skye come to me 10 years down the road and ask for a little lift to Planned Parenthood, I would give you that courtesy call first.
I just get... You know how I get.<eos> Please. This is important to me.<eos> I'll talk to the mayor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're not gonna regret it.
You know, I see these housewives in their identical homes with their identical lives, and...<eos> They disgust me, but sometimes I...<eos> I wish I could be like that, wish I could live like that.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
And what about you, young man?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm here because I don't like racists, and because I'm a nonconformist like my mom.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?<eos> I was trying to teach your grandson a lesson.<eos> "Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> What about the neighbors?<eos> What do you care what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?
Mom.<eos> Remember that protest at White Tower?<eos> You couldn't have been more than ten.<eos> And that day you said to me,<eos> "If something makes you really mad, you've gotta go out there and do something about it."
I'm about to go on.<eos> Susan filed for divorce.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I knew it was gonna happen.<eos> I told you so, didn't I?
- Oh, come on.<eos> You were over that fusspot a long time ago.<eos> At least she didn't cheat on you like Richard did with me.<eos> What about Robin?<eos> No, don't you worry about Red.
This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.<eos> You were the boss.<eos> I had to.<eos> Does that mean I'm supposed to let you win now?
Son of a bitch.<eos> Hello, football fans...<eos> We got beer, vodka, cigs.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.
Look where it got me.<eos> I'm, uh... heading to Florida next week for my daughter's fifth birthday.<eos> I'm using my take to set up her college fund.<eos> Yeah. She's awful sweet.<eos> And lucky to have you for a father.
Well, you've called me worse.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, you know that.<eos> What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?
If they try to cut it out, it will spread.<eos> Tell me what you need.<eos> I can't go in the operating room.<eos> I won't come out alive.<eos> Then we gotta get you out of here.
You should've died with them.<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Do you have the list?<eos> It's in my head.<eos> What if you forget something?
You think I helped them because they brought back my dead son.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Theo!<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.<eos> We're the ones that brought you back.
So when the Wild Hunt moves on from Beacon Hills...<eos> I'll be like Lenore.<eos> Left behind.<eos> Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.
I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.<eos> Hey, Malia.<eos> You aren't still upset about the whole shooting thing, are you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.
I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.<eos> If you can't help, we can find it ourselves.<eos> Scott, I admit that you have a flair for beating the odds.<eos> But, this?<eos> You don't walk away from.
There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.
I was myself again.<eos> I knew you were gone.<eos> Liam, you and Lydia get to the bunker.<eos> The whip.<eos> It didn't take you.
Where's my sister?<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I can help. I know about the Wild Hunt from the dread doctors.<eos> Where's Stiles?<eos> To not tear you in half right now.
It's just, it's a theory based on a...<eos> On a Ghost town.<eos> You don't see anything?<eos> I see a deeply disturbed young woman.<eos> You're afraid to remember him because you're afraid of what it means.
On a Ghost town.<eos> You don't see anything?<eos> I see a deeply disturbed young woman.<eos> You're afraid to remember him because you're afraid of what it means.<eos> Why do you care so much if I remember him?
And you want a lot more of us considering how many of them there are.<eos> I hate to say he's right but...<eos> He's kind of right.<eos> If I let you out and I see any behavior that I find remotely suspicious,<eos> I'll put so many bullets in your head, God won't even recognize you.
What?<eos> Tell you what?<eos> What are you talking about...<eos> Tell me about my son.<eos> Tell me one thing about Stiles that you remember.
- Which one?<eos> Any of them.<eos> Come on!<eos> There's a lot of keys here!<eos> I really feel like you're not even trying right now, Liam.
Whoa!<eos> Yes! Go, go, go!<eos> Okay, it's doing something.<eos> You ready?<eos> Remember, this will get cold enough to kill you.
Scott, don't fall asleep.<eos> You have to keep your eyes open.<eos> Trying...<eos> It's not sleep. I think you're losing consciousness.<eos> And if you do that, I think we're gonna lose you.
You want to bring them all here?<eos> Every single one of them?<eos> That's exactly what I want to do.<eos> 'Cause if the Ghost Riders are here, that means they're not trying to get to Scott.<eos> So you don't care if they get to you?
Just hanging out with my dead sister?<eos> Having a good time catching up on childhood memories?<eos> I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.
Can you see the books?<eos> I see them.<eos> Concentrate on them.<eos> The books on the shelves are your memories.<eos> Everything that's ever happened to you.
"When you turn the TV on, it's going to play memories from your life.<eos> "The remote gives you total control.<eos> You can play any memory you want.<eos> "All you have to do, is hit the button."<eos> Honey, there's a Stiles here to see you.
You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't, I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.<eos> Just remember, remember I love you.
They're all gone.<eos> - Look, you have to come with me.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.
Okay, how the hell do you "merge worlds?"<eos> Okay, nowhere in the manual does it say that werewolves can do that.<eos> And Scott and I pretty much wrote the manual.<eos> We can't even move between them, all right?<eos> Look what it took to break you out.
Zuruckkommen.<eos> Come back and kill them.<eos> Tote sie.<eos> Yeah, call your army back.<eos> Or don't they listen to you?
- I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?<eos> Karen.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She wouldn't have written you if she didn't want you to know her.
Do you know who I am?<eos> Witch!<eos> S-S-Stern.<eos> Merciful and Stern.<eos> Steel won't help you, swordsman.
What about... baseball?<eos> I might have.<eos> Who's to say?<eos> Do you remember anything from here?<eos> Anything you recognize or makes you feel something?
You need rest.<eos> I'm off to get a chicken for dinner.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> I'll be back soon, Tip.<eos> Don't you worry.
But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?<eos> I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?

Now it mourns for her.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> Murdered.<eos> Tip?<eos> Have you made your mind up?
You can't just control a tornado.<eos> It's not a dog.<eos> And you're not the Witch of the East.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> W-what if it kills you?
Because that was my past.<eos> Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.
Because I took my past and I obliterated it.<eos> People called me the Wizard of Oz because I demanded it.<eos> Crushed anyone who denied me the name.<eos> Your past does not define you.<eos> Your mother does not define you.
K. Chapman. Karen Chapman.<eos> Yes, but K could be for anything.<eos> It could be for Katherine or Kordelia.<eos> Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.
I'm Dorothy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> She doesn't understand you.
Okay?<eos> Close your eyes. Close 'em.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> Be difficult to feel any worse.<eos> I thought I'd lost you.
Maybe Glinda can help you.<eos> Give you a new life. Yeah.<eos> I trust her even less than her sister.<eos> Wait.<eos> West wanted you, too?
It's you.<eos> A soldier?<eos> My soldier.<eos> The best I've ever known.<eos> But you don't remember that, do you?
Baby, you just have to think back.<eos> Think back to when you killed the witch, okay?<eos> Just remember.<eos> That's all you got to do.<eos> You just... You got to remember.
You need to let me see him.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.
Are you okay?<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I need you to lie to the wizard.<eos> I need you to tell him you remember something... anything.
Then go.<eos> I think she likes to watch.<eos> Shall we let her?<eos> If this is what you want.<eos> Let's see what lowly witch has cast a spell on you.
Tip.<eos> And how do you know my Jack?<eos> We grew up together.<eos> We were best friends.<eos> Is this the one who killed you?
I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> Children can't be corrected if they don't know what they've done wrong.<eos> Show her.<eos> Show her what she did to you.
The tunnel in Nimbo would have brought them to Glinda.<eos> You are sworn to her, as am I.<eos> He works for Glinda?<eos> You know me?<eos> There is a wagon in the load-out that'll take you north to calcedon, Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you.
I just have one thing to ask of you first.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> You were born in Oz...<eos> Oz brought you back.<eos> Have you even asked yourself why?
Come on.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> Dorothy?<eos> Is something wrong with the house?<eos> I don't want you to get hurt.
You're just gonna reason with a Cardinal Witch?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Kill her if I have to.<eos> Words without point, Dorothy.<eos> You don't know what opposes you or how to stop it.
There is no fight left in Emerald City.<eos> The true fight still comes for all of us.<eos> I brought our kind back from the dead.<eos> And I will take back what belongs to us.<eos> Emerald City does not belong to you.
Five dots, a circle.<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to kiss each mark before I put you to sleep.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One to keep you safe, one for good dreams.
The truth.<eos> I went to check on Karen.<eos> She was hurt, so I went to go get help, and then I was swallowed up by a twister.<eos> Ten minutes later, I wake up right where I left.<eos> That's all you remember?
Twins... as close as two things can get to being the same one, and what's the first thing they do to each other?<eos> Fight over who gets to be the first one to see the light of day.<eos> And here I sit at the head of an army of men, each of whom, present company included, has probably at some point considered killing the man he now fights alongside, each of whom, present company included,<eos> has certainly considered killing me.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I haven't considered killing you in months.
For whose benefit is that?<eos> I'm told that once mastered, it's actually quite soothing.<eos> At this moment, I'm finding that hard to believe.<eos> But if I am to play the role, I ought to make some effort to look the part.<eos> It bothers me that this does not bother you.
Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.
You are part of Flint's inner circle?<eos> If you have information about Captain Flint's contingency plans, it may argue in favor of leniency.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Pull him up.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
Are you through?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then go.<eos> When was the last time you fought in a vanguard?<eos> He ain't never gonna see you in that way, Teach.
Charles Vane stood by us when no one else would.<eos> Charles Vane risked his life for us.<eos> Charles Vane...<eos> Oh, fuck Charles Vane.<eos> I know how you felt about him.
I know how you felt about him.<eos> I felt the same way, and you know it.<eos> But he's dead.<eos> And I can't see what fucking sense it makes to keep trying to make him happy.<eos> And all it's actually gonna lead to is you joining him.
Daddy, what's a mistress?<eos> Love is never deliberate, grandpa.<eos> It just happened.<eos> You were an action star, Rusi.<eos> When did you become a romantic hero?
Julia..<eos> I'm going to pee, wanna join me?<eos> Ladies only.<eos> You're so stubborn.<eos> Everyone warned you about doing that stunt.
Oh, that felt so good!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I was praying to God, I was, like,<eos> "Please give me a reason to shoot you." And you came through, bro!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Two bikes.<eos> Dispatch, this is EAGLE-6.<eos> We have four suspects on two black motorcycles heading eastbound toward Pennsylvania Ave.<eos> Shots fired, shots fired!<eos> Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.
Yeah, you can. Most guys probably...<eos> It was my first day, so I thought you'd probably want to see what I look like.<eos> In all brown?<eos> It's great, Jon.<eos> I thought maybe it would remind you of your dad.
- Great job. Very thorough.<eos> - Very thorough.<eos> - You know what confuses me?<eos> That you have an Italian name, Poncherello.<eos> Mm-hmm? Why didn't they give you a Guatemalan name or Taiwanese, or whatever the fuck you are?
He loves paperwork. - I don't really care.<eos> You think I'm Haitian or Cuban, from Miami?<eos> I'm law, motherfucker, the old kind.<eos> If you had something on me, we'd be in the box right now, but you got nothin'!<eos> So, why don't you fuck off and get a motorcycle lesson?
Wait, your dad was a cop?<eos> God, no.<eos> He was just a fuck-up, kind of like you.<eos> Mmm. So flattering.<eos> I was wondering, when you get discharged, if you wanted to, um, take a ride back home with me?
Yeah, enjoy that app, right? Wow.<eos> Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Oh! - Hey! - Oh, Ponch!<eos> Man, am I happy to see you!
Oh, thank God!<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, I need your gun.<eos> I'm so happy to see you.
She worked for a huge firm.<eos> Maddie, I haven't even told these guys. They don't know.<eos> It just pisses me off, because in large part this has to do with Renata Klein having this mayor and this town by the balls.<eos> And if city council were to see somebody like the... the likes of Celeste and Perry Wright on the other side of this, they would have to pay attention.<eos> Why... why are you laughing?
You're laughing at me?<eos> Gordon, please, I spend all day long never letting my guard down.<eos> Just let me be a scared mom.<eos> It's our daughter.<eos> Look, one of the things that makes you so successful is that you're able to see every hiccup.
I gave up my career for you.<eos> I left my family.<eos> I left my friends.<eos> I moved here for you.<eos> You honestly think I don't love you?
What's the big problem, hmm?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.<eos> If you go to pieces again, who's gonna put you back together?
- What?<eos> No. No freaking way.<eos> Come on, don't give in.<eos> Ziggy didn't do it.<eos> Do not let them get to you.
That's great!<eos> What do you and Ziggy like to do together?<eos> We just like playing and stuff.<eos> And he's nice to you? Yes.<eos> Amabella... is somebody still hurting you?
I want more!<eos> - Oh. - And you know what?<eos> - What?<eos> - You're gonna be a lawyer again.<eos> - No. I mean, I have never seen you like that.
- What if it goes to court?<eos> - It's not gonna go to court.<eos> That is a done deal.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.
Hey, where you going?<eos> - I'm going to Becky's.<eos> - Becky?<eos> Wait, is she the stupid one?<eos> Your mom's always nagging me about letting you hang out with stupid people. - Dad!
Target practice.<eos> I try to go once a month.<eos> You were doing target practice?<eos> You seem suspicious.<eos> Well, we're going on a road trip to go meet the person that assaulted you, and you're doing target practice?
You can leave in a mess, but don't...<eos> - Amabella.<eos> - What?<eos> What happened?<eos> Did somebody bite you?
Do not make this a referendum on my anger.<eos> That someone has been hurting her for who knows how long, that we haven't even known about it, that we can't even stop it, and that she won't even talk to us about it...<eos> - I know!<eos> - Don't pull out your fucking scorecard to total up who's got the most anger.<eos> Oh, you're the one that's getting mad at me? Instead of some little fucker who's chomping on our kid?
I know you have feelings for me.<eos> Well, then if you know that, just cling to that.<eos> I have to go back.<eos> Can you please take me back?<eos> That you're this uncomfortable with the conversation...
Geez. What about the guy in the truck?<eos> It wasn't a guy. It was a teenage boy.<eos> They think he was texting.<eos> I've got to sit down to dinner with Perry and the kids right now, so... why don't you give her a call?<eos> She's at home. She'd love to hear from you.
Call me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I feel like you were driving less aware...<eos> I'm here 'cause some kid ran a stop sign.<eos> I think I owe you some clarity.
- Better. I think we're all doing better.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Actually, I normally have a lot of lower back pain, so probably saved me a trip to the chiropractor.<eos> I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm just gonna head out now. - Okay.<eos> - But good to see you, Tori.
You know it.<eos> So, what's your point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just... I relate to the guy.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine not looking back at you.
Hey! Look at me.<eos> You're the girlfriend.<eos> Where's Holt?<eos> I... I can help you.<eos> But I need to show you something first.
- Yeah. - It's Gabriel.<eos> Holt, listen. I've got a tail for you.<eos> It's not for me anymore.<eos> You know why I wasn't answering your calls, right?<eos> It was to protect you from this.
You're here.<eos> Julia?<eos> Here she is, Samara!<eos> This is what becomes of your savior!<eos> With the grace of the Holy Spirit, may the Lord who freed you from sin save you, and raise you up!
They left in a hurry, not bothering to sew their wounds or burn the dead.<eos> And when they reached their home shores, not one of them ever set foot in a boat or spoke of that new world ever again.<eos> Over 100 years later, when Leif the Fortunate, son of Erik the Red, would rediscover that land, he found his god waiting... along with his war.<eos> Best thing, only good thing about being in prison, is the relief.<eos> You don't worry if they're going to get you when they already got you.
I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.<eos> They'll do anything they can to keep you inside with them.
I smell snow.<eos> Hello?<eos> I love you.<eos> Something feels weird.<eos> I love you, too.
Not a thing.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> I love you, too, baby.
I am truly, deeply sorry about your wife.<eos> Nice obituary, though, I thought.<eos> Okay, I said fuck off politely as many ways as I'm gonna.<eos> Now I'm fixing to be direct.<eos> Don't you want to ask me about the job?
I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.<eos> So did Laura.<eos> Shit, Shadow.<eos> No one told you?
I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.<eos> Robbie did his best to avoid looking at me.<eos> Get used to the boot, puppy.<eos> There is no closure from the dead.<eos> Maybe, you know, three years from now, some therapist will tell you, to write her a letter saying everything you wish you could say to her and drop it in the ocean.
And maybe it'll help.<eos> It won't help.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Shadow.<eos> I really am.<eos> Anyone tell you that yet?
My husband and your wife... my best friend...<eos> I want them to see it.<eos> I want Robbie to watch while I take this gorgeous man's cock in my mouth.<eos> Pissing on him wasn't enough.<eos> I want you to come in my mouth,
She gets on her knees.<eos> She takes what she don't want to, and we watch in easy fucking judgment and pretend we'd do a single thing different in her shoes.<eos> I hear they blew up your altar.<eos> Darn.<eos> I have a new one to offer you.
Now, we have a compact.<eos> Yeah, up to which point you piss me off.<eos> And you've just gone and pissed me off, okay?<eos> So I think that just violates the terms of our agreement.<eos> What are you so pissed off about?
Shadow?<eos> That's a sweet name.<eos> Now, now, now, now.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> Why do they call you Shadow, sweetness?
I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means. None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring. You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.<eos> What has gotten into you?
No!<eos> It's her day.<eos> You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned.
Happy fucking Easter.<eos> No...<eos> A word.<eos> You shut your mouth before I slap it off your goddamn face.<eos> How dare you.
No...<eos> A word.<eos> You shut your mouth before I slap it off your goddamn face.<eos> How dare you.<eos> How dare you come into my home and uncork all over Jesus of Nazareth, and all the other Jesuses who died on the cross, and even the ones who didn't?
They shake hands, they take shits.<eos> What I'm doing here is of no concern to them.<eos> This is your day, love.<eos> Always has been, always will be.<eos> Just don't try to tell me that they all worship you.
Deep penetration.<eos> Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now... It's my turn to do well by you.
Come on.<eos> A dead girl?<eos> I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home. - Don't stoop.
I have other guests.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I was killed... by a god?<eos> Which... fucking... god?<eos> Never saw you look quite so pretty before.
What was it?<eos> My mother was dying.<eos> And I got serious about someone.<eos> And?<eos> I heard you were getting married.
How would you take off a biohazard suit?<eos> You know, so you don't get Ebola when you take off the other glove.<eos> Like, wouldn't you have to have someone suited up to take off your glove, and then they would have to have someone for their glove, which has to be disposed of?<eos> Just stay away from Ebola and do your homework, you know, that's...<eos> Yeah, but how do you know that you can stay away from Ebola?
Parking's free, but you have to be in the left spaces, because the right has a meter.<eos> - Did you get booked?<eos> - Yeah, 90 bucks.<eos> Mate, your voice is so high-pitched.<eos> Has anyone told you that before?
No-- she wouldn't go anywhere without telling me first.<eos> - Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> - What, your girlfriend?<eos> - Yes. "Dear Brett, I've decided to see the world."<eos> Your paid sex worker wouldn't go anywhere without telling you?
I'll start at the weekend.<eos> Thanks, sis.<eos> I'm sorry, by the way.<eos> About the wedding, I mean.<eos> Is it true you walked out on the day?
Now you're just flinging labels at me, so stop it.<eos> You can't control me-- you don't live here any more.<eos> I'm not trying to control you!<eos> I'm here three days a week!<eos> Why don't you sit down with us and eat?
Look, Chris, tell me this, okay?<eos> How can I get in trouble for patting down an old lady?<eos> It's standard procedure.<eos> Gary just think 'cause an elderly bitch is elderly, she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.<eos> C, wait, wait, wait. I know you laughin'.
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.<eos> That's okay. We're not judging.<eos> We're not.<eos> That's a nasty habit, though.<eos> You should have Missy take care of that for you.
Okay, fall back, Dean.<eos> It's a service we provide.<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> Yes. Thank you, though.<eos> Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the big get-together. Yeah.
- No, it's not.<eos> - Um... It is.<eos> Actually, it is.<eos> Is it really?<eos> - Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
I filled the liquor bottles with water...<eos> And let me finish?<eos> Uh-huh. Go ahead. I'm curious.<eos> So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely. Oh, God.<eos> You realize you're coming off as, like, the world's biggest douchebag, right?
No, it's fine. It's fine.<eos> Yeah? Yeah?<eos> Uh-huh. How are you so calm?<eos> Honestly, it's nothing.<eos> I like you on your racial flow, though.
You're so scared.<eos> You think it was your fault.<eos> How do you feel now?<eos> I can't move.<eos> You can't move.
Logan King.<eos> Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you.<eos> Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.
And it's the people here, too.<eos> It's like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for 'em.<eos> Yep, you're in it.<eos> Also, shit...<eos> I don't even wanna tell you.
You ain't gettin' in my head.<eos> I know. She caught me off guard, right?<eos> But it's cool because I'm cured.<eos> It worked.<eos> Bruh, how are you not scared of this, man?
Yes.<eos> Well, I'll have to let you all get on the rest of the night without the aid of my marvelous wit.<eos> The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.<eos> Logan, you just get some rest.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Chris.
How long have you known that guy?<eos> I met him today.<eos> Why?<eos> Man, this is gonna sound weird, but when he came at me, it felt like I knew him.<eos> Like you've met Logan before?
Let's go home. This sucks.<eos> This sucks. Let's go home.<eos> I'll make something up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, baby.
I love you too, baby.<eos> Good night. Thank you.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> Good night, Chris!<eos> It was great to meet you.
Compact amended.<eos> How much longer you gonna be in this town?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe another day.<eos> You're done here, we're done here.
Not so fast.<eos> We need to talk, Shadow.<eos> Look at me, Shadow, all in hi-def.<eos> We shot the show in 35mm, cutting edge. Looks like hell in the transfer.<eos> Funny how things supposed to make you look good only make it worse.
Now they hold a smaller screen on their lap or in the palm of their hand so they don't get bored watching the big one.<eos> Time and attention, better than lamb's blood.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.
Time and attention, better than lamb's blood.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.<eos> I would never do that to you, honey.
They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.<eos> We're done.<eos> Whatever the old guys are giving you,
Would I rather be ignored?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, yes, ignore me.<eos> Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.
Or in a pinch... a telegram.<eos> You know I miss those.<eos> Dots and dashes, secret code.<eos> There was drama in there.<eos> Someone gave you an envelope, you got anticipation.
The secret is charm.<eos> Yeah, well, you either got it or you don't.<eos> Charms can be learned like anything else.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya.<eos> He don't going to be happy to see you.
Why would you make all that up?<eos> I think it's our instinct to search for meaning, and when there is none, it's our instinct to create meaning and we just...<eos> lie. We lie to ourselves.<eos> You are so annoying.<eos> Has anyone ever told you that?
When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.<eos> You're sounding just as paranoid as him.<eos> Dad said he needed to change things up.<eos> People knowing our address was too dangerous.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.
What is it?<eos> Rose-colored glasses.<eos> That's what you're wearing.<eos> Shit-colored glasses.<eos> Anyway, you shouldn't worry, because all of this is being closely monitored and controlled.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.<eos> Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.<eos> - That's all. It's not a cult.<eos> - It should be different. Straitjackets.<eos> You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason. Right?
Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.<eos> I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.<eos> Okay, last question.<eos> Are you legitimately suicidal?<eos> If you knew what came after... this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
I don't think that's going to happen, Will.<eos> Because tonight... everything changes.<eos> We finally unveil it.<eos> What is "it," Toby?<eos> Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.
To get there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> They didn't want me to come.<eos> Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know you very well.<eos> I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.<eos> I'm just... lugging a corpse through a parking lot."<eos> - Why'd you go with "Jim"?<eos> - Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.<eos> Believe me, if hypothetical Jim makes you not wanna kill yourself, I can be supportive.
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by and this is kind of weird, but there seems to be, like, a dead body laying in your parking lot.<eos> - That was pretty good.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Get out.<eos> - I'm saying you're doing a good job.
The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.<eos> It gives them purpose. And I care about them.<eos> Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.<eos> You...<eos> You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.
What?<eos> I had a son... and he was five years old.<eos> And I fell asleep... just for a second.<eos> And when I woke up, he was gone.<eos> At first I thought I wasn't supposed to meet you... or feel anything.
Not yet!<eos> His vitals are concerning me.<eos> If we pull him now, we might lose him.<eos> Isla. Isla, please.<eos> I'm not ready to leave you.
And some of the things people have investigated, for example, are things like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders.<eos> And while they may occur more frequently in that population, there's no evidence that their receiving sex for money caused that problem for them.<eos> Let's say I'm some unemployed guy or something in the middle of the country living in a trailer park, but I have the ware-for-all to be able to save $100 a week up so that on my birthday next year,<eos> Okay, she just fell off that pedestal, in my opinion. And she became less valuable to the industry.<eos> As soon as someone can have you for a price outside the industry, your value to the industry goes down.
So, I took my time with it.<eos> It took me 17 years before I did my first interracial scene.<eos> So, I took my time so that I wasn't burnt out and people weren't burnt out.<eos> Are you following me again?<eos> Told you to stop following me.
And I'm not knocking the girls.<eos> Hey, if that's how they want to make their money, that's fine.<eos> Again, be safe about it.<eos> But I think they're coming in the industry to make a little name, and then they go out there and make probably even more money being an escort.<eos> So have you ever wondered why I'm so at ease with the adult business and when you were doing movies and whatnot?
Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.<eos> Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,
I just thought he was nervous.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi, Kat.<eos> This is quite a turnout.<eos> People are happy to see you go.
It makes me anxious.<eos> Run it again!<eos> Tootsie Roll?<eos> How can you eat those?<eos> Seriously, what does that look like to you?
- Are you awake?<eos> - Are you alive?<eos> - Yeah, I'm alive.<eos> Door closed.<eos> I have to be able to see you to know you're alive.
I have to be able to see you to know you're alive.<eos> - It's a minimum requirement.<eos> - You heard my voice.<eos> I heard indistinct mumbles.<eos> Well, you take what you can get in this life, Mom.
Okay. Thanks.<eos> Uh, what am I in, exactly?<eos> If you have to ask, you don't know.<eos> And just like that two became three.<eos> And, like, before you know it, you're best friends.
It's hard.<eos> To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?
To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?<eos> More than I can tell you.
Alex, tempo.<eos> Fifteen, here we go.<eos> One, two...<eos> ♪ No rushing, Alex ♪<eos> I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but I need you to focus.
Never.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> - Justin!<eos> - Uh, hey, Coach.<eos> Missed you at the pep rally.
If she had a friend, maybe...<eos> It's okay, man.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's not okay.<eos> You want it to be okay because then you get off the hook, but you're losing your shit.
- This tastes like shit.<eos> - Fuckin' finish it anyway.<eos> Are you fucking shitting me?<eos> Hey, really appreciate your help.<eos> Looked like you were having a good time.
What skeletons you might turn up?<eos> Well, for this next one, you're about to find out.<eos> A-4 on your map, kids.<eos> Mother...<eos> Now, don't say you're too afraid or that you don't feel comfortable doing this kind of thing, because guess what? You spy on people every day.
Uh, no.<eos> About who you're going to take to Winter Formal?<eos> People take people to that?<eos> Quiet study, please.<eos> What else has you up nights?
- Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.<eos> They just want to shut you down.<eos> And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.
You two worked together?<eos> Right.<eos> At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.<eos> Did she ever talk to you about her experiences at school?
At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.<eos> Did she ever talk to you about her experiences at school?<eos> Uh, experiences?<eos> I mean, did she ever say anything to you that would indicate that she might have been mistreated or bullied in any way?
Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> But you knew that already.<eos> I what?<eos> I knew you looked familiar.
- No!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Little light housekeeping?<eos> - Yeah, I was just going to do laundry.<eos> - You were? I don't think I've ever seen you do laundry.
Whatever you're going through now, you don't have to do it alone.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said... I know what it feels like to have people judge you.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
- It's not that old.<eos> - It's older than me.<eos> A limo?<eos> Honey, we can't afford a limo.<eos> - What were you thinking?
You're missing out on the fun run.<eos> It's three miles of torture.<eos> What part of that is fun?<eos> Calling it fun is Orwellian.<eos> And why do you care if I miss it?
Hey, where's your girlfriend?<eos> Sorry, which girlfriend is that, exactly?<eos> Your girlfriend from the picture, Laura.<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you now and then.<eos> Who'd you hear that from?
I want to be your friend, Courtney.<eos> I have been a friend to you, and this thing you're scared for people to know about you doesn't matter to me.<eos> Okay, it doesn't fucking matter.<eos> And I'm sorry if you're scared, but I'm not your shield, okay?<eos> You don't get to hide behind me.
This is amazing.<eos> I fucking love these peanut butter and cheese crackers, even though they don't taste like peanut butter or cheese.<eos> God, you would make the best soccer mom, dude.<eos> Thank you, Jess.<eos> I'm sorry I slapped you that one time.
No one's going to think anything's happened.<eos> No one's going to think or say anything.<eos> Clay's out of control.<eos> I'll get him under control.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.
So you're going to try to prove that Hannah wasn't bullied.<eos> The school's position is that they didn't know about any bullying, and they would have stopped it if they had.<eos> You believe that's true?<eos> I believe we'll find out.<eos> Are you okay with that?
So, Montgomery, this case seems pretty straightforward.<eos> - You were the one driving.<eos> - So? So the pedestrian has the right of way.<eos> That is the law.<eos> And you were walking when he almost hit you?
Uh... one of them, yeah.<eos> How many are there?<eos> I told you it was just school stuff.<eos> Forget it?<eos> Thought you didn't get caught up in high school bullshit.
Stop!<eos> What the fuck, Justin?<eos> - I told you, my mom...<eos> - Your mom what? Huh?<eos> It never stopped you before.
Because you're a good kid.<eos> Maybe there aren't any good kids.<eos> I have to get ready for bed.<eos> Clay, honey.<eos> If this case could hurt you in any way... then I won't take it.
And we will... keep going and keep searching and keep fighting for as long as you want to.<eos> As long as we have to.<eos> Whatever they throw at us... it's you and me against the world.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you, too.
He do something to you?<eos> No, Dad.<eos> 'Cause, you know, if he did, I'd kill him, right?<eos> Dad.<eos> If anybody does anything to you, I'd just...
And communications class could be supremely silly... as you know.<eos> Maybe she should try a diet.<eos> Seriously, Pratters?<eos> Jesus!<eos> I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then... you know, don't be fat.
Seriously, Pratters?<eos> Jesus!<eos> I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then... you know, don't be fat.<eos> Mr. Pratters!<eos> Pratter's, that's like someone saying to you,
I can't get my strength!<eos> Take a handful, boys.<eos> Start passing these babies out.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> How many of these did Daddy make you?
Seriously, no.<eos> Look...<eos> The whole night... with Marcus and everything...<eos> I couldn't believe you were on his list and not mine.<eos> Zach... I don't know if you're doing this on a dare or whatever.
Leave me alone!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This shit that happens to you...
I had things to hang on to.<eos> I had chess club, I had Knowledge Bowl...<eos> See, now you're embarrassing yourself, Dad.<eos> Do you have something?<eos> Does anything bring you joy?
Game's about to start.<eos> Get off the court.<eos> Go. Hey, skinny kid, get the hell off the court.<eos> Clay, you okay?<eos> Do you care?
I gotta go to bio, guys.<eos> Why, so you can cry about a frog again, you fuckin' pussy?<eos> I didn't cry.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Maybe that kind where you think no one truly sees you.
We left early.<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> Me and Bryce and some other guys.<eos> You couldn't have texted me?<eos> Bryce said he texted you.
Take 'em.<eos> Share 'em.<eos> Release 'em to the world.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Really? You... you don't give a shit?
I needed direction.<eos> Any direction.<eos> You have to be kidding me.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I have something I have to show you.
All the answers you seek are at the top of the cliff.<eos> The drag of your hand across my chest<eos> Sparks a blaze my lips cannot extinguish<eos> You, stubborn inferno<eos> You drive fast, and damn the red lights for slowing you down
That's my mom's ring.<eos> Be a good son or plunge to the rocks below.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for the perspective.<eos> It must be possible to swim in the ocean of the one you love without drowning.
Oh, Jess, come on, look.<eos> I just...<eos> Maybe later.<eos> I just don't want to right now.<eos> I don't do it for you anymore.
-You think so?<eos> I think it feels really real.<eos> "How many circles can I walk in before I give up looking?<eos> How long before I'm lost for good?<eos> It must be possible to swim in the ocean of the one you love without drowning.
You should come. It might be cool to actually hang out when we're not both covered in chewing gum.<eos> Don't be an enabler.<eos> I made a deal with myself.<eos> I'll watch out for you.<eos> One beer, max. Home by midnight, even if I have to pedal you home on my bike.
Thank you.<eos> Keg's out back.<eos> Get on it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Maybe you do fit in after all.
Okay, tell me.<eos> Why is this happening?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?<eos> Do you have something you want to tell us?<eos> Like who sold you the drugs?
Hey, we're playing beer pong out back. (LAUGHS)<eos> - You want to go? No, dude, I'm all right.<eos> I'm sticking around for Jessica. - She's so wasted!<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> I'll bet you had some fun with her, didn't you? Let me see.
I kind of liked the music.<eos> Did you like the music?<eos> Sheri.<eos> What?<eos> I have to tell you...
You know, I think you can be both.<eos> I mean, like... right now, maybe it's easier being mad at him than being sad.<eos> That's cool.<eos> But...<eos> I also think that maybe someday you might feel worse if all you were today was mad, you know what I mean?
Can we...<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About what?<eos> About what happened.<eos> I need to tell you...
Shoulders back.<eos> Breathe in.<eos> Breathe out.<eos> Then you shoot.<eos> Clay, we're just so glad to finally meet you.
But he was older than me, and on the baseball team and everything, and I wasn't really anybody.<eos> Well... you were to him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was really nice to me.<eos> So, Clay, what brings you here?
I think you do.<eos> Go on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Going in.<eos> I'd talked to you a million times before, but... tonight was different, and... I didn't know what to say to you.
For example, there's the triple take.<eos> You can freeze time when you want for as long as you want, but once you unfreeze everyone else, you're frozen three times as long.<eos> Okay, and you read this in a book?<eos> No, I made it up.<eos> For those real life situations where you wish you had a super power to get you out of?
Didn't look like nothing.<eos> I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.<eos> Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Your mom's gonna be glad to see you.
You used to be nice.<eos> We can't all be nice girls like Sheri.<eos> Or Hannah.<eos> Why talk shit about Hannah?<eos> What did she do to you?
It's what you do instead of killing yourself.<eos> Suicide is for the weak.<eos> I mean, what a... what a bitch!<eos> Wow. Well, she is!<eos> I never heard you use that word before.
Wow. Well, she is!<eos> I never heard you use that word before.<eos> She doesn't know what was going on in Hannah's life.<eos> You don't know what's going on in hers.<eos> Would you... you know, shut up, Tony?
I could lose my job.<eos> You're not gonna lose your job.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Babe, you had no idea that girl was suffering.<eos> You can't blame yourself for what she did.
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.<eos> You should just go.<eos> Part of me was saying...<eos> "Please don't leave."<eos> Part of me never wanted to see you again.
What are you doing here?<eos> What are you doing here with him?<eos> We're just having fun.<eos> Why the fuck are you here with Bryce?<eos> Why do you care?
Tell me!<eos> - Tell her, Justin.<eos> - Alex.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Tell me why you care. - Let's go.
- Tell her, Justin.<eos> - Alex.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Tell me why you care. - Let's go.<eos> Tell me why you fucking care!
Prepare you for what kind of questions they'll be asking.<eos> Which will mostly have to do with your relationship with Hannah Baker.<eos> And the more we know before the depo, the easier it will be.<eos> Mom.<eos> I promise I'll tell you everything... but not yet.
Okay.<eos> Jesus!<eos> What the hell, Justin?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I needed to see you.
I was going to the bank anyway.<eos> And I wanted to come see you.<eos> Why?<eos> Just to say hey.<eos> I mean, uh, haven't seen you in a while.
Well, there's no replacement for Hannah Baker.<eos> Clay, I'm... I'm really sorry about Jeff.<eos> I heard his funeral was beautiful.<eos> Sounds like the whole school was there.<eos> Thought I might see you there.
Hm. Okay, listen.<eos> If you get one, what matters most is that you just tell the truth.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, right, right.<eos> Sheri.<eos> And if you remember anything or hear anything, you come tell us first, okay?
My mind and heart were still in the big, blank nothing.<eos> Jensen.<eos> The fuck do you want?<eos> Hey, Bryce, um...<eos> Listen, I was wondering... if... I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't mind...
Look, I know it's weird, but I was hoping to buy some weed.<eos> It's kind of an emergency.<eos> You want to buy some weed. From me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If you wouldn't mind.
Just relax, just relax.<eos> We'll go nice and easy.<eos> But if you're not lucky, you die a little bit...<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> ...over and over... until you realize it's too late.
She got in the hot tub with you.<eos> And that means she wanted it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.<eos> But she didn't tell you so.
Girls play games.<eos> She didn't say she wanted you to fuck her.<eos> She never said no.<eos> And that's not rape?<eos> Why do you care so much?
- I'm just eating breakfast.<eos> - You disappeared again.<eos> There are consequences when you disappear.<eos> I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake. I was at a friend's house.<eos> A friend who beat you senseless?
Thank you for meeting me.<eos> You were the only one who tried to tell me the truth.<eos> Are you...<eos> I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing,"<eos> because, like, how the fuck do you think, right?
Are you...<eos> I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing,"<eos> because, like, how the fuck do you think, right?<eos> But... how are you?<eos> How the fuck do you think?
I'll talk to the cops.<eos> I'll kill Bryce.<eos> If you want, I'll kill him with my bare hands and pay the price.<eos> Just please tell me what you want.<eos> What I want... is never to see you again in my life.
It's just... I know I'm still on suspension, but I... I needed to talk.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> I was glad to see you on my calendar.
Why did she make that choice?<eos> We can't know that for sure.<eos> What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
She told you what happened to her.<eos> Look, even if she did come to visit me... this is not something I can talk about.<eos> So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone?<eos> Yes, I can tell your parents.<eos> You know, I can tell who I need to tell in order to get you the right medical attention.
Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?
Are you embarrassed by what happened?<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe you made a decision?<eos> No, I...<eos> A decision to do something with a boy that now you regret.
If I tell you... will you promise me that he'll go to jail?<eos> And I won't ever have to see his face again, that I won't have to face him?<eos> I can't promise you that, Hannah.<eos> But I will promise you this:<eos> I will do everything in my power to keep you safe and protect you in this process.
Are you sure you don't want Mr. Sebring to meet us there?<eos> Mom I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I don't need a lawyer.<eos> I just worry.<eos> Those kids are already picking on you.
Fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You don't look fine.<eos> Daddy?<eos> I need to tell you...
I understand what that must've felt like.<eos> You asked me once what I would do, what I would sacrifice if it meant having Thomas back again.<eos> I honestly don't know... what I would've done.<eos> I honestly couldn't say I wouldn't have done what you did.<eos> I told you I'd see you through this.
But I know you did this.<eos> Sent me away from that island so I would not see it.<eos> Emboldened Julius so I could not oppose it.<eos> Orchestrated it.<eos> Don't you dare insult me by denying this.
A world that is no more.<eos> I hear it ain't altogether over.<eos> I hear there are still men on the account here under the blessing of the governor.<eos> I hear he allows for it... as long as it helps drive up prices for the merchants here.<eos> I hear he allows you to continue the practice.
So that's it?<eos> You're finally leaving me?<eos> You caught me.<eos> I'm just... sick of being so damn happy at home, you know?<eos> Didn't know how to tell you.
She's tough.<eos> Maybe she'll live.<eos> Say her damn name!<eos> Carol.<eos> I hoped you didn't know her, but I didn't think you'd care, 'cause you know what needs to happen.
But things are gonna get very hard before that time.<eos> We have to hold on.<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What made you smile?
We have to hold on.<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What made you smile?<eos> What made you so... confident?
Okay.<eos> I'll be back in 10.<eos> Enjoy your new place.<eos> Good mornin', sunshine.<eos> Is it just as cozy as you remember?
Now us.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Negan. I'm Negan.<eos> Well, Eugene...<eos> I know you remember Lucille.
But who knows how truly smart you are?<eos> No sex.<eos> That is a grave no-no.<eos> However, you can have a little dinner, some drinks, share a few laughs.<eos> There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good to make you feel human again.
What does Dr. Smarty-pants say to his knew bestest friend in the whole wide world?<eos> What does he say?<eos> Fully, completely... sincerely, seriously... thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you go have some fun?
D...wealwayssaid that if we got separated, I should come back here and wait for you.<eos> You'd show up with beer and pretzels.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I know.<eos> You probably don't.
I don't think I'm gonna make it out here, but you're wrong.<eos> Being there isn't better than being dead.<eos> It's worse.<eos> I hope you realize that, and I hope you get away.<eos> I hope you remember the good days, even just one of them, but... I don't think you will.
Is everyone okay?<eos> Just tell me if it's true. You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.
Benjamin, get your gun up.<eos> It was supposed to be me.<eos> That's what Gavin said -- that I'd be first.<eos> I was trying to stop it.<eos> I was gonna give my life to show you!
It's better to talk about it when we get back, Your Majesty.<eos> We'll talk about it now.<eos> How's the kid?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Start walking back now before I kill you.
You okay?<eos> Can I get some water?<eos> I should introduce myself.<eos> I'm David.<eos> I wonder if you remember me from last night.
Do you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I can forgive that.<eos> Last night was kind of a shitstorm.<eos> I was the guy that gave the rope to the guys that tied you up.
I get it now.<eos> I got to hand it to you.<eos> You've got some beach-ball-sized lady nuts on you, coming in all kamikaze like that.<eos> Big question here, and I need the truth on this one ...<eos> Did Rick put you up to this?
Full disclosure, the pillow is not hypoallergenic.<eos> There was some debate as to whether or not I should come in here.<eos> They said in the event of a hostage situation with the pig sticker that I would fully be on my own.<eos> Just wanted to share that.<eos> Negan relayed to me his offer to you.
You still got a ways to go before I'll believe you're fully on board here.<eos> Baby steps.<eos> It is absolutely not personal.<eos> If the situation was reversed, I'm sure you wouldn't believe me, either.<eos> Still... the way you saved yourself, the way you surrendered to me just now ...
And, well, that needs to change, and you're gonna help me change it.<eos> We're gonna find us a win-win.<eos> How?<eos> What are you ...<eos> Hey, I'm gonna get you some stuff to make you more comfortable, let you have a taste of what it is we have to offer.
- Someone else...<eos> - It should be us. Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie.<eos> Have you, uh, changed your mind about taking that allergy medication?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Good. I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.
like, just now.<eos> Jesus.<eos> That is timing.<eos> Well, Rick... you chose this.<eos> I truly don't know what more I could've done to warn you.
I just want you to put that in your brain and roll it around for a minute.<eos> I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here, she's gonna take your hands.<eos> You can do it right in front of me.<eos> You can take my hands.<eos> I told you already... I'm gonna kill you.
The decision was made a long time ago, before any of us knew each other, when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street before the world ended.<eos> And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble.<eos> You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.
Pop, you remember how he'd stand when he'd read it?<eos> He'd come up to me and he goes...<eos> "'Cisco, buddy, that plant right there..."<eos> "Has gotten itself some root rot, boy-o."<eos> "You take that plant right there and you're best to move it..." "Two plots over, if you really care for that plant."
Well, as soon as the insurance money comes in, I'm selling...<eos> I'm getting out of Bella Canejo.<eos> Well, you're not wasting any time, are you?<eos> Yeah, well, I wasted enough.<eos> Mom, can you stop jerking off to real estate for a second?
I know you have this idea of your father... But maybe that idea was outdated.<eos> Maybe the truth is that he just got on that old tractor... He just plumb forgot how to drive it... And he ended up in the ditch.<eos> Sometimes, there is no mystery, no story...<eos> We just have to get on with our lives.<eos> I'm gonna hang around for a while longer... If that's okay with you?
Headquarters... I'll be the coalition, an organization... Injustices of the law.<eos> The that water once again flows... In the central valley.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And continues to flow!<eos> I hope you feel good, kid.
And continues to flow!<eos> I hope you feel good, kid.<eos> You helped this whole community, you've saved a lot of people.<eos> Well at the ocean.<eos> I wish you please... don't forget how to get back here, okay?
I wish you please... don't forget how to get back here, okay?<eos> Take care of this place.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
He abandoned us.<eos> Willem Dafoe!<eos> Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.<eos> Don't make my mistake, Summer.<eos> Don't deify the people that leave you.
Because you suck.<eos> You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.<eos> He bails on everybody!<eos> He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He... He bailed on tiny planet!<eos> And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.
And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?<eos> - That's my sister.<eos> - This used to be my home.<eos> Imagine doing anything you want, then hopping to a timeline where you never did it.<eos> Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you.
He loves me.<eos> You're a rogue Rick... Irrational, passionate.<eos> You love your grandkids.<eos> You came to rescue them.<eos> I came to kill you, bro.
R-Rick?<eos> Why not shoot through her?<eos> 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol,<eos> My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil.<eos> The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
Err? I'll find out.<eos> Who's that, what's going on?<eos> I'll check the flights for you now.<eos> Now I know I've got to run away.<eos> I've got to get away, you don't really want any more from me, to make things right, you need someone to hold you tight.
Stuff like that. Permit me to corroborate the barman's account of things.<eos> Demons and Cannibals.<eos> But I'm sure you have contingency plans.<eos> Just like last time.<eos> All the time you were gone, Dan. I prayed that Eric would find you and bring you home.
That could have been a warning.<eos> They sent him a warning after they cut off his head off?<eos> I'm trying to build a profile of the crime.<eos> This isn't how it's done.<eos> I have to tell you something.
Coffee expert too!<eos> An Americano with milk.<eos> I need you to take me round the coast of Vukobejina. The Mayor just called me, for a meeting.<eos> You've got a chopper, get you there in half hour.<eos> What the fuck do you need a boat for?
No fogging, no blurred vision?<eos> Erm, just, just, just that headache.<eos> Well, it doesn't sound like a tumour. That's good news.<eos> It's pretty fucking good, Vince.<eos> We need to get you back, now. I'll call, get the chopper out.
The law pays for you.<eos> 500 pieces for Long John Silver.<eos> I'm sorry, I think you're mistaken.<eos> I'm not...<eos> I seen you. Huh?
Israel Hands became jealous of Teach's affection and that it led to a falling out with the captain that was most humiliating.<eos> A degrading beating before all the crews on the beach.<eos> A pistol shot just missing his eye, rendering him a misshapen wretch.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> So, you can understand my confusion, given that Nassau's first king embarrassed you so thoroughly and so publicly, forbade any other crew from having you.
Soon.<eos> He wants to know when you're leaving.<eos> You have no intention of leaving, do you?<eos> What exactly do you suggest I tell him?<eos> Whatever the fuck you wanna tell him.
That said, the strangest thing just happened out by the slave quarters.<eos> The doors were locked... from the inside.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> What?<eos> What did she tell you?
- We're gonna be moving back towards...<eos> - We're not going anywhere.<eos> Henry, Davis, restrain the captain.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm through following you down a path only you seem able to see.
Is Rackham?<eos> Is Flint?<eos> This war may feel over, but as long as we're all free, it's far from it.<eos> And if somehow we prevail in Nassau, what happens to former friends who've since aligned themselves so warmly with the governor?<eos> I've come to offer you a chance to earn back our friendship.
This thing that perpetuates itself with anger and bluster and blood.<eos> I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.
Amabella, did somebody bite you?
His family's with him now.<eos> - Madeline.<eos> - Hi, Tori.<eos> I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.<eos> Glad to see you're feeling better.
- That was... whoa.<eos> Get out. - Go, honey, go, go, go.<eos> - Bring it on, sister. - Yes! - My gosh.<eos> What?<eos> I should've never Googled him or stirred you up like that.
And had this Saxon Baker been the guy, what would you have done?<eos> Were there others?<eos> Other Saxons in your Internet search?<eos> Listen, you moved to Monterey to start over, to build a future.<eos> I suggest you focus on that, not the past.
- I'm just gonna have to call you back,<eos> - all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Night, honey.<eos> Tell me, baby, what bad things have happened to you.
- Okay.<eos> How do I look?<eos> - You look nice.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Remember, you're not allowed to sing that one. - Okay.
- It's not really for kids.<eos> - I like puppets.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> Is it because the puppets have sex?<eos> - Who told you that? - Chloe.
- What?<eos> - Get ready.<eos> - We can be a little late.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> Well, I'm just very excited to see you. To be home with my beautiful wife.
That was really great.<eos> - I'm not a huge fan of Muppets, but... - Right.<eos> - Um, where'd Abby go?<eos> - She rushed out.<eos> She told me to tell you she loved it.
Get up.<eos> Celeste, you're fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you just got the wind knocked out of you.
It's your turn to have one now?<eos> Max, look at me.<eos> It's all right.<eos> The tooth fairy's gonna come for you, okay?<eos> You don't have to worry about that.
That didn't help matters... you know, people getting half in the bag.<eos> You otter try one!<eos> We're currently reviewing our alcohol procedures in relation to school events.<eos> So, did you plan on telling me?<eos> Or was I just to discover you gone when I got back from Hawaii?
- Ed's being a dick and... - Let's do it.<eos> For God's sakes, what is wrong with you two?<eos> He's been trying to pick a fight with me for weeks.<eos> - I'm standing up for Madeline, dick! - Stop it.<eos> Will you relax?
Hey, here he comes. Here we go.<eos> - Go get 'em, guy.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I need you to take the boys now to this address that I'm gonna give you.
Israel Hands.<eos> It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> - You want to withdraw?<eos> - If we don't, it will be the end of whatever trust exists between us and the slaves on the island.<eos> I'm through following you down a path only you seem able to see.
It was him and one other.<eos> I had six men.<eos> I thought it would be sufficient to apprehend him myself.<eos> Apprehend him?<eos> No one asked you to apprehend him.
I thought it would be sufficient to apprehend him myself.<eos> Apprehend him?<eos> No one asked you to apprehend him.<eos> All you had to do was report the invitation to meet and let the captain handle it.<eos> How in God's name did that not occur to you?
All you had to do was report the invitation to meet and let the captain handle it.<eos> How in God's name did that not occur to you?<eos> I did not fail to do it.<eos> I refused to do it and would again.<eos> Why would you refuse to adhere to the law?
But instead, I am stuck here for as long as it takes to fix this.<eos> In order to do that, you are going to have to give me something to fix it with.<eos> But you'd better come up with something of value I can use to get him to walk away from this.<eos> You think you can control him.<eos> And by the time you realize he has been controlling you, it is going to be too late.
Too many of them!<eos> Why would she do this to us?<eos> - Maybe she didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> Love you.
- He escaped.<eos> - Okay. You can hug him now.<eos> They won't believe it unless it's harsh.<eos> Jeez, now I know why I quit therapy.<eos> What brings you by, Kev-o?
Suit yourself, Sheriff.<eos> Everybody knows you just like to ride that horse.<eos> Giddyup.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
He thinks the New Testament's getting old.<eos> I've only read some of it, but you figure fairly prominently, Kevin.<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> He got pretty excited when you rose from the dead.
- Make sure he's...<eos> - No, he's resting now.<eos> Little bit of the old snore and drool.<eos> He took a pill, I think, maybe two.<eos> Or three. As soon as he's wakeys, I'll have him give you a ring-a-ding.
- Okay, Chief.<eos> Told you. Can't call me that anymore.<eos> I'm a Deputy now, same as you.<eos> I'll run the rest of these tomorrow.<eos> Which, you know... Serving eviction notices doesn't give you a sense of hope and purpose, what will?
- Not your wife.<eos> Did you sell your head to Czernobog?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You keep giving away your life.<eos> You don't much care if you live or die, do you?
Is good enough for me.<eos> You only learned to live with less.<eos> There is food, there is roof.<eos> What more do you need?<eos> A court to adore you.
Uh-oh, look what the goat dragged in. - Cat.<eos> - Goat.<eos> Big, rank, stinking goat.<eos> Mad Sweeney, you look like a man who's fallen on hard times from a great height.<eos> Thought I wasn't gonna see you until Wisconsin.
I'll see you back at the car.<eos> Just make sure he doesn't steal it, huh?<eos> Now, you're gonna do a little light shopping at the grocery store.<eos> Pass a little time at the phone booth.<eos> If anybody asks you what you're doing, well, you're waiting for a call from your girlfriend.
Did you always?<eos> Not before Laura.<eos> So you didn't believe till you did, and then the world changed because you believed.<eos> Belief is only a product of the company we keep and how easily we scare.<eos> And you do not scare easily.
The only thing that scares me is being forgotten.<eos> I can survive most things but not that.<eos> Very best part of memory is it's mostly about forgetting.<eos> We remember what's important to us.<eos> I wonder what'll be the first thing that drifts through your mind when you look back on this evening?
Sounds good.<eos> Let's celebrate this reunion with some fascist brandy.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - I know where to get some.<eos> You achieved glory by killing a load of fascists, then just walked away.
- You'll see.<eos> - Always want more.<eos> He's like me.<eos> - Look!<eos> - Uncle Juli brought you a doll.
Silent corpses, the stench of betrayal...<eos> It's grotesque and macabre.<eos> As if it were my home.<eos> Juli, I'm not in the mood for an absurd speech.<eos> All that riding seems to have upset you.
- Write to her and invite her here.<eos> - I don't take orders from you.<eos> Invite her, or I will.<eos> - What for?<eos> - You know what for.
Open the front door.<eos> We have a visitor.<eos> Olivella?<eos> Come in, Father.<eos> It's good to see you.
Get off me!<eos> Do it.<eos> Look, there's Daddy!<eos> Lluís. Lluís.<eos> I thought I'd never hold you again.
- The whole village knows!<eos> It's so humiliating. Don't touch me!<eos> Never touch me again!<eos> Trini.<eos> I knew you couldn't love me like I loved you, but I never thought you'd become a fraud and a cynic.
A false marriage certificate.<eos> Is it money you want?<eos> No, I don't want your money.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I want you to undress.
Protomolecule seems to behave uniquely. In each subject, Mutating rapidly in each different biomass.<eos> The level of the information density required. For the variety of outcomes I'm seeing is of a magnitude. I can't explain.<eos> "protomolecule." they gave the goddamn thing a name.<eos> Phoebe station is where it all started.<eos> These must be the martians that lopez told you about.
I'd never want to see another one of me. Running around anyway, so...<eos> If you need a few more days, we...<eos> No, no.<eos> A ship needs a captain.<eos> I don't know how you've managed without me.
Mmc!<eos> Good to see you, cotyar.<eos> If you'd known it was me, would you have come?<eos> Probably not.<eos> The last time I saw you was at charanpal's funeral.
The ones no one gives a shit about...<eos> Are you trying to make yourself feel bad about this?<eos> I'm gonna feel better when I watch those assholes burn.<eos> Look, I'm for killing whoever needs killing.<eos> But it's not gonna make you feel better.
We will honor those existing contracts.<eos> But we'll be adding 30 more positions to the nauvoo.<eos> The rest will come from other bids, All new work.<eos> Yeah, go on, coyo.<eos> Keep licking the earther's hand, Maybe he toss you a few more scrap from his table.
Deimos was the smallest move. The secretary general could swallow.<eos> Big symbol, minimal body count.<eos> Anyone with half a brain knew we were not going to leave. That room without an escalation.<eos> I'm honored you think. You gotta justify your actions to me...<eos> I'm simply telling you how. Your tantrum got you sidelined.
Make us look like something that got dropped.<eos> You got it, hoss.<eos> Hey, holden!<eos> Holden!<eos> Didn't the navy teach you to stow your gear. Before you went into maneuvers?
Attention, this is the freighter. Guy molinari to all vessels within range.<eos> This is a legal notification that we are on approach. To a loose cargo container. And have filed a salvage claim.<eos> Any interference with our property. Will result in civil action.<eos> Hey, when did you soldier up?<eos> Last time I saw you, you were...
That's Jacob, Dabi and Rebecca's third son.<eos> He's 6 now.<eos> Looks like his father.<eos> He's always getting into trouble, so naturally, he's my favorite.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?
This land was promised to Abraham.<eos> Yes.<eos> Promise.<eos> A covenant with God made thousands of years ago.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as a form of insanity?
What the fuck, man?<eos> ! Fuckin' spaz.<eos> Fuck, man! Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.
Fuck, man! Aah!<eos> So...<eos> That's the $2,000 I owe you.<eos> Less the $2,000 you stole from me, leaves what?<eos> How much I owe you now?
Not all the others.<eos> We'll sort that out later, but this one...<eos> And all these foreign nations just bleeding us dry!<eos> I am sick of it!<eos> But if you say that, if you stand up and say what's really going on...
Stop lying!<eos> I know why you're here, and I know about the gang in Pittsburgh.<eos> - What gang? - The one you got arrested with.<eos> I know everything...<eos> why you met Sekou, pretended you were Muslim, pretended you were his friend and mine.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - All things considered, I thought this would be better than showing up at your home.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A word in your ear about the President-elect.<eos> I know you've been meeting with her.
You went down into the valley.<eos> You went across.<eos> What do you say I pack first?<eos> Then we can have some breakfast and talk, okay?<eos> So who were you meeting?
Not this one.<eos> We back-channel for our bosses, turn down the temperature, keep the peace.<eos> Such as it is.<eos> We don't hold each other for ransom... or ask what we cannot give.<eos> You know what your problem is, if you don't mind me saying?
I'm here.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine now.<eos> Oh, what's happening?<eos> Ugh. Nothing, nothing.<eos> You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.
That I... flatlined and was dead for three minutes.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You were in a coma, Peter, a deep coma.<eos> Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.
On the positive side, the shrink said expect to hear from him soon.<eos> Plus, he was smiling, so...<eos> Fingers crossed.<eos> What's this?<eos> Um, according to cellphone records, it's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.
God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?<eos> She didn't say there was an issue.<eos> There is.<eos> She didn't ask you about this missing year?
No such thing as private anymore, is there?<eos> M and M?<eos> That year, from here to here,<eos> I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin?
- How's your commute?<eos> Not too bad.<eos> If you stay at the Resident Suites, there's a corporate rate and a pool.<eos> A lot of people take advantage.<eos> If you get lost, you're Level 6, Area 3.
So, I'm seeing Facebook accounts, Instagram, Twitter... 4chan, 8chan, fuckin' Linkedln, whatever.<eos> We're there.<eos> And this interface masks your identity.<eos> It did until it stopped working.<eos> Didn't O'Keefe tell you anything?
It did until it stopped working.<eos> Didn't O'Keefe tell you anything?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> All right, look.<eos> So, these sock puppets you're missing, they're just a bunch of fake users with online lives that you manage, right?
'Cause, tomorrow, we hit her even harder.<eos> Here you go, talking points for tomorrow.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - A work in progress-- not ready yet.<eos> Plenty of other stuff to show you, though, if you're interested.
Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.<eos> See?<eos> What was I just saying?<eos> She never tells you what you want to hear.
Give us a minute, will you?<eos> Carrie.<eos> Please.<eos> I will come right to the point.<eos> How would you feel about making our arrangement permanent?
Why, then?<eos> Lights out.<eos> Nothing till tom-- morning.<eos> Good. Then maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were being hauled off by orderlies at Bellevue.
You keep saying you saved my l-life.<eos> You killed it.<eos> You made this stroke.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> You only care because you got f-found out.
I've known him a very long time.<eos> He's developed quite an online presence recently-- a website-- which worries me.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> This is getting tiring, Max.<eos> If I wanted to hurt you, you'd be hurt by now.
You're gonna get out of this.<eos> We both are.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to tell me?<eos> What do these letters look like to you?
You are never welcome here.<eos> My father asks for you to keep the hounds quiet.<eos> Thyra... if you do not comply, he will have them killed... again.<eos> And again, you shall bring me pups.<eos> He will have men hump you.
Yeah, false idols.<eos> Usually disappointing.<eos> Anyway, gotta go.<eos> Uh-uh-uh. I don't think so.<eos> Tuff, you couldn't take me when we were kids, what makes you think you can take me now?
Okay, okay.<eos> [screaming in pain] That is no good.<eos> [Gruffnut] Hookfang. [chuckles]<eos> -[growls] Your old buddy.<eos> You don't mind if I take you for a little spin, do ya?
Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine. Just a nosebleed.<eos> I take it you're here to yell at me about the book?<eos> What book?<eos> The one I gave Kevin. He didn't tell you?
- Jesus.<eos> - How big can I make it?<eos> You are a heartless bitch.<eos> Hey! Hey! Hey, God damn you!<eos> God damn you to hell!
- What'd you do?<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> We're just working through some... We're fine.<eos> How are things down under?<eos> Well, Matt, funny you should ask about how things are going down here because it seems like you don't give a shit.
- No, no.<eos> When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.<eos> He was a grown man. 36 years old.<eos> That makes no fucking sense at all.<eos> Did you, uh... Did you get the money I sent you?
That makes no fucking sense at all.<eos> Did you, uh... Did you get the money I sent you?<eos> Yeah, I did. Ha.<eos> What's it for?<eos> Well, just to help you out.
God.<eos> Buddy, I know you're my totem, but I got some bad news for you.<eos> If I go down, I don't think I'm getting up.<eos> So...<eos> I need to eat you.
You give them the money, they show you the thing, you see that it torches people, then you bust them.<eos> Right.<eos> But you don't have any jurisdiction in Australia.<eos> That is technically true.<eos> The DSD didn't send you.
Remember?<eos> You need to indulge that person's delusion and find common ground.<eos> Otherwise, it's very likely that they will hurt themselves.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want you to hurt yourself, Kevin.
'Cause if you're having visions, he's gonna wanna put it in your fucking book.<eos> It's not my fucking book!<eos> No?<eos> I think you like it.<eos> I think you wanna be Jesus Christ fucking Superstar because it makes you feel important.
I will talk to him.<eos> He didn't call you.<eos> - He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?
He got better because of us, because of the work we've been doing, because of the book.<eos> Laurie gave him psycho babble.<eos> We gave him faith.<eos> She doesn't believe in the same thing we do, but she wants to help Kevin.<eos> I think she'd wanna help you, too, if you just talk to her.
Because Patti is dead!<eos> Because Evie is dead!<eos> - If you wrote a book every time somebody thought they saw--<eos> - Evie?<eos> Is that what he said when he called you?
♪ Get behind your wheel and crash the car ♪<eos> ♪ Like Desert Storm ♪<eos> ♪ Got bombs for the war ♪<eos> ♪ Confront an alligator ♪<eos> ♪ Let it eat you raw ♪
I heard you were with the good Reverend Jamison.<eos> He coming, too?<eos> No.<eos> He gave me something for you, though.<eos> He says he's sorry he didn't put you in his fucking book.
I'm of sound mind and body and give consent to go... to go wherever they went.<eos> Amen.<eos> So, the two women in that house, they recorded this?<eos> And we're also assuming they're just gonna lead us right to this device they told you about?<eos> Laurie: You don't have to stay, Laurie.
If I was gonna kill myself, I'd just go scuba diving.<eos> What?<eos> There are lots of ways to die when you're scuba diving.<eos> Your oxygen tank can break.<eos> You can get a bubble in your blood that gives you a stroke.
Know your cancer's back, tell no one... get no treatment, pray for divine fucking intervention.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You... you don't wanna kill yourself.
In a fire when we were kids.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Nora: Oh, fuck my parents.<eos> I wanna talk to my kids.<eos> I just told you, Nora.
But me, I just...<eos> I just couldn't believe it.<eos> I should've told you.<eos> Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked you into helping people talk to their dead relatives.<eos> I thought I was helping you.
I was locked up in a fucking mental institution.<eos> So you're wrong, Pop.<eos> I'm not Thomas.<eos> I'm Judas.<eos> Doubting is easy because doubting costs you nothing.
Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I... I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.
I'm here to say good-bye.<eos> Want a cigarette?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Don't forget me."<eos> Is this the lighter Jill gave you?
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to.<eos> And then... then I didn't have to.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Scared of what?<eos> Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw and holding you under the water until you drown.
"Today's Special"!<eos> Yes! Oh, my God.<eos> Fucking "Today's Special." Eat it, you fucker.<eos> Fuck, yes. - Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> - I knew you'd remember.
- I love you, Mom.<eos> - I love you, honey.<eos> Tell Tommy I love him.<eos> Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.<eos> I love you, too, Mommy!
You can't keep doing this.<eos> - Yes, he can.<eos> - No, look at him!<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Now you're worried about him?
You named me Secretary of Defense.<eos> You were asked who did you want in this position, and you named me.<eos> You summoned me out of retirement and I came back because I owed you.<eos> You helped me, Kevin.<eos> And now I'm here to help you.
We prefer to give a more thorough orientation, but since we were in the process of moving on, you'll just have to bear with us.<eos> Was that a person?<eos> It's a fossil.<eos> The person is gone.<eos> Maybe they'll let you keep mine.
But I think he knew I was lying.<eos> Nora?<eos> Kevin.<eos> Kevin Garvey.<eos> I don't know if you remember me.
- Because if you did, just say so, and I--<eos> - I didn't.<eos> We established boundaries the first time you called me.<eos> Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.
Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.<eos> I would never betray that, Nora.<eos> Then how did he find me?<eos> How did he say he found you?
- Miami.<eos> Yes.<eos> But we were strangers?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're giving me a hard time about inviting you to a dance?
When Matt told me you were gone, I didn't believe him.<eos> Or I couldn't.<eos> - I had this feeling that you were still alive... and that I would see you again.<eos> And then-- then Matt died and you weren't even at the funeral.<eos> And that should've convinced me, but I couldn't believe the last time I saw you or talked to you was in that fucking hotel room that night I burned his fucking book.
Come on, my pretty.<eos> Anne, get up.<eos> Move!<eos> I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.
But something tells me... if I free you, you'll find a way to be a problem for me again, and soon.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> When you and I last saw each other... you had every reason to see me killed.<eos> Certainly would've solved a lot of problems for you.
Your mother knew that.<eos> Knew that the best one can do is to find a place you can protect, build a wall, and save who you can.<eos> You'd be wise to learn from her example.<eos> I'm sorry for what happened today.<eos> The moment I realized what was about to happen, I sent men to find you.
_<eos> _ _<eos> Everything we've put that ship through... and she just refuses to die.<eos> It's fucking unnatural.<eos> They'll all follow you.
That's the first in recent memory.<eos> And one that they'd allow to lead them into a rational future...<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with reason, and you know it.<eos> You want them following me only to the extent that I, in turn, will follow you.<eos> I'm a convenience... designed to aid you in ruling over Nassau with the same uncompromising grip you'd vilify from Flint.
If I choose to side with him, trade the cache for the fort and his life, are you honestly suggesting you'd let it happen?<eos> That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.
Stupid sea pigeon, looking at me like that.<eos> Please!<eos> You're also at the beach with no friends.<eos> Honey, you paid someone to take a GED graduation photo?
I said I would come back with $16,000 in my pocket and a working pocket.<eos> I was gonna shower Mikey with gifts.<eos> Orchestra seats at a Mets performance.<eos> Mud flaps with a sexy man on them.<eos> Wait. This whole time you didn't get paid?
I even got a bonus after my bravura performance in the Bermuda Triangle.<eos> But then I had to eat all my paychecks.<eos> I mean, I lost them. Shut up!<eos> Kimmy, I'm tired of failing, tired of feeling like a loser.<eos> Titus, I've never seen you like this.
Are you serious?<eos> It's Richard.<eos> Richard Stemple? From high school?<eos> No, dummy. You didn't go to high school because I kidnapped you.<eos> I can't believe you don't remember that.
And I'm making it worse.<eos> I bet your cell's pretty small. My apartment's so big, I can-<eos> - Gosh dang it!<eos> Why don't our shins have butts?<eos> I know it seems like you're just having fun, but you let someone back in your life who's-- who's bad for you.
My override?<eos> Once I identify the leak, I can track them back to the people behind this.<eos> Keith, killing the Rangers is only the beginning.<eos> These people are planning attacks against this country.<eos> I have no way of verifying what you're telling me, but, what? I'm supposed to give you unfettered access to the system?
So what is Mr. Harris going to do?<eos> He say he'll tell the principal that he believes me, then we see what happens from there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you only did this because you care for me.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya, but it was over.<eos> That I explained everything to you, and you believed it.
Yeah. Well, you hung up on me. I was...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
He's still in.<eos> But listen up, I know you ain't down with the split, never have been.<eos> - You?<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
They'll be discreet, but I wanted to give you the heads-up.<eos> Wait, wait, wh-what do you mean, sequestering her?<eos> I'll explain when I see you. I'll be there in 15 minutes.<eos> - Rebecca...<eos> - I promise I'll tell you everything, but you need to stay away from her until I get there.
Listen, Nicole I know I haven't been hearing you.<eos> And I know I got a lot of things that I need to work on. But I promise you, I promise you things are gonna be different.<eos> Okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I-I'm having a hard time accepting this.<eos> Yeah, but you just said that they found security video...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> John, the sooner you accept that Nilaa is not who you thought she was, the sooner you can... begin to recover from the damage she's done.<eos> You're not surprised by all this?
John, the sooner you accept that Nilaa is not who you thought she was, the sooner you can... begin to recover from the damage she's done.<eos> You're not surprised by all this?<eos> Nilaa supporting terrorists?<eos> Well... I mean, you know her as well as I do.<eos> How come you're not disoriented by all this?
I just finished up with some business. I'm heading back now.<eos> Isaac, you sure she's okay?<eos> She good, bro.<eos> All right? You asked me to watch her, that's what I'm doing.<eos> I'll get her to call you.
How do you know what I think?<eos> Because whatever's on your mind hangs on you like a sign.<eos> Anyway, you're right.<eos> - I am? - Yeah.<eos> In fact, when I first got here, Mullins asked me to document every time you screwed up, so he could have a reason to let you go.
Anyway, you're right.<eos> - I am? - Yeah.<eos> In fact, when I first got here, Mullins asked me to document every time you screwed up, so he could have a reason to let you go.<eos> You're spying on me?<eos> You know, if I was, I wouldn't have told you.
That much is still true.<eos> As is the fact that, there was only three people that had access to that particular account:<eos> Me, Rebecca and you.<eos> Son, I hope to God you're not saying what I think you're saying.<eos> You know, it struck me how easily you were able to just, turn against Nilaa. Yeah, w-without blinking.
Ben, you better be telling me the truth about Gabriel.<eos> I am.<eos> Eric, I swear.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause if you're not, I'm-a kill you myself.
We are changing the world.<eos> And when it's over, everyone will know our names.<eos> Princess.<eos> Don't cry, little one.<eos> I'm happy to see you, too.
I thought so, too.<eos> Eric, what's going on?<eos> Listen, I want you to go to Christine's and I'm gonna come and get you as soon as I can, okay?<eos> I love you, Nicole.<eos> I love you, too.
Oh, really?<eos> Can I?<eos> I just saved your life.<eos> And you let Aisha and Jerome bounce.<eos> Yeah. What would you gain by killing them?
Listen, thanks for saving my life earlier.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> It's just been real hard lately, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> It hasn't been the same since you left.
John.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he say anything else to you?<eos> Anything I should know before I go in? Um...<eos> Just what I told you over the phone. That he gave up the Army Rangers to the terrorists. That he framed Nilaa for it.
Henry.<eos> Becca.<eos> Can I get you anything? Something to drink?<eos> I would just like to understand what's going on, why John would do this to me.<eos> I know he's told you some story about my working with terrorists but I swear to you, I don't have the least clue what he's talking about.
Give me the phone.<eos> So how do you know they're genuine?<eos> Because I know where I stole them from.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> What's to stop me killing you? Keeping the plans anyway?
What does it matter, anyway?<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> Here, take some more.<eos> How can you do this to your own father?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.
Here, take some more.<eos> How can you do this to your own father?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.<eos> If you go through with this, whatever you're thinking of doing, my life will be over.<eos> Amira, do you not remember your childhood?
We don't want to hurt you.<eos> If you go through with this, whatever you're thinking of doing, my life will be over.<eos> Amira, do you not remember your childhood?<eos> How we played together? How we used to sing you to sleep?<eos> What would your mother say if she were to see you treat me like this?
I will... I'll call them right now.<eos> Are you meeting me there?<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
The reason we pray?<eos> Family and peace.<eos> That is what we seek.<eos> Anything else is a twisted perversion.<eos> Don't let your brother lead you down the wrong path.
Family and peace.<eos> That is what we seek.<eos> Anything else is a twisted perversion.<eos> Don't let your brother lead you down the wrong path.<eos> I raised you better than this.
We're his children, Khasan.<eos> Was he there for us when we were growing up?<eos> No.<eos> He only came around to raise his voice, puff his chest and beat us into behaving.<eos> Hmm? Or have you forgotten?
Mullins revoked my clearance.<eos> He knows I'm the one that gave Eric Carter the classified missile specs.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?<eos> Yeah. Something you could've used a little more of.
He took away my clearance, and he'll fire me as soon as he figures out how.<eos> I shouldn't have gotten involved.<eos> Some might consider what I did an act of courage.<eos> Courage?<eos> Something you could've used a little bit more of.
That's why he's right for this job.<eos> I have to go.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I just need to tell you that I get it.
He'll try. 'Cause that's what he does.<eos> You made the right choice.<eos> You did.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> 'Cause the next time they come up here could be the last time I see you.
Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.<eos> He will, because he loves you.
That's what it sounded like, but he should've been here by now.<eos> The GPS on his phone and car have gone quiet, and I can't reach anyone on his security team.<eos> How long ago did he call?<eos> 15, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll call you back.
Your father wasn't responding to conventional interrogation.<eos> We needed to try something else.<eos> Something else?<eos> We need to finish this conversation in person.<eos> I'll have CTU bring you over.
Please.<eos> I need you to get in the car, now.<eos> What's gonna happen to you, Eric?<eos> Nicole.<eos> Just tell me you have a way out of this.
You knew the people to call.<eos> 'Cause you've done this before, haven't you?<eos> Another day at the office.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you, and I don't even know who you are anymore.
This is about to be a war.<eos> No.<eos> I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm gonna go after Eric 'cause I love him.<eos> No. I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband.<eos> Eric gave himself up to save you.
Yes?<eos> Got it.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
Oh, and what was that?<eos> For the record, this is the proof that my path is righteous.<eos> You know, you can keep hiding behind your religion all you want, Jadalla, but we both know this is just about killing innocent people.<eos> Some of them Muslim.<eos> Not that you give a damn.
I remember when you were all family, when there wasn't anything you wouldn't do for each other.<eos> Let's give these bitches some payback.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
Rebecca.<eos> I hope things work out between you and John.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I can manage.<eos> I've asked Dr. Waring to stop by tonight so he can, uh, take a look at you.
And I know that you can bring Rebecca around.<eos> I mean, if anybody understands that sometimes short-term compromises have to be made for the greater good, it's Rebecca.<eos> She understands that sort of thing.<eos> There were over 100 innocent people that were killed on that bridge. Because of you.<eos> And 100 million people will be helped if you become president.

There's still no sign of pursuit.<eos> We've been blessed.<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were my father's lieutenant?<eos> Not my place to tell you.
He killed the asset's family.<eos> Carter found them.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> You think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.<eos> It has happened for a reason.<eos> When I left for Europe, I... I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore.
It's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric.<eos> And I'm here to help you.<eos> Help?<eos> What these people did to you is wrong.
Unlock the phone, Don. Hey!<eos> Inside the house, we only want the girl.<eos> Just send her out and then we're done.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
_<eos> _<eos> Ara, I need you to stay in here while I take care of something. - Okay?<eos> - Those people...<eos> I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you, I promise, but I need you to go in here and don't make a sound, not until I come get you.
Why are you telling me this right now?<eos> So that you would reconsider what I said last night about staying in the race.<eos> He never gives up. Never gives up.<eos> If you drop out, I will turn myself in to the authorities.<eos> I would have done it before if I had thought there was any way to keep you out of it.
There is very little that I remember from when I was young, but I remember this.<eos> You were older.<eos> You were beautiful.<eos> I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.
But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.<eos> It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?
If?<eos> A thousand Spanish fighters are more than three times our number could withstand.<eos> What can we do but retreat?<eos> We're not leaving.<eos> If it's Madi that concerns you, we could send someone out to find her.
I've found myself thinking about it.<eos> Of walking away from Nassau, from England, from civilization.<eos> One can be happy that way, can't they?<eos> A life of isolation and uncertainty as long as it is lived with someone you love...<eos> And who loves you back.
And your plan now is to follow that man into more of the same?<eos> !<eos> "What result?"<eos> That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!
Yesterday, he had nothing.<eos> He was shouting at the rain.<eos> Now you've given him all he needs to kill this war dead.<eos> My God.<eos> The number of times I have followed you blindly, backed you with the men blindly, put men in the fucking ground... good men, friends... because you said, "I know the way.
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.<eos> Chances are good you've seen the last of him.<eos> You killed a friend of mine.<eos> Her name was Charlotte... and you did it for reasons that had nothing to do with her.<eos> There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.
I couldn't tell then if it was... because she was afraid of you.<eos> Wouldn't have blamed her.<eos> Or if it was something else.<eos> But I respected her wishes.<eos> Obeyed when she said we'd protect you despite what you'd done.
You are the bravest person I have ever known.<eos> The truest person I have ever known.<eos> And I betrayed you and it sickens me.<eos> I am so sorry for working so hard to protect the wrong things.<eos> For failing to see that there is nothing important that does not include you.
We fight, only two outcomes I can see...<eos> I die or you die.<eos> Either way, he's gonna take me to blame for it.<eos> That's how far you've burrowed into his head.<eos> He won't put you out of it until he sees you for what you are.
Sent the men after them.<eos> Carrying that chest, they won't get far.<eos> Well, Flint doesn't need to get far.<eos> All he needs is to bury that gold somewhere unknown and he's won.<eos> How long did he give you?
Know the role it played in motivating me to do the things that I've done, the things I will do.<eos> It has made me transparent to you.<eos> Not only that, but when I told you this story, you insinuated yourself into it.<eos> The latest in a line of ill-fated partners, situating yourself such that... were you and I ever to come to blows...<eos> I'd be forced to hesitate before doing you any harm.
What is it?<eos> James said he saw him clutch for his chest.<eos> Then... he just dropped.<eos> Should we...?<eos> So, you asked him to recount for you what he knew days ago, yes?
A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.<eos> And right now it matters far less to you whether she lives or dies than it happens your way, on your terms.<eos> I think you know it's far more complicated than that.<eos> I'm certain she does.<eos> Even if you could kill me, even if that somehow helped you see her alive again, how are you going to explain it to her?
So now, we can say yes.<eos> Pass me that, please.<eos> Here.<eos> Take these, darling.<eos> I'm sure you'll fall in love again.
Quickly!<eos> Careful.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When they took you...
A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.<eos> But they're not hunting you.
Good.<eos> It is not every day you escape prison.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?
- One truth! - One truth!<eos> - Our truth! - Our truth!<eos> One truth!<eos> Our truth!<eos> I mean, the idea of polyphonic fiction reflecting both the intercontextuality of an author's work and their life really resonated with what is happening to you.
No, we should get out of here.<eos> The devil!<eos> She's the devil!<eos> ...toiletpapergetsstuck to your fucking shoe.<eos> You step on it with the other foot and then it sticks to your other foot and then it takes for-fucking-ever to get rid of it.
I've come to say goodbye.<eos> I thought I had value to them, but it seems that time has passed.<eos> What's happening?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> They're using me to send you a message.
- Yes, it's wonderful.<eos> The balance between spice and masala...<eos> Sanyam, you've totally outdone yourself.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - If you don't mind...
"The Hispanic coke dealer is about to give another kind of blow job when he finally gets the bullet he deserves."<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> This is it. This is how careers end.<eos> You either take the roles you hate or you sit at home - until you're completely forgotten.
But it's evidence.<eos> It's evidence, Hernando.<eos> It proves no one wants anything to do with me.<eos> Well, that is not true.<eos> Somebody wants you and here's the proof.
- It sounds so fun.<eos> Come on, Lito.<eos> You have to go.<eos> Maybe this is just what you need.<eos> To remember how many people are affected by what you did.
They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we've come across.<eos> But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.<eos> - What?<eos> - How afraid they are of people like you.<eos> Right now, all we can offer you is a little... invisibility.
It has to be because there is a lot more of us out there than we thought.<eos> - We need...<eos> - to find them.<eos> Vincent, this is Riley.<eos> We risked so much to get you free, Riley.
No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.<eos> Which is the part where I may need some courage.<eos> I've not felt so lucky since I met you.
I have to get to work.<eos> Last night was a dream come true.<eos> See you later.<eos> So they came to my house, they talked to me about it, and they left.<eos> Wait, you're telling me the DRP actually came to your door - and asked you to run on their ticket? - Yeah.
See you later.<eos> So they came to my house, they talked to me about it, and they left.<eos> Wait, you're telling me the DRP actually came to your door - and asked you to run on their ticket? - Yeah.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> And you haven't met with them again?
And you haven't met with them again?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought you would find the story funny.<eos> I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.<eos> He's a serious and very intelligent man.<eos> Why wouldn't you meet with him?
Sex... can be such a good trust-builder.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Hard To Get dot com.<eos> That is my domain.<eos> Give me a call when you get bored of you-know-who.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.<eos> But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.
So... big day tomorrow.<eos> Do you know what you're gonna say?<eos> What...<eos> Do you think I should say something?<eos> You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.
You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.<eos> Yes. Absolutely.<eos> But... you're so good when you speak from your heart.<eos> Baby, the interview you did at the premiere was incredible.<eos> I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.
Everything has been fine.<eos> That is such a relief.<eos> I told Tom I am so happy that you're gonna be there after what happened last year.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Even though I know Mom and Dad must be giving you hell for this.
I can't believe this is happening.<eos> I cannot believe I let you do this.
I heard that.<eos> And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.<eos> She knows.<eos> She didn't mean it literally.<eos> And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.<eos> All we can change is ourselves.<eos> I'm not sure I agree.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I can't help you.
- By any means necessary.<eos> - Mom!<eos> They exaggerate, honey.<eos> Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.<eos> Well, what can you do when this thing smiles at you?
Don't treat me like one.<eos> Everything I built in this world, I built for you.<eos> But if you force me, I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.<eos> I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.<eos> You're not allowed to be sanctimonious when you're living off a trust fund.
If they know I'm here, I don't think it will be because of Hoy.<eos> Someone's following me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Diego!<eos> God, you're a sight for sore eyes.
But I love Kenya, like your son does.<eos> My future is my country.<eos> Which is why I am so excited about him running for office.<eos> What?<eos> Mama, I've been meaning to tell you something.
Okay.<eos> All right, that's fine.<eos> Will you just answer me one question?<eos> What?<eos> How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
I will tell them I have to withdraw.<eos> You will do no such thing.<eos> All I ask is that you remember that you are all I have left of him.<eos> Father, I'm sorry.<eos> If you hadn't come to the prison... if you hadn't cared about me... maybe you would still be alive.
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.<eos> Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.<eos> This agency no longer represents you.
Where?<eos> - Oh!<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> So sorry.<eos> But you are gonna freak out, too.
When I watched those poor, innocent people killed...<eos> If it's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening... shouldn't we?<eos> Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?<eos> Whispers.<eos> She told me, the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists, or to take a handful of pills, or to jump from a height... that voice never shouts.
He could be a zombie.<eos> I believe that was the intention of our friend over there.<eos> I think you're the first cluster to get this close to Whispers.<eos> You continue to impress, Officer Gorski.<eos> Wait, if Whispers wanted you lobotomized, then who stopped the surgery?
Is Jonas still here?<eos> - No.<eos> The blockers kicked in.<eos> - Good.<eos> How did you remember that?
I lost my agent.<eos> I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.
Which, frankly, I am not sure I even want to know, but can any marriage really survive secret-keeping?<eos> Do you want to tell him everything in order to make him tell you everything?<eos> Or do you want to tell him because you're in love with someone else?<eos> Your thiamine is low and the lack of iron is affecting your adrenals, which is why you're craving the drugs.<eos> Heroin is not going help you figure out how to find Whispers.
You will be fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> So will you.<eos> Ah, look at you.<eos> When you get elected, I hope you don't forget about your friends.
Lito!<eos> Burt Lancaster had this... power.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> They all wanted to be her.<eos> Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you, too?
I care for Lila a great deal.<eos> She's not like other women.<eos> I love listening to men trying to express their feelings.<eos> I think you can understand that I have thought about marrying her.<eos> Was that before or after you came inside me?
Far enough.<eos> So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?<eos> So, tell me, did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics?<eos> Or you are Silas' bitch now?<eos> Why do you care?
Go with Martha.<eos> - You still have homework to do, huh?<eos> - See you later.<eos> See you.<eos> If you do become president, will you stop driving the Van Damn?
- I'm not leaving this room. - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> And I'm not judging, or trying to fix it, or tell you what to do.
And I'm not judging, or trying to fix it, or tell you what to do.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I love you.<eos> And that you aren't alone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lito, you have to get up, right now!
Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> He's never called me "daughter."<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
- I'm okay, Dad.<eos> - You're not okay!<eos> There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked up shit about you.<eos> - Dad, are you drinking?<eos> - What do you care?
There's never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Is this our life now?<eos> Is this our new normal?<eos> I can think of worse normals.<eos> Are you okay with it?
Though, when I think back, I don't remember being given a choice either... when this nerdy girl walked into City Lights... and this voice in my head was telling me, "Whatever you do..." do not let her go until you get her number."<eos> What?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> We all wake up and we have to take the same Terms and Conditions box:<eos> Everyday stuff will happen to you.
Yeah.<eos> I'm good, Mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Last year, when I heard about what you did, I had a feeling you were one of us.<eos> But then we heard that you were running for political office.
I was in Delhi.<eos> I have been cooperating with Agent Singh and the federal police on a complex investigation into political corruption.<eos> Ajay is a part of that investigation.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot tell you more because it will only put you at risk.
It's her.<eos> I warned you, Wolfgang.<eos> There are only two sides in this world:<eos> with me or against me.<eos> Imagine my surprise when I found out how badly the Cannibal wanted you.
Imagine my surprise when I found out how badly the Cannibal wanted you.<eos> Open!<eos> Move! Move! Move!<eos> Hello, Wolfgang.<eos> When they slice you up, I want the last face you think of to be mine.
I should promise you this and that in order to leash the rest of your cluster as quickly as possible, but we both know that would be a complete lie.<eos> We both know exactly what's going to happen.<eos> One by one, I'm going to hunt your cluster down.<eos> And no matter what you do, I will find Ms. Gunnarsdottir.<eos> And I will enjoy feeling you experience her death... inch by inch, piece by piece.
And what is that?<eos> Me.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You're here.<eos> No! I can't visit you.
You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.<eos> It's more physical.<eos> I never understood the word "presence" until we were together.<eos> And if you're wondering about the sex... no matter what I say, it won't be enough.
Hey, man, look at you.<eos> Van Damn!<eos> Mom?<eos> Oh, my son.<eos> If your father could see you now.
- Just like them?<eos> They do.<eos> - You'll be fine, son.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because your whole life, every really good day, and every truly bad one, has been preparing you for this moment.
No!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Please!<eos> Don't do this, please!<eos> We have to get you out of here!
He's got a knife!<eos> Will.<eos> Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.
No, I...<eos> I fucked up.<eos> And it won't happen again.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> He's not gonna hurt you.
You never have to say that to me.<eos> In many ways, this place made me.<eos> Sit.<eos> There's nowhere that the stark difference between winners and losers is more clear.<eos> I have called you here tonight to tell you how we are going to win.
And I knew he wasn't gonna cheat anyone else that day and would look over his shoulder thereafter.<eos> I had managed something better than payback.<eos> By acting with purpose and understatement, I had created a more just environment, which is what I am asking of all of you.<eos> This is the new way.<eos> Well, how do you know if he did the right thing after you left?
We are at an inflection point.<eos> We have to make big changes to the company. We have to make it quickly.<eos> And I am getting conflicting advice from my people.<eos> The kind of things that I bounce off you and it all makes sense.<eos> I know you well enough to tell you one thing. You'll figure it out.
It's you.<eos> And now you're leaving.<eos> I can't afford that.<eos> I'll die off.<eos> And that's before I blew lunch with you not being a vegan.
So how do I keep you?<eos> You kind of can't.<eos> Just look at him. The everyman grilling away.<eos> You know, he sent the chef away tonight because the two of you always do this together.<eos> And even though you've frozen him out the past few months, he's still counting on it.
That's a lesson you only have to learn once.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I need to deploy your specialized computing skills, can-do attitude, the magic of your tech nerdistry.<eos> No one's ever said I have a can-do attitude before.<eos> That's because you hide it behind a superior, dismissive, and pessimistic mask, but I see past all that.
You killed my father. You're the reason he died.<eos> Melissa...<eos> It's all right, Melissa. We understand.<eos> I hope you die and she becomes president.<eos> What did the girl say to you?
We are at war.<eos> And he is an enemy combatant.<eos> And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.<eos> So don't give me your pride or your position.<eos> Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
Not even joking.<eos> I'm not joking.<eos> She's pretty hot.<eos> I especially like her black lipstick.<eos> Good, it'll match the black eye I'm about to give you.
Oh, wow.<eos> Although I have my ways.<eos> Good night, Paul.<eos> You're actually kicking me out?<eos> Exactly what did Karen say to you?
- You boys be good now.<eos> - Oh, that's asking a lot, Stacey.<eos> I think you've had enough.<eos> All he ever does is eat, eat, eat.<eos> Howard, I have something I'd like to show you.
She probably told you that she never mentioned dawn black to me by name.<eos> And that she didn't know anything about the history of this house, or... Maggie black's tampering with the occult, or the incubus.<eos> As a matter of fact, that's exactly what she said.<eos> Now you're wondering how I knew all those things.<eos> Was there any truth to what that burnt up bitch told you this afternoon.
Paul.<eos> I bet you really want to know what's inside that black room in the basement, don't you?<eos> Paul, you're starting to scare me.<eos> Well then, come downstairs and see what I've been working on for the past two and half years.<eos> I don't understand what's gotten into you.
I'm doing you a favor, you know.<eos> I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.<eos> I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".<eos> Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard. FBI.<eos> Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.
I'm just barely open.<eos> _<eos> Sorry, I was hoping for some music.<eos> God, I haven't seen you in an age.<eos> What brings you back to the west?
I don't know.<eos> Where are we gonna find a lemon?<eos> Come on.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> When life gives you lemons...
Well, you got me.<eos> I used to be a fireman.<eos> I'm trained in emergency medicine.<eos> No, I need a surgeon, not a fucking fire-tranny.<eos> Hey, I don't care if you bleed out.
You wanna move it to the side for me, cowboy?<eos> It's in my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm super mad at you.<eos> Is this because I wouldn't let you use my apricot facial scrub?
Sounds good to you?<eos> Best plan ever.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> You know, you could probably leave your boxes packed.<eos> Easier to clear out when MCC calls and fires you.
And I don't wanna hear no talking between you.<eos> You got that?<eos> Huh? You got it?<eos> Daya, look.<eos> You can't let these guards see you like this.
She's gonna be someone's bitch so fast.<eos> Maybe we should help her.<eos> What?<eos> What happened to staying out of trouble and laying low?<eos> You have, what, three months left?
Can you get OCD, sorry - CDC, out of my face? I got a big operation.<eos> I need to concentrate.<eos> - I just wanted...<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> I love you too.
Okay.<eos> There! - There.<eos> - I see it.<eos> Here we go. This is fun.<eos> Rory, you have to move, it's gonna hit you. - That's bad.
- Who's going in?<eos> Waiting for fucking what?<eos> Don't do this!<eos> I don't give a shit about your fucking quarantine!<eos> Who gave you this jurisdiction?
Okay?<eos> There you go.<eos> Good, good good.<eos> Do not worry about Calvin.<eos> We are gonna get you inside and get it off.
You're practically the Alpha now.<eos> I'm nothing without her.<eos> Liam, can you help me with this, please?<eos> Hayden left me.<eos> She moved, to protect her sister. And it's not like she dumped you or anything.
Maybe, uh, I should lower this a notch or two.<eos> Latin?<eos> You wanna take Latin?<eos> I like Latin.<eos> Liam, who told you to take Latin?
Wait, that's a...<eos> Run!<eos> Wait, I'm not leaving you!<eos> No, he's a Hellhound!<eos> If the Wild Hunt couldn't keep you, nothing can.
I'm at the freaking FBI.<eos> It's real. I'm really here.<eos> Uh, I kind of told Lydia that I miss her and I can't wait to get home, but...<eos> Listen, Scott, whatever you're doing right now, just make sure you're still getting out of Beacon Hills.<eos> I mean, maybe you think you can't leave, you know, like, the whole thing falls apart if you're not there.
You have got to be kidding me.<eos> I know, those horses were so rude.<eos> I guess they're a tad literal. Yeah. I'd call needing to see an actual crown on my head as pretty goddamn literal.<eos> Look, it's not just about the carriage.<eos> They're not gonna let us into Whitespire until you've been crowned High King, so...
I mean that in the best possible sense.<eos> Everyone clap.<eos> I have known what you truly are since the day we met.<eos> Long may you reign.<eos> I feel it's incumbent upon me to promise never again to betray you like I did.
Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, everything okay?<eos> I'm going back to the Torrent.<eos> You think that guy did something to you 'cause you were a raging douche?
So how do you feel now?<eos> We're not getting back together.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been wondering something.<eos> Why didn't Reynard kill you with your friends?
What, you mean like my soul?<eos> Part of it, yes, the slimmest part, but it holds specific power.<eos> It's called a Shade.<eos> Shade.<eos> It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.
I'm really sorry for last night, Su.<eos> I didn't talk to you not because I didn't know what to say<eos> but because for the first time I felt weak.<eos> I was angry with myself.<eos> So much, that I forgot to console you.
But he just goes away. Like he was never there.<eos> It's all right.<eos> When you least expect it... Out of the blue... There he is.<eos> None of this is just you.<eos> Not your fault you couldn't remember.
It is dark but...<eos> - Mamma?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Where are we?<eos> You don't remember? No.
♪ There once was a mermaid, ♪ ♪ who lived by the pond, ♪<eos> ♪ who was very beautiful, ♪ ♪ and very blond. ♪<eos> Teena McGuire.<eos> Hey, it is Marvin Fick, remember me?<eos> Of course you do.
Can you please wait?<eos> I need your help.<eos> NFPD! Get down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> You can't come in here like...
You and your whore mamma better shut your faces. You hear me?<eos> This is just about summoning them to trial.<eos> All you have to do is identify them.<eos> You're gonna keep your eyes on me. and don't look at anyone else.<eos> Until you ask me, who?
You have a child.<eos> You have a daughter.<eos> We both know what it's like to lose someone we love.<eos> Don't let her lose her mother too. Don't let her feel any more pain.<eos> Why do you care?
I will check with her.<eos> [EXCUSE ME? ] [HEY]<eos> Listen to me now, before the boat house, before they raped your mum,<eos> I was gone.<eos> That's what you say in Court. Don't forget it. Hey!
Bethie!<eos> Hello? Fritz Haaber?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> It is you.<eos> I don't know if you remember me, Lou Ellen Drought?
What are you talking about?<eos> You took my phone from the wine bar, remember?<eos> I remember your shirt, your pants, and how do you say... "haircut"?<eos> No, I didn't take your phone.<eos> How dare you accuse me of this?
You're going in!<eos> Will!<eos> I guess that resignation will have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Where are they taking you?
- That's funny.<eos> - Yeah, funny. You're forgetting about the part where you almost got me and my son killed.<eos> Dylan. Norma's kid.<eos> Your kid.<eos> Don't you dare talk about her like that, or I will kill you.
- Maybe a varnish?<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> You've just seen each other!<eos> I'm so happy to have your semen inside me.<eos> It's like you hadn't left.
- How was yesterday with the faculty?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Did you have Civil Law with Vazquez?<eos> No, his assistant came.<eos> Is there any concept you find particularly difficult?
Did you have Civil Law with Vazquez?<eos> No, his assistant came.<eos> Is there any concept you find particularly difficult?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Remember to say hello to Vazquez when you see him.
You're doing very well.<eos> I agree with everything.<eos> Laura?<eos> Marta?<eos> The teacher was worried. He sent me to check on you.
Yes, it is.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't keep thinking about it.<eos> Some of us are meeting at my house on Saturday.<eos> I'll send you the address if you feel like coming.
Don't be silly.<eos> If you haven't screwed a 40-year-old, you haven't screwed.<eos> Your turn, Lola.<eos> What will I tell you?<eos> Tell us about the first time you came.
I was with Marta, from school, and two other girls.<eos> You want to live your life?<eos> Then you can pay for it.<eos> Tomorrow you start looking for a weekend job.<eos> Is that what you care about?
But you've got a lot of talent.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What qualifies you to say I have talent?<eos> You could pass the tests.<eos> What do you get from working on watches?
Carlos, sit down.<eos> Your mother and I want to talk to you.<eos> Vazquez called.<eos> We know you haven't been in class for two weeks.<eos> Did we put any pressure on you to study law?
Don't feel guilty.<eos> Come on!<eos> Tell Alex what you like.<eos> Explain in detail.<eos> Tell him how you want him to undress you, to suck your tits, - how to eat your...
- I'll see you later.<eos> Laura!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> - No, but if I were him, I wouldn't leave you on your own.
- You know him?<eos> - Of course.<eos> They say he was killed falling off a horse, but I think it was suicide.<eos> My turn.<eos> There's a room full of paintings with people who seem to look at you as if you'd killed someone.
A bit dizzy.<eos> We'll talk tomorrow.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> I've been thinking and it's best if you go out with that guy.
We love each other.<eos> There she is.<eos> If she wants to go away with you for a few days, I don't mind.<eos> You're late.<eos> We agreed I'd call you.
Don't do it, please.<eos> Let's go to the place with the palm trees.<eos> We could go tomorrow morning.<eos> Don't wait for me tomorrow.<eos> I won't phone you, and I won't answer my phone.
Laura!<eos> - Move!<eos> - Motherfuckers!<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> - Kid, you've better get out of here.
I know you don't want to see me but... I needed to say goodbye properly.<eos> I'm going to the village.<eos> My mother is separated.<eos> I wanted you to know that you're the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> And that I'm very sorry that I hurt you.
Know what?<eos> My sister was born.<eos> When I held her I thought she was our daughter.<eos> I love you.<eos> I think I'll always love you.
Did you come?<eos> No one has given me as much pleasure as you.<eos> You haven't answered me.<eos> Look.<eos> I did this so you'll never forget our story.
- Sorry.<eos> I probably should have called.<eos> Your mom gave me your new address.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I only wanted you to have these.
You knew that.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And you deserve better.<eos> Is everything all right, Bryan?<eos> I need to show you something.
I got this.<eos> You know what, Captain Debater?<eos> Let's debate this.<eos> But we're not doing a regular debate.<eos> It's gotta be that thing I saw you do where we argue the opposite side to better understand each other.
A quinces is just about the village celebrating that you're a woman, which I know you know 'cause you're the smartest one in the family!<eos> Oh, I got better moves than that, right?<eos> But village isn't literal.<eos> It just means your family and your friends.<eos> So, what's so bad about this modern village coming together to celebrate you?
Seriously!<eos> Your argument is that my adulthood has to be approved by your friends?<eos> Pass!<eos> Well, I'm not gonna clap for that.<eos> So you want to crush my heart into pieces... after I worked so hard to give you an opportunity in this land of the free and home of the brave?
Jesus and Santa were cousins.<eos> Everybody knows this.<eos> So, when it comes to your quinces...<eos> I'm pleading with you.<eos> Can't you do this one thing for your mother who loves you?
No, this ends now.<eos> It's like you're stealing.<eos> Exactly!<eos> It's like I'm stealing.<eos> No, you're not charming your way out of this.
Enough.<eos> Yes, you keep that up, and you will not have a quinces.<eos> Wait...<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> You know how hard I bust my ass, by myself, to send you to that school so that you can have more opportunities than I did.
He's being a good provider.<eos> There are jobs here where they don't shoot at you.<eos> We live in America, name one!<eos> It's not just the job, and you know that!<eos> - It's not like he cheated on you.
Or, I noticed you bought a pair for under 40 bucks, which means you did the right thing before you did the many, many wrong things.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, thank you!<eos> I was trying to be brave, but even the nuns would've made fun of me.<eos> Listen, you don't have to worry about being the man of the house.
I don't wanna walk into a meeting smelling like this.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe, um...<eos> Maybe I'll go get some coffees... just to let you have your space.
I don't wanna talk about pinworms.<eos> I wanna play TableTopics.<eos> Come on, enough about the worms!<eos> Who's thirsty?<eos> So, what else keeps you up at night?
I'll just go.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Damn.<eos> Okay, I'll go now.<eos> "What body part are you most attracted to?"
You're fucking cheating, I swear to God.<eos> Still didn't get me down yet!<eos> I am not a sissy!<eos> You like it rough, big boy?<eos> I was born to replace you!
And wait for somebody to try to kill me again?<eos> I think I'm better off on the move.<eos> I can't leave the Resistance.<eos> The Resistance is full of shit.<eos> I don't know how they got you in the first place.
Motherfucking cheap ass, terrorist ass...<eos> Killing your own people ass, goddamn.<eos> I don't like you.<eos> Yeah, I know, all right.<eos> Well, you don't deserve it, but by St. James Dean, the light of Ziggy Stardust and the darkness of the Holy Womb, you have one last chance to repent your agnostic taint before you...
What are you doing?<eos> Neither of us knows what's waiting over that finishing line.<eos> Well, it's definitely a violent death, but we're not stopping now.<eos> This race is fixed and so was your Resistance.<eos> I don't want to see you get hurt, Annie.
I have to agree.<eos> Not sure I buy it either.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> What were you expecting?<eos> They'd send someone to spring you?
Tell Mom bye.<eos> Tell her I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm gonna...<eos> - You're gonna what?<eos> Your mother can't lose you too, son.
Tourists heading home.<eos> Moving in.<eos> Mills is in the house, moving around back.<eos> Wait out.<eos> I'll tell you this: Dude's got some skills.
No, Zack, what you did... it was genius...<eos> it worked. I have feeling again in my legs.<eos> Hodgins, you should not be thanking me.<eos> Why not?<eos> Is it because you feel guilt for other things that you've done?
The truth is you only have a slim chance, less than one percent, that you will regain mobility.<eos> So you don't think that it's gonna work?<eos> I have been told, although it has not been proven scientifically, that hope can sometimes have the power to heal.<eos> Hope is what I was trying to give you.<eos> But my fear is... all I've brought you is pain.
Come on, Booth.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah, what is it?<eos> Karen has an idea that she'd like to run by you.
You willing to prove that?<eos> Hey, how's it going in there?<eos> Slowly.<eos> Were you able to find any more medio-cam images?<eos> Um.... no more than I already gave you.
Also, uh, everybody look out for tripwires.<eos> This guy knows explosives.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
- That would be huge.<eos> Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> So great that you guys got that... - Yep. Yep.<eos> - done.<eos> I got to tell you that I love seeing women work out a problem like that.
I don't know why.<eos> Christ.<eos> Nice boxers, dude.<eos> Yeah, they're not mine.<eos> Doesn't bother you that there's another guy's boxers in here?
Christ.<eos> Nice boxers, dude.<eos> Yeah, they're not mine.<eos> Doesn't bother you that there's another guy's boxers in here?<eos> So, um, I didn't tell you but... Lilly and I have an arrangement.
- I thought I had inside information.<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I just want everybody to be safe.<eos> You can't steal his car.<eos> Is that what he told you?
This Women's Realm pamphlet's been quite an education.<eos> - Brandy Alexander, Patsy?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> An evening of ulcer-dressing and haemorrhoid compression on the district rounds rather spoilt my appetite.<eos> And if you wouldn't mind getting off my bed... .. I'd quite like a lie-down.
Even this one.<eos> What, apologetic Pats?<eos> Apologetic Pats and I do have what you might call a glancing acquaintance.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> For being brusque and not telling you why.
You gotta do it big and loud and stupid!<eos> - Bertie?<eos> - Okay, yes.<eos> It gets that mushroom blood straight to the brain.<eos> I'm gonna kill you if you don't get up now.
Coyote, and then Gus said I should go in.<eos> Oh, no, we all said you definitely shouldn't go in.<eos> I'm so sleepy.<eos> Please, just let me sleepy.<eos> Otherwise... I might have to kill you.
That can't be true.<eos> He... We have multiple witnesses who said that they saw Ian programming the robot that day.<eos> AMI's not capable of lying.<eos> Her A.I.'s not that sophisticated.<eos> Okay, AMI, you don't remember anything?
My lips are sealed.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I'm your dad, Tempe.<eos> C-Can't you give me a hint?<eos> Nepotism will get you nowhere.
Oh, come on.<eos> I'm your dad, Tempe.<eos> C-Can't you give me a hint?<eos> Nepotism will get you nowhere.<eos> Since when do you care about dancing?
Anytime I needed anything, anything, Aldo was always there for me.<eos> I'm sure that goes for the other men in your unit, too.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He took on all their troubles.<eos> It could be he didn't want you getting pulled in, too.
Why'd you fire him? He was stealing from the tip jar.<eos> You fought with him. His facial bones were broken.<eos> There's extensive fracturing to the ribs.<eos> You hit him so hard your hand was broken.<eos> Who told you about that?
You look good, son.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I'll make this easy on you.<eos> Why don't you turn around, put your hands behind your back?
Okay.<eos> But, wait, isn't it illegal to even own a sawed-off shotgun?<eos> So we're not looking for someone with a gun used to hunt.<eos> No, we're looking for somebody with a gun used to commit a crime.<eos> Aubrey, didn't they tell you there's cake in the break room?
This was a mistake, James.<eos> Oh, and one more thing.<eos> Don't ever take credit for how I turned out.<eos> Okay?<eos> Any good in me was despite having you as a father.
You've not only read my novels, but you were once a devoted fan of them.<eos> You're gonna tell Angela and Hodgins about this, aren't you?<eos> That would be needlessly cruel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think it's enough for us to know that despite your apathetic affectations, there are things in this world that bring you joy.
A little.<eos> Only because you're so professional.<eos> I mean, if you weren't, I would kiss you right now.<eos> I might even grab your butt.<eos> Don't you dare.
Why did both of you come here to give me this information?<eos> We wanted to see how you were.<eos> Not well.<eos> I find it difficult being separated from my children.<eos> Well, no one would blame you for being with them.
Let's go.<eos> Tempe.<eos> How you feeling, Dad?<eos> Thirsty.<eos> That's from the laryngeal airway tube that was used to intubate you.
As we all know, skulls don't float, so...<eos> Angie, here, techs found this for you at the scene.<eos> What?<eos> I'm having too much fun.<eos> I hope you're still having fun when you're in hell.
You don't want to do that.<eos> You got a dent in your car.<eos> More bad news, you're under arrest, pal.<eos> Why don't you take a seat?<eos> I need to ask you a few questions.
Um, sorry, I'm trying to decide what to write my dissertation about.<eos> I recommend you choose wisely, as it will be one of the most important decisions of your professional career.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As if I wasn't already stressing enough.<eos> What is it that excites you about the field of anthropology?
Oh, come on, Chad.<eos> Come on.<eos> Roar!<eos> Hey, hey, what happened back there?<eos> I mean, what's the point of having me in your ear if you're not gonna listen to me?
- Thank you.<eos> So does that mean I'm gonna get more ASA experience?<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But it does mean that you're gonna become a full-fledged Supervisory Special Agent.
It doesn't matter.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Aubrey!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How you feeling this morning?
This doesn't make any sense.<eos> I don't know why Hodgins insisted I come with you.<eos> I should be with the remains. What?<eos> Trail go cold?<eos> I, uh... I want you to move to L.A. with me.
Hopefully not for long.<eos> But I promise, okay?<eos> We're gonna keep you safe.<eos> James Aubrey.<eos> You look about ten years older than the last time I saw you.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, Ange?<eos> Keep yourself safe, huh?<eos> Hey, sorry to interrupt you guys.<eos> What? Booth, Avalon is here to see you.
That's the only thing you can do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Told you. You came to the right woman.<eos> Okay, looks like this is done. So I'll call you the second that Kovac makes-- makes contact.<eos> Ooh, looks like Hodgins got you, too, huh?
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt, but I just got a location for Kovac's phone.<eos> It's in a moving car near Arlington headed south.<eos> The FBI already dispatched a SWAT unit.<eos> You have to go, Booth.<eos> I know you're worried for my safety, but the best thing you can do is catch him.
Previously on "Scandal"...<eos> You are gonna make me President of the United States.<eos> I've already lost a daughter to hell if I will let what happened to you happen to my son.
Man, these guys are persistent.<eos> So am I. I'll meet you at the wall.<eos> Sounds like a challenge.<eos> Think you can keep up?<eos> Oh, it's not me you have to worry about.
Everything for my little girl's coronation weekend must be absolutely perfect.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> ♪ And now that at last you are here in my arms ♪<eos> ♪ I won't permit you to fall ♪<eos> ♪ I must protect you ♪
Now, as princess, you are not only representing yourself and the family, but all of Corona.<eos> Don't worry, Dad.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> But while we're on the whole princess, coronation thingy, I mean, all these royal activities are great, but do you think I might be able to catch a little downtime soon?<eos> I know this is all new, but you'll adjust.
That didn't go quite as I had hoped.<eos> We'll discuss that later, son, much later.<eos> Right, we both have bigger fish to fry.<eos> That was so fun!<eos> I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we're supposed to be sneaking out.
You have your own owl.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Owl.<eos> Max!<eos> Yeah, when he heard I was sneaking you out of here he insisted he come along.
♪ And everything life ought to be ♪<eos> ♪ Well, I know that it's waiting for me out there ♪<eos> ♪ And I'll find it, I swear ♪<eos> ♪ With the wind in my hair ♪<eos> Just remember, no one can ever know I took you outside the walls of Corona.
Wouldn't wanna expose you to that.<eos> That's ah, very thoughtful of you.<eos> Um, Dad and I want you to join us on the terrace for breakfast.<eos> Um, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff I have to do to get ready.<eos> Rapunzel, well, your father has something very important to share with you.
But you know better than anyone else what a dangerous and evil place the world can be.<eos> And the barrier keeping us safe from that is sometimes more fragile than it appears.<eos> When that evil rears its ugly head it is my job to protect Corona from it.<eos> And one day, that will be your responsibility.<eos> And I must teach you how to carry it.
Oh, don't you start.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Oh, hi Mom.<eos> You left so quickly after breakfast I...<eos> I didn't have a chance to give this to you.
I'm more than okay, I...<eos> Rapunzel...<eos> There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I love you.<eos> The night you were taken, a part of me died, the best part of me.
Rapunzel...<eos> There's something I need to tell you.<eos> I love you.<eos> The night you were taken, a part of me died, the best part of me.<eos> For 18 long and agonizing years I swore that if somehow, someway, by some miracle the fates decided to show mercy and return you to me, I would never let anything happen to you again.
I love you.<eos> The night you were taken, a part of me died, the best part of me.<eos> For 18 long and agonizing years I swore that if somehow, someway, by some miracle the fates decided to show mercy and return you to me, I would never let anything happen to you again.<eos> And now that this has returned, the very reason you were snatched away from me in the first place, I'm afraid I'm left with no choice, sweetheart.<eos> As of tonight, I'm forced to exercise my martial right as king to forbid you from leaving the walls of this kingdom without my consent.
I believe somebody ordered room service?<eos> Eugene, how did you know?<eos> Ah, I had a feeling.<eos> Look, I just wanted to clear some stuff up.<eos> I haven't had a chance to apologize for putting you on the spot with that proposal.
Don't say it.<eos> Eichen House.<eos> The card readers on the doors?<eos> It's the Closed Unit.<eos> You're not going back to Eichen, and you're definitely not going anywhere near the Closed Unit.
The card readers on the doors?<eos> It's the Closed Unit.<eos> You're not going back to Eichen, and you're definitely not going anywhere near the Closed Unit.<eos> What if there's a connection to the... dead Hellhound?<eos> What if you go there again and someone tries to kill you?
Yeah.<eos> I get it,<eos> I freaked out.<eos> - Which freaked you out.<eos> - So you admit that you freaked out?
So, that's it.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.
Okay.<eos> Thanks again for coming, everyone.<eos> It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?
Listen to me, woman.<eos> I need you to do as I tell you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I need to get you and the boy away from here.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I can.
I'm going in, Sam.<eos> I decided we should use blanks.<eos> No one needs to get hurt by accident.<eos> Well, it's just us now, kids.<eos> Fellas, it's been a real hell of a time planning a heist with you.
Neil's not talkin' either.<eos> So, then I went back to this.<eos> I'm back to needing a straight answer from one of you two.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me bottom-line this for you.
- What?<eos> As a matter of fact, I love country music.<eos> And I don't...<eos> I don't miss my dad that much<eos> I mean coming to the mine with him was all I had. But.. coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
You will humbly walk amongst your peers. But heroes you all will be.<eos> Attention..<eos> Attention in detention!<eos> Each of your names will be etched alongside the great rangers teams before you.<eos> I will always owe a debt of gratitude to you all.
If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.<eos> These drip feeds will keep the drug in your blood streams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.<eos> I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be... corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now.
Fifty thousand dollars, past due.<eos> It'd be real smart for Mr. Jones to have that on him tomorrow when we call his office.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Don't you dare go to his office.<eos> I'll talk to you myself.
Are you fed up with crime?<eos> - Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.<eos> - Yeah, we're sick of it.<eos> Then let's talk about real improvements that will end the cycle of crime.<eos> I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.
Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know... I wish I'd never come to China with you.
Where are you taking him?<eos> Colleen, what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.
That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.<eos> Once we're out of the hole, hit the charge, get out.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I am going down with you.
- We're not gonna leave you here.<eos> You made a promise to get him back.<eos> You better keep your word.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> I'm right behind you.
We can cure any disease and we can end hunger, and...<eos> Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information, we can finally realize our potential.<eos> This is a special Dream Friday.<eos> I thought I'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech but an interview.<eos> I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you.
There you go.<eos> Um... Uh, I hope the engineers are watching, because that definitely shouldn't have happened and, um, it definitely won't happen again.<eos> You can trust me there.<eos> This is me brushing my teeth.<eos> If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.
Oh! Awkward contact. No touchy.<eos> Great.<eos> Bugs.<eos> Welcome, strangers.<eos> May the light be with you.
Look at me. These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India - and they will free you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You must go with them now.<eos> I will be with you when you're inside and you will know it.
I've got a shot to make.<eos> So make it.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is George Chichester.<eos> And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.
I have a little dog.<eos> I have a house.<eos> I have my life back again.<eos> How can I ever thank you?<eos> I hope you realize what a special person You having dining with you.
Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll come with you.
What did he do?<eos> Set a course for Nassau... to send a message when we return... that this can all end... if the governor turns over the one thing he wants.<eos> When I made the choice to see Charles' sentence carried out, I did not know what the consequences would be.<eos> I knew it was the only way to protect our future here, to protect you, so I did it.<eos> And when the backlash followed, the resentment over my relationship with you, which I knew could only be soothed by my pretending to have no influence at all, I did that, too.
We fight, we win.<eos> We don't fight, we win.<eos> You die out either way.<eos> You are the passenger pigeons and thylacines.<eos> Nobody cares about you.
Are you with Bryce?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We're hanging out at his place.<eos> Tell him to get over here!<eos> Who else is there? Is anyone else there with you?
The city, we leave in your hands. It's ours, it must remain ours.<eos> I will ensure it.<eos> You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.<eos> No, Lord.<eos> You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.
Again, please.<eos> Reload.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord, but she demanded that I relay what follows... her words precisely... in spite of any protest you offered.<eos> She says she knows that you will be angry and that this will be hard for you to understand but she said...<eos> She said you should trust that her commitment to you remains inviolable... and that this is no betrayal... but an act of love.
You'll have plenty of time to murder her another day.<eos> Right now, you need to rest.<eos> You asked to see me, my Lord?<eos> I cannot imagine what sort of horror this is for you.<eos> Please know, to whatever extent there could be any doubt, that the choices she made in recent days were made out of concern for you and out of love...
I've been meaning to talk with you.
Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.<eos> She's counting on you.
- No, no, you don't. You take us straight to the address right now!<eos> I-I get cigarettes.<eos> Linc, this is a setup.<eos> We're gonna grab your bag now.<eos> May peace be upon you, guys.
This is not helping us.<eos> You're gonna make a phone call so you can hold up your end of the deal.<eos> There's an auto body shop off Nashwan plaza.<eos> I want vehicles there, full tanks of gas so we can get to the border, all of us.<eos> I'm not going with you to the border.
So do something he's not expecting.<eos> Split up.<eos> No, that's...<eos> What about you?<eos> If I don't have to worry about the two of you, then I can put my focus towards finding the others.
This is quite advanced.<eos> And beyond our skills, ser.<eos> Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.<eos> As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.<eos> How you choose to spend that time is up to you.
Do I have your support?<eos> You have mine.<eos> Dorne is with you, Your Grace.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
This is exciting.<eos> It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.<eos> I'm happy to have you.<eos> What do you want with Supergirl?<eos> Same thing that I want with both of you.
Love, Supergirl.<eos> Love is about... letting yourself be saved.<eos> It's not just about saving other people.<eos> Even if you are superheroes.<eos> Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like, mess with you a little bit.
No... oh, this morning?<eos> Oh, yeah. No, I remember you now.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> H.R.<eos> Wait, what is it with you people?
I can... I can feel it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> ♪ I kissed her and she kissed me... ♪ Wow, the venue is amazing.<eos> I can't wait to see Inferno light up this space.<eos> Now, there is one thing I'd like to share with both of you.
I take my highly trained soldiers, track your ass down, and you get hurt.<eos> A lot. You can't run forever.<eos> You're trapped out here.<eos> Well, what we have here is a failure to communicate.<eos> 'Cause we're not trapped out here with you.
Why I'm here, for instance.<eos> You're here to recruit us.<eos> You already got Mary playing your game.<eos> You want me. And Sam.<eos> Well, I don't, but the old lads have taken quite a shine to you.
But we promised we'd find another way, and we did.<eos> We found a better way.<eos> This can work. I'm going with Castiel.<eos> No, Kelly, if you go with Cass, you die.<eos> Your baby dies. I go with you, you take away the thing that makes him special.
I know... I've been distant.<eos> Cold, even.<eos> Leaving you, working with them...<eos> I was trying to make things right.<eos> Just from a distance, because... Being here with you was too hard.
Just 'cause he's an arsehole doesn't mean he's a rapist.<eos> No, but these are a match to the condom wrapper found at Axehampton.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How's he off for blue fishing twine, Miller?<eos> Beth Latimer's downstairs saying she needs an urgent word with you.
I did.<eos> The king... should be at the centre... surrounded by his enemies.<eos> I am sending Uhtred to Eoferwic to aid Guthred against the brothers who would take the city for themselves.<eos> I want you to go with him.<eos> Stea pa shall accompany you.
No, we go in as agreed, together.<eos> We cannot risk the both of us being killed.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.<eos> If it is for Alfred... I will go with you. And me!
- Neither am I.<eos> So let's not dishonor that profession, which takes eight years of intense training, by thinking we can give medical opinions, okay?<eos> Fine, then let's just stick to facts.<eos> The homeowners came by, they didn't like what they saw.<eos> So they don't want to work with you anymore.
I really love reptiles.<eos> Baudelaires?<eos> - Is that you, Dr. Montgomery?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!
I'm calling to confirm an appointment for Charles McGill.<eos> Yes, it's 215 San Cristobal Road...<eos> McGill, with an "M."<eos> A door? Oh.<eos> Okay. I thought it was you guys.
Pop... Jughead hasn't been by, has he? Nope.<eos> You're not the only one who's come looking for him.<eos> Betty...<eos> - Thank goodness. - We were gonna call you.<eos> I'm not talking to you, either of you, ever again.
Try not to panic.<eos> Slow, deep breaths.<eos> Arthur Pilbury and George Marsh -- they're still in there.<eos> Oh, Lord, no.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.<eos> Look, the fire's only just out.<eos> The bloody wiring must've caused this.<eos> It'll still be dangerous.<eos> I'm coming with you.
- 15.<eos> - 15?<eos> !<eos> Apiece.<eos> I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
- And you're a lot shorter.<eos> I grew up on stories about them.<eos> All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.<eos> Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.<eos> Let me come with you.
Just keep yourselves, and particularly, Helena the blonde under wraps for now.<eos> He's right.<eos> Think of our babies.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll talk to you guys soon. Okay?
What did you guys do with the books?<eos> I wanna find out as much as I can about Zerstoerer.<eos> In the cellar, we left them out and open.<eos> We were kind of in a hurry to get here.<eos> Rosalee and I will go with you.
But I did nothing for them.<eos> Nick.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Who?<eos> The other Grimms fighting with you.
Just the type of guys you want buying heavy artillery.<eos> And here comes the sexy.<eos> Wait for them to make the exchange, and then swoop in and ruin their weekend.<eos> Bienvenidas.<eos> Looking forward to doing business with you.
It's nothing, it's just, in the time I did six, most of them did nine or ten.<eos> Guess I am.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> But I was telling Nathan the truth.<eos> I'm not looking to come back here with these guys instead of working with you.
I did not have a class last period.<eos> Your turn. Sweetie, we are not going to lie to you anymore. But being honest does not mean that we are going to involve you in something where I may or may not look like The Edge.<eos> Do you have any thoughts on this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take it off. And take me with you.
When the reverend went back to his desk, she could have leaned out and stabbed him then.<eos> But I only went to him when I saw the blood on the floor.<eos> All right, thank you all very much indeed.<eos> I think we'll leave it there for now.<eos> And we'll try not to bother you again, but if you could just make sure the officer here has details of where you can be contacted on the off-chance that we might have to speak to you again.
Well, apparently not anymore.<eos> "Six grandfathers" is the Sioux word for a mountain in the Black Hills more commonly known as Mount Rushmore.<eos> Jenkins, we need to get there before DOSA does.<eos> - Set a door.<eos> - I can't go with you.
I saw Eddie Phillips at the squat.<eos> I watched him die in front of me.<eos> Go on.<eos> I walked in on them having an argument.<eos> Terry was pissed off that Eddie spoke to you lot.
The knob could shatter into a million pieces and hit your eyes!<eos> Lake Lachrymose.<eos> I know every island in its waters and every cave along its shores.<eos> But now I can only stand to look at it from far away.<eos> That's why I couldn't meet you on the docks.
Cadmus...<eos> Changed me, they tried to break me.<eos> But in the process, they made me dangerous.<eos> I know their weaknesses, and I'm here...<eos> To work with all of you to make our planet safer.
That's lovely.<eos> Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.<eos> You know what was us?<eos> You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?
We're ready to go. Aren't you coming?<eos> You need to go to the bayou without me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Take Hope.<eos> - I'll be right behind you.
What happened to your friend, huh? The one that looks like Sloth from Goonies?<eos> No, I hate sloths!<eos> They only urinate and defecate once a week, and they have to do it in the same place every time.<eos> Huge Darwinian disadvantage.<eos> Oh, please. I could go with you.
Okay.<eos> If you just listen to me, I promise you, I promise you, I will tell you the truth, okay?<eos> Okay, it's...<eos> Whoa!<eos> Jesus, come on! What is wrong with you?
If you say no to this now, it will all be for nothing.<eos> Not to mention, you are gonna piss off a lot of people.<eos> The women in here... and the guys out here.<eos> And their weaponry is a hell of a lot more punishing than anything a CO wears on his belt.<eos> What you see out there... is a shit ton of people who are also angry at you.
Well, the truth is, most of my professors thought I would not grow up to accomplish much of anything.<eos> I have not been the best of Jews.<eos> Before today, I had not set foot in a synagogue in years.<eos> But now, I've come to believe a university that celebrates our heritage is essential to the future of our youth.<eos> Today, I am here with you to celebrate our Jewish heritage as special and of value.
Anyway...<eos> There's our little king.<eos> So how have you been since, um...<eos> Uh, I'm managing.<eos> Um, how are things with you guys?
So, I've been meaning to ask you.<eos> Finding your grandma's been hard, huh?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> A lot of records were lost in the war.<eos> So, I'm thinking, after all this, I may just go back with you guys.
What made you decide?<eos> I seen more women arriving.<eos> I'm going to... buy myself a wife.<eos> To come over on the next ship.<eos> Is Henry staying with you now out at the plantation?
- Catch anything?<eos> - No! Not yet.<eos> But, hey, I'm hopeful.<eos> Look, we don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you shouldn't have brought them with you.
We won't get kicked out?<eos> No, Lola's bark is worse than her bite.<eos> Relax.<eos> When she goes to sleep, you can go home.<eos> Girls... could I stay here with you?
I went to the part of Mercia that Alfred gifted to the Danes, yes.<eos> You happened to wander across Watling Street?<eos> I was sent for!<eos> I was invited!<eos> And the same will happen to you!
Will you fetch him, Finan?<eos> We'll be waiting in the hall.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> The man must have a priest for each day of the year.<eos> God be with you.
- I am sharing your joy!<eos> There is no joy!<eos> I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.<eos> Thyra will not go to Ragnar.<eos> She is happy here in Winchester with you.
The Ealdormen of the Witan, are saying.<eos> Lord of Mercia, perhaps.<eos> Alfred would never allow another Saxon to be called King.<eos> Nor would a certain dead man called Bjorn.<eos> - He wishes to meet you.
Visionary words, written by a wise man centuries ago.<eos> Fire is pure and true, unlike certain humans who amass power only to grow corrupt and weak.<eos> The badlands are now led by people such as this!<eos> I know because I was one.<eos> But I give thanks to the fire that consumed my false empire, and brought me underground here with you.
Visitation starts in 20 minutes.<eos> - what'd he do with it?<eos> What did he do with it?<eos> - Hey, sexy.<eos> Tell me about the day David came to live with you.
Why would Captain Sham do something terrible to his closest friend?<eos> Good point, Poe.<eos> - He isn't Captain Sham.<eos> - He's Count Olaf.<eos> Baudelaires, I've been more than patient with you.
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> Aunt Josephine said it wasn't far.<eos> Come on.<eos> We don't have all day.<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?
No rules, no curfews.<eos> (SIR OVER PA) Lights out.<eos> But it's only six o'clock.<eos> Oh, boy, more time for dreaming.<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'm Phil, and I am excited to work with you kids.
Now it's time to swim in some deep waters.<eos> Tomorrow night, you're going to the Estate nightclub at The Scott hotel in Philadelphia to attend the post-rehearsal dinner party of a lovely young couple about to get married.<eos> You'll be assigned your mark amongst the wedding guests when you arrive.<eos> Your goal... to seduce them.<eos> You make them feel so comfortable they're willing to spend the night with you and wake up with them after.
It's about police brutality.<eos> It has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world, and mine, right?<eos> Just let it go.<eos> I don't give a fuck if you watched every episode of McHale's Navy.<eos> This is still not about you.
...and you just end up with an itty-bitty scar right there.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. I think it's time to take you up.<eos> I will come and talk to you when we're done.
So David and Robbie just got caught in the cross hairs.<eos> Right, and that's not all.<eos> Monty came through. With the cell tower records, so we're headed to where he thinks is the primary abduction site right now.<eos> Great.<eos> Go. We'll catch up with you as soon as we can.
- Don't do this.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - Don't pause it.<eos> Okay, could everybody... raise their glasses? Drinks up.<eos> We have some very exciting news we want to share with you because, really, we're more like family than neighbors.
Maybe he actually is in the bathroom.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to Mama's.<eos> Y'all take a seat anywhere you like.<eos> I'll be right with you.
He'll be working on a research project in our lab.<eos> What kind of research project?<eos> - That's classified.<eos> - That's classified.<eos> I look forward to working with all of you.
The Mayor would like a word, Miss Smoak.<eos> Then maybe he should've come down here himself instead of sending the bimbo brigade.<eos> Rude!<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.
Odda, what has saved you from outright banishment is that you chose your King over your own son.<eos> Lord, I chose Wessex over my son.<eos> A traitor!<eos> You should at least consider doing the same!<eos> What am I to do with you?
Hey, we actually have a little treat.<eos> Lisa Turner's our new in-house counsel.<eos> She's going to say what's up.<eos> Yeah, hello.<eos> I look forward to working with you.
The child that grows in the womb of the High King's wife.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Highness? A word?<eos> You've offended the ambassador.<eos> He will no longer bargain with you.
Maybe the truth?<eos> Or, whatever you're comfortable telling' people.<eos> You know, I want everything out in the open.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's up to you.
Lord Aelfric could well provide those men.<eos> I have offered him a bargain, in this letter.<eos> You will bring me an answer.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> May God be with you.
I know very well what happened to Kattegat, Lagertha.<eos> I was born here and I grew up here.<eos> We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.<eos> Will you come with us?<eos> Would you really want me to come with you?
Who would have told them everything.<eos> Who would have told them that we gave ragnar lothbrok to king aelle to be killed.<eos> Sometimes, god does things to test us.<eos> This has nothing to do with god!<eos> This has to do with you.
Now, as you are my wife, I could order you to leave my father and I alone.<eos> But you're not like most wives.<eos> So I simply ask if you would do so.<eos> You're angry with me.<eos> Of course I'm angry with you.
And farewell, Bishop Edmund.<eos> My dear vintner.<eos> May God bless you and keep you.<eos> I am going nowhere, Sire.<eos> I am staying here with you.
You want some?<eos> Yes, I want some.<eos> Are you, Matilde?<eos> Yes, but I'm not on duty.<eos> I'd like to have a word with you.
Are you spying on me?<eos> I thought you were my friend!<eos> I was.<eos> And this is how you betray me?<eos> Everything I know of treachery, I learned from you!
I'll be in the stables at midnight.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> Here we go again.<eos> You were with him, weren't you?<eos> I'm not going to have this conversation with you.
Wait, what now?<eos> Huey, Dewey, Louie, meet Scrooge McDuck.<eos> Remember, no tricks, no lies, no trouble.<eos> Yes, Uncle Donald.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
Glomgold out!<eos> We have to go!<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Mr. Duck.<eos> Could we, um, maybe bum a ride with you?
LEGOLAND and an outlet mall.<eos> LEGOLAND?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Sam Hanna.<eos> Supposed to be working the detail with you guys today.
And make sure we can never find him again.<eos> Right.<eos> Agent Andrews, your order is to surveil Chen, but do not engage.<eos> Agent Gibbs, understand?<eos> Hard not to, with you two finishing each other's sentences.
No, it's pepper spray training.<eos> Every couple years, we all have to get recertified.<eos> Yeah, which includes getting sprayed.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll go easy on you guys.
- Harry.<eos> - Shut up, Alabama.<eos> You're gonna be next.<eos> Okay, yeah, so... I'm undercover at The Farm, but no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> There's a twist, because I'm not just training alongside you.
If you ask any Marine, the reason we fought was to make sure we all got to come home, and we fought for the memories of those who didn't.<eos> Doc Campbell, from all the men of the 8113 and the countless Marines you've helped, our sincerest thank you.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor, but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
- Attention to the award.<eos> - The Naval Attaché to the United States Embassy in Berlin and the President of the United States take pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Senior Chief Petty Officer Kevin Campbell.<eos> I appreciate this honor, and it is an honor... but the real praise goes out to all the strong men and women who continue to fight long after we've come home.<eos> It's those soldiers that we are indebted to, and we remember them every day.<eos> It has been the privilege of my life to serve with you.
This just in.<eos> One of the drivers, Marta Calderon, she's agreed to an interview.<eos> All right.<eos> JJ, Luke, Garcia, you head to the crash site.<eos> A special investigator from the NTSB will meet you there.
They must be after our prototype exo-suit.<eos> Time to take action.<eos> First, we take care of this threat.<eos> And then we continue this conversation.<eos> Over to you, officers.
And then we continue this conversation.<eos> Over to you, officers.<eos> You will now find this area Hydra-free.<eos> Team One has secured the entrance.<eos> Team Two, you're up.
You told us to go to hell.<eos> Well, now you can go to hell.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I knew I could count on you guys.
But you all knew S didn't go anywhere without a fight.<eos> And that fight was for all of us.<eos> A people, a network, her family.<eos> ♪ I'll gently rise and I'll softly call ♪<eos> ♪ Good night and joy be with you all ♪
One is to your northeast, the other to your southeast in a big, clear-cut area.<eos> What's the clear-cut area southeast of here?<eos> Loggers' camp, but they shoot first, ask questions later.<eos> Happy, Doc and I'll check out the camp.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Just imagining what you'd look like without teeth.<eos> Knock it off, Rory.<eos> I can't believe that even we would do anything so foolish, unless something went terribly wrong the first time you were here.<eos> Uh, I can't help but notice...<eos> Not all of us came back with you.
We won't be time jumping together.<eos> You're not coming with us.<eos> This has always been a one-way ticket for us.<eos> Your team has to get the Spear of Destiny away from here.<eos> We won't fail you guys.
I did this, and it's made me realize that I was blinded by luxury and comfort, but now I see that none of that matters if I don't...<eos> Brian, Brian, hold on.<eos> Looks like we've learned a lot, and my face is better.<eos> God, I'm so nervous.<eos> You sure you guys want me to play with you?
We were sloppy.<eos> We were human.<eos> You're on speaker, Eric.<eos> So, Nell was able to access the cell phone of the woman Granger killed, and found a phone number for Ferris.<eos> Doesn't really help us because his phone is in the boatshed with you.
I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But I think that you and I have been doing the same thing...<eos> Trying to find out who Carly was working for before she died.<eos> All right, so that's why you broke in, to see if we're on the same side?<eos> I had to be sure before I approached you, so I started following you. But I needed real proof.
Miss Millán, do you mind if I take the day off?<eos> Yes, of course, if you're not feeling well.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -I'll see her out.<eos> Girls, I'd like to speak to you.
Carlota, a little dessert wine?<eos> -No, thanks, Doña Lola. -I'll have a little.<eos> You stick to water.<eos> Alcohol doesn't agree with you.<eos> What's wrong with you two?
Dopey?<eos> - Doc.<eos> Did you want somethin'?<eos> I wanted to get off on the right foot with you.<eos> Well, I already got the rundown of working with you guys, if that's why you're here.
Why?<eos> I've been expecting something from work.<eos> You didn't get an envelope for me?<eos> No, babe, just that.<eos> I'll come down in five minutes, have the croissants with you guys.
Maybe we could grab a pitaya bowl one day and you could fill me in. - Wow.<eos> I'm actually more of an açai bowl guy, myself.<eos> Well, trying new things can really, uh, change your life.<eos> This is Sheldon Rhodes' engineering pod.<eos> Five of his engineers are assembled and ready to speak to you.
I got eyes on Sam.<eos> - Nell?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Deeks?<eos> Well, the good news is, is Jesus is always with you.
So, I'm talking about all this on stage in this Christian college gymnasium, and... it's not connecting, you know?<eos> And it was really sort of awkward backstage after the show between me and this guy who booked me.<eos> He was just like, "Why?<eos> Why would you talk about Jesus for ten minutes on stage?"<eos> And I didn't have the best answer, but I feel like it's good enough to share with you guys.
It's been too long.<eos> I know, I don't even remember the last time we saw each other.<eos> As I recall, Colt soaked a watermelon in Everclear and we had to pick up Abby after she got her stomach pumped.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, uh, peace be with you.
I've never dated anyone with American Sniper type accuracy.<eos> Where I could be like, "Right here.<eos> Hit the moving target."<eos> I'm like, "Okay, Katniss...<eos> Now, most of the time-- tell me if this is true for you guys-- he's like, "All right, are you ready?
Call me Rebecca, please.<eos> And it's not a problem.<eos> I've been through this a hundred times.<eos> You go on up.<eos> I'll join you.
I think you're confused.<eos> We're not here to arrest you.<eos> You're not?<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> The President wants to see you.
I love you, with all my heart.<eos> You must have so many questions.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I know that we will have all the answers soon.<eos> You have no idea how much it hurts me to not be there with you right now.
You mean...<eos> Emilio.<eos> Is that why you called?<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> He won't talk to you.
I bet in the long run it's more economical.<eos> Just get in the truck.<eos> Yeah, I'm getting in the truck because I choose to get into the truck.<eos> - I... - Wait!<eos> Take me with you.
Stephanie got a job offer in DC.<eos> She's gonna take it.<eos> Are you... are you gonna go with her?<eos> Maggie's looking into a transfer for me.<eos> I can't imagine not being here with you guys.
I have that ego.<eos> You live life like it's your movie because you don't wanna be the bitch-ass extra, right?<eos> I certainly... I orchestrate my life that way.<eos> I feel like I'm the lead of my movie right now.<eos> I'm on-stage yelling into a microphone at you guys.
- I got the pack. Abby!<eos> Please, Abby.<eos> The book.<eos> Come on. Let's go!<eos> I'm not going with you guys.
Can I get anybody, like, water or anything to drink?<eos> - Water or... - I'm okay. Thank you.<eos> I'll take some water.<eos> - Feel free to make yourself at home.<eos> Just through there. Yeah, have a seat in there and, uh, Lane'll be right with you.
We're gonna make that our starting point.<eos> Are you guys really gonna go camping out in those woods?<eos> Yep. That's the plan.<eos> You ask 'em.<eos> Uh, we wanna go out there with you.
Peppers.<eos> - Peppers are good.<eos> - All right, darling.<eos> One day you're fighting and calling each other names, now you're giggling like a bunch of school girls.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you two?
Unless...<eos> Unless, what?<eos> Well, unless she doesn't come at all.<eos> But that's crazy talk.<eos> Who wouldn't wanna be with you?
# Zeno-Tek!<eos> Zeno-Tek! #<eos> I love this party!<eos> I love this company!<eos> And I want to work with you people!
He deserves better.<eos> And if you don't understand that and you do this to him, you will wake up tomorrow and you will feel ashamed.<eos> Faster, faster!<eos> Get in there kids!<eos> What's wrong with you?
- If we don't really know what they are...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Would you like to add something?<eos> If they are wearing cloaking technology, you need to bring it back as intact as possible.<eos> Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison will be on mission with you.
Jeez, are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Move!<eos> Come on, move!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
I need to talk... You wanna touch me?<eos> - Don't put your hands on me.<eos> - Andre? It's okay.<eos> - That's, that's...<eos> - Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.
I want to talk to everybody out there.<eos> Every single person that's watching me right now.<eos> And here's what I want you to do.<eos> I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.<eos> I'm gonna be upfront with you.
-No, man. I gotta go back.<eos> -You can't just wander back in there. -They'll know.<eos> -I can't leave him there!<eos> I'll put the tracker back in. They'll pick me up.<eos> You guys go ahead. I will meet up with you later.
Do not.<eos> I mentioned the Señor Famous to assure you Who, from now on, can work directly with me And can charge me a higher value.<eos> "What do we get in return?"<eos> - Access To the policemen and judges of the Ormino, now controlled by us.<eos> Most would not want anything to do with you because you're Cuban.
Alice!<eos> Hatter!<eos> Goodbye, brother.<eos> Brother, goodbye.<eos> I have cherished every moment with all of you.
There will be no survivors...<eos> What is this place?<eos> Where am I?<eos> Answer me!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Everything will be blocked off for 5 miles.<eos> You won't get through.<eos> I can help.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I come with you?
Eric. Don't freak out.<eos> I don't want you to freak out.<eos> Just come on in.<eos> Why don't we all just sit down?<eos> We gotta talk to you.
Do you wanna fuck?<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> - What? - You guys...<eos> - Do you want me to fuck you?
Hey! Hi!<eos> Sorry, I lost Eric.<eos> I wasn't lost.<eos> Just driving at a reasonable pace.<eos> Stay there. We'll come to you.
- Yeah. All right.<eos> I'm gonna take back what I said to you earlier.<eos> Lam going to lump you in together.<eos> All right, you are lumped!<eos> The hell is wrong with you, huh?
I'm gonna take back what I said to you earlier.<eos> Lam going to lump you in together.<eos> All right, you are lumped!<eos> The hell is wrong with you, huh?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
But we have to try<eos> So, no matter what type of animal you are... from the biggest elephant... to our first fox...<eos> I implore you... try<eos> Try to make the world a better place.<eos> Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.
I just wanna do what's best.<eos> For who?<eos> - We just want to talk to you, son.<eos> - Watch it!<eos> - I'm not going anywhere with you!
Let's go!<eos> We got them!<eos> No turning back now.<eos> All right, this one's yours.<eos> Someone say I'm coming with you?
'Cause... 'cause we need faith!<eos> We... - Ugh!<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> Thank you for com...<eos> - God be with you.
Brothers.<eos> I go to prepare a place for you.<eos> Go... into all the world and preach the gospel to all nations.<eos> You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.<eos> And know that I will be with you.
We called ourselves the X-Men.<eos> Your brother was there.<eos> We used to call him Havok.<eos> He was a real handful... but when it came down to it, he was very brave.<eos> What happened to the rest of the kids who went with you?
No, thanks.<eos> You want to walk cross the fringe, I don't think so.<eos> There's no rule saying you can't go home, four. Come on.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'll go with you.
yes, I can hear you, frank.<eos> Can you give us, in general, Just a little bit more light backstage, something?<eos> direct from germany, Master illusionist jan rouven.<eos> thank you very much for your applause.<eos> My name is jan rouven, and I came all the way From germany to be here for you tonight.
But you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't.<eos> 'Cause tonight is our night.<eos> And whatever happens, I just want you all to know how proud I am to be a part of this with you.
Come on.<eos> Get outta the water, mate.<eos> It's unclean.<eos> That stuff will kill you.<eos> You're bladdered, the lot of you.
Attention, all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> All flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately.<eos> We have been redirected to Scarif.<eos> Pilots, you'll be briefed by your squadron leaders en route.<eos> May the Force be with you.
Yes, sir.<eos> Come on.<eos> You may fire when ready.<eos> Commence primary ignition.<eos> Rogue One, may the Force be with you.
- Amelia?<eos> - She's not here.<eos> - She's here.<eos> Amelia.<eos> WOMAN". We can't talk to you.
- She's here.<eos> Amelia.<eos> WOMAN". We can't talk to you.<eos> Who said that?<eos> We can't talk to you.
No, mate, come on.<eos> You gotta let me out, come on.<eos> Please!<eos> See you in the morning, miss Robson, once your head's clear.<eos> Man, what's wrong with you?
Not a chance.<eos> I'm staying right here.<eos> I'd agree with you, but you're wrong.<eos> See, we, too, share a "vested interest."<eos> I don't share anything with you guys.
Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.<eos> Canal Street.<eos> Did he also offer to re-tar your driveway?<eos> Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks, confusion, and psychosis, you don't want to make a habit out of this.<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.
Hey, you're welcome to try.<eos> You said you were a cop.<eos> You a cop like him?<eos> You're going take me to the nearest shelter, and you're gonna help me get in.<eos> CPM sees me with you, they shoot us both.
Get us into them, and I'll get us through them.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I got a CPM override.<eos> I can unlock your ship.<eos> Take us with you.
Get us into them, and I'll get us through them.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I got a CPM override.<eos> I can unlock your ship.<eos> Take us with you.
She looked good.<eos> She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.<eos> No, she wouldn't be.<eos> What happened at Winterfell?<eos> I should have gone with you while I had the chance.
Help me!<eos> Help me, please!<eos> Don't let it burn!<eos> Help me!<eos> What's the matter with you people?
Jesus Christ.<eos> There she goes again.<eos> - Secure the audience.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> I'd like to talk to you guys.
- Where do we go?<eos> - The van.<eos> Go.<eos> Come on, Joe.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
Wait.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Pippi.<eos> This girl has a screw loose.<eos> If you would be so kind as to follow me, Miss Pam would like to speak with you.
Pippi, stop!<eos> We give up!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Too late, my darlings.<eos> I'm tired of playing with you.
- Hey, hey, y'all.<eos> - If he start that shit.<eos> Wait till y'all hear this next track, though, dirt.<eos> You know, in samurai times, a refusal to sit at a man's court was considered a profound insult to his honor.<eos> I'm just fucking with you!
You ask me if I'm afraid?<eos> Yes, I'm afraid.<eos> Jan, Uncle, we do it tomorrow.<eos> As planned.<eos> May God be with you.
Stop right there!<eos> Jaxi: Please jump.<eos> Hey...<eos> Make my fucking night.<eos> Oh, I was just messin' with you guys.
- What about it? You got corn on the cob, you got fried chicken!<eos> - People love fried chicken.<eos> - Do they? Let them go somewhere where they serve fried chicken.<eos> And your kitchen is filthy!<eos> What the hell is the matter with you guys?
- I've heard enough.<eos> We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.<eos> The Boltons helped us do it.<eos> Now you want me to fight against them?<eos> I could be skinned for even talking to you.
Which is why I'm here.<eos> This is irregular.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> I suppose that life is irregular.<eos> The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.
If I had run as far as you, I would want water, too.<eos> But what you want is of no importance.<eos> I am your Kintago!<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> And with you.
Hi, Mrs. Zander.<eos> I'm Mikey.<eos> Are you ready to go?<eos> Not quite.<eos> If you guys are walking to school, why don't you take your sister with you?
Lina, wait outside.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No, that's my sister.<eos> This is my house, and I'm going with you.
How's Amy doing?<eos> Is she paying enough attention to her pelvic floor?<eos> Ignoring that.<eos> She is keeping a low profile, just like we discussed.<eos> I'm really impressed with you two.
- Richie, we got shit. We got some stuff. -l'll call you.<eos> You know I'm good for it.<eos> You know my money's good as gold.<eos> GALASSO: Oh, come on, Maury.<eos> I don't know what it is with you people.
All right. Let him up.<eos> Good boy.<eos> You all right?<eos> My fucking hat.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Thank you.<eos> Which is something I never thought I could do, nor did I want to.<eos> I spent my whole life trying to avoid being alone because I was terrified.<eos> But after this experience, it's like, this rules.<eos> Not only did I not die from loneliness like I thought I would, I never even really felt alone, probably because you guys were forcing me to hang out with you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Did I... Did I do something?<eos> Was it me?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> No, no, it was an honor working with you, too.
A change.<eos> - He likes you, doesn't he?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> I like him.<eos> Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
When he hears news of the invasion, he'll return.<eos> But if he doesn't?<eos> No man has his skill in leading a fleet in battle.<eos> Not even you.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you people?
Hello!<eos> Welcome!<eos> - Thank you all for coming.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> My understanding is that you two are in charge now, and I'd like to speak to you about changing my room.
Michal: Which one is Mattiyahu?<eos> Merav: I don't think he's arrived.<eos> I hope for your sake that he's kind and attentive... and taller than when he was 8.<eos> [Laughs] Excuse me, my lady.<eos> Might I speak with you in private?
Man: Let's move.<eos> Man: Put the chargers in the stable.<eos> Get all the breastplates.<eos> Where's Mattiyahu?<eos> Father, is he with you?
Shit.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Your precious phone is safe.<eos> You can't just take it.<eos> I want to spend some time with you.
- You are under my...<eos> Ow! - You son of a...<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> - What is wrong with you? - Oh-ho-ho!<eos> Walk in here with you idiots smoking reefers like a bunch of yardbirds, and you spritz me?
I won't allow it.<eos> I'm the only one who can go down there and not get hurt.<eos> If we let her go, there is no reason for her to come back.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> I want to be with you.
That kind of volume usually means beaners.<eos> Attract a lot of unfriendly attention on both sides of the borders.<eos> You got one hell of a pair of balls on you, I'll give you that.<eos> Banshee will become the distribution hub for the entire East Coast pipeline.<eos> As long as I can count on you, the Brotherhood will be well compensated.
How many?<eos> They don't want to fight against King Ragnar.<eos> I said how many of them?<eos> Maybe half.<eos> They want you to come back to the camp so they can talk to you.
You have to choose it yourself.<eos> Please come back to us, Kara.<eos> Please.<eos> I wish... I want so much for all of this to be true.<eos> To stay here with you.
You're just as fucked.<eos> You got tangos out front and two tactical sitting on your back porch.<eos> The trucks are out back?<eos> All right, you gotta move.<eos> We're coming to you. Come to us?
And her crew.<eos> Jackie.<eos> Why don't you get our beautiful young ladies something to drink?<eos> Virgin piña colada.<eos> I'll be right with you guys.
- What are you doing?<eos> - What's wrong? When all is well, Antoine messes things up!<eos> Or are you tidying up?<eos> Don't hold your breath.<eos> What's wrong with you two?
We all do. Come.<eos> Are you from The virginia cavalry?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm looking for A frank stringfellow.<eos> He would have been fighting Alongside you, I think.
Listen, we're all bad moms, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was literally the only thing you said tonight that made any fuckin' sense.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, guys. Can I talk to you for a second?
I come in peace.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> - Hey, Maya.<eos> - Hi, Beth.<eos> Can I just watch TV with you guys?
Sycamore and Orange, there's a 10-55 in progress.<eos> Sycamore and Orange.<eos> - 32-15, show me en route.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll come and get you.
My name is Andri, I'm the chief of police.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> Did that man bring you here?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm going to ask Hinrika to speak to you in my office.
- Congratulations, y'all!<eos> - Thank you, baby.<eos> Y'all did it!<eos> Derek, Derek.<eos> Yo, I'll catch up with you.
I'll sign the papers now.<eos> Your approval of the sale.<eos> Uh, the other one?<eos> The one you called me six times to have me sign.<eos> Um, I assume you have it here with you.
Did I say that you're doing it with me?<eos> We're a team!<eos> We do everything as one!<eos> - We eat together, we... - Quiet!<eos> I was going to ask you guys
Dinner, anytime.<eos> How can I explain this?<eos> You see, Patricia never calls people, to not be a bother.<eos> So you have to call her and say:<eos> "Patricia, I'm dying to have dinner with all of you again."
Can you show us how they work?<eos> Sure. Got six hours?<eos> I was thinking more of a crash course.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm going with you.
If I were you, I'd take all the help I could get.<eos> Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> And 20 minutes ago, I was having my brain zapped.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.
So if the situation was reversed, that's what you would've done?<eos> Let him shoot me?<eos> Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.
And thank you for defending my honor.<eos> I am the one that called you a whore!<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, and fuck you, too.<eos> I can't believe I fucked either one of you.
And in secret, the last thing we want is a martyr.<eos> And as for their collaborators in our administration,<eos> - deal with them. - Yes, sir.<eos> JIMMY: Once you go out with us there'll be no going back.<eos> I'll be going out with you.
What did he do?<eos> I have to talk to Jonathan.<eos> I will wait all night if I must.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll wait with you.
Childhood, such a perilous time.<eos> So much tragedy can just occur.<eos> So far, the King has refused to listen to me.<eos> If all of you bear witness, he will understand the severity of this situation.<eos> Why is my son out here with you?
I will speak to them as a soldier, not a Minister.<eos> What's happened?<eos> They saw us help them against the Red Guard, they'll listen to me.<eos> You're going alone?<eos> If I go with you, it will provoke them.
-Yes, Julio from Tagones.<eos> 10 or 12 of them.<eos> Don't you have a last name?<eos> The Lord be with you.<eos> May the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, be upon you.
We're still stuck with that.<eos> No, we ain't.<eos> I should've killed them.<eos> Hey.<eos> The ones that took you and Maggie... what'd they do to you?
You've been back for days and never said a word, and on top of it --<eos> is that my shirt you got on?<eos> Quiet!<eos> You'll get us all shot!<eos> - I'm coming with you.
Everybody has secrets, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Whatever it is, it's safe with me, believe me.<eos> I owe you. What about you?
Can you get the hell out of the way?<eos> Dick.<eos> Wow, Dave, you're just an asshole magnet.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> I'm here with you.
We won't get away with that again.<eos> In that case...<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> To the new Commander.<eos> May I join you?
Me, too.<eos> Care to look in the eyes of who I'm risking prison for.<eos> My guy's already way ahead of you.<eos> He's rolling as we speak.<eos> Says he'll meet you anywhere you want tonight.
Huh. I mean, I was 100% certain I wanted kids.<eos> Yeah, well, that, of course.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine...<eos> Just the other stuff I don't know about.<eos> Well, that's you guys.
They survive... Cat poop... and then they grow up to be just like us.<eos> Yeah, and they have a very healthy immune system.<eos> - Anyway, I'm going to go to the kids' show. - Okay.<eos> Hey, if you're going to come, will you just text me?<eos> It was nice meeting you.
This seal gonna hold?<eos> Hope so. It's chlorine gas.<eos> - And if not, we'll all go blind.<eos> - What?<eos> Guys... I'm coming to you.
- And if not, we'll all go blind.<eos> - What?<eos> Guys... I'm coming to you.<eos> Joey!<eos> I said I'd come to you.
what did you do?<eos> I've got Malick.<eos> I have to get back to the base.<eos> - They have something we need.<eos> Guys, I'm coming to you.
When the world is full of care<eos> And every headline screams despair<eos> When all is rape, starvation, war and life is vile<eos> Then there's a certain thing I do<eos> Which I shall pass along to you
After you.<eos> I'm not sure we understand.<eos> You are looking to sell the doctor eye technology, are you not?<eos> - Yes, but ...<eos> - The doctor will meet you once I've seen the surgery is complete and your cybernetic eye is in place.
Say Daddy. Say Daddy.<eos> Sonia, I have to leave for the airport.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you coming home or staying in Barcelona?<eos> I'm coming home to you.
To get Kira.<eos> Her dad told us that her mom took her out to New Mexico, to this place called Shiprock.<eos> They're trying to figure out a way to help her, but it's dangerous.<eos> So we're gonna go find her and bring her back.<eos> I'll come with you.
Your Dad's the one that issued us these things, and he wouldn't officially say why.<eos> Did he say anything unofficially?<eos> No. But everyone's got a theory.<eos> What's yours?<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you guys.
Em, what's wrong?<eos> "What To Name The Baby?" What class is that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What does it say?<eos> I've chosen to share this with you because ultimately, my diagnosis was a wake-up call.
It's nearby.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> The powers they bestowed are on the wane, but--<eos> Enough!<eos> As I was saying, the magics are losing their potency, but I still have enough to make short work of the two of you.
What have we forgotten?<eos> We have forgotten God.<eos> You!<eos> You have forgotten God.<eos> I want to be very clear with you.
And so, in protest, he's moved to a new place, he's gone to the outskirts of town, a filthy studio apartment upstairs from a tire repair shop.<eos> At night, God suffers from the heat.<eos> He can't seem to sleep, because He's come to the conclusion that there's nothing He can do about human beings.<eos> He's decided that He's lost the "u".<eos> Now it's up to you.
- just make sure he doesn't talk to anyone. - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - If they arrest him?<eos> - Take him home.<eos> - I'll come to you.
Good.<eos> Deliver this message to the X-RAY operatives.<eos> "Valiant men of X-RAY," make contact with KLO and light the Palmido Lighthouse on September 15th, 0000 hours.<eos> Guide our fleet to the beach.<eos> Lastly, "may the grace of God be with you."
No, no, no, you don't treat me like I'm just your secretary.<eos> I've done more work on this case than you have!<eos> - I can't get into this right now, Karen.<eos> - No, enough of the dodgy bullshit.<eos> I deserve to know what is going on with you two.
'Cause whatever that is, they... they want to keep in the dark.<eos> Karen has found something that will bring the truth to light.<eos> Here, uh...<eos> This... is this the body they asked you to make disappear?<eos> -I shouldn't be talking to you.
♪ He can hold back the dawn ♪ Don't hold back!<eos> ♪ He who's wise never tries ♪<eos> - ♪ To revise what's past... ♪<eos> - Stop it! Stop!<eos> What is wrong with you? !
For real?<eos> When you hear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then and only then are you no longer rookies.<eos> In the meantime, we're counting on you.
He had a cute dog.<eos> -What about you?<eos> -No one since Asian Larry Hagman. Oh.<eos> Frankie, are you out there yet, having fun?<eos> Actually, I need to talk to you guys.
He's our tribunal president.<eos> No more bloodshed to cover, these reporters try to stir up trouble in other ways.<eos> Why did General MacArthur choose you as the president of the tribunal?<eos> [reporter 1] Give us the goods.<eos> Well, you'd better ask the General that one, boys... if you can get him to talk to you.
Is it possible that the cargo that the Master has brought here is that very same Ancient?<eos> There is a possibility.<eos> They were most eloquent.<eos> So, perhaps the Master has formed an alliance with one of your kind.<eos> Do you understand what it means that he's not sought the same arrangement with you?
It half worked.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - You stole the book?<eos> And teamed up with that filthy half muncher against us?<eos> - It wasn't about you.
We heard you took yourself away into the wilderness.<eos> Why?<eos> - I went to find someone. - Who?<eos> Myself.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I want to tell him that I love him.<eos> He has the wrong idea.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> My Lord, I trust you are well rested after such great exertions.<eos> Forgive me, I had to come and see you.
Listen to me.<eos> You can't go back.<eos> I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout.<eos> The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.<eos> I want to come with you.
You can't go back.<eos> I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout.<eos> The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> Please, let me hunt with you.
We're practically a second Front.<eos> What's that for?<eos> That's for me.<eos> I'm not leading you.<eos> I'm not even going with you.
Ride to the cathedral at Saint-Denis where Francis is interred.<eos> Find the embalmer who removed the king's organs.<eos> Ask him if the liver was already black when he removed it. If it wasn't...<eos> That means the liver was tampered with after Francis' death, which proves he wasn't poisoned and that you are innocent.<eos> You are offering me a kindness and consideration I have rarely shown you through the years.
But as I was telling my story, I suddenly realized I have no solid proof against Catherine.<eos> A sign of her genius.<eos> Lola, what are your doubts?<eos> Mary mentioned something last night and I can't get it out of my head.<eos> She said that it was you, not Catherine, who planted the rat in my tub, as a way of scaring me into marrying you.
His sudden disappearance is your way of tying up loose ends.<eos> Did you bribe him to go away?<eos> You killed him. - Please, let there be one honest thing between us.<eos> You want to hear something honest?<eos> I love you, and I would do anything to keep you.
I'll tell you what you can tell them, honey.<eos> We're making things for people like us, because we are sick and tired of being dismissed by people like you.<eos> Mic drop.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Oh, um, if you guys are going, I should probably go with you.
Who's your contact?<eos> Oskar Halminski here...<eos> he is Polish resistance.<eos> Maybe he can help.<eos> We appreciate the offer, sir, and we're indebted to you, Major, but I have a mission that I'm not at liberty to discuss.
Fall back!<eos> - Fall back!<eos> - Inside!<eos> Inside!<eos> Please, take me with you.
- I want to come with you. Mother's been sheltering me here for a month while those pigs are out there.<eos> My father taught me to hunt.<eos> To be proud.<eos> He'd be ashamed to see me now... hiding.<eos> Please, let me hunt with you.
'Cause that could go either way.<eos> So far so... good.<eos> The road from Earth to the stars is not easy. How many times do we have to tell you, Hartley?<eos> Ever since Evil Wells got erased from existence, no one speaks Latin around here anymore.<eos> Well, as always, it's been a pleasure working with you all on this little project.
Laurel shot me.<eos> You ran away, as you tend to do.<eos> Interesting, too, isn't it, that you're the only one not in this?<eos> What, you think that I sent it?<eos> Anything's possible with you people.
He won't have to get buried with the paupers.<eos> He'll have a hearse and...<eos> Where did you get it, Min?<eos> Mrs Butler gave it to us. (PRAYERS CONTINUES) When she heard.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.<eos> Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<eos> Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
John Bosworth is officially a grandfather.<eos> Look, I know it feels like we got to California two minutes ago, but we can't slow down now.<eos> We are continuing to expand user experience on the network...<eos> Avatar modification, building out neighborhoods.<eos> We have a ton of really important deadlines coming up and we are counting on you guys.
But how to decide, how to know the role you're most suited for.<eos> Well, we're here to help.<eos> Today is the day you pick your top three choices.<eos> Think of this as Quantico's version of career day.<eos> We've brought in representatives from every major program to talk to you.
On his own.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So where does that leave you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you guys.
There has to be some way.<eos> All I ever hear is that England needs a king and an heir.<eos> And I can give them both.<eos> I will marry you.<eos> I'll divorce my wife, and I'll marry you.
The alarm went off at her office again, but nobody's there, and Cat's on a case, so can you let the alarm company in?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Uh, I'll be right back.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.<eos> I'll come with you guys.
Ask me dad.<eos> They'll interview him, that lot.<eos> I just thought you might know him, I was just being nosey.<eos> Ah, my two favourite women in uniform.<eos> No, I'm talking to you.
I found out.<eos> And I asked him about it.<eos> He wouldn't talk.<eos> Turned into a fight.<eos> I need to know what's going on with you guys.
As a kid...<eos> Sorry, the manager isn't in right now.<eos> Would you like to place an order?<eos> I know you know who I am.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I insulted you guys. But just who talked to you?
Wait.<eos> It's sex magic?<eos> All magic where I'm from is sex magic.<eos> Thought you knew that.<eos> I could perform it with you if you'd prefer.
You think I'm a target?<eos> Well, we'd like to take you into protective custody immediately, just to be safe.<eos> I have a delegated security team.<eos> Sir, with respect to your team, the FBI wouldn't be here if we didn't think this was a credible threat to the safety of you and your family.<eos> All right, I'll go with you.
So, I created this thing called "Date With Destiny."<eos> If I could uncover what beliefs and values control me, I could literally redesign me.<eos> I created this motherfucker standing here.<eos> Three, two, one, go.<eos> What's the best way for us to interact with you?
So, what is the charge on this Marwan guy for the APB?<eos> Murder suspect.<eos> Keep it local.<eos> We don't want the Feds in on this one.<eos> Look, I'm out of here tonight so I'm gonna have to dump this one on you guys.
TOM: You're on.<eos> It's your moment of truth.<eos> COOPER: He looks worried.<eos> Like he got a call from his wife's shrink saying she's having a panic attack.<eos> He's on his way to you now.
When the meteorite crashed, they must have come up to investigate.<eos> That's when they came across Daniel and Rosie.<eos> Houdini...<eos> I apologise for the bonds.<eos> We were preparing to escape when we came across you.
- See?<eos> - This wasn't a vision or a dream.<eos> HOUDINI: Which means your husband was a secret terrorist fighter who faked his own death.<eos> Yes.<eos> And that's why I'm not going with you.
I'm the husband, so you think I did it.<eos> You're messing with me, and you want me to say something stupid.<eos> We can show you the autopsy report, Mr. Jacobs. No.<eos> What you can do is leave.<eos> You want me to talk to you again?
How do you know of this place?<eos> You don't answer, they pay.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> Is there anyone else with you?
Give it to me. - Now.<eos> - Am I talking to myself?<eos> It has to be my hand.<eos> You try to get your fleshy meat paw into this thing and it'll never work.<eos> I have to come with you.
Go!<eos> Another one is coming inside.<eos> We gotta take her down now.<eos> Okay. What about you?<eos> I'll join you.
She's safe, for now.<eos> I'm taking her back with me.<eos> The safe house is all set in Virginia.<eos> You take her away from every face she knows and she'll shut down.<eos> Or at least let me come with you.
Thank you, Simon.<eos> Simon, we love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> We're all still here.<eos> I'm always with you.
Well, we should have the test results in a few days.<eos> Urn, do you have an egg donor in mind? - Not yet.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We are still narrowing it down. - Yeah.<eos> You know, we should tell you, too, that we are thrilled to be working with you. And we're both very open to any kind of emerging technologies.
All right, you can get out of here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did you guys see...?<eos> I need to talk to you guys for a second.
Your vampire huntress is currently residing somewhere in Cincinnati.<eos> Let's get going, Nora.<eos> The sooner she's dead, the better.<eos> Do think I just did that locator spell for a tune-up?<eos> I'm going with you.
I asked your chief if there was anyone who'd be willing to go down to the scene, see if there's any structural damage, a safety concern, anything that could get us inside the building, under the radar.<eos> You want me to kick down a door, I'll kick down a door.<eos> Hey, where's Chili?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Everything okay between you two?
Oh. Miss Woodrow.<eos> Evening, Sheriff.<eos> I hate to interrupt your supper, but I was hoping...<eos> Well, I'm... I'm looking for Eugene.<eos> A-And I was hoping he'd run off to spend time with you, like he sometimes does.
So... I'm writing the last three rungs, and they'll say that I'm the chosen son.<eos> I'll let you know when they're finished.<eos> Maybe you'll want to come back out again.<eos> You'll never get Silas on board.<eos> Silas will meet you at the airport, all right?
Her odd behavior.<eos> Others saw it.<eos> There were no witnesses.<eos> Then you are free.<eos> But I'm not free to be with you.
Actually, I have, it's one of the ones the Santero told me about.<eos> I think that's the only way we're gonna get the mask off him.<eos> This guy's too dangerous to move.<eos> We can't risk taking him any place!<eos> Well, then, I guess, text us the address and we'll come to you.
Cos it equals nowt to us.<eos> Till there are coins in the palm of my hand, no graft gets done.<eos> No man lifts a finger!<eos> It's only a day or so before the money comes good, isn't that right?<eos> In the meantime... I'll work with you.
Your new...<eos> Retro Girl!<eos> Ladies... gentlemen...<eos> Powers all...<eos> Most of my life I've dreamed of being here among you.
It's not safe.<eos> Something's rotten here.<eos> Dr. Yedlin.<eos> Xander.<eos> Jason would like to speak with you.
Psilocybin.<eos> A naturally-occurring compound found in simple mushrooms, which can open our minds to the realm of spirit, allowing us to touch the eternal.<eos> Unfortunately, the mushrooms themselves taste like crap.<eos> But the taste and any nausea or discomfort that you feel-- that's part of the experience, too.<eos> I'll be with you every step of the way.
Yes, we know.<eos> You keep reminding us.<eos> So we need to talk to this Mr. Weiler again.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna run his I.D. photo through the database.<eos> I'm coming with you.
All my students are still learning english.<eos> Well, then we're gonna need to talk to all your students, One by one.<eos> That's gonna be harder than you think, detective.<eos> Most of my students come from countries Where the cops are corrupt,<eos> So they're not gonna want to talk to you.
That vehicle was downed two weeks ago for maintenance.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Just drop an anchor.<eos> We're rolling to you.
This would be about honor.<eos> He would feel it was his duty if he is the Inugami.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> We need to get to Roger's house.<eos> Take me with you.
Everyone at the commission needs to see results within the next three weeks before we can do anything else.<eos> Look, rebuilding our database is the only solution to this problem.<eos> This is not my opinion.<eos> These are the facts, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Now, I've cooperated with you on every level.
Okay, I'll get some hot water, some towels... please!<eos> I'm not having a fucking baby here.<eos> - Teresa's having the baby.<eos> - Whoa, whoa.<eos> All right, I'll come with you.
You all look woefully underdressed.<eos> We are if we're going to a charity gala at the Russian consul general's.<eos> Were Eric and Nell able to set up our covers?<eos> They were, indeed.<eos> Anna will be joining you.
We are if we're going to a charity gala at the Russian consul general's.<eos> Were Eric and Nell able to set up our covers?<eos> They were, indeed.<eos> Anna will be joining you.<eos> Having a Russian along with you should prove helpful.
Hmm. Alive or dead?<eos> Alive, Bucky, very much alive.<eos> Hands.<eos> Show me hands.<eos> I can't come with you.
I don't even care.<eos> Put your fist through his gut this time.<eos> Gladly.<eos> Easy there, Man-Rage.<eos> I had to bring you somewhere safe to talk to you.
Everyone, cheeks to the seats.<eos> That means ass in the chairs.<eos> My name is Mr. Deliver.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Teacher probably shouldn't talk to his students this way, but have any of your teachers ever talked to you this way?
For business.<eos> I've had no need for diplomatic negotiations of late.<eos> So unless you have something else of an official nature to discuss.<eos> I do.<eos> The terms of securing a dance with you at the coronation feast.
They're long gone.<eos> Dalton might be halfway off the island now.<eos> Use your legs, use your legs.<eos> Yeah, that's right. Okay, okay.<eos> Hey, you guys all right?
This grim face of angelic constipation?<eos> Just ... yuck!<eos> And I join you?<eos> I thought you detestable as deadly inimgos.<eos> But working with you?
We shall see.<eos> Elizabeth, men in general like to win.<eos> Prince Magnus seems a very proud man.<eos> Denmark has things that England needs.<eos> Plus, you want him to want to marry you, don't you?
It's going to be a stunning victory.<eos> One the privy council can't ignore.<eos> Long live King Charles.<eos> Will you be visiting Elizabeth's palace in London as well?<eos> I'm afraid we're heading back to Denmark tomorrow, which is why I'm keen to spend every remaining moment with you.
You understand.<eos> Christophe.<eos> You can't be in my chambers.<eos> I'm gonna have that secret passage sealed tomorrow.<eos> I needed to talk to you.
Wonderful.<eos> We could use a happy ending.<eos> What better way to celebrate your rule and mine, huh?<eos> And I expect both you and your sister to be there.<eos> Your Majesty, Queen Mary wishes to speak with you. Privately.
Not yet.<eos> Gideon, would you fetch me some more ink?<eos> It's in the trunk in the corner.<eos> Gideon? Gideon!<eos> I've been wanting to speak with you since the play last night.
I was just thinking of you.<eos> Is that blood on your sleeve?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Archbishop Ridolfi needs to be more careful.<eos> Jeffrey learned he's here in France, and guessed he was strategizing with you.
I believe I can. Then do it, whatever it is, as soon as possible.<eos> I hope that's my food, Mimi.<eos> I'm famished.<eos> Your girl said I could bring this up for you.<eos> She said you haven't left your room in weeks. Greer, I've been so worried about you.
Has he had any visitors?<eos> No, he's been too busy borrowing the royal carriages, for what he calls "holy errands."<eos> - Do you know where he's been going?<eos> - No. But his drivers loathe him.<eos> I'm sure they'd share that information with you.
The only solution you can come up is one that serves your own purposes?<eos> You've worked hard to preserve the Vatican's support for your return to Scotland.<eos> And while I am glad that you have opened yourself up emotionally to Gideon, do not let those emotions cloud your judgment.<eos> But I will lose him.<eos> Then I leave the decision to you.
Let's go!<eos> We're leaving!<eos> So is this the private jet for all inmates or just me?<eos> Well, you're not special, if that's what you're asking.<eos> I don't want you to think that I'm ungrateful for this prison transfer, so I'm gonna share something with you.
They get to leave?<eos> Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?<eos> Hold on!<eos> Theresa?<eos> I'm gonna come with you.
Pilcher sent a dozen nomads in a dozen directions out beyond the fence. And Adam's the only one who's ever returned.<eos> They're gone.<eos> This is a rare opportunity.<eos> With the Abbies retreated, we can work without fear.<eos> I want to come with you.
We'll be back shortly for group two.<eos> Daddy?<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Don't be scared.<eos> Ma-Mama's going to be there with you.
But I need to speak with you in private.<eos> Not now... my attentions are needed here.<eos> Get word to our spies in Scottish court that our delegation is heading to Edinburgh.<eos> Is that all you brought?<eos> Stephan, I can't go with you. What?
I don't.<eos> I shall die in the service of Queen Mary and the true faith.<eos> Until tomorrow.<eos> Information has come from our spies that the Red Knights are hiding in one of three potential towns.<eos> What does that have to do with you?
Is that what you want her doing?<eos> Attacking the religious leader of the country when she has sworn tolerance?<eos> Who's shaking the jar then?<eos> If you care about your sister, you won't give her reason to misstep.<eos> And if I care about my sister, what do I do about you?
You think you're in control, but you're not.<eos> Yeah, you have information that can harm me.<eos> But is what you use to do whith this information... that is so crucial to my future.<eos> You need to tell me who gave you this information.<eos> Because how do I know it ends with you, eh?
We have nothing to talk about.<eos> We know what you think.<eos> You tell everyone.<eos> You cleaned yourself up.<eos> This is what you do to people who disagree with you?
3045 Hudson Street?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Something wrong with that address?<eos> Yeah, it's mine.<eos> We'll check in with you later.
They're not responding.<eos> - They're stuck in kill-mode?<eos> - We should go.<eos> - Now.<eos> - We're coming for you.
When this is over, you and Alexei and Katia are going to leave.<eos> And you're going to cut off all contact with Elena forever.<eos> You will also tell her that getting in touch was a great mistake on your part.<eos> - My Pack has been under attack since you got here.<eos> And Elena is being torn apart between her loyalty for us and the unknown with you.
Because now I love details.<eos> Well, his leg-- yeah, everyone sees that, but...<eos> I saw the way he covered it with a blanket to make it look normal for me.<eos> And when I see something, I have to say it.<eos> Like with you guys.
I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.<eos> Come in, it's freezing out here.<eos> So, what brings you all the way out here?<eos> A friend of mine has been trying to... to get a hold of you guys.
Just do this for me.<eos> Imagine Allah in your heart.<eos> What does he feel like?<eos> Is he loving?<eos> Does he care for you?
Look.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - Un-freakin' believable. Oh.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna let them know that I'm here with you and that they're busted. No.
He said the lab was hemorrhaging money.<eos> That sounds like motive.<eos> Come on, Castle. Let's go talk to this guy.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Maybe I should come with you.
The study you published about mast cell tumors.<eos> The one that was ultimately... discredited.<eos> You had your chance to find a cure. You failed.<eos> Every day spent discussing how to save the animals means thousands of human lives will be lost.<eos> So as much as I'd like to stand here debating ethics with you all day, I have a war to win.
Maybe you decided to tell him so.<eos> Can you tell us your whereabouts between 10:00 p.m. and midnight two nights ago?<eos> I was on patrol.<eos> Did anyone see you?<eos> If I killed Mike, why would I have come to you the other night?
That's insane!<eos> I know.<eos> I know -- calling this a challenge is the understatement of the century, but everyone in this room has experienced firsthand what one rogue agent can accomplish.<eos> Now, can you imagine what a conspiracy of them could do?<eos> Can we rely on you?
Yeah, and it has the standard "suicide clause."<eos> There's no payoff if the insured takes his own life within two years.<eos> Okay, so... the wife wants to cover up the suicide and make it look like a murder so she can collect two million dollars.<eos> Why would the mistress go along with all this?<eos> I said I'd come with you.
What does... that mean?<eos> Nothing. Nothing.<eos> I, uh...<eos> These last three months have been the best.<eos> Just getting to spend time with you.
An opportunity to reclaim our lost heritage, to follow the example, our prophet Muhammad, salla llahu wa-sallam, who taught that extremism and violence has no place in Islam.<eos> My vision is of an authentic Islam, one that remembers that tolerance is fundamental to our faith.<eos> Because... Islam is salaam.<eos> Peace.<eos> And peace be upon you.
And now President Bassam Al Fayeed.<eos> I am no longer an Al Fayeed.<eos> I am Leila Haddad.<eos> And if I am elected president, I will shut down that palace and turn it back to a people's park.<eos> And the president of Abuddin will live right here, in a humble home. With you.
I... I know that trusting my judgment isn't one of your strong suits, but maybe just this once, give it a shot, huh?<eos> Dr. Heart-Print will be coming our way any second now.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to welcome you here on this special night.<eos> Now, I know many of you are still clinging to the hope that the "animal problem" will somehow rectify itself.<eos> I, unfortunately, am here to share with you that things have gotten a lot worse.
You could have killed yourself.<eos> Congratulations, guys.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to be?<eos> I... I... I do, actually.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Okay, I've got a visual on Callen.<eos> He managed to escape.<eos> Head north on Union.<eos> I'll pick him up.<eos> I'm coming to you.
So what's happening?<eos> You got any suspects?<eos> That is police information only.<eos> I'm going to need to see your security footage.<eos> If you don't have any answers, I really don't have time for you people.
- Yeah.<eos> Look around.<eos> Moment he showed up, metas start appearing everywhere.<eos> Now you show up, and we get aliens.<eos> Superpowers are evil, man, and I don't want anything to do with them or with either of you.
Sounds like you know something about kids. You got any?<eos> Sorry I'm late, but I come bearing gifts.<eos> We had this tradition in my family where we'd all open our presents at the exact same time.<eos> Since you guys are the only family I have,<eos> I, uh, figured I'd try it with you.
Well, if that's the case, is there anything I can do to help?<eos> Well, not right now.<eos> But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby's heartbeat.<eos> Really?<eos> It's okay if I listen with you?
Anyone that knows anything about them.<eos> So, I need you guys to forget everything that you just heard.<eos> Oh, no, afraid we can't do that, boss.<eos> You guys, LokSat took out my entire AG team.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen to you.
- Mimmuzzo is ours!<eos> - Enough!<eos> We have one thing to ask you.<eos> Four days ago, the afternoon of September 14th.<eos> Mimmo was here with you?
- Pretty much.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Damn.<eos> Nobody told me I'd be sitting here with so many badass dudes.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, an OD, a murder right here at your school, if that doesn't bother you, then there's something wrong with you.
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, but you got to stay off your feet.<eos> - They're badly infected.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Your attention, please.<eos> If you need immediate medical assistance, please raise your hand and I'll come to you.
Peter, no, you didn't.<eos> Peter, Brandon's alive, okay?<eos> And we're gonna take care of him right now.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm gonna need to talk to you.
I feel like Diane was pretty clear she wanted us to make it work.<eos> Was she?<eos> Yeah, I mean... why would you--<eos> I just wish you'd discussed it with us first.<eos> - ( knocks ) - ( door opens ) Sorry, Diane Gould is here for both of you.
I'll be around all weekend if you want to talk any of this through.<eos> Thanks, Diane.<eos> Really.<eos> So do you want to drive up tonight or tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, uh, well, while a wine farm retreat with you sounds super romantic, I am busy this weekend.
I'll tell you what, why don't you take a walk, and she can face those consequences right here and now?<eos> She's ours.<eos> We'll take care of her.<eos> Now, I'm here to extend an olive branch.<eos> We want to work with you.
My baby Sam.<eos> My little boy Dean.<eos> Just feels like yesterday, we were together in heaven, and now...<eos> I'm here, and John is gone, and they're gone.<eos> And every moment I spend with you reminds me every moment I lost with them.
So you're a what?<eos> You're, uh, English men of letters?<eos> British. We wanna work with you.
Excitable.<eos> She tried to kill us.<eos> Like I said, excitable.<eos> And you're better?<eos> I don't care about you one way or the other.
Lawn furniture? No, not today.<eos> Today, we hunt a bigger prize... your ship.<eos> Masks, suits, fins, tanks at pressure, regulators, cutting tools, comms.<eos> Now, Cruz, Kudelski, Wallace, Fiores, you're all going in.<eos> Be damn sure I wish I could join you.
The next group is right...<eos> There!<eos> That was close.<eos> Two more sets.<eos> Cruz and Wolf, you're up.
- Yes, let's go.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm going this way too.<eos> Main square is that way, just follow the others.<eos> I'm coming with you.
We were so close back then.<eos> Basically family.<eos> Then, a couple years later, you tried to destroy us.<eos> What did I do to make you hate me so much?<eos> Like I said, it wasn't about you guys.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Imagine this,<eos> President of Colombia goes on TV and tells the whole world he'll never make a deal with you.
What's going on?<eos> I'm going to freeze to death out here.<eos> That's Bogotá.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
There are cops working for Los Pepes everywhere.<eos> It would be better if you get us to the United States at once.<eos> - I'll cooperate with you.<eos> - Anything you want.<eos> I'll cooperate with you.
And that has been a good decision for business as well?<eos> Because things are very difficult.<eos> And when all this shit is over, the organization will change, the routes will change, this whole city will change.<eos> And how do you know you'll still be in business, Judy?<eos> That's why I'm talking to you.
Welcome to Cali.<eos> Gilberto, thank you, brother.<eos> Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm here to speak to you all.
Target at twelve o'clock.<eos> Copy.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Down on your knees, now.<eos> Does that line ever really work for you?
Where, um, almost ready.<eos> What is this thing again?<eos> A SCIF room.<eos> A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.<eos> - You bring this stuff with you when you travel?
Oh, my God...<eos> Okay, we're thinking about hiding out in the movie theater.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> The cops are everywhere.<eos> Hey, I'll meet you there.
I suggest you die remembering him as he was.<eos> It's better that way.<eos> Unless you'd care to join him.<eos> Cadmus welcomes any bright minds willing to help our cause.<eos> My father would never collaborate with you.
It's also been... it's also now shown to the law students in Yale.<eos> Like they're meant to learn something or some shit.<eos> Now, I appreciate all these things.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> I don't know if I deserve these accolades, or whatever the fuck they're called, because, I'm gonna be honest with you... Um...
That's because you earned his respect.<eos> You kids aren't Avengers yet. But if you keep it up, you will be.<eos> Um, Cap?<eos> Before we leave, I never got to take that selfie with you.<eos> Actually, I never got to take a selfie with you.
"You don't know how." "I'll figure it out."<eos> This isn't talent.<eos> This is determination... for sleep.<eos> I love sleep.<eos> And when we're sleeping with you, ladies..
This isn't talent.<eos> This is determination... for sleep.<eos> I love sleep.<eos> And when we're sleeping with you, ladies..<eos> And I mean sleeping with you.
Cubbies!<eos> The only reason I ever put up with the guy was because he's the best damn mechanic in the business.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Grew up in Wrigleyville.<eos> Truthfully, I could say the same about every one of you, so it's been a pleasure working with you, and if you ever get to Palm Desert, please, promise me you won't call!
(CHUCKLING) Tech.<eos> IRON MAN: Unbelievable.<eos> You Avengers bicker and bark.<eos> Wild and out of control.<eos> Is it a wonder why I would not work with you?
You good? -Mmm.<eos> I just don't know why it didn't come up, but... Jeff and I, we've been running an illegal brewery out of his garage.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Ten.<eos> I don't really like yelling at you guys, okay?
Honestly, like, I would have been really upset if I had found out that--<eos> -Right?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You know, that, like, they're doing this thing that I'm not a part of.<eos> Yes, but the point is that it's not about you guys.
-Right. So we're allowed to start telling people, so like...<eos> -You're, like, one of the first people we've told, like, you know, outside of our family.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> -[Paige] I know. God, I feel so special to be one of the first.<eos> Ah. I want to celebrate with you.
-Baby, what do you want to drink?<eos> Um... I'll take a tequila, I guess.<eos> -Tequila.<eos> -I want to cheers.<eos> I'm waiting to cheers. I want to cheers with you guys.
Our Intel says he owns a body shop in the East Falls area.<eos> I'll dig up an exact address and send it to you.<eos> Get over there. Check it out.<eos> - Will do, Gibbs.<eos> I'm coming with you.
And the only answer I keep coming back to is what I told you last night.<eos> I think that I can effect change and promote unity.<eos> Never before in my life have I felt this more strongly... The depth of love that I have for this country and its survival.<eos> But I cannot do this alone.<eos> Nor can I waste any more time fighting with you.
Okay, we're moving now.<eos> NSA security has set up a pickup location.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> This was a shooting incident.<eos> The FBI will need to speak to you.
Why are they after you?<eos> Like I said, I know things.<eos> Are you in here 'cause you're hiding from them?<eos> Hey, Davey.<eos> I need to talk to both of you.
We only had three.<eos> But I was still able to use call records from the cell tower closest to the blast to track The Ghost's location.<eos> No easy task in New York, where the buildings can reflect...<eos> Hey, who are you talking to, Riley?<eos> Uh... I-I thought you guys, but apparently I'm just talking to myself.
(WHIRRING) Too late. It's launching.<eos> I wasn't fast enough.<eos> (GRUNTS) Come on, Ant-Man.<eos> This isn't over yet.<eos> No need to waste time and energy on you.
I'm a photographer covering the G20 because the President of the World Bank was gonna speak.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Simon.<eos> - We're all still here.<eos> - I'm always with you.
You ok?<eos> I'm just glad we found those kids.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too.<eos> But, uh, I was talking about that other thing.<eos> I haven't had a chance to talk to you guys. What do you think?
Have OP send us an updated list of who they've invited to the swearing-in.<eos> Seth.<eos> A word?<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> I'll catch up to you.
That's why they don't cat-call.<eos> That's why they don't have to be creepy.<eos> They can fuck salad.<eos> You don't gotta cat-call when you can fuck salad.<eos> You think if there was a vegetable that felt exactly like a vagina, we would ever talk to you?
- Whatever.<eos> - You know who I'm talking about.<eos> - Guys, wait up.<eos> Wait up.<eos> I'm coming with you.
48 minutes.<eos> - Hey, don't let go.<eos> - Don't tell me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't come with you.
Why?<eos> She took kattegat away from me.<eos> I wanted it back.<eos> Why didn't you also have us killed?<eos> This was nothing to do with you.
Being overprotective is in the big brother description.<eos> That's never gonna change.<eos> Well, can we at least come to a compromise?<eos> Uh, we're listening.<eos> I'll agree to be more up front and open with you, if you'll agree to give me my personal space and trust my decisions.
Commodus made sure that he maintained the support of the Roman people.<eos> Coins are a great way for Emperors to advertise their reign.<eos> It's a way that they can show themselves as they want to be seen.<eos> People of Rome, thank you!<eos> And may the Gods be with you!
Hetty-steps, you know, just get a tiny tree.<eos> Why don't you just burn my house down and save me the hassle?<eos> Nell, can you please tell Callen to let joy into his life?<eos> Actually, Christmas trees start over 200 house fires every year.<eos> Who hurt you?
Dear Lord, I hope she is safe.<eos> where could that child be?<eos> in the name of the father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.<eos> the angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, and she conceived of the Holy Spirit.<eos> Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you.
- And he's just leaving.<eos> - I'm working this one with you. - Let's not fight in front of the kids.<eos> Nothing to fight about.<eos> I'm your boss.<eos> The victim is my friend, and it's a death-penalty case, so, yeah, I'm working it with you.
What about you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Did something happen to you?<eos> Please don't worry about me!<eos> I'll catch up with you.
[negotiator] I wish you would, yeah.<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> What can we do for you, George?<eos> Well, we can start out with the lights. We can start out with the water. We can start out with news media, and deliver you two hostages.<eos> I can't guarantee that the news media will even talk to you.
- You got it.<eos> - No.<eos> -I made you guys little fart bombs.<eos> -It's gonna be a gun farty party.<eos> Well, at least I'm suffering with you guys.
As usual, we'll rank our six contenders by testing them against three criteria.<eos> Number one, how long has the tech been annoying?<eos> Number two, how annoying is it versus how useful it might be?<eos> And this one, is number three, the potential to get worse.<eos> First up, I want to share with you one of my personal pet peeves.
[indistinct chatter]<eos> [Rachel] We were incredibly excited. We were... we were ready to go.<eos> Some of the gang were giving us their mobile phone numbers saying,<eos> "Call when you get to Britain."<eos> Some of them were saying, "Take me with you."
You're going alone."<eos> [Al-Hamati] As soon as we arrived at the place where we were supposed to receive Yolande, I put on the foundation T-shirt, which had the flag of South Africa on it.<eos> I got out of the car and was met by some armed men.<eos> We went into a room, and they said to us,<eos> "Yolande is here, safe and sound, and she is coming out to you now."
- Deal.<eos> Lame.<eos> Yawn.<eos> Stupid.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you, as always.
♪ ♪ I said, Dad, Dad Why don't you hug me?<eos> Where we headed?<eos> Our village is two miles away.<eos> We'll be there in five hours.<eos> What's up with you guys?
I should be calling the police.<eos> [laughs] Amish don't have police, or phones.<eos> Pee-wee, I beg you, please don't blow our cover.<eos> Me, Pepper, and Frecks will drop you in New York City on our way to Canada.<eos> Why would I go anywhere with you?
Me, Pepper, and Frecks will drop you in New York City on our way to Canada.<eos> Why would I go anywhere with you?<eos> You and your friends are nothing but trouble.<eos> Now you're stealing their horse and buggy?<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
Do you know where he is?<eos> Brodsky?<eos> In Moscow, I think.<eos> No, he's not in Moscow.<eos> We have information that tells us that he's staying here with you.
Get him out of here, because I will fucking kill him.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Move him now.<eos> Get these children out of here.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
As long as the books remain locked, we're safe... but when they open... well, you've just seen what happens.<eos> I'm allergic to dust mites.<eos> What's your point?<eos> I'm just saying, I have allergies too so I understand.<eos> Why am I talking to you?
But... How?<eos> How can you be here?<eos> I have a million questions to ask you, too.<eos> But right now we need to move.<eos> Did you bring anyone with you?
Old.<eos> But not obsolete.<eos> Not yet.<eos> All done.<eos> What's with you two?
I'm serious.<eos> We'll buy your swaps, but only if you say how you're fucking us.<eos> I'm not fucking you, Vinnie.<eos> I'm kissing you.<eos> I'm looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie.
Maybe I have defective engineering too.<eos> And if that's the case... is there any way to fix it?<eos> You are royalty now.<eos> I'm a splice.<eos> You don't understand what that means, but... I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.
They will abdicate your title and in return My Lord guarantees that he will do everything in his power to see that no harm comes to you or your family.<eos> You can't do it, Your Majesty.<eos> You cannot trust these people.<eos> If you abdicate, you'll have nothing to protect yourself.<eos> You're going to kill them if I don't come with you.
- You wound me, Mr. Wise.<eos> If I were trying to wound you, Mr. Night, you wouldn't be breathing.<eos> If it makes everyone feel warm and cozy, the Aegis is welcome to follow us.<eos> No.<eos> She won't be going anywhere with you.
So, Vinciguerra Island.<eos> The plot is... and stop me if I get this wrong, Jockelson... a stealth attack on the island from the sea.<eos> We shall go in through the front door here at the harbor.<eos> Jockelson and his men will get you in there and keep the enemy entertained.<eos> The rest is up to you.
My soul and the prince's soul.<eos> Your soul was over by the banquet tables.<eos> You didn't see him dance with me.<eos> Dance with you?<eos> He didn't even speak to you.
I don't know about you, but I'm happy to sit this one out.<eos> I didn't regret hitting "send," but I did regret how I left things with Jess and Casey.<eos> So all of this because of some word?<eos> It didn't feel like just some word to me.<eos> I think deep down I've always known you guys were prettier than me, and I felt like I couldn't talk to you about it because you wouldn't understand what it felt like to be your schlumpy friend.
I'll go for diamonds if you don't mind<eos> - Heil Hitler, everyone<eos> Ah, I see, voluntary disbanding<eos> Very sensible<eos> But if you think that the strike fund will disappear with you, you've got another thing coming
In fact, it took me a while to get used to it, but it's big.<eos> - It's a big change. - And it's...<eos> Whoomp, there it is.<eos> No, no.<eos> I can't talk right now with you.
No!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - My bag!<eos> My bag! I'm gonna finish you off.
What's up, guys?<eos> Mr.Macleish, are you familiar with a priest named Paul Shanley?<eos> Yes, I am familiar with him.<eos> And have you settled cases against Father Shanley?<eos> As I'm sure you can understand, I can't discuss that with you.
Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> "Adderall."<eos> God, your parents must be freaking out right now.<eos> You've been gone for hours.<eos> They must be so worried about you.
I don't make mistakes.<eos> It's Christmastime.<eos> My friends are here to celebrate with me.<eos> Get the fuck out of my house.<eos> Take this shit with you.
Please!<eos> All right, let's slow it down, ladies.<eos> We got some serious things to talk about right now!<eos> All right, is there anybody up in here... that ain't on birth control?<eos> Oh, no. I'm keeping it real with you, ladies.
Come on, guys, I think it's just over this hill.<eos> How do you expect us to go up to the surface?<eos> We won't be able to breathe!<eos> All right, all secondary characters come with me.<eos> - Yeah, I'm with you guys.
What's happening?<eos> I feel tingly!<eos> My neck!<eos> I've done all I can.<eos> The rest is up to you.
I didn't come in here looking for, you know, dicks.<eos> Maybe I can convince you to stay for a little bit?<eos> No, I was just...<eos> Hi, by the way.<eos> Again, I did not come in here to be with you guys.
My brother is in Switzerland on business.<eos> Is that what it's called?<eos> Your brother's sugar company is guilty of tax evasion amounting to one million Reichsmark.<eos> His assets have been frozen until the money is paid.<eos> This officer will be staying with you.
All you have to do is to admit that you took them illegally.<eos> Yes, and then, of course, come to some agreement on the question of compensation.<eos> I'm afraid we are not budging, and that is final.<eos> Can you help me understand the inflexible position that you're taking?<eos> We will not be paying for something we believe is ours, and we will fight you till the end before we concede on this.
Sharon from Colorado.<eos> Hi, Sharon.<eos> Hi, Sharon.<eos> Cindy and Joan!<eos> I can't believe I'm talking to you!
- Mr. O'Dwyer.<eos> - Sheriff?<eos> We'll mark our route with the four rocks so you can see it.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm comin' with you.
Hold still.<eos> Let me examine you.<eos> How bad?<eos> Mr. O'Dwyer... - you're stayin' behind.<eos> - No, no, I'm comin' with you.
I don't wanna wake up next month.<eos> And take the rest in case my wife needs it... or Deputy Nick.<eos> I'll put some in a whisky flask and I'll leave the remainder for you.<eos> But you don't take more than a spoonful a day.<eos> I don't know if I'll be awake... when you go so I want to apologize to you now for gettin' hot at you.
But when the moon comes out, the real monster fun begins.<eos> Being scary.<eos> Right, guys?<eos> Guys? Guys!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Come on in.<eos> They're on the Medway.<eos> Heading for London?<eos> It's time.<eos> Gentlemen, the people are counting on you.
They're on the Medway.<eos> Heading for London?<eos> It's time.<eos> Gentlemen, the people are counting on you.<eos> Over to you.
Oh, my God. My heart is pounding.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Who the fuck are you, man?<eos> I wanna fight you.
Greg, you hung out with Rachel once.<eos> You're befriending her to feel good about yourself.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Who even does that?<eos> You guys mind if I sit with you?
Hey. Hey, it's me.<eos> Hello!<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so glad to be...<eos> Hi.<eos> ...here with all you guys.
leaks to CNN in the next 90 so it makes the three o'clock news cycle, as well as the nightly news.<eos> That'd be good, too.<eos> Am I being tangible?<eos> Gary?<eos> Look around here. But I stay here with you.
Oh, he's right about the egg.<eos> That is magnificent.<eos> I'm gonna insist that you pay.<eos> Won't be needing this.<eos> My lawyer will be in touch with you.
We should really thank you for making this tour a reality.<eos> You know, with your bumbling ineptitude.<eos> We should send them something... a fruit basket?<eos> Or would you prefer mini muffins?<eos> Okay, we didn't come here to start something with you guys, we just wanted to check you out before the Worlds where we're gonna kick your ass.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys.
Yeah.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys.<eos> What?<eos> To Candor.<eos> I'm not coming with you guys.
JACK!<eos> - WE'RE OVER HERE.<eos> --JAC K!<eos> STAY TH ERE.<eos> I'M COMING TO YOU.
Mama.<eos> Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> Come on.<eos> No, it's a very attractive offer, and you know I would love to work with you guys.
And that's what you see when you're old.<eos> Everything seems really far away.<eos> That's the past.<eos> Brenda... Can't wait to get started.<eos> And I am so proud of having written this screenplay with you.
Waiting confirmation to strike.<eos> Fire!<eos> Agent Douglas, please confirm deployment.<eos> Fucking fire!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you!
- Let me explain.<eos> - Don't you fucking talk back to me.<eos> Either she's on her back, or she's out on the streets.<eos> But if it ain't one of the two come tomorrow, I'm gonna deal with it my way.<eos> I will be very honest with you.
Yeah, but you listened.<eos> Oh, and don't get us wrong, we're still gonna bill you.<eos> Just as soon as we figure out how to make bills.<eos> I did notice that you could use some help around here.<eos> And I owe you.
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.<eos> He's a goddamn sheriff I'm a monkey's uncle.<eos> Good.<eos> Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable.<eos> So the new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling with you?
Yes, Mrs. Kettleman, so good of you to return.<eos> Actually, I don't have Mr. McGill at the moment, but I know he...<eos> Oh, splendid.<eos> Unfortunately, our offices are being painted and the fumes are quite horrid.<eos> Could he meet you and your husband at, say, Loyola's Café on Central?
Yes. He's the captain of the soccer team.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Stroller soccer?<eos> - You're hilarious.<eos> I will be honest with you.
I'm your father, Beatrix.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad, no.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I wish I could go with you.
Yeah, so these guys are operators, working for someone called the Boss.<eos> Head of the local syndicate.<eos> - You got the camera yet?<eos> - No, we're on our way to get it now.<eos> OK, we'll meet you.
What do you think?<eos> Will they ever find those earrings?<eos> Funny thing about lost items, always in the last place you look.<eos> Thanks for coming in' guys.<eos> I look forward to working with you.
Because now you have the tools.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, shout them out and I'll tack them up.<eos> Jared, I'm... I'm really sorry, but I have to go.<eos> You know' would it make more sense if I worked something up and then I got back to you guys, and...
- I am trying to save you.<eos> It is not just the children.<eos> You have other responsibilities.<eos> Ragnar has left Kattegat in your care.<eos> There are folk who are waiting to see you.
This Harbard?<eos> Yes, he was a good man.<eos> Judith?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's the matter with you, Judith, hmm?
We must expect an attack any day now.<eos> Gisla, I regret not sending you to safety in time.<eos> It is much on my mind.<eos> I did not want to be sent away.<eos> I wanted to stay here with you.
Because no Christian king will ever be allowed to rule our world.<eos> It's unthinkable.<eos> An insult to our gods and our people.<eos> Then someone needs to kill him.<eos> - Princess Gisla, I want to talk with you.
Where's Aunt Claire?<eos> Okay. Those of you in the front of the train. Should be able to see our main gates.<eos> Please obey all park rules.<eos> Proper attire, including shoes and shirts, must be worn at all times.<eos> Your aunt arranged to greet you at 1:00.
You need to evacuate the containment area.<eos> Paddock 11.<eos> Paddock 11, do you copy?<eos> Yeah, what's the problem?<eos> It's in the cage! It's in there with you!
What is this?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Why didn't you come back?<eos> I was so worried about you. Who's that?
They will take care of your mother.<eos> And the baby?<eos> The baby will be fine, I'm sure.<eos> But will it be like us or like them?<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
She seems to have settled at 66.<eos> - Will they mind?<eos> - I hope not.<eos> We like to think we're a community.<eos> Well, it's nice to talk to you.
- Because I'm totes fab.<eos> Ah, okay, let's get a pizza.<eos> Michelle.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'll go with you guys.
I have gathered us....<eos> Please listen.<eos> Friends.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm here to share my thoughts with you openly and to answer all your questions as best I can about the recent tragedies.
Alone.<eos> -No. No.<eos> -You're too emotionally invested.<eos> You wanted to do this together, so I'm coming with you.<eos> Amy will see you now.
-You know what I want.<eos> -Doesn't happen overnight.<eos> We need more time.<eos> -Sarah.<eos> -And yet it worked for the two of you.
No one told you, did they?<eos> They didn't tell-- Mama, I-<eos> - I asked to come home.<eos> I wanted to move back.<eos> I wanna work with you.
Sheriff's department took over.<eos> It's hard.<eos> You want to be the one to catch the bastards.<eos> Point is, I know what this is like.<eos> Want you to know I'm here to work with you.
They have more basic needs.<eos> They were trying to find medical supplies for their wounded man.<eos> They can't go to the hospital.<eos> We could put our people outside local drugstores, let them come to us.<eos> I said I'd work with you.
You may kiss the bride!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Ah, they make a beautiful couple, absolutely beautiful.<eos> Okay, you two can spend an hour in here together.<eos> Bell will stay with you.
Look, other people gotta make a living, too.<eos> My salon has been empty all day.<eos> You think I don't know those Spanish girls been spreading shit about me?<eos> I don't wanna get involved.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Good, 58 more minutes.<eos> Who's tending bar?<eos> I'll shake and stir.<eos> Gotta be 5 p.m. somewhere.<eos> I really did miss being with you guys.
Can you guarantee the beach is safe?<eos> Can you?<eos> No, sir. Sergeant!<eos> Then keep your mouth shut!<eos> I've been too kind to you.
- Is that what...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Settled then.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm not done with you two yet.
- You weren't there.<eos> None of you! None of you have seen What has been happening in boston.<eos> Good men have lost their lives, And you are sitting here and arguing And look for someone to blame.<eos> Well, here I am!<eos> I am here. I'm here to work with you.
None of you! None of you have seen What has been happening in boston.<eos> Good men have lost their lives, And you are sitting here and arguing And look for someone to blame.<eos> Well, here I am!<eos> I am here. I'm here to work with you.<eos> I am here to work with you towards a solution.
Your Grace.<eos> There's a bug.<eos> Yes, best be careful.<eos> You might accidentally consume some solid food.<eos> When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions?
You made me marry him.<eos> To keep you here.<eos> And about your husband, you're to tell me everything he says, and everything he does.<eos> Thought I'd lost you.<eos> - I was worried about you.
You couldn't get it out?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow, the store looks great.<eos> So you guys were testing us both?<eos> What is the matter with you?
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?<eos> I'm afraid he does.<eos> I cannot disobey my king's command.<eos> She will return with you to King's Landing.
It was two farm boys.<eos> I killed them and burned them so no one would know.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?<eos> I can't talk to you anymore.
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.<eos> Hurry them along.<eos> - Right, Curlew. - Yes, sir. Dig between those two rises.<eos> - Spread out.<eos> - I'm with you.
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.<eos> Why would the Meereenese listen to him?<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> They will listen to Grey Worm.<eos> I'll come with you.
Also, try not to freak out about this, but I like you. We're not gonna get married or anything.<eos> Right?<eos> So you're good practice.<eos> Tiny Tim. What's up?<eos> Yo, I'm supposed to work with you guys.
No way, no how.<eos> Now, just hang on, everybody.<eos> Let's just be cool.<eos> There's 170 of us on this ship and, what ... 25 of you?<eos> You might take down some of us, but we will overrun you.
Let's hope that one sinks in.<eos> It pains me to admit it, but I couldn't wait to buy the place just so I could see the look on Larry's face when I fired him.<eos> Just let me know if you need anything else, okay?<eos> You guys just have a seat wherever.<eos> I'll be right with you.
If ever a man needed killing, it was him.<eos> We're raiding the Chisholms today, and now I'm a man short.<eos> And I could do with a tall, strong Scotsman who's swift with a sword.<eos> So unless you're prepared to dig seven graves, including your own...<eos> I'll ride with you.
Hello. My name is Price.<eos> Actually, that's not my name. But I have a nephew named Price. I've always kind of liked that name.<eos> Anyway, we're not dealing with names today.<eos> You can tell me or not tell me yours. Or a fake one is fine.<eos> If I need to talk to you, I'd prefer something other than "Hey, you."
Proud of a genius!<eos> Only a genius could fool the whole world.<eos> Only a genius could achieve the biggest energy monopoly in history.<eos> I'll sell my energy to the whole planet, and any country that doesn't wanna pay for it...<eos> Boom! I'll disintegrate it, as I'm gonna do right now, with you!
- Of course.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> I thought we were going to Playland.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> I'd love to go with you, but I don't have any money.
Listen to me.<eos> All of you.<eos> In any war, you have two choices.<eos> You can sue for peace on the best terms you can get. Or you can fight.<eos> If you choose to fight, we will stand with you.
What do they want?<eos> Maybe they're going to surrender.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Peace.<eos> We want to know what it would take to have peace with you.
Whatever it is...<eos> Whatever it is, they want it back and him dead.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Your turn.<eos> What does this have to do with you?
See you in four days!<eos> Make him work for it.<eos> Let us be seen as one Chilean with dignity.<eos> As a Chilean who stands side by side with the poorest.<eos> Here I am with the rest of you, my colleagues.
Wah-reeth al Ghul commands your presence.<eos> Leave us.<eos> - Is everyone okay?<eos> - Like you give a damn.<eos> - Didn't Malcolm speak to you?
But hear me, Jackie Peyton.<eos> You are a nonfactor in this hospital.<eos> That's a lot of old people.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, can we play with you?
Everything in here should recover the wiped info from the vic's devices, okay?<eos> Just plug it in.<eos> I already know all this, Krumitz.<eos> This is a big case.<eos> I should be coming with you to Boston.
How's your crew holding up?<eos> The entire ER nursing staff of a major city hospital walked out and nobody cared, so it's a tragedy.<eos> - Do you want some help?<eos> - From you?<eos> Just 'cause I'm not standing out here with you guys doesn't mean that I don't agree with what you're doing.
Well, we pick up what's left of us.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> We get you kids to the safe haven.<eos> Then we start over, I guess.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Do as he says.<eos> How dare you defy me!<eos> Open the doors or we'll kill you and open them ourselves.<eos> You dare bring an armed guard into my presence!<eos> ~ I must speak with you, sire.
Who burnt the school, why, how?<eos> -Everyone burns the schools.<eos> -Why do you say that ?<eos> -I do not want !<eos> I want to stay with you !
Sign the bill.<eos> If you don't, and the storm hits, you and I won't have a campaign.<eos> You should get back to your dinner.<eos> Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes for a second.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I actually have the same question.<eos> And that's your last question.<eos> This is my last answer. The connection I know, he's my man.<eos> He's never used this method to bring in stuff before.<eos> Juan's going with you.
We'll kill that bottle.<eos> I could use a drink.<eos> Stand down, stand down, stand down.<eos> I love being a cop.<eos> I love workin' with you.
- I will.<eos> - Be with those you love.<eos> - I am, Sire.<eos> You defy me?<eos> My place is with you.
I know you, Brother.<eos> I have only given you my love and respect.<eos> Do you say that fucking my wife?<eos> Someone has to!<eos> Everything I have I share with you, but you won't share the truth.
Only kings sit by His Majesty in a chair with arms.<eos> You are more than a king.<eos> You are my friend.<eos> I would like to hear stories about your son.<eos> In his last hours, he asked me to tell him about my life with you.
Not enjoying the hospitality? Hmm!<eos> There's a great deal of it!<eos> And more besides, as you'll see tonight.<eos> - What then?<eos> - I'll sit down with you.
Ask the Parthenays!<eos> That was when she had the bows in her hair!<eos> Yes, the picnic.<eos> Midsummer.<eos> - I was angry at you.
We are told not to play with fire, but they enjoy it.<eos> I see no merit in it, no skill.<eos> Oh I don't know.<eos> A little burning is good for the soul, don't you think?<eos> Joan of Arc might disagree with you, or Lucifer.
How you feeling, chief?<eos> Burning up.<eos> He got in my head.<eos> He made me steal something from the lab.<eos> You can't let him talk to you.
This is hard, sorry.<eos> We achieved a lot of great things in this restaurant.<eos> I don't know, I'm speechless,<eos> To be honest with you.<eos> I've written down a couple pages of stuff, But, you know, I speak from my heart from this, But I'd rather speak to you.
Wolfe has escaped containment into the ring, he could be anywhere on Level 9.<eos> Walker and Pilgrim?<eos> I've got eyes on Pilgrim.<eos> Walker is missing.<eos> - We're heading over to you.
That's why we're here.<eos> Those of you who want to volunteer raise your hands, and we will give you white shirts.<eos> Raise your hands if you want to unite!<eos> Hand them the t-shirts.<eos> It's been an honor for me to be here with you.
Do you remember where she treated you?<eos> That bitch is the one thing - that I can't forget.<eos> - How do we find her?<eos> I'll take you right to her.<eos> As long as you take me with you.
We knew you were upset about the press conference.<eos> We wanted to do something nice, so we got you Max Hardy's address, the code to her alarm system so you can kill her.<eos> When the time is right.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> And I-I shouldn't have acted out like I did without talking to you first.
- Hey. - Are you okay?<eos> Just a mild concussion but I'm okay.<eos> You guys, take her outside.<eos> No, Emma.<eos> I'll meet you out there.
You don't have the balls to fight me?<eos> This isn't you, Jess.<eos> We were happy.<eos> Whatever you think I did to hurt you, I'm sorry.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
As such, their overseers will often do or say things in their company they would never share in public.<eos> You've cared for Jack Connaughton for the last nine months.<eos> Did you hear anything strange during that time?<eos> Brett... people are dead.<eos> I can't talk to any of you about this.
I did a little research.<eos> The Plowmans are holding a public press conference the day after tomorrow and we gotta get there.<eos> So we're gonna train hop all the way to California?<eos> Tickets, please.<eos> Just messing with you.
I'll let you know if I find anything.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mrs. Fallon, we're with the FBI.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions about your son.<eos> The lawyer said I can't talk to you.
FBI wants to know the same thing.<eos> They're sending agent Scott to coordinate.<eos> Good.<eos> Hopefully, your case officer near Fatah can shed some light.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a minute?
W-- sir, we need to talk. Ladies and gentlemen, Isaac Monroe.<eos> I hate public speaking.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Why, he's a little full of himself, huh?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, to be honest with you, I'm not much of an adventurer.
You're gonna win this game tonight, you hear me?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> You're gonna win this game!<eos> You wanna know how I know that you're gonna win this game?<eos> Because it's not about you.
Hi, boys.<eos> Don't forget your tuxedos. Man!<eos> We're rich and famous but we still live with my parents?<eos> Of course not, don't be ridiculous.<eos> No, we live with you.
What's he saying?<eos> I don't speak any languages. Just my own.<eos> I'd say you're tourists, but tourists don't come here.<eos> A cab driver ripped you off saying this was Sultanahmet, huh?<eos> What are we gonna do with you?
We need to calm down.<eos> We cannot rule out that the tomb was opened and emptied by the authorities to flush us out and round us up.<eos> I saw him. Who?<eos> Jesus.<eos> He spoke to me, as clearly as I'm speaking to you now.
Same M.O. He was never able to crack it.<eos> Says his partner was a little obsessed with nailing this firebug.<eos> You know, the one that always got away.<eos> Let's talk to this cop.<eos> If he'll talk to you.
I need to be prepared... For whatever it is.<eos> We need to know everything we can.<eos> Just what it is, what we can do.<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll come find you.
You made it look like she was sleeping so you could buy enough time to escape the crime scene.<eos> No, I wanted to tell someone.<eos> But they wouldn't let me.<eos> They were scared of what he would do to us.<eos> Of what who would do to you?
He worships him.<eos> He doesn't want anyone to be near John but him.<eos> No one's good enough.<eos> You didn't answer the question.<eos> After I spoke with you guys, I got scared for John, so I had to find out.
You're disobeying Hera's orders.<eos> Were they orders, or more like her opinion?<eos> If we're gonna save him, we don't have a choice.<eos> - You with us or not?<eos> - Yeah, I'm with you.
But the problem is somebody will run the story.<eos> They're always making shit out to be worse than it is.<eos> Come here, brother.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm your boy. What's going on between you two?
So, you're leaving us?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I'm resigning my commission.<eos> I'm gonna stay here with you.
I don't fucking know, Terry.<eos> I got to think about it.<eos> Right now, I don't know.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> You tell Abby I appreciate the offer, but I can't move in with you.
I didn't know your church did that.<eos> We do.<eos> So, is this something...<eos> that you've been discussing?<eos> Well, Paige did come to me, and I told her it was a wonderful thing but that we needed to discuss it with you first.
It's not the end, Max.<eos> He knows how to survive better than any of us.<eos> We'll be together again, brother.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I'm not coming with you.
And we'll work through it. We'll help her work through it.<eos> Hey, I'm home!<eos> I got a chicken.<eos> I'm gonna make a pie.<eos> What's up with you two?
Here I come.<eos> Following after you in a very masculine and attractive way.<eos> Holy crap, Dylan left, like, a hundred messages.<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> What was going on with you two?
I don't know the next time<eos> We'll have fresh bread,<eos> Especially if this drought lingers.<eos> As providence decrees.<eos> Peace be upon you.
-You lied to me.<eos> -You lied to yourself.<eos> That's kind of your move.<eos> Something's off about you, though, isn't it?<eos> -It's always something with you boys--
-Sam?<eos> -Hey.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Dick Charlie just hotwired Baby.<eos> -She thinks she's on her way to you. -What?
- That's Seth.<eos> Is that Seth?<eos> That's Seth, isn't it? Mommy!<eos> He's sick, isn't he?<eos> - They tampered with you.
He got away.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> It's arterial-- he'll need a hospital.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I want to stay with you.
I'll make a few calls and get that sketch out there.<eos> You will recall, however, that Clay Dubrovensky was not bound with para-aramid rope, further suggesting he was not killed by the cartel.<eos> You still like Barbara Conway?<eos> Watson and I still believe that she had motive to want him dead.<eos> You're right, I was not entirely forthcoming with you yesterday.
No, I acted without thought and through fear alone.<eos> Honestly, I have killed rabbits with more courage than you.<eos> My brother deserves better.<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> The question is, what to do with you.
Especially the king.<eos> And who better to control the king than his own brother?<eos> Yes?<eos> Oh, Monsieur Marchal.<eos> I was worried about you.
Do you not belong at Versailles, Your Highness?<eos> Does His Majesty know of this?<eos> It was His Majesty's idea.<eos> I see.<eos> We rely on you to transmit this information to every noble in the palace. And anyone who is seen transgressing the rules of etiquette shall be sanctioned.
But you are so much more than a mere advisor.<eos> You realize he no longer loves you?<eos> Yet you still lie awake at night and dream of hearing his footsteps on the floor and the midnight knock at the door.<eos> You were and are my first love.<eos> Whoever I'm with, a part of me will always be with you.
Whoever I'm with, a part of me will always be with you.<eos> He will promise and beckon and you will continue to hope.<eos> You would've made a wonderful queen.<eos> He will promise and beckon and you will continue to hope.<eos> Whoever I'm with, a part of me will always be with you.
Kung Hei Fat Choy.<eos> Kung Hei Fat Choy.<eos> My name is Michael, c all me "The Knight of Gamblers" if you will.<eos> What's up?<eos> My master had some misunderstanding with you back there.
It's nothing.<eos> I saw francis at the party After lola said he wouldn't be attending.<eos> That he'd be with you.<eos> The whole castle knew of your plans tonight.<eos> Why didn't he stay with you?
Why else would your declaration frighten me so?<eos> I can promise you nothing, Given who I am and what I've been through.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> Was francis harsh with you?
Less of me.<eos> You.<eos> How have I offended you now?<eos> One question.<eos> Could sex with you be simple?
Where's Henry?<eos> He's coming.<eos> You'll never guess who came by the office today.<eos> - Pastor Tim? - Mm-hmm.<eos> He asked me if it was okay for him to arrange the mission trip with you guys this year.
Only has eyes for you.<eos> 24 hours-- we'll know our next steps.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you still doing up?<eos> I need to talk to you.
And it is a choice.<eos> Every day of my life, I still ask the same question that I asked in that bed, that hospital bed, every day.<eos> "Oh, Lord, why?"<eos> "Why did you let me see heaven and take it away from me?"<eos> I believe it is so that I could be here with you today and tell you to your face,
Yeah.<eos> You've got yourself a deal.<eos> And I thank you for that.<eos> I truly do.<eos> But I wasn't talking to you.
Not with francis.<eos> He loves mary.<eos> Things change, lola.<eos> If francis and mary are finished, There's an opportunity at the king's side For some lucky girl here.<eos> I need to speak with you.
Spa!<eos> Seriously, kidding, food.<eos> Alright lets get some grub.<eos> Eh, you guys go ahead.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
Who the hell are these clowns?<eos> They're your new partners.<eos> We work alone.<eos> That's funny, I was just about to say the same thing.<eos> Do I look like I'm negotiating with you people?
What, we're not gonna trust her now?<eos> Because she's not who we thought she was?<eos> Welcome to the goddamn club.<eos> The device is online, activating field, ten percent.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
-Right.<eos> -Taking in my surroundings.<eos> Go ahead, action.<eos> You guys go ahead.<eos> I'll catch up with you guys.
Why did you have to make it worse?<eos> I'll do better.<eos> I promise. I'm tired of giving you second chances.<eos> Hey, talk to us, hot stuff.<eos> I feel like I don't deserve to talk to you, because I have terrible news.
- 5.<eos> How are you feeling now?<eos> I can hold down broth, some, I can walk a bit now, but he's not eating. - OK.<eos> - He's not getting better.<eos> I'm going to stay with you.
Pam, shut up.<eos> Well, we tried.<eos> And just where, exactly, were you hoping to smoke that cigarette?<eos> Magnum P.I.'s house.<eos> But since I'm stuck in here with you people...
No.<eos> And that, my dear earthlings, is the key to understanding the entire universe.<eos> Well, at least as we understand it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ta-take us... with you!
Got ourselves another frozen stiff.<eos> You got a location?<eos> Route 4, mile marker 17.<eos> - Okay, we're on our way.<eos> - Yeah. I should probably go with you guys.
Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Now that we have a body, maybe that will give us some leverage.<eos> Taylor, we need to talk.<eos> My lawyer said not to speak with you.
Haven't seen another soul for months.<eos> We've been rationing our food, making runs when we need to.<eos> And there's decent hunting.<eos> Can you hang in a few more weeks?<eos> I can come and find you then.
I... i don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.<eos> This message is for the people who are holding sophie troy.<eos> We have received your demands and we are taking them very seriously.<eos> At this time, we want to ensure sophie's well-being And are willing to fully cooperate with you.
He was living with his foster parent, but last I heard, he left home.<eos> I felt we had failed him, but I had no proof who had done this.<eos> If this kid Simon thinks the janitor was involved, it could be revenge.<eos> Let's go the precinct and run a background on the janitor.<eos> Do you guys mind if I tag along with you?
I'll miss him.<eos> My God.<eos> You wretched brats.<eos> Your brother, my first-born son, and you can't find the decorum, the civility, to honor his memory.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
You can't bear to see me happy.<eos> It's not my fault, you're not getting any!<eos> The house seems like prison to me.<eos> It's good, I have Supriya, now.<eos> I was thinking, there's no point in wasting time with you guys.
Hey, then don't, you know, all right?<eos> I'm so not used to being interrupted.<eos> Oh, yes he is.<eos> What I wanted to say was good job.<eos> Actually, if I may, I just want to say it's really been an honor working with you guys.
I didn't stay with you guys after peru...<eos> Because i didn't know if i could get the job done.<eos> And i didn't want you to see me fail.<eos> The truth binds it.<eos> I didn't stay with you after peru Because i wanted to prove that i could do it alone.
Come on, Rosie.<eos> Ugh, you killed me, Carrie.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I'm gonna give Jay a call.<eos> Hey, everything all right with you guys?
I'd hoped that she'd just gone back to her country, but... I'd been around too many cops for too many years to really believe that.<eos> It's our understanding that one of your reelection team was briefly considered a suspect.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just...<eos> I've been advised not to talk to you.
As my daughter, Casey, once told me...<eos> A little odd, isn't it, that I'm gonna tell you a cute, little story about my daughter when really...<eos> I-I mean she's a great kid, my Casey.<eos> But we are talking about the entire government of the United States of America, and this is... Real.<eos> And I'm s-standing here talking to you. And I just...
He's worked for me occasionally.<eos> But not recently.<eos> Do you have any idea how we could locate him?<eos> Personnel files are protected information.<eos> Sorry, but, I can't share those with you.
Last time we spoke it was about one of your clients,<eos> Argento International.<eos> And because this man worked for me in the past, you think there might be some connection between Argento and this kidnapping.<eos> I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I can assure you there's no connection whatsoever.<eos> If I come across any information that might be useful I'll share it with you at once.
Well, if he can't overcome it,<eos> If his fever won't break, and soon,<eos> The king will die.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't believe I'm here with you.
Your grace.<eos> That was a fine performance.<eos> I don't doubt your concern for your husband is real.<eos> Pity I can't say the same for your lover.<eos> If francis dies, condA© could marry you.
I thought you said that these woods Were too dangerous for me alone.<eos> And now you're sending me off with a messenger?<eos> He made it here safely.<eos> The woods between here and the castle are well-patrolled.<eos> As it happens, I have other reasons For not riding on with you.
And that's why I had Monsieur Alves bring the five of you together.<eos> Five?<eos> I count four.<eos> This is Chloe Tousignant.<eos> She will also be working with you.
We have travelled far... How did you do that?<eos> ! Magic.<eos> .. And much treasure.<eos> How dare you...? !<eos> I am very, very cross with you.
The Durst Family...<eos> His father or brothers...<eos> Never offered to help us, or never said,<eos> "Look, we have a private investigator involved in it.<eos> Anything he finds he'll share with you."
How about 50,000 livre? (chuckles) Is that all?<eos> Why not take my diamond earrings?<eos> They're worth 60.<eos> Seriously, what will it take?<eos> My lady, I would love to stay chatting with you all day, but I have other duties.
I think we'd be good together, perhaps have a future.<eos> This is sudden.<eos> Not really.<eos> You've been flirting with me since the day we met.<eos> You should know that if I choose to be with you, there are things in my past that I can't change.
Do you realize that by helping Condé escape, Elizabeth could have a foothold in France?<eos> Condé's army is loyal to him.<eos> If he becomes king consort of England, we will essentially have an enemy army on our soil.<eos> Mary, this is the most dangerous thing you have ever done.<eos> Her Majesty Elizabeth still rejoices in the idea of marrying you.
And I want to have my way with you without worrying who might see us.<eos> I thought that added to the allure.<eos> It did, at first.<eos> But in the few weeks we've had together, I've come to care for you.<eos> I see the life I could have with you.
And now that you've failed...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Truly.<eos> I meant everything I said.<eos> I wanted a life with you.
- Oh, we're, um...<eos> Graduate students of criminology and forensics.<eos> We're tagging along.<eos> What she said.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Parks, I'm sorry, I have bad news to share with you.
He's like that with all the girls.<eos> But he was just telling me and Cookie that you can really blow.<eos> What?<eos> He thinks you got a million-dollar voice.<eos> You know, I can't wait to see what he's gonna do with you, Laura.
Yeah, and the director is trying to get some behind the scenes footage of the rehearsal. But this whole commercial... this is just a part of the plan that I have for Jamal.<eos> You're the other part of it.<eos> I don't think I can stay in my lane, Lucious.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When you first started, you blazed a new trail. You were out of the box. And that's what Jamal is doing, and... that's why I want to work with both of you.
His arrest numbers are staggering.<eos> His conviction rate is magnificent.<eos> He is blotter dynamite.<eos> I mean, I'm cool.<eos> I'm just hanging out with you guys.
See, I don't think that you did.<eos> Because you fled. Without the money.<eos> Because you are suspects, in the murder of a US ambassador's daughter, the FBI wants to extradite you.<eos> They will take you to a facility, and you will be tried as terrorists.<eos> Do you have any idea what they'll do to you in there?
NOPD's on the way.<eos> You tell 'em to bring a translator?<eos> 'Cause I can't understand a word Baryshnikov here is saying.<eos> I was gonna take a semester in Moscow, but it's too cold.<eos> Why I should talk to you?
I have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law.<eos> I have a right to an attorney, and since I can definitely afford one, one will not have to be provided for me...<eos> Listen, you idiot, you murdered your own sister, all right?<eos> With these rights in mind, I would prefer not to speak to you at this time.
Oh. Oh, no.<eos> [crying] - Ma'am?<eos> - It's all right, officers.<eos> (Goodwin) Come in. Come in, please.<eos> I think the police may want to speak with you.
He wants to meet.<eos> - About what?<eos> - He won't say.<eos> He's still worried about leaks.<eos> I'll have to catch up with you later.
And if he were to die, it might be possible that I will be regent.<eos> God in heaven!<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Not a word to anyone.<eos> This is a testing time but I know with you by my side, - I can overcome anything.
Your majesty, let me go.<eos> If it's the house, this may be an attempt on your life.<eos> Wait for me here.<eos> General, your bravery will not soon be forgotten.<eos> We owe you a great debt of gratitude.
Sure.<eos> Ah, I notice you've been taking pictures the last couple of days.<eos> Yeah, just... feels good to focus on something other than myself.<eos> Tanner called.<eos> Now, that Andrew has been released she's eager to meet with you girls.
No, you're gonna explain right now.<eos> Why were you following us?<eos> She didn't want us to find this.<eos> Just give it back to me, okay?<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with you guys.
Hey! Hey!<eos> Against the wall!<eos> I got your girl.<eos> I swear I'll kill her.<eos> I'm not playing with you.
What about the hit man from the Arkady sting a few weeks ago?<eos> Nicolai Brantov.<eos> Yeah, Callen thought he was working for the Russians.<eos> Well, whoever he was working for, they obviously haven't packed up and gone home.<eos> Kensi, what's happening with you guys?
It's funny... coordinates you gave us put the tanker in the middle of the Sahara Desert.<eos> Must have been typo.<eos> Try again.<eos> No typos this time.<eos> No typos... if you take me with you.
- I don't understand.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> What the hell?<eos> I want to say it has been a pleasure to have worked alongside all of you for the past 21 1/2 months.
And after he left the hotel, you didn't go back to the party.<eos> No, I was invited by a friend for a drink at a bar around the corner.<eos> And we were there until I heard about Dennis.<eos> Her name's Andrea Schuster. I can give you her number.<eos> Can I talk to you guys a second?
He and his sister grew up in that area, but it doesn't look like anyone else is still around.<eos> A few of the guys have been helping make calls.<eos> Wake up all the Dilby's owners and collect surveillance videos.<eos> We were just gonna see how they're doing.<eos> Oh, I'll be with you guys in a minute.
If this is not rectified, your casino will face substantial fines.<eos> Possibly closure.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Well, let me look into it, and I'll get back to you.
Hey, this man's gut-shot.<eos> He needs a doctor.<eos> No doctors.<eos> You still with us?<eos> Yeah. I'm still with you.
We should be able to get the plastic up in time, though<eos> Hjortur, take these with you.<eos> 'Ladies and gentlemen, the ferry will be docking in 20 minutes.<eos> 'Please, get ready to go to your cars.<eos> 'Remember to have all your luggage with you.
You making yourself our leader?<eos> No, I'm not asking you to fight for me.<eos> I'm asking you to fight with me.<eos> We fight or we die.<eos> If you're killing angels, we're with you. Good.
- I got a map.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> I got it from Malvado's brother.<eos> Kill me, you're lost down there.<eos> Take me with you, we all get what we want.
We're looking, Dr. Brennan.<eos> No preconceptions, just observe.<eos> What am I missing?<eos> Ugh, am I that bad of a teacher?<eos> Have I wasted all of these years on you people?
- And you want me to keep you all safe.<eos> - Can you?<eos> I'll need help, obviously.<eos> Gallifrey is at your command.<eos> Oh, not from you lot.
Listen, we're actually really lost, and we're lookin' for this cabin...<eos> We passed one awhile back.<eos> I wanted to crash there, but uh, Brad here, wanted to push on.<eos> Rest is the reward, not the goal.<eos> Please, take me with you.
Ride the main trail north.<eos> It leads to Castle Ventris.<eos> They can wait there.<eos> Just follow on.<eos> I'll be with you.
My behavior.<eos> This is not who I am.<eos> Perhaps it's that other life.<eos> The one you believe God intended?<eos> Trying to find its way and have a word with you.
It was more of a marital nature.<eos> Station Sir Norton outside the door.<eos> That is all, Reeve.<eos> Why are we here, Corbett?<eos> Sir Huxley has yet to return from his travels with you.
Best guess is on your phone, Mr. Deeks.<eos> I'll let you know if he moves.<eos> Find him?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> All right, I'm coming with you.
Not everything's the same as the last time we met.<eos> Case in point.<eos> This Ant's gonna make you say, "Uncle!"<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> I'm not through with you! Let me...
Will Olivia Pope become our next first lady or the first lady to take down a sitting president?<eos> It's late, Mellie.<eos> I know.<eos> I take it you've seen the news.<eos> That's why I called you here... because I wanted to talk to you...
I want you to stay here with Nusrat.<eos> We need to be good to each other today.<eos> We need to be stronger together.<eos> Come.<eos> NUSRAT: I've decided to delay my flight to-to London until after the funeral, if that's all right with you.
Now, tell me... where am I and how the hell did I get here?<eos> A curse?<eos> That brought you to our realm and wiped the last six weeks from your memory.<eos> Who would do that?<eos> We weren't completely honest with you on the way to Camelot.
He would never think to use it because he believes the dagger will be his strength, and this gauntlet... It leads you to a person's greatest weakness.<eos> So I'm going to finish this damned quest and get back the man I love.<eos> And you cannot stop me.<eos> Stop you?<eos> I'm joining you.
- It's mine!<eos> I know, bud, I'm losing it, too.<eos> Ruff, Tuff, wait up!<eos> How about a couple of impartial judges for the Thorston challenge?<eos> For the love of the Thor, take us with you!
Hookfang can't take on that Totan Wing alone.<eos> He won't be alone.<eos> - Neither will you.<eos> - We've gotta do this ourselves.<eos> No way! That thing will tear you apart.
In the moments before you asked me to flee with you, I saw your brother.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Father is coming.<eos> We have to leave.<eos> Well, then I will come with you.
It absorbed the minds of our people.<eos> We didn't notice until it was too late.<eos> The people it takes over, they -- they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not themselves anymore.<eos> They're part of...it.<eos> Then how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you?
- Where are you, Tosh?<eos> - I'm right here.<eos> Where?<eos> And now we know water washes it off.<eos> - Whatever has gotten into you?
Patterson, nice work.<eos> Keep working on the tattoos.<eos> - Hey, you have to stay here.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I'm coming with you.
You will give me nothing!<eos> You will watch, and you will learn!<eos> Put him in the water before his mother's tongue gives me grief.<eos> She's not my mother.<eos> Will you take him with you to battle to watch and learn?
We will, erm...<eos> We will continue with a moment of silence to help find the peace once more.<eos> This interruption cannot be allowed to go unpunished.<eos> It must be death.<eos> Peace be with you, my dear.
- I'm here with the president and the Secretary of State.<eos> They've promised that the United States is gonna honor its deal with you, but something unexpected has come up.<eos> What?<eos> What unexpected?<eos> The Taliban are coming for you.
We can work out the details on the way.<eos> Thank you, and thank you.<eos> - Give your mother my best.<eos> - I will.<eos> I'll be with you in just a second.
- So Frankie killed Isaac?<eos> - Nope.<eos> According to Frankie, Isaac was killed by a guy wearing a weird looking animal outfit.<eos> I didn't press him.<eos> I leave the pressing to you.
What about Frankie?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Have you told Amanda Proctor yet?<eos> We wanted to do background first.<eos> I should go with you on this one.
No!<eos> Selina.<eos> They have Johnny?<eos> Sounds like they have her, too.<eos> Well, if you're dealing with the Rat King, we're going with you.
Your spirit will become my own.<eos> And I swear this world will pay for coming between us.<eos> Brothers and sisters.<eos> We have arrived home.<eos> I am speaking to you in the language of this new world.
I must see this with my own eyes.<eos> - Lord, that is not advisable.<eos> - I've made up my mind.<eos> If there is treachery, it is something I must witness.<eos> - I'll go with you.
All right.<eos> We got to get in position for when they get off that roof.<eos> Okay, now for chemistry class: Ferric oxide and aluminum shavings create thermite.<eos> Which, when ignited, burns with heat intense enough to burn steel. Okay.<eos> Well, I've been working with you guys for a while. I pick up things. Okay.
Agent Hotchner.<eos> Who's this?<eos> This is Morpheus.<eos> Do you have Corinne Wallace?<eos> No. That's why I wanted to speak with you.
Maybe we're changing.<eos> Maybe... maybe I'm not a robot either.<eos> You're not normal people, are you?<eos> Greetings submerged.<eos> Toby Curtis here, talking to you underwater.
Fought so hard for me.<eos> All that's left now is to enjoy my final hours.<eos> We should call for Catherine.<eos> No. No.<eos> I want my last hours to be in peace. Alone with you.
You seem remarkably cheery.<eos> Oh, I am.<eos> I've put it all together.<eos> I know about the rat.<eos> You planted it in Lola's bath to scare her into marrying you.
That's not the pest were dealing with.<eos> Kenny! Outside.<eos> Lock 'em up.<eos> Join him in there, Arthur.<eos> You boys sit tight until we figure out what to do with you.
Checkmate and all of that.<eos> Now for sure you got a question to ask me, don't you?<eos> Aah! You want to know... who gave me the names of the Federal Agents that shot my little brother.<eos> You guys don't got a clue.<eos> One of your own... is gonna burn you down from the inside.
Between Uber, Lyft and GrubHub, way less than 500.<eos> Five hundred?<eos> That is the worst birthday present ever.<eos> Luqman Badr Al Din.<eos> I'll be honest with you.
Thank God you're okay.<eos> That's Dallas's truck over there.<eos> You got to walk the rest of the way.<eos> You're not staying in the car. What?<eos> If he sees me with you, he's gonna kill me.
All right, look, next time the guys go out, you're in.<eos> Nah.<eos> Nah, I think I'll pass.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yeah, I didn't actually want to hang out with you Neanderthals.
We do not wish to fight you, only to trade.<eos> We will not be intimidated!<eos> Tell this to your neighbor.<eos> Convey my words!<eos> We do not wish to fight you, but should you elect to raise your hand to us, we will conjure a wrath of violence upon you that will reverberate for generations to come.
Sí, sí.<eos> This was my line.<eos> Oh!<eos> Well, that is such a sweet invitation.<eos> Well -- But unfortunately, I've got a massage appointment, So I won't be able to join you.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Yo, uh, Chenoweth.<eos> Wait up!<eos> Oh, you guys, that was so much fun.<eos> I've always wanted to perform with you.
Cornwall.<eos> How will we ever see each other?<eos> We won't.<eos> Cornwall is Amy's best chance of survival.<eos> She knows even now I would rather be here, with you.
Don't go back to Scotland.<eos> Charles.<eos> Court Don Carlos or any other prospects here.<eos> We'll show Spain that you will always have power as long as you are aligned with France.<eos> That you will have the House of Valois... the new king... behind you.
Yeah?<eos> Well, it happens to us every day.<eos> Why doesn't someone man the big gun?<eos> That's no good in this situation.<eos> Oh. Kinda like you guys.
I'll take care of this.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No.<eos> I have to go alone.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
That's a sexy machine.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> NCIS, Mrs. Hudson.<eos> Your husband home?<eos> Yes. We'd like to talk to both of you.
- No. No. It's for one of Bailey's patients.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> She put all her services on hold to fix her giant problem.<eos> She had me push two procedures for this.<eos> She's doing it to you guys, too.
So you're not part of Libertad for the money.<eos> Then why do it?<eos> I'm guessing it started as a simple addiction to painkillers or benzos.<eos> That you were a bored housewife and Libertad tapped into your hidden ambition and business skills.<eos> My husband's gonna have a field day with you.
So... we go into the church and I was like, "I got this under control."<eos> And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit.<eos> No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400.<eos> And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said,<eos> "Peace be with you."
Huh? What?<eos> When? When?"<eos> For those of you that aren't Catholic, I don't mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but...<eos> There's a part in church where the priest says,<eos> "Peace be with you."
You just immediately sound caught off-guard.<eos> It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren't expecting it.<eos> Like, the priest was like,<eos> "Hey, this is the first time we've ever had church.<eos> I just wanna say, 'Peace be with you.'"
Okay, okay, fine, but, um, what about you?<eos> I used your pic. You're much hotter than me.<eos> Enough with the low self-esteem!<eos> Seriously. I'd spank you before Walsh.<eos> What's going on with you, honestly?
You look awfully young to be a doctor.<eos> Oh, I'm a medical student.<eos> Sarah Reese.<eos> Why don't you come with us?<eos> Come with you?
I don't want you to suffer.<eos> It was wrong of me to ask you to stay.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I want to be around you.<eos> And I want to be with you.
Or do you seek something from him?<eos> Come here.<eos> I need his vote to gain control, which I need to protect my family.<eos> But for him to give me this power, he needs to think that he has power over me.<eos> And he does. Because he bedded you.
You speak as if he's leaving without an engagement to you.<eos> Mary, Scotland needs Spain.<eos> Did you even try?<eos> No matter what you might think, I can't just force men to fall in love with me.<eos> Did he tell you why he wouldn't marry you?
Delphine, when I told you<eos> I wanted you out of my head, I was just scared.<eos> Any time I've opened myself up, I've been hurt.<eos> My brother, my wife, my parents.<eos> But with you, it feels different.
Now, what do I...?<eos> It helps if you create a scenario.<eos> Tell me why I must be punished.<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> Um, I'm very disappointed in you?
Stop!<eos> Just from the sound of your screaming, - I think maybe we should stop.<eos> - Who are you talking to? !<eos> You.<eos> I'm talking to you.
Lies.<eos> I am Drax the destroyer.<eos> Who else would I be?<eos> Something's making you all act like your old selves.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Looking wonderful in that suit.<eos> And there you have it.<eos> Point, a shrug, no grunt.<eos> The man has not changed.<eos> I'm glad I could reach you guys.
They Molotoved what used to be a room back there.<eos> It's where I found the other two bodies.<eos> And your friend Liz was here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She, uh... she loved working with you guys.
I do not know.<eos> We'll protect you, Bahar. No.<eos> You leave.<eos> Always leave. We stay.<eos> They kill me for talk to you.
It was a vicious beast.<eos> It dragged Paul into the woods.<eos> Sheriff, you saw the body.<eos> Look, when we have more information,<eos> We'll let you all know.
We are adjourned for today.<eos> Mrs. Avery, I'm Angenette from Channel 5.<eos> - We just wanted to ask you...<eos> - My son is innocent.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
Your mom and me, okay...<eos> Well, your mother, okay, is a piece of work, all right.<eos> I think you know that by now, all right?<eos> And I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be with the two of you, okay?
Thanks.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> No, I think we're just gonna hang here for a minute.<eos> You want me to stay with you?
Happy high school graduation, Mason.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, guys, let's be clear.<eos> We're gonna break this into four categories.<eos> One, anything you want to keep from your childhood and you're taking with you.
Hello.<eos> Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you today.
Human victims... Y'all are leaving?<eos> This whole operation's being run out of the Houston office.<eos> That's my hood.<eos> Freddy will be close by.<eos> Behind locked doors... I'm going with you.
I so did not understand the ending of Lost.<eos> Raph?<eos> I just...<eos> If this is our last moment together, I just want you guys to know I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I was so hard on you.
You always say that you left your band to become a better dad.<eos> But you were a great dad when you were in the band.<eos> You didn't have to give up something you loved so much just for us.<eos> No, baby, I didn't give anything up.<eos> I played that adventure out, and then it was time for a new adventure with you guys.
- Who's gonna run the bar?<eos> - Gail.<eos> - Maybe you could check on her every now and again?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Well, you've got something you'd better take with you, then.
Is share a meal with the special people in my life.<eos> Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?<eos> No, wait, guys!<eos> Wait up!<eos> Okay, I'll meet you there.
That ought to make the boss happy, right?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Toothless, stay.<eos> The dragons don't care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you.
We're actually moving. And there's no honking.<eos> No honking. Hey.<eos> I'm gonna have these two over to the house to watch some cricket.<eos> It'll be nice to watch it with somebody who appreciates it for once.<eos> He wants to watch cricket with you.
Mary had a couple of years on him and they both wanted out.<eos> Up and out.<eos> Mary saw Frankie as her chance, and she poured it all into him.<eos> Love?<eos> I'll be honest with you.
Go home.<eos> Take care of your wife.<eos> Thanks, Tommy.<eos> I owe you.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Don't get me started, baby.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Could use a little more color.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Pleasure working with you.
Just me... my beautiful wife... and a good cigar.<eos> Quiet and peaceful... in the knowledge... that none of this could have happened... without me.<eos> By the way... you're ever in Vegas, go to any casino, say the name Tommy DeVito.<eos> My hand to God... you'll be out of there in about 12 seconds.<eos> All right, I'll be honest with you.
Calm, calm, calm.<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> - Take it easy!<eos> Just relax.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you guys?
Yeah, I did, too. Learn some shit.<eos> Hey, you guys were wacked out on Peruvian mescaline, of course you'll learn some shit.<eos> I went under during a colonoscopy last week, I learned some shit.<eos> Don't patronize us, man.<eos> Listen, we don't know how else to say this, but we're worried about you guys.
All of my kind must leave tonight.<eos> But, Saoirse, you are part human.<eos> If I take her coat, our worlds will be untangled.<eos> Mum...<eos> And she can stay with you.
i have to go now.<eos> -i know what you are.<eos> what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> you, don't move.<eos> i need to see the two of you outside right now.
-Mike. -Yeah.<eos> -Big John.<eos> -Nice job.<eos> Nice work, fellas.<eos> It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Thank you very much to the two of you.<eos> As you can tell, so many questions remain unanswered.<eos> We will bring you the latest information as it becomes available.<eos> For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1 .<eos> Let's send it back to you.
Who are those two cuties?<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yo!<eos> - Too bad I can't be there to hang out with you guys.
Once you drop it, target is destroyed.<eos> Sir, we've all had trainings in... the US version of smart-bombing.<eos> It's too risky with US ammunition... too much traced evidence.<eos> Tracking profile is tricky... even on the latest NAVY stuff.<eos> That's why Ms. Zhukova is going in with you.
- Ham?<eos> - He's here.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> I don't belong here.<eos> For what it's worth, I'm glad that it begins again with you.
- Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where should we go?<eos> Meet at the place on the corner?<eos> I'll catch up with you later.
No, you talking to me.<eos> Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?<eos> I don't see anyone else here.<eos> I don't see anyone else here, either!<eos> We're trying to talk to you.
One hand!<eos> - Well, that's not safe.<eos> - No. I am ripping shit up! Yeah!<eos> Enjoy my spray!<eos> Because I'm spraying you!
- I know.<eos> Yeah, we're going to need more tomatoes.<eos> We'd better write it on the...<eos> write it down on the board.<eos> These canvasses represent my dreams of the last few years, and I'd like to share them with you.
I'm sold.<eos> I wanna invest.<eos> We got one.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Now, how would I get in touch with you guys?
There, you will find a red bag.<eos> You will transfer the money into this bag, then drive out and await the location of the drop.<eos> And we tell him if anyone follows him in, his son's a fucking corpse.<eos> And when Bert drives that far underground the police will lose the signal from his wire.<eos> But when he arrives, instead of finding a bag he finds you three.
I know I'm not supposed to say this, let alone think it.<eos> This streak's our legacy.<eos> We will never experience anything like this again in our lives.<eos> You guys are all my family... but after tomorrow night, this will never be like this again.<eos> I'll never forget my time on this team, or with you.
Nobody wins 151 football games straight without cheating.<eos> We will not play De La Salle next season.<eos> Great.<eos> Done.<eos> We don't wanna play you either.
Bring it down.<eos> Alumbaugh's pulling the team together.<eos> Okay. Good.<eos> I talked to my doctors... and they don't feel that I should come back to coaching you.<eos> But rather than drawing this whole thing out... I'm just gonna be truthful with you.
I have no idea.<eos> I haven't talked to them.<eos> You haven't called your wife's parents yet?<eos> You can't get a signal in this building.<eos> I've been in here talking to you.
Jesus!<eos> Ignore him.<eos> He's nothing but a horny old bastard.<eos> You must be pretty tough, hiking this fucking trail.<eos> I'm in a car with you, taking a ride.
Sorry, little buddy.<eos> My house!<eos> Benny!<eos> You bodied that guy's grocery cart.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> No, no, no. I sang for you and you owe me.<eos> What's that?<eos> He called you a witch.<eos> Okay. What is wrong with you?
I am really proud of her for letting go.<eos> I really am.<eos> Was she a freak?<eos> I bet she was.<eos> I'm not talking about the details with you.
This is an emergency situation.<eos> We have a plane down, it's search and rescue...<eos> Repeat, this is an emergency.<eos> Come on, there has to be someone out there.<eos> What is wrong with you?
How's about giving me and Worm a ride?<eos> Huh? Okay, Butch.<eos> That'll be one dollar.<eos> I was thinking more like you pay me.<eos> How much you got on you?
Me and the gang wanted to let you know we've heard in the news that there's been a bit of a squabble down there on campus.<eos> One of your professors insisted that God is dead.<eos> Well, I'm happy to announce that the reports of God's death were greatly exaggerated.<eos> Now, let me ask you a question.<eos> Have you got your cell phones on you?
Get in.<eos> Sir.<eos> Does this concern my missing soldier, Hook?<eos> It does, doesn't it?<eos> We'll come with you.
Yes.<eos> Of course I do, come on.<eos> I'm just high, man. I'm just high.<eos> Forget I said any of this stuff, okay?<eos> I just wanted to talk things through, you know, before I jump off the bridge.
You, kid, outta here.<eos> - Wait...<eos> - Just...<eos> Can I...<eos> Can I come with you guys?
Right.<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> You'll miss your train!<eos> I'll catch the evening train.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Of course it worked.<eos> Doubted the Zombie Squad?<eos> Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?<eos> He did not.<eos> It has been a true honor killing zombies with you.
Go, radio him in.<eos> Lockdown behind you.<eos> He went that way.<eos> He went that way.<eos> He went that way. Peace be with you.
- Guys...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Know what I'd really like?<eos> - No.<eos> - A typical evening with you.
We got that.<eos> If I don't stop you, I lose my job.<eos> If you stop us, you'll lose your teeth.<eos> Then again, we're in briefs...<eos> We'll leave you to it.
You called me and said there was an electrical fire.<eos> What do you think about the game so far, Comish?<eos> I'm an employee of the university!<eos> There is no Comish.<eos> What's wrong with you guys?
Part of me, I always felt that I'm running after you.<eos> -Trying to catch the train.<eos> -Girls!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Merren would like to talk to you.
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.<eos> So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?<eos> Categorically.<eos> I would like to speak with the Mountain.<eos> I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
Her sunburn's looking a lot better too.<eos> That's a healthy-looking animal.<eos> She sure is.<eos> Okay, guys, I have Mandy's test results here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you two about them first before I briefed anybody else.
No one's sending you away, baby.<eos> - You're lying, both of you.<eos> Please, honey, just get in the car. No.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you!
That's why you're here.<eos> Now look into each other's eyes. And pledge to go as far as your soul will allow.<eos> Swear it now.<eos> Give your assent, Mr. Chandler, or leave this company and its mysteries behind.<eos> I'm with you.
I'll go. You're not the fucking guvnor here.<eos> Is this what's it all about with you, Trent?<eos> I thought this was about Mickey?<eos> You two, I can't have this here, not now, alright?<eos> Now fuck off, I'll see you later.
Yeah, I heard of that.<eos> Then you've lived a large life, my friend, not many people have.<eos> What the fuck is a "gadji"?<eos> It's what Gypsies call outsiders.<eos> I'm dropping ancient knowledge here, shared only by my people, but now, I'm sharing it with you.
You get there.<eos> I'm gonna run along the tree line.<eos> Listen.<eos> I'll run along the tree line.<eos> I'm gonna distract it, and I'm gonna meet you there. Okay?
On the roof!<eos> Connor!<eos> Connor!<eos> He's alive, I know he is.<eos> Please, take me with you.
I know you have rain here in the summertime.<eos> Well, we don't... California, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> No, it seems you don't.<eos> Is that young man here?<eos> Did you bring him with you?
What is dead may never die.<eos> What is dead may never die.<eos> And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?<eos> Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.<eos> He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.
- Loved your mother.<eos> - No.<eos> - That's what you wanted to say.<eos> He loves you, Aunt Lysa.<eos> He's married to you.
The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.<eos> I swore to your mother by the old gods and the new.<eos> I don't care what you swore.<eos> - Arya! - You heard the girl.<eos> - She's not coming with you.
- Let's begin.<eos> Your relation to the plaintiff?<eos> I live with my sister Rachel and her husband. For how long?<eos> Eight years, Your Honors.<eos> The plaintiff lives with you?
- Come on, walk.<eos> - We were okay.<eos> Call it in.<eos> Oh well, looks like it's back to confiscating beach fireworks for me.<eos> - I really enjoyed my time with you guys.
We're having too much fun.<eos> Listen up.<eos> Even with the Blade, we're gonna need all the help we can get against Abaddon.<eos> Go find the Blade.<eos> It's always something with you boys, isn't it?
I guess there's enough of that blame to go around, then.<eos> Dean.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Um... I know this may sound a little crazy, but...<eos> Maybe I could come back and hunt with you.
For me.<eos> And not just me.<eos> For my dad.<eos> Please...<eos> Can I count on you guys?
Like a classic rock band whose hold-out member finally needs money.<eos> Wow. Everyone's back together except Gramma and Grampa.<eos> Oh, I think that's about to change.<eos> Aren't you going to work, Dad?<eos> One of us has to stay home with you guys.
You know why?<eos> 'Cause you're just gonna get in our way.<eos> Or you're gonna get somebody else killed.<eos> So, you can either walk out of here or crawl.<eos> Up to you.
Then he's not human.<eos> So, what, we got monsters killing monsters now?<eos> Maybe.<eos> We got to see the body.<eos> I'm coming with you.
If she has her cell, we could trace the signal.<eos> Yeah, you might be right.<eos> All right.<eos> What's her number?<eos> Take me with you, and it's all yours.
Sorry.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I'd like to take a moment to welcome you all back.<eos> I want you to know how moved I am that you've accepted me as your new God.<eos> My heart, as they say, is full. Which is why I want to share some wonderful news with you.
Follow my lead, viking.<eos> (grunts) Star-lord, you have to listen.<eos> I know how it looks, But tony stark always has a plan.<eos> If this is his plan, it's failing.<eos> Star-lord: Gamora, hawkeye, you're up.
Well, maybe we could host a benefit luncheon to combat gun violence.<eos> Wouldn't that be better?<eos> How would that be better?<eos> Everything's better with a luncheon.<eos> [Inhales deeply] What is wrong with you people?
I'm sure this will be, too. I'm moving out tonight.<eos> It's time.<eos> I have a job opportunity, so...<eos> I do have a favor to ask.<eos> I'd like Ethan to continue living with you. He's still in school and...
Eat..<eos> This, this is my body...<eos> This is my blood<eos> Remember Me by Doing this.<eos> Im going to the Father and I'll always be with you..
We're working that out.<eos> We're gonna move them now.<eos> What hospital you taking them to?<eos> Collins general.<eos> We're gonna ride with you.
- Broken window.<eos> Now we're talking struggle.<eos> Oh, maybe the killer went out the window.<eos> - Where's the owner?<eos> - Waiting to talk to you.
She doesn't speak English.<eos> She's just visiting.<eos> You do realize prostitution and solicitation's illegal in this country, right?<eos> Of course.<eos> I also do know that she doesn't have to talk to you if she doesn't want to.
We'll, uh... we'll let you know what we find.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You three should... talk.<eos> See if you could find something to help on this.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
Nadia, the devil's spawn.<eos> Hey, Caroline. Did you remember to tell Elena that?<eos> I think my mind just exploded.<eos> Ok. Katherine's upstairs.<eos> Actually, I'm here to see all of you.
What about Harvey Reed?<eos> Or Glenn Truman?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Beth, I'll be there in a minute.<eos> I'm not talking to you.
Yellow looks like white at night.<eos> - And gray.<eos> It's a common car.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Someone wants to talk to you.
I got this.<eos> No offense, but I'm not leaving Eugene's life in your hands.<eos> You came with us because you wanted help.<eos> You're support, not point.<eos> We'll move north with you till I find the right vehicle just off the tracks.
We're a day's walk from Terminus.<eos> Who knows what they've got there?<eos> Look, it couldn't hurt to check.<eos> Load up on supplies, maybe even recruit some of them to come with.<eos> I'll go with you guys, but after.
Thank you so much for bringing me.<eos> I was afraid nunning was going to be boring, but that was so exciting.<eos> Sisters! Where have you been?<eos> We were at the rally.<eos> Sister Constance would like to see you immediately.
And your little electroslock therapy?<eos> You're not fooling anyone.<eos> Please tell my old friend, Red, that I... I hope she feels better.<eos> Some flipping friend you are.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
I'm willing to let you keep a much bigger cut of the profits than any of your current suppliers do.<eos> So to be clear, you want us to sell Fishscale for Los Angelicos<eos> - and give you a kickback?<eos> - No.<eos> I want you to buy from me, but to sell for yourselves, set your own prices... what you do with the Fishscale after that, it's on you.
Do you know the address?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh, 2014 Ocean... something.<eos> It's--it's right on the water.<eos> Is there anything else you can tell us about Perez?<eos> Just that he'd probably kill me if he knew I was talking to you.
We're from The Post. We just had a few quick questions about the coroner's report you prepared on Daniel Douglas Langston.<eos> Mr. Langston's blood had elevated levels of troponin.<eos> I'm confident he died of sudden cardiac arrest.<eos> Do you still have those results?<eos> I shouldn't be talking to you guys.
Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all very much.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm very happy to be here with you tonight, to make an historic announcement.
I mean it.<eos> I know you're confused, honey, but it's gonna be all right. We're here to help you.<eos> Vince, clear a spot on the back for him.<eos> All right, all right, all right!<eos> I'll come lo you. I'll come to you, all right?
All right, all right, all right!<eos> I'll come lo you. I'll come to you, all right?<eos> Just let me...<eos> I'm gonna walk down.<eos> Just... I'll come to you, okay?
If you will permit me. I will connect with your mind and reveal any additional information.<eos> It won't hurt you in anyway.<eos> I'll be here with you the whole time.<eos> Please trust us, Lolani.<eos> I trust you.
Another mutant?<eos> - Got a problem with that?<eos> - Wait.<eos> What are you, like, some kind of turtle ninja?<eos> - Hey, you filthy scum, I'm not done with you!
That was the awesomest part!<eos> Huh? Aww, what's up?<eos> No more robots left for me and Raph?<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Okay. What's up with you two?
The thing is, that the type of Alzheimers I have... is... very rare.<eos> It's familial.<eos> - It's passed on genetically.<eos> - My god.<eos> We believe that she got it from her father... and of course we're very worried, about the three of you.
I'm smarter now, and I've got a strict policy against walking through glowing doorways.<eos> So I know what to expect.<eos> Nobody knows what to expect.<eos> Not in this town.<eos> I want to be out there with you guys.
It's just so hard because I don't know what to do with myself all day.<eos> I'm a lawyer, but...<eos> I was... a lawyer.<eos> I loved it. But I guess I loved drinking more.<eos> I know that I can make it down here with all of you.
Your mole works in S.E. division.<eos> Well-placed in counter-intelligence.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I've seen the files at the SVR in Yasenevo.<eos> How long has he worked for you?
Everybody seeing and hearing this?<eos> We're up and running.<eos> Rick, what's going on with you?<eos> You with me?<eos> I'm with you.
- At the viking motel.<eos> But I think she's catching a plane home tonight.<eos> I thought it was a little weird she wasn't staying with Sam and Dana.<eos> - You know her name?<eos> Hey, I really need to talk to you guys.
Is it ok if I eat there?<eos> I promise I'll be home early.<eos> Please. That's not the problem. We just...<eos> We were planning on inviting B over for dinner tonight.<eos> There's a couple of things we want to talk to you guys about.
- It's Arlene Fowler.<eos> - And Holly Cleary.<eos> You know who we are.<eos> I know you do.<eos> I can't be talking to you.
Excuse me?<eos> Saliva will simulate sweat and fake out the body heat feature.<eos> _<eos> Ms. Shaw, I created a three-minute surveillance loop on the camera feed.<eos> The rest is up to you.
Why, thank you.<eos> We were just nearby.<eos> If there's anything else...<eos> Wait...<eos> Has Anna been getting along with you?
Well, it's the least we can do for my benefactor. Hmm.<eos> What happened to... my attacker?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Do you need us to get you anything? Yes.<eos> I need you to go home and take my wife with you.
Hey, partner, we're wasting daylight.<eos> Finn, you're joining the band?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> Haven't really got a chance to hang with you guys much.
Ms. Gillette here as a voice coach...<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Again!<eos> And also since he's crippled.<eos> Will be going with you.
It doesn't sound very good.<eos> Why does that sound really, really, really bad?<eos> Because they're gonna kill us.<eos> What?<eos> ! Unless you got maybe $100,000 U.S. on you.
Give me an honest answer.<eos> I deserve that. I was prepared to give everything to you.<eos> Including your life.<eos> I know that, and I'm sorry.<eos> But I can't marry you.
Yeah, you move. You move!<eos> Stop, right here.<eos> Stop!<eos> You wait for me.<eos> Play nice with me, I'll play nice with you.
You're lucky to be down here, you know?<eos> This is a...<eos> This can be a safe place.<eos> For a few hours we'll get to know each other.<eos> You cooperate with me, I'll cooperate with you.
You didn't know that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Federales found them all shot up in their truck with traces of heroin.<eos> Long gone.<eos> I bet you two boys were expecting that heroin to come your way, weren't you?
They'll be here real soon.<eos> Well, maybe we should wait until "real soon" to finish this discussion.<eos> No, you ain't got to worry, Mr Duffy.<eos> Everybody's gonna be just fine, trust me.<eos> Even if it arrives safely and we agree to go with you, 20% ain't happening.
In five centuries, it's never been done.<eos> All right...<eos> When do we start?<eos> As soon as I leave.<eos> I can't go with you...
And I just really love you.<eos> Mrs. F., why was Pete's memory of all that and not just one case.<eos> Tell them, Agent Lattimer.<eos> Maybe my defining moment is all of it...<eos> Every minute... That I got to spend with you guys.
But when I went to milk the goat, she was dry as dust.<eos> And this liar took four of my chickens,<eos> Good laying chickens, in trade.<eos> I deserve them chickens back.<eos> My lord regent... The good man is speaking to you.
Well, you know you can't do that.<eos> The midwives are all in the village, That's the first place that hugo will look.<eos> If you let them Catch you together, you're lost.<eos> Well, we can't stay here.<eos> No, you have to leave. And take me with you.
What if the queen hasn't left any?<eos> Then we at least have to slow her down.<eos> Let's let the horses rest for a spell.<eos> I'm going to check the roads, see if the castle guards Are still back behind us.<eos> I'll come with you.
Do you really think royals are so different From ordinary people?<eos> Well, just look at you.<eos> What about bash?<eos> He could be king someday soon.<eos> And married to you, I hear.
You've reached Henry and Lucille.<eos> We're not available at the moment.<eos> Leave us a message, and we'll call you back.<eos> It's Marty- - Agent Bellamy.<eos> I need to speak with you immediately.
I think it's time you told your story to the Chancellor.<eos> Master Jedi! I beg you to reconsider!<eos> The Chancellor wanted all the data on Tup to be sent to Coruscant.<eos> We're sending the data, the tumor and Fives along with it.<eos> Then I am going with you.
I'm not talking about that supermarket crap, I mean the good German ones.<eos> Der Gummi.<eos> Grab some people.<eos> We'll go topside tonight for provisions.<eos> Can I come with you?
I'll fetch a blanket.<eos> Woman Hey.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Clarissa, what are you doing here?<eos> I was worried about you.
You said bash knows the direction they went in.<eos> Can he track them?<eos> Francis always went on and on About his brother's hunting skills.<eos> He can, and I'll be with him.<eos> I'm coming with you.
We have to elope.<eos> Today.<eos> Now.<eos> Bash: There's a church just east of the old village, by the quarry.<eos> I wish that I could come with you.
I know it's true! Yes.<eos> Yes, of course, I want all those things.<eos> Then tell mary I will cause her no harm ever.<eos> And that she will cause you no harm By loving you.<eos> By marrying you.
Get your asses in here, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come here, get in.<eos> How the hell do I get out of this godforsaken cave?<eos> Really looking forward to working with you.
Adilyn.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, don't freak out.<eos> It's me, Violet. Jason's girlfriend.<eos> - I just wanted to talk to you, if that's okay.
This morning I found Scully's gun in the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.<eos> I think he was using it as a spoon.<eos> The truth is, I had to give 'em the case.<eos> You insulted Super Dan.<eos> He refuses to cooperate with you.
Hell, no.<eos> This is bad, Ava.<eos> No shit.<eos> Hey! Dewey!<eos> I'm mad at you girls.
Hasn't detective lohank been through enough?<eos> He just got diagnosed with prostate cancer.<eos> Course he did. Clean this up.<eos> Now.<eos> What's wrong with you guys?
Can you tell us what's happening?<eos> We have taken precautions.<eos> As far as we know, no one here has gotten sick.<eos> As queen, I will need to be isolated.<eos> I can't stay with you.
Someone who didn't care whether or not I was titled?<eos> Slim, I assure you.<eos> - You're going to pursue her, aren't you?<eos> - Whatever happens,<eos> - it has nothing to do with you.
I didn't want to say anything because-- but I--<eos> He walked out.<eos> "We're fucked, we're not gonna get signed!"<eos> And the next day Phil Carson comes in and he goes,<eos> "So boys, I'm going to sign you to Atlantic Records, "but I have to tell you a very interesting conversation I had.
You want to save Humanity, this is what we got to do.<eos> We don't know what's gonna happen when they reach fertile age.<eos> So we got to monitor, we got to test, we got to do whatever's necessary.<eos> One of these kids could be the key to figuring this whole thing out.<eos> Mind if we join you?
Take somebody with you.<eos> I need McGee and DiNozzo here.<eos> They've already started working on the Capitol Hill angle.<eos> That could lead to something. Bishop.<eos> Watch your six, both of you.
The way my chefs do stuffed pastry.<eos> Now... there.<eos> Now, all we have to do is get her back to her chambers, and... toss her out of the proper window.<eos> Oh, this was my favorite coverlet.<eos> Add it to the list of my debts to you.
You spend half your life here, Shane.<eos> This is your dating pool.<eos> Why am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?<eos> They shouldn't be able to do this to us.<eos> Nobody's doing anything to you.
- Hello?<eos> - Mom, it's me.<eos> Sweetheart, what's wrong?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> The girls and I need to come and stay with you for a while.
Look, I'm telling you, Donna, I'm on a roll.<eos> They're both on board.<eos> I got Joe to sell his Porsche so now we've got enough money for COMDEX.<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm going with you.
Gentlemen, there is a killer hiding in this town, a killer who finds it amusing to rip the eyes from the head of a young woman.<eos> We're gonna find him, and we're gonna find him tonight.<eos> I'm giving you each scrip, walking-around money.<eos> Spread it about, grease informants, buy rounds of drinks, whatever it takes.<eos> I'm counting on you.
This whole adventure is totally looney!<eos> Show your ugly bird head, Malachi!<eos> Well done, fellowship of turtles.<eos> Now I shall prepareth thy next adventure.<eos> Then I will playeth the game with you forever.
Kind of ingenious, in a degenerate sort of way.<eos> Not if you're Sapphire.<eos> If you're Sapphire, you're pissed that you lost your income stream, and you want those photos back.<eos> I'm sorry, but Sapphire's gone.<eos> She bolted right after she talked to you guys.
Drop it!<eos> Mike Weston.<eos> What a lovely surprise.<eos> Ryan Hardy can't be far behind.<eos> Where is he? How many others are with you?
My wife and I, we don't communicate like that.<eos> That's why I stayed.<eos> I'm learning valuable stuff from you guys.<eos> Like how to wash my wife's underwear?<eos> Well, I felt like I owed you guys, so I started doing stuff around the house.
That's a warning.<eos> Get out of my face before I break that pretty nose of yours.<eos> That is a threat.<eos> Okay, okay, okay! Break it up!<eos> Hey! What the hell's wrong with you two?
Nerd Herd, you want to grab some, uh, pint glasses over there?<eos> All right.<eos> So, uh, how are my little mermaids?<eos> Okay, on that note, I should get going. But, um, guys, thank you for everything.<eos> It was, uh, it was a pleasure working with you.
We hear he might have changed his look though. So silver hair now, brushed back, possibly a goatee.<eos> Uh, drives a red BMW, possibly stolen.<eos> The FBI is sending a team. And in the meantime, the two original agents are staking out Lester's house.<eos> Molly, Gus on one.<eos> Yeah, I'll be out there with you coordinating maneuvers.
You know about that?<eos> I didn't talk to anyone.<eos> They took the damn thing away,<eos> I got nothing to do with it anymore.<eos> What is it with you people?
Up until now, we've been cool.<eos> Never had any beef with him.<eos> Let's pull his file.<eos> I want to know everything about him before we get him in a room.<eos> Spider's never gonna talk to you.
Think.<eos> You could have a king's son as your firstborn.<eos> My gift to you.<eos> Your queen wishes to have a word with you.<eos> Just you.
Not that anyone would believe you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> If you'd known I was a queen, Would you have gone through with it?<eos> I would have gone through with it no matter who you are.<eos> I made love to you because You are the most intriguing woman I've met In France.
It's a burden sometimes.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you here.<eos> Because mary's not here?<eos> I didn't come looking for mary.<eos> I was worried about you.
I've bribed your jailer.<eos> A merchant's wagon will take you to the Spanish border.<eos> If you value your life, you will do as I say and you will never return.<eos> - I'm not ready to go to Spain.<eos> - Bash, what is wrong with you?
Gossip surrounds me and still you seek my favor.<eos> Why?<eos> You have a good heart.<eos> And I'm too rich to care what people say.<eos> What I care about is you.
Good evening.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Matt Jamison.<eos> I didn't know your friend very well.<eos> I don't even know if you considered her a friend, but she lived here, with all of you.
And can't you?<eos> Mostly, yes. But what happens when being a good king means Being a bad husband?<eos> That's simple:<eos> Be a bad king.<eos> That's why she wanted to marry you, isn't it?
Wait.<eos> Where are your things?<eos> I watched you pack.<eos> Where is the...?<eos> I can't go with you.
When I am king, the position is yours.<eos> But I have one condition.<eos> Your men will report to me as they would to you.<eos> But why would you need my men to...<eos> I'm going with you to Scotland.
How many?<eos> A ozen or so.<eos> Maybe more.<eos> Rick: We can hanle a ozen.<eos> Bob an I will go with you.
I don't need to tell you people that hospitals are struggling to stay open.<eos> With fiscal challenges, Obamacare, we need to cut costs... improve customer satisfaction and increase profits.<eos> And to help us achieve those goals... is new interim chief of the night shift, Dr. Jordan Alexander.<eos> Nice.<eos> I just wanna say, I'm excited to work with all of you.
I traded one life for another today.<eos> And I pray that I've saved my mother.<eos> - But at what price?<eos> - Count yourself lucky it was bought so cheaply, Your Grace.<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
You've found people before, you even found Vincent.<eos> Look around you, what do you see?<eos> How would you track Gabe?<eos> We'll need you there by 7:00.<eos> Why don't I just come and meet you?
You cracked the case, Batman!<eos> Well done.<eos> I hope everyone likes boardgames!<eos> Stand on a lit tile and everything is humpty toy. {*}<eos> But if your tile goes dark and you're still on it, you're out of the game... permanently!
Once more and hurl! Aah!<eos> We will do this until we get it right.<eos> Look, do you want this to be your last school memory?<eos> Pull harder!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Hey guys, can I share something with you?
What's goin' on?<eos> You guys touch pee-pees or something?<eos> I wish.<eos> No, our wives got in a big fight and banned us from seeing each other.<eos> So what if they're in a fight? What does that have to do with you?
She wants me to stay.<eos> Mmm, you know something, Michael?<eos> What Polly wants will always be a mystery to me.<eos> I've decided.<eos> I want to make real money with you.
I want us to have a chance to love each other.<eos> You told me once that you would support whatever decision I made in regards to England.<eos> Is that still true?<eos> I will stand by you.<eos> You can count on me, as I count on you.
You know, when I was a little girl, My mother had a blanket made of fleece.<eos> How do you stay warm?<eos> Do your parents let you sleep beside them?<eos> Where are you parents?<eos> They must be worried that you're cold or hurt.
I did what you couldn't do.<eos> I did it for France.<eos> For the nation that you used to put Before all else, even me.<eos> Because that is what rulers do!<eos> What is wrong with you? !
Okay.<eos> You're not taking the bus.<eos> Try to stop me.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey, hey, he!<eos> You stay... you stay an help us, an we will go with you.
You stay, help us.<eos> Half a ay.<eos> Come high noon, we're taillights.<eos> I'm not waiting for the other amn shoe to rop.<eos> An we will leave with you.
Remember what these people are capable of.<eos> - Tyreese.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You up for this?<eos> I'm going with you.
I have to secure the door. It's locked.<eos> Let me help you undress. Please, just...<eos> Just hold me, A little more, please.<eos> We have no reason to stop.<eos> I want to marry you.
Because, finally, lola wants you to know it, too.<eos> Francis, she writes that she may not survive.<eos> There is no time to lose.<eos> Be there when, god willing, Your child comes into the world.<eos> Hurry, and I will come and join you After I have gathered some help.
We ran the name that he mentioned and found that the case belonged to you guys.<eos> Anyway, I figured you'd want to see the body before we carted him off.<eos> Thank you.<eos> .357, antique.<eos> We'll let you handle the ballistics.
Thai was a fun day.<eos> In my opinion, attacking them head-on- on their own turf- seems like a good way for us all to die.<eos> The thing about rats is they always have a back door.<eos> That's why it's so tricky to catch them.<eos> I'd bet that the vamps- I bet you they have one too.
-Ask the boss.<eos> We are not boss.<eos> -Not our work<eos> -You're mocking us.<eos> -Hey, I'm talking to you.
Take his boots. - Uh... no.<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> No, no, no, no. No, you can't take my boots.<eos> Bag 'em.<eos> Okay, this is insane. I came back here to talk to you guys.
I tried to hang up on this thing.<eos> It wouldn't let me.<eos> - You take turns?<eos> - Honestly, he is not in with us.<eos> That came with you guys.
I'm a detective inspector with the National Crime Agency.<eos> I just need you to stay calm and tell me everything you know. I know very little.<eos> I've been saying to Catherine,<eos> I'm not really the person you need to be talking to.<eos> The person you need to be talking to is going to be very cross when he finds out I've spoken to you.
So, I looked that cocksucker right in the eyes and said,<eos> "Can't be that great.<eos> They gave one to you."<eos> (CLANGING) Everybody? Everybody.<eos> If I may, on behalf of the Civic Clergy Association, I feel obligated to share with you why I nominated our guest of honor for Mapleton Man of the Year.
Sir, look at me.<eos> Not at them, look at me.<eos> My name's Jim. Jim Gordon.<eos> This is one of the iconic figures in comic-book law enforcement.<eos> It's daunting... to play him, to be honest with you.
It's okay, Topher. We got you.<eos> Make some room!<eos> Everybody, come on! Outta the way! Outta the way!<eos> I know. I know!<eos> - We will get to you.
I have no doubt.<eos> You have neither the training nor the intellect to conceive a drug as complex as Aterna.<eos> But we need to know who did.<eos> Not here.<eos> I'll come with you.
THE AVATAR THANKS YOU FOR YOUR LOYAL SERVICE.<eos> DID YOU FIND ANY MORE LEADS?<eos> THERE ARE REPORTS OF AIRBENDERS POPPING UP ALL OVER THE EARTH KINGDOM.<eos> I MARKED THE VILLAGES ON THIS MAP.<eos> YOU GUYS CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU.
WHY? "WHY, MAKO?<eos> I CAN'T GO ON.<eos> "I CAN'T..." AND THEN SHE DIES.<eos> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.<eos> I'LL COME WITH YOU.
BUT IT DIDN'T.<eos> YOU NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT.<eos> DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES I DID.<eos> - MOM? DAD?<eos> CAN I TALK TO YOU?
What's the hold up, lieutenant?<eos> Do you have them?<eos> Council leader Tharn standing by.<eos> Your time has run out.<eos> I'm tired of playing with you.
Okay, what is he doing here?<eos> - That's my fault.<eos> - Of course it's her fault.<eos> I mean, who else's fault would it be, right?<eos> Is Michaela in there with you?
You would have done the same thing, Marren. No.<eos> I would have made my own company.<eos> As I did.<eos> Did you really think that you could burn me?<eos> And you took trusting, naive Pax down with you.
She just sat there and drank.<eos> - And they gave her whatever she wanted.<eos> -I see.<eos> At least, I think I see.<eos> - Next time, I'm coming with you.
Wave.<eos> Jamal, go stand over there.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> My son will cut the ribbon.<eos> It is a great honor... to be standing here with you, the good people of Ma'an.
Not all of us anyway, necessarily.<eos> I agree your loyalty and your neighbors have earned you a Fuller understanding of the events I referred to yesterday.<eos> Well, I'm glad you see it that way.<eos> Watch your screen, please.<eos> So the good news that I want to share with you today then, is this... death and aging are problems.
And if I may get serious for a moment hosting this show has been one crazy ride.<eos> With all its ups and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world.<eos> Except for now, when I'm giving it up.<eos> Before I sign off, I'd, uh...<eos> I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag:
A thousand pardons.<eos> You don't...<eos> you don't need to apologize to me.<eos> Just get him to the hospital.<eos> You know what, why don't I come with you and make sure no one else makes the same mistake.
You see, I have a condition.<eos> Don't worry, it's not contagious.<eos> My doctor tells me that I have a neurotic character.<eos> Which, when properly medicated, as it is now, is no more neurotic than any other in this room.<eos> And now I can see that you are wondering why I'm sharing this information with you.
Where, when you feel a little down?<eos> ... Library<eos> I think Yan is not feeling well lately<eos> She may not go to the tuition class<eos> Maybe we ask her to see you when she's fine
- MMM, LET'S GET TO WORK.<eos> - EVERYBODY, STAND BACK!<eos> WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE<eos> BEFORE ZAHEER GETS HIS HANDS ON KORRA.<eos> - TAKE ME WITH YOU.
- WE NEED TO GET TO THOSE CAVES.<eos> HOW? I DON'T THINK WE CAN ALL FIT ON MY BISON.<eos> - OOGI!<eos> I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO, OLD FRIEND.<eos> - I WANNA COME WITH YOU.
I don't think I'm coming back.<eos> - Why wouldn't you come back?<eos> - Really?<eos> Your father clearly sees his chance to get rid of me.<eos> Why else would he be paying for me to go with you?
Do you know where he lives?<eos> Off Germantown road.<eos> We're gonna leave officers here until we make sure that we've got him.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> I should go with you, 'cause it's very remote.
No!<eos> No!<eos> - What happens now?<eos> - You should find a good lawyer.<eos> I'll keep a couple of my guys with you.
Which one of you wants to go first?<eos> I've already been questioned.<eos> Didn't know anything then, don't know anything now.<eos> I heard a rumor Mr. Bowman had a bit of a temper.<eos> I also heard you were sick of him taking it out on you.
I have other sources.<eos> I will see you tonight.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - What is going on with you two?
Your son?<eos> Listen, if you concealed any evidence that stopped us finding Olly...<eos> Look, I cannot compel him to visit if he doesn't wish to.<eos> Then I suggest that you try.<eos> Because that will be the only way that I will talk to you.
How did the FBI end up working for Reddington?<eos> How'd you find us in Warsaw?<eos> Who told you we were there?<eos> Medical examiner just called.<eos> He needs to see you.
Then I tested their inks against Calvin's tissue sample, and there is only one that uses that exact barium- titanium blend.<eos> It is on Magazine.<eos> And I will gladly share this with you under one condition.<eos> There's a condition?<eos> Take me with you.
Gotta go!<eos> Kid, you wake me, you die.<eos> - It's his fault!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> I'm crushing you both.
Oof! Thank God!<eos> Dear Kasim.<eos> Something got into you all in my dream.<eos> Oof! I swear you were dressed as a woman.<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!
Yeah.<eos> Dirty Deeks.<eos> No, no, no. Uh...<eos> Scabby Spice.<eos> I need to talk to you two.
Look, I don't believe you are who you say you are.<eos> Badges and I.D.'s can be faked.<eos> I know who's after me.<eos> Who's after you, Miss Reed?<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you, okay?
He's been holed up in the woods since the apocalypse.<eos> He's armed and dangerous.<eos> He became a recluse after the death of his son.<eos> How do we find Homer?<eos> He won't talk to you.
Men like narcisse, Protected by the church and the crown.<eos> Your father built his power By giving the nobles what they wanted.<eos> If he were here now, he would let those men die.<eos> And what do you expect him to do, Risk disenfranchising the nobles he depends on?<eos> Well, maybe it's time we change things, Shift the power back to where it belongs, With you, our king.
Ask the spirit that brought you here.<eos> The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!<eos> This is a mission of the utmost importance.<eos> Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom, and we need to find the Avatar.<eos> Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?
Come on, I'll give you the tour.<eos> Wow, you must, uh, must really trust your neighbors.<eos> I still need to set up a checking account here.<eos> Here, see the kitchen.<eos> Casey, Dawson, can I talk to you two, please?
So, it's not unreasonable to think that you were in the area for a meeting.<eos> I was champing at the bit to take on Openshaw in court. That would have played well with the voters.<eos> Then let us see your calendar from three weeks ago.<eos> Clear this whole thing up.<eos> I've done nothing but cooperate with you.
Me too.<eos> It's remarkable how many firearms you can fit in that purse.<eos> One must accessorize.<eos> The Governor and I are going to bring New York into the future!<eos> And as your Lieutenant Governor, I look forward to working with all of you.
That's some real cultural insensitivity. Sorry, sir.<eos> We didn't mean any offense.<eos> We're... we're vacationing at Diamondback.<eos> Yeah, I figured that.<eos> I was just messing with you folks.
Well, I'd love to talk specifics, but that information's classified.<eos> Is there anything you could offer us?<eos> Darby and Rebecca spent much of the past year on-site with a private defense contractor.<eos> Uh, Axelrod Industries.<eos> If there were issues, they'd be someone you should talk to.
This isn't the first fight?<eos> We're on top of it.<eos> Jim and I have been down there.<eos> We're gonna go again.<eos> Believe me. What's going on with you guys?
Greer?<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> I co... I couldn't wait any longer.<eos> I rode here<eos> All night... Because I want to marry you.
Like a drowned rat.<eos> I know.<eos> Actually, you look quite trouble-free.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, Castleroy hasn't spoken to you, I take it? I...
Find peace, Father.<eos> There's no peace for me.<eos> Not while my killer walks free.<eos> If you're here to lay blame, then at least be honest and shoulder your own.<eos> You murdered girls who had the misfortune of sleeping with you.
What if I asked you not to do this? Don't convert.<eos> For your safety and mine and the children.<eos> For what it could do to our lives if people knew.<eos> Greer, I love you.<eos> But if you asked me to give up what I believe, I don't think I could marry you.
For your safety and mine and the children.<eos> For what it could do to our lives if people knew.<eos> Greer, I love you.<eos> But if you asked me to give up what I believe, I don't think I could marry you.<eos> And to be fair to you, if you... if you choose to end this now, know that I will still take care of your sisters and fund their dowries.
Whatever it is, it must wait till tomorrow.<eos> I'm off to beauvais to put in an appearance At lord gramont's saint day party.<eos> It always softens up the nobles When a queen appears at their gatherings.<eos> A sop to their vanity.<eos> Why don't I come with you, then?
Hands on the steering wheel!<eos> Please, please, you can't be here.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> I can't be seen with you!
- So can you go into the avatar state again?<eos> I was worried when you told me you couldn't.<eos> - Wait.<eos> When did she tell you she couldn't?<eos> What's going on with you two?
PEMA, FIND WU AND GET THE REMAINING CITIZENS TO SAFETY IMMEDIATELY.<eos> WE CAN'T HAVE INNOCENT LIVES IN JEOPARDY.<eos> - WHAT SHOULD WE DO?<eos> - LET'S GO TO MY FACTORY. MAYBE WE CAN GET A FEW OF THOSE HUMMINGBIRD SUITS UP AND RUNNING.<eos> - WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.
- She's right.<eos> - Let's have the PAC do it.<eos> - No. We're not giving it to the PAC.<eos> We are not using it.<eos> I'm learning a lot from you guys, but you need to learn something from me, too.
You touched God in that moment.<eos> We murdered your sister.<eos> FBI!<eos> Drop the weapon!<eos> You're not taking me with you.
Our stepfather was suffocating.<eos> He never let us make a decision on our own.<eos> If we veered off his path, he just beat us into submission with the strap, belt, or whatever else he had handy.<eos> Is that why you're doing all this?<eos> 'Cause of what he did to you?
.30 caliber?<eos> Same that was used to kill Petty Officer Bell.<eos> No surprise-- ballistics match.<eos> Same gun that was used to kill Bell was used to kill Drayer.<eos> And I'll bet you dollars to donuts that the shooter is the one who hired Drayer to do the catfishing.
Building a school, dear.<eos> In an under-serviced region.<eos> And I... I'm merely one of the donors.<eos> It feels good to be involved.<eos> Can I share with you some of our other projects?
I fear this nation is burning and I am the man who lit the match.<eos> Oh, perhaps I overvalue my role in the matter.<eos> You control a king.<eos> I'd say you're being accurate.<eos> You betrayed me, you called me an enemy of those you hold dear, and yet when there was danger tonight, my worry was for you.
They just think it's not glamorous, but it's important.<eos> I mean, all the great handcrafted trades are going down the tubes.<eos> Some have already gone.<eos> And then there's nobody left to teach them, and you'll have all kinds of machine-made junk.<eos> Listen up, everybody, this wonderful, wonderful man is going to talk with you.
Now why would I do that?<eos> To enjoy the pleasure Of a few moments of your company alone?<eos> Would that flatter you?<eos> It's not so much flattering As it is inconvenient.<eos> You can't force me to ride back with you.
Your majesty.<eos> May I present My son william?<eos> Your majesty. It is an honor.<eos> Ah, the dashing groom-to-be.<eos> Oh, claude will be most taken With you.
I'm already questioning him by authority of the king.<eos> We don't answer to the king or his deputy. Woman: No!<eos> Man: Stay back. Oh.<eos> man: Move him out.<eos> Francis, I need to speak to you.
Cary.<eos> - It's odd to be on this side.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, where are we at?<eos> Because I really don't want to be in that courtroom with you people.
I have to go. That didn't sound like Christmas-present coordination.<eos> No, it didn't.<eos> Told you, every word these guys say is a lie.<eos> It's not about presents, okay?<eos> My father cancelled his surgery and instead of me being there to convince him otherwise, I'm stuck here with all of you.
- I doubled down.<eos> - Oh, I heard you.<eos> Are you sure you don't want me to go in with you, you know, maybe hammer out some final details?<eos> No. Deal's already worked out.<eos> I'm just gonna pop my Herbie Hancock on a few forms, and I'll, uh -- I'll meet you at the bar.
- I was going to visit my brother in Navarre, but I turned back as soon as I heard the news.<eos> Where's Mary?<eos> She's fine... getting some much-needed rest.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Francis, you must know my loyalty lies with you.
- He's pushing into orbit!<eos> If he takes control of that ship, we're dead.<eos> - He'd maroon us?<eos> - He is marooning us.<eos> I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Yeah. If you don't believe me, you can ask him yourself.<eos> - Can we help you?<eos> - Mesdames.<eos> There has been a change of plan.<eos> I have been billeted with you.
Every time I see you, we go through this shit.<eos> One more word, I'm gonna knock your block off like I did in fifth grade.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! Knock this shit off!<eos> The hell's the matter with you?
- How about just a glass of soda?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, me too.<eos> I feel a little--<eos> Well, I can't tell if I'm having another stroke or if it's these dad-gum lights.<eos> What's with you guys, all right?
Thank you.<eos> My dear people, let us begin as we begin all things holy.<eos> In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ... the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you always.
Hey, everybody.<eos> Steve, that was a great speech.<eos> That was really nice.<eos> And I've been to several of these now, your anniversary parties, and I never quite honestly appreciated them.<eos> I guess I always just sort of looked forward to the food, and I have something to share with you.
Can I help you fellas?<eos> - We'll get to you in a minute.<eos> - We wanna talk to her, is all.<eos> Hey, we got a message from Mr. Cohen.<eos> It just seems like the lady doesn't want to talk to you.
They coerced the defense witness to change key testimony... And then they invited the real killer, Rusty Berkhart, to take the stand... And claimed that Lacey had confessed.<eos> Police and prosecutors considered Lacey Stubb trash. And they threw her life away without so much as a backward glance.<eos> If it can happen to her... It can happen to anyone of us.<eos> It can happen to me.<eos> It can happen to you.
Oh, that is interesting.<eos> Well, we just think it's the only way to make sure... that he gets the best education possible.<eos> You should really consider it for your kids.<eos> Hey, you know, Kevin's upstairs doing his homework right now.<eos> I'm sure he'd love to talk to you guys about it.
You're in charge of this.<eos> Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.<eos> No problem.<eos> Can I go outside with Joy?<eos> Convince your brother to go with you and you can.
How are you two?<eos> You both getting ready for bedtime?<eos> [kids] Yeah.<eos> [Max] Yeah, that'd be nice.<eos> I wish I could go with you, 'cause I'm so sleepy now.
Yes, because it's in front of people!<eos> You should wake up embarrassed.<eos> I'm Art!<eos> New Age philosophy major.<eos> Excited to live with you and laugh with you, and cry with you.
In the face of unending pain and...<eos> Forget it!<eos> You're in.<eos> Look, we know we're no one's first choice for a fraternity, so it means a lot to have you here with us.<eos> Can't wait to start Scaring with you, brothers.
And, once in a weakened state, leads them to the third and final stage: possession.<eos> Hey, Ed?<eos> Lorraine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's someone here that would like to talk to you.
But right now I'm trying to go straight, you know, for the very first time in my life.<eos> Wow. Good for you.<eos> You know, Laird's brother just got out of rehab.<eos> He was in rehab for oxy...<eos> Which I cannot do with you right here across the street.
This summit is over.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> This is it, boys.<eos> This country is at war.<eos> With you and you and you and you and you and you.
Phil!<eos> mr. jackson.<eos> Thank you, your honor.<eos> Good morning, everybody. We spent a lot of time over the last few days talking about what you've read about the case, what you've heard about the case, what you know, what you think you know about the case.<eos> This is my opportunity to talk with you for a few minutes about what we expect the evidence to show, the actual facts in the case, to show.
So there's a nigger, a kike and a wop and they get surrounded by Indians.<eos> The chief walks to them.<eos> He says, "Listen, we're gonna kill you,<eos> "we're gonna skin you, we're gonna boil you.<eos> "We're gonna make a canoe out of you.
I figured it would be.<eos> - Hello. - hello.<eos> Falletta. - Nice to meet you.<eos> Mr Falletta, I told miss Cosulich not to leave the bank.<eos> - Why did she come out with you?
- That's me. What do you want?<eos> I'm commissioner Montalbano, this is inspector Fazio.<eos> I didn't ask who you were... what do you want?<eos> We'd like to talk to you.<eos> Like I've got time to waste with you!
- No, he wanted to remain anonymous.<eos> Is there anyone inside?<eos> I don't know. We haven't gone in yet.<eos> It looks like arson. We found a petrol can. We're going in now.<eos> - Can I come in with you?
The horned toad is actually a lizard.<eos> -...with this whole...<eos> -Sensual.<eos> ...family dinner thing.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Walker.<eos> Can I speak to you?
Lord we love You<eos> Lord we love You<eos> Lord we choose<eos> Lord we need You<eos> We have come to share with you the good news.
Who not only has access to the components, but can fabricate something like that?<eos> Maybe a handful of shops in London.<eos> Regular tuner shops aren't going to cut it on this one.<eos> We're going to have to dig deeper than that.<eos> Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.
Thank God.<eos> And I'm so tired of you, and hearing you, and drinking all the booze in the house.<eos> I am not gona buy morphine.<eos> You hear that?<eos> I just cannot deal with you guys.
You hear that?<eos> I just cannot deal with you guys.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> And everybody fucking with.<eos> And I cannot deal with you guys.
He just sits in the waiting room and reads Highlights magazine.<eos> Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can, and then leaves.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Jesus, what are you gonna do with him?<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you guys about that.
Smile, smile, smile, smile.<eos> Stand up straight.<eos> You're on camera.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're honored to be here with you today.
Where's Lucas?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Truth time.<eos> Look, I had my reasons.<eos> But I haven't been straight with you.
You do this for me.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're walking Finlay to the station.<eos> You... you want me to come with you?
More on the eyes, please.<eos> You want lipstick, handsome?<eos> I brought my own, thanks.<eos> Wonderful to see you showing such interest.<eos> Okay, Bobby, Mary, Uncle Joker's counting on you.
You Moody boys sure do like your six-shooters.<eos> You got permits for those?<eos> You won't be around long enough to find out.<eos> You're not gonna shoot a man at your brother's wake.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
They get you no matter where you go.<eos> - You can't win.<eos> - No, you really can't.<eos> Looks like you're safe enough, though.<eos> Meaning no offense, my lady, but... I wouldn't tangle with you.
Lady Margaery wears it that way.<eos> Many ladies wear it this way.<eos> I have good news.<eos> I'll be leaving the city soon.<eos> You still want me to come with you?
- I don't partake.<eos> You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?<eos> Very well.<eos> My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.<eos> Oh, she won't be going with you.
"On the sick or wounded bison, But another vulture, watching<eos> "From his high aerial lookout..."<eos> Florence, I would very much like to paint you.<eos> I was wondering whether you would sit for me.<eos> And when I'm with you, I could pick your brains, because I came here to learn from you.
- After you've gone, I guess.<eos> What do you know!<eos> What changes are you making here?<eos> The same you saw yesterday when you were here.<eos> Are you bringing the little one to stay with you?
I'm a princess.<eos> Or at least, I used to be.<eos> Happy day all of you!<eos> I love you!<eos> I'm so happy to be here with you!
It'll be fine.<eos> - You have your inhaler?<eos> - I left it in the car.<eos> Okay, you guys go and have fun.<eos> I'll grab it and catch up with you.
- Yeah.<eos> Negotiating.<eos> That's how you call it?<eos> It's a system that we have.<eos> You found a system that works for you.
You've saved your own life, into the bargain.<eos> Halt!<eos> Be still.<eos> Our visitor was expected.<eos> You know I can't be seen with you.
- No, she had this family thing tonight.<eos> But she wanted to make it, she just couldn't.<eos> - She told me to say hello to you guys.<eos> - That's sweet.<eos> Everything good with the two of you?
I fired my manager last week, and I'm all out of cocaine.<eos> Might you be in the market for new representation?<eos> If you can get me some Peruvian flake... I'll maybe think about throwing you in the mix.<eos> - Here you go, rock-star asshole.<eos> - It'd be an honor to work with both of you.
Understand this!<eos> A war band lives and dies together.<eos> If you cannot trust the men to either side of you, or in front of you,<eos> you are already a dead man.<eos> I am with you.
A war band lives and dies together.<eos> If you cannot trust the men to either side of you, or in front of you,<eos> you are already a dead man.<eos> I am with you.<eos> I made a mistake before. I did not come with you.
That won't be so long then.<eos> By my sacred rings, I swear.<eos> But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.<eos> What is this favor?<eos> That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
Me?<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Will you come with us?<eos> Perhaps you would prefer to stay here and worship your own God.<eos> No, I'll gladly come with you.
No.<eos> Of course not!<eos> How could you be a Christian and walk among our gods?<eos> I share your appetite for new adventure,<eos> Ragnar Lothbrok, and I will gladly join forces with you, since, as king, I am naturally not in favor of individual enterprise by my earls, or anyone else.
That is, if you really want to be something.<eos> Ragnar Lothbrok,<eos> I drink to your good fortune.<eos> May the gods continue to favor you and increase your fame.<eos> May they do the same to you, King Horik.
Are you the emissaries from King Horik?<eos> Well, I can tell you at once, you're wasting your time.<eos> It's my land, and I want it returned to me.<eos> That's all I have to say.<eos> He wants to make peace with you and come to some kind of agreement.
The death of your brother and the start of your own fame?<eos> Well, what do you say?<eos> I say yes.<eos> I will fight with you.<eos> I will fight with you against my brother.
Had enough?<eos> There may be a time and place for you to kill each other but it is not here and not now.<eos> I do not serve your Goddess and I do not live or die by goodwill.<eos> So long as her goals and my own are aligned<eos> I will go with you.
Now I realize it is a difficult task.<eos> But we have the opportunity to make history here.<eos> And I want all of us to make it together.<eos> So, good luck.<eos> We're counting on you.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Well, he doesn't even know I'm in Boston and, uh,<eos> I need to keep it that way.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm just gonna meet you at work.
Yeah, and you two look like human maxi pads.<eos> Glass houses much?<eos> We're the definition of "hot mess."<eos> Could you leave?<eos> I can't deal with you.
- Hang on.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> Dixie, I want everybody out the flat, now.<eos> Fucking move!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
What are you doing out here?<eos> You inspired us.<eos> Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.<eos> Where's Yao?<eos> Did he come with you?
You're only making things worse.<eos> - The spirits are coming back!<eos> - Let's wipe 'em out this time.<eos> We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to.<eos> - What happened to you?
That's right.<eos> You went back for Daryl.<eos> And now he's gone again and the Governor is still alive.<eos> - Daryl was the priority.<eos> - I should have been there with you.
God has sent me.<eos> I am here... to set you free.<eos> God has sent you.<eos> Yes.<eos> God... sent me to speak to you.
This is my body.<eos> This is my blood.<eos> Remember me... by doing this.<eos> I'm going to the Father.<eos> But I will always be with you.
"Thanks, Carrie!<eos> Yeah, that's an upgrade!"<eos> Hi, Lauren.<eos> The rest of the group decided to take the day off to celebrate goal achievement.<eos> Man, I have worked with you guys for years.
While we cover your ass?<eos> Just so you know, about 17 people way up the food chain all called and demanded I back you off Ari Sonnenland.<eos> Did I?<eos> So just take the damn job.<eos> Besides, those two like working with you.
what's your next step?<eos> Untie me!<eos> It won't happen.<eos> No!<eos> Peace be upon you.
But you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you.<eos> We can build on that.<eos> 5,000 jobs becomes 10, then 15.<eos> Not in the snap of a finger, but faster than doing nothing will.<eos> Can I count on all of you?
- I think she meant us.<eos> ( All arguing )<eos> I mean all of us. Our only hope is to work together, free our friends, and destroy that weather machine before it destroys our world.<eos> Why should we do anything with them?<eos> We didn't wanna do anything with you first.
Good morning to ya, one and all.<eos> It is I, little old Terry Wogan, coming to you via the radio.
It's a real game that I just made up.<eos> (SNICKERING) OK.<eos> Well, maybe you can explain that to me later.<eos> Straight line, guys.<eos> I'm going to do room checks, so I'll meet you.
I mean, she looks an awful lot like the fucked up sister Patrick was describing.<eos> Savannah?<eos> Where is she, dude?<eos> Where did she go? I don't know.<eos> Please, take us with you.
Others have experienced what you're going through and have struggled the way you're struggling now.<eos> Why are the Grays, or whatever they are, so interested in us?<eos> What makes us so special?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's nothing special about you.
Stop.<eos> No, we want to go to the beach.<eos> -Accelerate.<eos> Fuck.<eos> If you stop, I'll kick a ball with you.
My Twitter.<eos> Armin, that was so...<eos> -What did you think?<eos> Mr Van Buuren?<eos> I think we'll have a great show, with you as my supporting act.
Your Grace.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> My Lords.<eos> We welcome you to court.<eos> The king has some important news he wishes to share with you about Princess Bona of France.
Ÿcomo estan, amigos?<eos> Everything you've acquired of value in your short time on this earth, everything you are worth is locked inside of you, and that means, at this moment, you find yourself in the unique position you may never be in again:<eos> You have nothing to lose.<eos> Let's cook it up!<eos> I'll leave you with this:
It's to get you back cerebellum, somewhere out there...<eos> And grab, better cut his finger.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Long had to drop everything.<eos> I'm with you guys.
I don't know what you did with it.<eos> Only you would know that.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You say that as though we're not carrying technology that can bend space and time into a Mobius strip.<eos> I'm not coming with you.
This way, Walter.<eos> Go into the first car. On your right.<eos> Now.<eos> We're on board.<eos> We'll make our way to you.
- Hey, gang!<eos> - Dad?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Yeah, I got kicked out of the hospital for lewd misconduct, whatever that means.<eos> So I thought I'd stay with you.
I was hoping she was here with you.<eos> Which is why I came here before I went to the police.<eos> Police?<eos> I understand Spencer's been a little "distracted" lately.<eos> Was there something on her mind that she shared with you?
Please? No!<eos> Okay, that didn't work.<eos> You guys are making a huge mistake.<eos> My dad's a big-time lawyer.<eos> He's gonna own this entire building by the time he's through with you. Hmm.
Wolf that killed my son-in-law? He's a man-eater, gotta be put down.<eos> We're doing this for Carl.<eos> - Okay, just... Just hold on a second.<eos> - No, going now.<eos> I'll come with you.
Gentlemen, in the absence of any and all other explanations, I'm afraid this has been a marvelous, tragic misunderstanding.<eos> I'll be on my way.<eos> That's not happening.<eos> There are things of grave importance.<eos> I do not have time to deal with the likes of you.
I don't even want to talk about your favorite planet-Pluto!<eos> And unless she was lying to the good ladies of The View, it's "De-mi," not "Dem-i"!<eos> You were going to let me go with him?<eos> Isn't that what you wanted, honey?<eos> What's the matter with you?
Cheers, boss.<eos> Merci,Bruce.<eos> From the deepest part of my heart, thank you.<eos> BRUCE:<eos> It was nice being alone with you tonight. (CHUCKLES)
He stumbled across us.<eos> No, he drew on us.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> It's what I was there for.<eos> I'm going with you.
I'm not the enemy, you know!<eos> They're a special bunch.<eos> Kind of tough to get through, but...<eos> Oh, well...<eos> One of these days. What's going on with you two?
They're out looking for him.<eos> Hey.<eos> Welcome back. I got a little headache, Doc.<eos> Aside from that, I feel fine.<eos> If it's all the same to you, gentlemen, I got a business to run.
Okay, Aunt Aggie, everything is fine now.<eos> Whoa. It smells like nuts in here.<eos> What?<eos> I thought I made myself clear.<eos> I don't want anything to do with you.
Uh, I'm just wondering about...<eos> It really looks like he can't take much more of the waterboard... the interrogating... and I'm wondering maybe if we want to do a little less "interrogating"<eos> I'm a U.S. attorney, gentlemen.<eos> I represent the United States of America.<eos> The United States of America is in this room with you, so you need to watch how you treat the prisoner on American soil.
I'll talk to you!<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know!<eos> Everything you need to know.<eos> But you have to come out from behind the glass.<eos> Just come out, and I'll talk to you.
But you have to come out from behind the glass.<eos> Just come out, and I'll talk to you.<eos> Just come out.<eos> I'll talk. I'll talk.<eos> I'll talk. I'll talk to you.
Hey.<eos> Ready for your close-up?<eos> Birkhoff, got some trash for pickup.<eos> You guys should be set.<eos> Wish I was going with you.
Maybe a wild goose chase. Wasting our time. No.<eos> She had a reason.<eos> Okay, let's let forensics have this.<eos> I hope you don't have dinner plans.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right with you.
The strategy is, Clearasil stops blemishes that keep you from having fun.<eos> That means no one should be having fun.<eos> Okay. So we'll just start over.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> I don't want you to think that just because I have high standards... that means I'm not happy with you.
That's an order.<eos> If you fail, what happened here will happen again.<eos> To us, New York, Washington.<eos> You have to carry out this mission.<eos> Your country is counting on you.
He was killed when the Separatists took control of this ship.<eos> Why were you hiding from us?<eos> At first I did not know if I could trust you.<eos> Then I was not sure you would believe me.<eos> Once you saw the truth, I was simply hoping you would abandon ship and take the rest of us with you.
Since we've been together, you're on Deb patrol.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> We'll do an experiment.<eos> Let's see if you can go one whole day without mentioning Debra Morgan.<eos> What is it with you people?
I guess this answers the question about whether he came to New York for you, huh?<eos> My sincerest apologies, Captain.<eos> If I'd have had any notion that my presence here would have drawn him to your city...<eos> Hey, hey, uh, he's the twist, okay? Not you.<eos> You two should go pack a few things.
Hey, smarty, think fast. Aah!<eos> He knows.<eos> He knows it's hot.<eos> 'Cause he's smart.<eos> I don't want to talk to you guys.
If you ask me, you've been impressed with me since we met. Absolutely.<eos> And why is that again?<eos> I-I can't seem to remember.<eos> Any more questions?<eos> Take me with you!
That's right. She'll never know.<eos> She'll think you're sleeping.<eos> Come on. No, guys.<eos> Please.<eos> I want to go with you.
I need you to be strong right now in this transition.<eos> Transitions are scary, I know.<eos> But believe me, I...<eos> I would not be asking you to go through this if I did not believe that what Pegasus Horizons offers is the best thing for all of us.<eos> I mean, if I didn't, I would leave with you.
Martha here is her grandmother.<eos> She needs to be with her family now, her pack.<eos> Listen, the last time we trusted your pack with Emma, Russell Edgington got his hands on her.<eos> I found her in a cage!<eos> Luna gave her life to save her, so, no, you can't take her home with you.
Actually, we have a very tight schedule.<eos> We need to get down to the hernia clinic now.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't I join you?
Oh, tell her, baby. Make it hurt.<eos> I'll be at the booth.<eos> My panties may or may not be on when you get there.<eos> They won't be!<eos> Okay, what is going on with you guys?
What do you want to know?<eos> I did things... Things that have affected your lives, made life hard for each of you.<eos> I need to apologize for all of that.<eos> I was wrong, and I'm very sorry.<eos> And it's time for me to come clean to you.
Yes.<eos> The Humanitarian Award ceremony.<eos> Isn't that a little public?<eos> No one will expect it.<eos> I have very welcome news to share with all of you.
The child I carried wasn't meant for them.<eos> I realized the life inside of me was in danger. So I ran, I hid. And gave birth to the two of you in secret.<eos> The two of us?<eos> Yeah. I had twins.<eos> I knew I couldn't keep you. So I hid you away.
Hi, Vicky, it's Eric, your faithful associate producer, loyal, second camera operator.<eos> I thought I'd give you a little Easter Egg for when you start editing this.<eos> I'm out here, in the freezing cold getting you your time lapse shot...<eos> I still think Luke should be shooting this...<eos> But he's in there with the rest of you guys, warm, comfortable.
For which the whole world will grant me forgiveness.<eos> And I return it willingly since there is nothing of value no residue of honour, of goodness of sanctity left to defend.<eos> There will be rejoicing in the heavens as hell welcomes you with open arms.<eos> May it lie in the filth which will be its deserved home.<eos> I'll gladly die with you.
- Get to the woods behind the high school.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Just go.<eos> Well, you guys are a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Who else is with you?
Why do I seem annoyed?<eos> Let's see...<eos> Instead of savoring this espresso, this cigarette, and the exactly four minutes of free time I have today, I'm talking to you cockwits.
Oh, you are... Yeah.<eos> Let's go down there.<eos> I own that dump. We can get a suite and totally spy on Mr. Archer and--<eos> Lana.<eos> Okay, I'm going with you.
But of greater interest, four of our former test subjects are inside the Warworld and attacking our patrols. What?<eos> !<eos> How did they get...<eos> - One minute, Mr. Ambassador.<eos> - I'll be right with you.
I can do that.<eos> Sign me up.<eos> This is a classic "Do not pass go, do not collect $200" mission.<eos> We will not stop until --<eos> Gentlemen! It's been an honor and a privilege serving with you, so let's give 'em hell!
Nope.<eos> But the man who did, he's your problem.<eos> He's a hell of a problem.<eos> Little mash note from Sebastian.<eos> "Dear citizens, our fight is not with you.
June!<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> You came.<eos> Of course I came.<eos> I said I'd come to "G.M.A." with you, didn't I?
Yeah, we're thinking he lifted the stones from the store.<eos> - No, not Reuben.<eos> - Wouldn't be the first time a cop got tempted... to treat himself after looking at his paycheck.<eos> Reuben was clean.<eos> Now look, I'll work with you, but you better watch yourselves.
He won't sleep in his bed.<eos> Every morning, we find him curled up in his closet.<eos> It took us months to break him of that behavior.<eos> You have no idea what a setback that is.<eos> Was he sleeping in the closet when he first came to live with you?
I do not like the implications of that scarab imagery.<eos> We still know nothing of what put this scarab off-mode for 4,000 years.<eos> You worry too much.<eos> They all die now!<eos> Guys, this is all on you!
We'll get the carpets rolled up and everything set during dinner.<eos> So that when His Lordship walks out of the dining room, there it is.<eos> And we're to hide them until then?<eos> Hide them?<eos> You just have to keep them with you.
That seems to have made a difference.<eos> Thank God he's a snob.<eos> My Lady, I promise you - I'm sure not.<eos> But don't let's spoil the effect now.<eos> To be honest, I wish I could join you.
You're scaring me!<eos> Don't worry. We're in this together.<eos> Oh, God, what are they going to do when they find out?<eos> Find out what?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you two?
Ian, when Lily reads what's inside, I can't control what happens next.<eos> Okay, I'll read it myself.<eos> No. No. Not--not now.<eos> Not... not here.<eos> I'll come with you, all right?
They have technology.<eos> Better than ours.<eos> But they only seem to use it when they have to.<eos> They keep the humanoids they catch as slaves, but they didn't seem to know what to make of us.<eos> What did they do to you?
You don't understand anything.<eos> No, I actually do.<eos> Maybe we can find a place where we can talk.<eos> Agents, I'd like to help, but I can't disclose the details of Tara's therapy.<eos> Frankly, I'm surprised she gave me permission to talk to you.
Most fathers wouldn't do that.<eos> Again, I am so sorry.<eos> So I'll see you at lunch tomorrow?<eos> Okay, we'll play it by ear.<eos> What is wrong with you?
You think I did this for the money?<eos> I did this because not doing this meant ending up dead, and then waking up in bed with my throat cut and my tongue pulled out so I couldn't scream for help!<eos> That's what this person said they would do to me if I didn't do exactly what they said.<eos> So, yes, I lied to you, but it wasn't because of the money.<eos> In fact, if this person knew I was talking to you right now...
- No one does. - No. As a bitter reminder of a tragic loss.<eos> And that's why you're in the group.<eos> [Chuckles] Is it?<eos> I'm a puzzle with many pieces.<eos> But it feels really good to share with you one of my secrets finally.
Everyone can be persuaded.<eos> Just shove newspaper up his trouser legs and set fire to it.<eos> For God's sake, Buster. What?<eos> He'll soon make up his mind then.<eos> What is the matter with you lot?
No.<eos> Nor can we prove that Milverton was your client.<eos> Or that he left certain materials with you, and told you to disperse them should certain fates befall him.<eos> Say this Milverton guy is a client.<eos> The law would proscribe me from discussing him with you in any way.
Okay, here's an easy one.<eos> A leaky, ten-year-old beanbag chair covered in beer, bong water and fossilized Cool Ranch Dorito fingerprints.<eos> Italy.<eos> Guys, this chair has been here forever.<eos> You gotta take it with you.
Everything is in here.<eos> Your cover identities, background briefs, just read the files and you should be fine.<eos> We've set up accounts for all of you.<eos> It's not a lot, but enough to get you on your feet.<eos> And the rest is up to you.
- How long does it take?<eos> The effectiveness of the treatment is pretty fast, but it does take a while to prepare the doses.<eos> Fortunately, though, I think... I think we've got everything we'll need.<eos> Okay, well, we need to get back to the precinct.<eos> You two okay if we leave him here with you?
Did you guys get the cake?<eos> Yes, they deliver it Tuesday.<eos> So there's this, um--<eos> Okay, but she doesn't know, right?<eos> I mean, look, I'm counting on you here, okay?
I am...<eos> - I am so sorry.<eos> - You don't have to apologize.<eos> I understand why you're here.<eos> It's torn me up inside not to be honest with all of you, really. But no more.
Major Tabori?<eos> Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby.<eos> You need to come with us.<eos> Why?<eos> Why does he need to go with you?
I don't remember anyone getting arrested, either.<eos> Guess you're rubbing off on her. Dude, really?<eos> We going back to high school with this?<eos> I'm just saying she looks a lot happier then.<eos> Okay, both of you, can I talk to you, please?
Well, then he's late.<eos> Protection detail.<eos> Mr. Arziani.<eos> It's okay, guys.<eos> I'm with you.
- [groans] - All right.<eos> - [groans] - whatcha gonna do now?<eos> [tires screech] Why do I ask these questions?<eos> Why?<eos> [all scream] [all scream] - I'll deal with you soon enough, freaks.
Thank you.<eos> I'm seriously gonna miss you, sista.<eos> Ditto. Take care of these boys for me.<eos> Be seeing you.<eos> - Can I go with you guys, huh?
No... problem.<eos> Great job, ladies.<eos> Now here's your 50 bucks each which should just about cover your parking.<eos> I can't believe he pays you so little.<eos> The crowd was crazy about you.
You're his son.<eos> If anyone can contact him, it's gonna be you.<eos> What if I don't want to find him?<eos> He bailed on us, okay?<eos> The same way he bailed on you.
___<eos> I am Major Nina Pirogova from Russian Intelligence Security.<eos> I am unarmed, and I'm coming in alone.<eos> Unarmed, my ass. Walk.<eos> There is a man who is very keen to speak with you.
Yeah, just for now.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Sounds like you have a lot going on.<eos> Maybe I should've checked in a little bit more before I roped you into this again.<eos> No, I wanna go with you guys next summer.
Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Nesbitt has clearly instructed us--<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This was Nigel's doing?<eos> Per his most recent memo.<eos> He's communicating with you through memos?
Lots of cute ladies.<eos> Please support us.<eos> BombA will perform at the orientation camp finale the night after.<eos> Root for us then.<eos> I wanna dance with you.
- Helen. You... look beautiful.<eos> Peter, good luck on your history test.<eos> And Celine...<eos> You have a wonderful day, all right?<eos> - I'll follow you out in a minute.
You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> Okay? That's why I'm here, to give you guys a heads-up.<eos> They were inside my head today.<eos> If I didn't leave, they might have figured out I've been talking to you.
It'd be a mistake to underestimate him.<eos> He's gonna give you another player to even the odds.<eos> He's a captive from another tribe.<eos> This is Little Raven.<eos> He's gonna play with you.
I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> Well, it looks like the ex-wife's clean.<eos> Friends say the divorce was amicable, and she's been in Europe for five weeks.<eos> So she's out of the picture.<eos> But I wouldn't come to you without something.
- Did you really just say "hogwash"?<eos> - Okay, wait. What are we celebrating?<eos> We are celebrating the fact that you two are about to solve that whole medical mystery you were working on earlier.<eos> What do the other doctors say?<eos> Who else is working on it with you?
Beginning tomorrow, you are going to return to your normal lives.<eos> For the next two weeks you will carry on as if nothing is wrong.<eos> We'll be watching you.<eos> Listening to you.<eos> Every move you make, even when we're not with you, we'll be with you.
Perfect, especially if baby Teddy is running on the grass beside you.<eos> The next day, you do one sit-down... A full tell-all.<eos> I'd go with James.<eos> He did the Mellie interview.<eos> The public will like the story of seeing him talking to both of you now. They like knowing that he's a family friend, plus Cyrus can control him.
This happened to Hope because I'm so evil to the bone.<eos> I think.<eos> Whenever I clean her colostomy bag...<eos> I'd wonder when it'll be over.<eos> Did her grandmother live with you?
- MAN: Only for a couple of days...<eos> - GIRL: I've never done this before.<eos> MAN: That's okay, can't learn in the passenger seat.<eos> GIRL: I don't know how to do this!<eos> Did this actually happen to you?
And action!<eos> Landed on the ball.<eos> 'Cause wait till you hear what my first line is.<eos> "Neither too hard nor too soft."<eos> Did this actually happen to you?
Woman: Tell us a little about elizabeth.<eos> Tom: Elizabeth, ah...<eos> To me she's always been lizzy.<eos> Um, I remember the first time she brought up adoption.<eos> Before we ever thought about coming to see you guys.
My clients, they get their money's worth.<eos> Well, maybe Adam found out who you really were.<eos> That gives you great motive to keep him quiet.<eos> The evidence suggests he was killed on your obstacle course.<eos> You know, I don't have to talk to you.
But if we don't...<eos> I'm telling you... this club won't have a future.<eos> We've had 20 members killed in the last two years.<eos> All of those deaths tied to the gun business.<eos> Outside of guns, how you earn is up to you.
Why?<eos> When Child Protective Services gets here, he'll be allowed to talk to me, as long as he has an advocate there, right?<eos> Sorry, cher, Child Protective Services can't do anything.<eos> His mother hasn't been charged.<eos> If you want to talk to him, Maria has to be there with you.
Museum ticket sales overseas are almost back to pre-tsunami levels, though in Korea, the numbers are only about half of what they used to be.<eos> I don't know version 2 at all.<eos> I just fake it.<eos> Hello, this is the Naoto Kan campaign.<eos> He's in this very van so he can speak to you.
But you have no intention of marrying me.<eos> What if I told them that?<eos> Then this would be over.<eos> You wouldn't do that<eos> Because it's not true; I-I might marry you.
- You know what?<eos> We're gonna continue working.<eos> So, you're just gonna do this on your own, huh?<eos> That's what we're gonna do.<eos> Okay. Let's see how that works out for you.
Laceration's deep.<eos> Make sure we get a core temperature.<eos> Let's start by warming him. Then we'll address the head wound.<eos> G-Guys?<eos> Back out of here slowly and take him with you.
I mean, what if it's true?<eos> What if you did know each other?<eos> Maybe then we all don't have to die.<eos> Luke said they brought them back so that they could break the curse.<eos> Look, I am in this with you.
Crystal?<eos> Mrs. Warner, that is the same stone.<eos> Detective, you're mistaken.<eos> They only look similar.<eos> Then I suppose you won't mind if we send one of our detectives home with you to look at it.
You know, we should do stuff like this all the time.<eos> Yeah, he'd love that.<eos> - I would, too. - Right?<eos> I mean, this holidays and weekends crap...<eos> I want to be back here in Seattle with you guys.
You buzz him out.<eos> He holds the door, she whips out a hammer, smashes the case, grabs everything she can.<eos> And then, off they go.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> It's not going to happen to you.
But how?<eos> You said the king wouldn't change his mind, That you'd done all you could.<eos> I suppose I was inspired.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I still can't offer to marry you right away, like tomas.
I still can't offer to marry you right away, like tomas.<eos> You'd have a secure alliance there.<eos> Here, we can only hope.<eos> Some day it will be right for our countries.<eos> I would rather have hope with you Than certainty anywhere else.
- I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Where were you hurrying to?<eos> My father's returning from Paris.<eos> His carriage is arriving.<eos> - May I join you?
He what?<eos> Forgot that he was my brother?<eos> Forgot that you were my fiancée?<eos> I know that I've made mistakes with Olivia.<eos> Seems like the biggest mistake that I made was being completely honest with you.
Well, it lets others get between us.<eos> Not if we swear to be true to one another. Not if we promise.<eos> What is an engagement but a promise?<eos> And it means nothing.<eos> Because unless it makes sense for France, I can't marry you.
We were attacked.<eos> Locked in.<eos> Then the guy disappeared.<eos> Hey, that's our story.<eos> - Is May with you guys?
- Hmm, why not laughter and merriment, princess, eh?<eos> - You have all forgotten my glorious royal birthday,<eos> Dr. Blip.<eos> - I am hurt beyond all recognition.<eos> I never want to speak to you...
Are they the parents?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'd like to talk with them.<eos> I'll go check.<eos> There's someone here who wants to speak with you.
Come on.<eos> The stairway to the roof is directly opposite.<eos> Ok.<eos> Don't forget, you guys spread out<eos> I'll meet you on the roof in ten minutes.
- Finch, you there?<eos> - Looking for this?<eos> You two still believe you're the heroes of this story?<eos> My men will have every subway, train, and road from Queens blocked.<eos> This ends one way, and it's not with you riding into the sunset.
Guess we were all worried about you.<eos> If my number was up, I'm just glad I was with you.<eos> No one I'd rather be with at the end.<eos> Your time's up.<eos> Told you I'd end you.
I am so proud of you, baby. Oh, I am, too.<eos> - Are you really okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> He didn't hurt me.<eos> I was just so worried about you guys-- are-are you okay?
And we met a lot of great people.<eos> Hey, what about that couple we met in Amalfi?<eos> Did you get their number?<eos> I did. You ready?<eos> Okay, it's 19-565-55018... 81-453... 989-90... 016-8945-2. Well, I can't wait to see the rest of the world with you guys.
Am I a suspect now?<eos> No, no.<eos> Not now, no.<eos> Um... and we appreciate how helpful you've been.<eos> So Sean made a lot of money with you.
Fishing not paying too well these days?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Look, so somebody offers you $1,000 to drop off a package on the beach and you don't find that suspicious?<eos> I didn't ask, okay?<eos> I'm here cooperating with you, aren't I?
Do you know what that cub's name was?<eos> Lionel.<eos> That's where your name came from.<eos> I promise... I'm here to help.<eos> Just when I think life with you people couldn't get any weirder, one of you takes it to the next level.
You're through with me?<eos> That's not what I'm saying at all.<eos> We can continue.<eos> But if you ask me again to choose between you and Diane, I'll choose Diane.<eos> Does the cardinal's visit have anything to do with you?
I have to say, I'm a little jealous. Really, Ash?<eos> Because if you're serious, just tell me.<eos> I'm joking, I'm joking.<eos> You are joining us for Christmas tomorrow, Ash?<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
What?<eos> This is some bull!<eos> It's sad news, for sure.<eos> Now, you're all valued employees.<eos> But as we undergo this transition to LIFE online... we wanted to be candid with you... that some of you will be determined non-vital employees... to the new partnership.
Do you?<eos> Your wife plays in a punk rock band, staying out all night long, high on drugs, sleeping with a different man every night.<eos> I don't think the courts are gonna look upon that too favorably.<eos> But...<eos> I was just messing with you.
We can't hold up under that.<eos> We don't know what the hell movie people do.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> I'll be with you the whole way.
We are invincible and we have no fear.<eos> Because the truth makes us one.<eos> THREE MONTHS LATER<eos> The moon Nazis are coming.<eos> What's wrong with you people, can't you see?
♪ Might not be there tomorrow ♪<eos> ♪ We left our home for you ♪<eos> ♪ Please help us, people ♪<eos> ♪ We crossed the wild, yes, it's true ♪<eos> ♪ For the chance to speak with you ♪
This is Joseph Pascal, the World's leading specialist on marketing.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Today, the biggest fast food chains were reeling from a record decline in profits.<eos> Their representatives had assembled before this guru of marketing with the hope that he could make a miracle.<eos> I want to talk to you today about love.
Uh... the woman with sickly, pale skin wears big, beautiful stones that shine just like diamonds.<eos> That's because they are diamonds.<eos> You poor, ignorant miscreant little clown.<eos> Dark Lopez will scalp your wig and read the weather report with your intestines.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
Dave!<eos> My baby.<eos> My...<eos> Jed.<eos> Can I come with you?
You guys have been leaving gifts, right?<eos> The lights.<eos> Why aren't they going out?<eos> They're collecting the teeth?<eos> Pipe down or I'll stuff a pillow with you !
I am recording this, 22 June, 2091.<eos> And if you're watching it you have reached your destination.<eos> And I am long dead.<eos> May I rest in peace.<eos> There's a man sitting with you today.
Come back!<eos> I think he sued his bondman, he cut you a cheque.<eos> Well, I was hoping for cash. It would really mean something.<eos> Hey Plum! You can't get Morelli naked so you're settling for him?<eos> - What's wrong with you?
You're doing excellent work, very good.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Now come, we need to talk, huh?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Shall I come with you, bruv?
Where is the silver?<eos> Silver?<eos> Should be here.<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> To get you all in one place... to finish you.
Hey, what's going on, Crystal? How you doing?<eos> Oh, my bad.<eos> Xavier, this is...<eos> Now ladies, if a man simply introduces you as his friend, then please understand, you are nothing more than his friend.<eos> See, if a man has a plan for you in his future, then he's gonna profess it.
I had some dealings with you and Mr. Westen several --<eos> I remember you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you clearly do.<eos> I'm on loan here today from the CSS because of my, uh, experience with you and Mr. Westen.
It was really hot, and everyone was leaving.<eos> Oh. Can we leave yet?<eos> I need you to, um... I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.<eos> I've heard that everyone's going to the mountains, you see, to a shelter where it's really safe.<eos> But I can't go with you.
I'm not coming, wee man, no.<eos> Thomas will take care of you, all right?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?<eos> And you stay with this group, and I'm gonna be with you just as soon as I can, okay?
Why are you not at work, George?<eos> Oh! I got fired.<eos> You want to sell?<eos> Well, my work situation has changed a Iittle.<eos> Look, I'm going to be completely honest with you guys.
Hi!<eos> George and Linda!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> What happened?<eos> We were so worried sick about you!
You know, these are things that happen to people, and a lot of people don't even understand what it's like to be a single mother.<eos> A lot of people don't even get it.<eos> And I'm a single mother.<eos> You know?<eos> I'm a single mother, and I'm sitting here in a Britney Spears costume at a party with a son of yours that lives with you.
It would be safer if you traveled with us.<eos> If you remain, think, they'll find you and they'll turn your powers against you.<eos> Do you intend to hunt the warlock that killed my father?<eos> Not only him, but his queen and the entire coven.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Come on, don't do this to us!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Fuck, man.<eos> - Come on, man, take it easy.<eos> You got knives or weapons on you?
She's afraid the search will end if she leaves.<eos> But everyone's on the lookout.<eos> If he's out there, somebody will spot him.<eos> If he's out there.<eos> Okay, I'll go home with you tomorrow.
What happened?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Clear the dock, Edgar!<eos> - Why is he bleeding?<eos> - Is Suzy with you?
I got as far as Los Angeles, and the embassy stopped issuing visas.<eos> Did you ever call your mom?<eos> She said to give you a hug.<eos> Amen.<eos> The peace of the Lord be always with you.
What would you like to do?<eos> Your choice.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - Yeah, anything.<eos> Just hang out with you guys.
- Last year was our best year...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> It catches up, all right?<eos> Maybe there's some other things I'd like to do.<eos> Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys outside the office.
Hey, look. I hate to break up the bromance.<eos> We're 20 seconds late!<eos> Get Moneybags up.<eos> A "thank you" would be nice.<eos> -I hate owing you.
- Dentist.<eos> Now, are you the Speck Brothers?<eos> And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?<eos> - So what?<eos> - So I wish to parley with you.
Take him to the refectory.<eos> Next.<eos> - You know how to heal legs?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> They're not with you?
- Are you serious? - Yeah.<eos> He fucking did it too.<eos> Oh, you're all right, man. You're all right.<eos> Take this front-row table right here, ladies.<eos> You got your ID on you? You got your ID?
Um, Regan.<eos> This isn't what I ordered.<eos> This isn't what she ordered!<eos> I said peonies.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you? What is that?
Chinese?<eos> Vietnamese.<eos> Vietnamese.<eos> Vietnamese.<eos> Yeah, didn't we have like a big war with you guys one time?
I love you. I gotta tell you...<eos> I could eat this woman for dessert. Can we stop with all this lover bullshit?<eos> This is creeping me out.<eos> The next thing I know, one of you freaks is gonna suggest group sex.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Bottom-of-the-barrel psych unit.<eos> It must get to you.<eos> Hey, you need to keep blanketing downtown and Rainier Valley with those things.<eos> It should have been done yesterday!<eos> What the hell's wrong with you people?
Do you want me to get 'em up?<eos> No. I'll do it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Larsen?<eos> I'm done talking to you people.
The lad meant no harm.<eos> I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters...<eos> No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.<eos> Now, sit down and shut your mouth.<eos> You bring any of that good wine with you?
And you, you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.<eos> You have proof?<eos> Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?<eos> I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.<eos> You think my father's going to negotiate with you?
- What do I get?<eos> One swig, not 15!<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Stop poking around!<eos> - We're coming with you.
So, um, anyone want another drink?<eos> I do!<eos> - I'll give you a hand, mom.<eos> - Thanks, sweetie.<eos> I'm gonna come with you guys.
You would take all ofthem?<eos> You slithering serpent!<eos> Back away, Pencil Neck!<eos> Fork over Freckles and Pigtails, and no one gets hurt.<eos> What's gotten into you two?
Then why do you force this false joy upon us?<eos> We are dancing on your brother's grave.<eos> Mother.<eos> Mother. He's here.<eos> We would speak with you.
To my death?<eos> Remains to be seen.<eos> [distant thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling]<eos> Who are you?<eos> Holy Father, [faintly] I must speak with you.
You're not coming, Damon.<eos> Why? I'm the one who found her.<eos> Ok, Damon, look, Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.<eos> We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.<eos> What's going on with you two?
Abby just showed up.<eos> Good.<eos> Perhaps this plan won't be an epic failure after all.<eos> You know, if this does go off and we drop the history teacher in the Atlantic, I'm still leaving with Elena.<eos> I'll go with you.
She got the Hunter's funeral she wanted.<eos> Kind of like the one we thought we gave you.<eos> Dean.<eos> What were you thinking, Bobby?<eos> You could be in heaven right now, drinking beer at Harvelle's, not -- not stuck -- stuck here with you?
Get some men with guns and the dogs.<eos> And some dogs with guns and a fucking helicopter.<eos> Just go.<eos> Go.<eos> On second thought, I think I'll just stay here with you.
Please go.<eos> Finn Lund?<eos> You bought a house.<eos> It seemed to be in good shape, but it wasn't.<eos> Did Roar suggest he move in with you as well?
Way more bang for your buck.<eos> In fact, it may even feel like $6 million once you're there.<eos> Good boys.<eos> So since we have a deal, I am gonna take what we paid for.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
Presenting the militant academic.<eos> Bobby Lincoln, this is my teaching assistant, Sameer.<eos> Watch out.<eos> He knows Urdu.<eos> Peace be upon you.
Bobby Lincoln, this is my teaching assistant, Sameer.<eos> Watch out.<eos> He knows Urdu.<eos> Peace be upon you.<eos> And you.
Watch out.<eos> He knows Urdu.<eos> Peace be upon you.<eos> And you.<eos> Peace be with you, brothers.
- I told you, we have plans.<eos> - What are you guys doing?<eos> We're gonna go see the Martin McDonagh play and then we're going to the Hamptons for the weekend.<eos> All right, fuck the party.<eos> Can I come with you?
Clearly I have issues.<eos> June, listen. Karen's a great woman, but we just don't have anything in common.<eos> I mean, she doesn't like biking...<eos> She is in a wheelchair!<eos> What is wrong with you people? !
I had a feeling this is what this was all about.<eos> It's not.<eos> This is about your business.<eos> Well, we appreciate that, but we're very happy with MacManus.<eos> I'm sure they're very happy with you. But you don't owe them anything.
Thanks, EmiIe.<eos> It's not as bad as you think, but it's pretty bad.<eos> -sally.<eos> -Go ahead.<eos> Papa, can I come with you to see you get your award tonight?
Yep, been here for a while.<eos> Well, I wanted to tell everyone, actually.<eos> Megan, are you okay?<eos> I'm not going to be working here anymore, and it's really hard to tell everybody.<eos> Hey! Megan's talking to you.
I never...<eos> It was an accident.<eos> She saw it, accidentally!<eos> I'll take that.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with all of you? ! What the fuck!
Argh!<eos> You've got a new friend, then? Thought we'd be new friends.<eos> You guys are on edge?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with all of you?
Frankly, it's damn near impossible to do anything as a gay man.<eos> I have found several examples of case law... that I believe clearly support our argument.<eos> Okay, gentlemen, let's talk some straight shit.<eos> If I decide to take this case... everything you have ever said or done is gonna be fair game... when we walk back into that courtroom and we tell them... that the great and powerful Judge Meyerson has made a mistake.<eos> And you think they were biased against you before?
But he's right about us.<eos> Our wives from the lron islands, they're for breeding.<eos> That's not enough for us. That's why we take salt wives, the women we capture.<eos> Capture me.<eos> Take me with you when you go ashore.
A few men and a lot of problems.<eos> We need that tank off.<eos> That will not be easy.<eos> We must destroy that tank.<eos> Can we count on you?
There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?<eos> I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.<eos> A man is what others say he is and no more.<eos> If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing.<eos> I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
All struggled enough.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow at 8am, in point.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Really.<eos> tomorrow at 8am on the dot tale with you.
We're you able to get any info off the driver's cell phone?<eos> Yes... and no.<eos> Can you just give us the yes? No.<eos> Obviously a burner, but we were still able to pull the S.E.N. off the SIM card.<eos> Of course the service provider will need a warrant before they release the records, and that would be up to you.
We triangulated it down to a radius of 1,000 feet.<eos> Northwest of town, pretty remote area.<eos> Closest address hit was 21343 Murtaugh road.<eos> If someone's dealing in stolen body parts, there's gonna be a lot of families who want answers.<eos> I'm going with you guys on this one.
You're going out again.<eos> Got no choice.<eos> Pope and Anthony sent another alien patrol our direction.<eos> We don't ambush them on our terms, they could roll right over us.<eos> It's not fair! I-I should be going with you.
Uh, actually, I'll pass.<eos> I'm just gonna have water, thank you.<eos> You know, actually, I think I'll pass also.<eos> Really?<eos> ! What's up with you two?
Came from the General Secretariat.<eos> The President this track?<eos> Do not be surprised.<eos> Have not I asked two assistants, but since there are... Not send you back to Central.<eos> I will be with you.
Tell me.<eos> Kadavo system.<eos> You were right, Skywalker.<eos> I am a slave, just as you are.<eos> Someone wishes to speak with you.
I merely wish to express how honoured I feel to have played a small role in your glorious victory.<eos> Of course.<eos> The only man from Kingsbridge to have fought in your favour.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm sure there were many of Kingsbridge who were with you in spirit, but they were simply too busy making money, feeding the King's army.
But how did you know I had the ring?<eos> Once I found out Dulac was dead, I knew his ring would go to the most worthy person, and like I said, I'm a pretty good judge of character.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Now that you're a Green Lantern, will you join us in our fight against the Red Lanterns?<eos> I would love nothing more than to go with you, but I'm more than a Green Lantern to my people.
No apologies, not to him, not to me.<eos> Just do your jobs.<eos> How's it going? Oh, that--<eos> That looks better.<eos> What's with you people?
Well, then, I'll make a phone call for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Travis, I really hope you're being straight with us, because if it turns out you're just a very smart actor pretending to be a very dumb actor...<eos> No, I am not pretending.<eos> I mean, I am being straight with you.
It mostly grows inside trees hollowed out by rot or age.<eos> All right.<eos> Cassie and I will go.<eos> And we'll put the rest of the ingredients together and get the elixir ready.<eos> I-I'll go with you.
Tell me, does the phrase "corporate espionage"<eos> mean anything to you? No.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> I have no idea what it means.<eos> Could I, uh, see you guys for a second?
He's going to be so blue, he'll look like Big Bird.<eos> I'm not looking after you.<eos> You soiled yourself.<eos> You stink.<eos> Bob and Muslim, you're taking her with you.
He's there!<eos> We can find him!<eos> Mom, you good?<eos> Yes, let's go.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Everybody off the boat now!<eos> I can't go with you.
I wanted to talk to you about Maya.<eos> I know you're worried and I think she's okay.<eos> No, but I heard from her.<eos> I got an email.<eos> Spencer, Jenna wants to talk to you.
No, can't do it.<eos> Sorry, Quinto, you're going back.<eos> If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.<eos> What about me and Howard?<eos> Fine, we can double with you, too.
- Then who did?<eos> We will use Emma to make you talk. Don't put it past us.<eos> - I did it.<eos> I killed Marcus.<eos> If I come with you, you got no reason to come back to this house.
Anyone fancy a drink?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Let's drink to forget, drown me bloody sorrows.<eos> Just need a shit.<eos> I'll meet you down there.
All right?<eos> You know, I can hear you all the way down in reception.<eos> Sorry. It's my fault.<eos> I don't care whose fault it is.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with you two.
Your master and I have reached a new agreement.<eos> There'll be no new agreement.<eos> Talk to him yourself.<eos> Hold your position.<eos> I'm coming to you.
Add to that your taking down Telecom Orange last Christmas...<eos> You guys know about that?<eos> I thought you weren't involved in law enforcement.<eos> But I'm sure Interpol would be happy to finally ID you.<eos> I knew something wasn't right about you two.
- My children.<eos> - Father.<eos> - How have you come?<eos> - My blood is in you.<eos> - I'm with you always.
You guys have any idea where he was last night?<eos> No.<eos> Well, do you know who he might've been with?<eos> Wes has a lot of friends.<eos> Okay. But he still lives at home with you, right?
The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.<eos> Everyone get ready. We leave at dawn.<eos> It's time to take down my father.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow.
This is Monroe.<eos> Monroe, this is Rosalee Calvert.<eos> I knew your brother.<eos> I'm sorry. We need to get into the basement.<eos> Do you need me to go with you?
MAN 1 [ON RADIO]: You're listening to KHRN Radio live from the heart of the Cheyenne Reservation.<eos> My name is DJ Ross Strongbow and I'll be with you all night long.
I once knew him well.<eos> You and many other women.<eos> Have you met the bride-to-be?<eos> She's young and she's pretty, if that's what you're asking.<eos> Now if you don't mind, I have better things to do than to banter with you.
I've been told of your arrival.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'll have some refreshments.<eos> No, no, Prior.<eos> For once I'm not here to see you, I have business with Mother Cecilia.
And I know that you care for me, too. So...<eos> I never cared for you.<eos> I pitied you as a young man deprived of his inheritance.<eos> But you have since become a rapist and a murderer.<eos> I'd sooner die than marry you.
No, we run an honest place.<eos> Go get the keys.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Head over.<eos> He'll come meet you.
'Cause I vision...<eos> I'm talking about real time travel.<eos> I have visions of me, Kanye, Beyoncé...<eos> I could figure out what happened...!<eos> - Hey, can I talk to you guys?
But, as you can see, the Loyalists figured out a new way to use it on us.<eos> No reason we shouldn't use it on them.<eos> It's just a transport truck.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Well, as far as ocular scanners go, the only surefire way is to bring him with you.
All your friends?<eos> See?<eos> Are you sure you didn't forget anyone?<eos> To those who don't know me, my name is Betty Barnowsky.<eos> I'm here to talk to you on behalf of major investors in Europe and North America who have contributed to Xu's success.
I'm confused.<eos> Does that mean we're supposed to have sex or not have sex or...<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> We don't care.<eos> It was never really about you.
Hi.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Um, have a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't want to be seen walking into the police department, so, I thought I could talk to you guys instead?
That's still funny as hell.<eos> You know, Ed, you make jokes like that because you're insecure, so you denigrate others to feel better about yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> The point is, anger took away something that I really loved.<eos> And I'm here to try to keep that from happening to you.
I'm spoiled with Avery.<eos> He's quick, he's thorough, he's funny.<eos> - Right, in a very dry kind of way.<eos> - Right?<eos> What the hell happened to you two?
- Thank you.<eos> - Great work.<eos> - Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's lovely to talk to you.
And it's dark.<eos> You should stay the night.<eos> Where are we?<eos> That's not for me to say.<eos> - He'll talk to you.
He was gonna execute us.<eos> S-so my brother's this governor?<eos> No, he's somebody else.<eos> Your brother's his lieutenant or something.<eos> Does he know I'm still with you? He does now.
You know, hit it.<eos> Went in. Yeah, or maybe somebody opened it for her, and wiped it down afterwards.<eos> Isn't that a reach?<eos> Detectives, we got the guys who own the boat.<eos> We've taken their statements, but if you have a few minutes to sit, they'd like to talk to you.
Is this hurting you?<eos> This is all circumstantial.<eos> I was no where near those woods that night when Tug was killed.<eos> And you can't prove that I was.<eos> Now, I can't stop you from looking through all this, but I certainly don't have to talk you.
Hydraulic pressure zero.<eos> Life support failing.<eos> Kilowog, with me.<eos> We'll pick up ugly one and ugly two for a well-deserved trip to a science cell.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Look what the cat dragged in.<eos> Cats don't do that!<eos> It's a stereotype perpetuated by dog people.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I acted like I didn't want to be part of the group.<eos> And if you'll let me, I would like to not have fun with you guys tonight.
Kroyov's claims of a sleeper cell have been taken very seriously by the DOD, particularly since the exposure of the Russian spy network in New York two years ago.<eos> The agent has to have other contacts outside of the community.<eos> Maybe it's time to visit my old friend Arkady, see if he's heard anything on the street.<eos> By all means, call in all your favors, gentlemen.<eos> A-A word with you two.
I mean, that's what he said.<eos> Is it drugs?<eos> It's drugs, isn't it?<eos> We didn't know!<eos> Hey, look, I'll be straight up with you.
We aren't working, neither.<eos> Not until you protect us.<eos> We won't be sitting ducks out there.<eos> Dammit, y'all, listen to me.<eos> That road's going to get built with or without you.
Too late for what, Grandpa?<eos> We want to help.<eos> And now?<eos> It gets you out of here.<eos> But we want to stay with you.
You know what I mean?<eos> And so, I felt under pressure at the time, and I said okay for that period.<eos> Then he went to the others and went,<eos> "Look what Mick's done.<eos> He doesn't want to talk to you anymore.
But you said that Chloe shouldn't have these, That they contribute to her "problem" and...<eos> She needs antioxidants.<eos> Okay. Well, in that case, you can have 'em...<eos> On one condition...<eos> I get to go out with you guys.
hey, han, it's Spence.<eos> Please tell me that you have Maya's bag, because I am so ready for this to be over.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> The app is voice activated, so it'll record any sound that it hears.<eos> And I can pick up the feed, so I'll be with you every step of the way.
We'll take it from here.<eos> I'm assuming this is the library.<eos> If you don't mind.<eos> I shall leave you now.<eos> May God be with you.
And now that I finally have it, you want me to give it to the one who betrayed me?<eos> No, I want you to give it to the one who can help us win the war.<eos> Fine, I'll sign a document granting it.<eos> It's a wise decision, Your Majesty.<eos> I agree with you.
Yank.<eos> What are you, a tourist?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Mr Turner?<eos> Be with you in one sec, gents.
So all the victims were players?<eos> Not merely players, Mr. Callen.<eos> They were the elite of the project.<eos> Naval Intelligence referred to them as Group Echo-1.<eos> The man behind the project has been authorized to brief you both.
-No, that's not it.<eos> The point isn't whether we let them read the text or not.<eos> I believe that we have to consider if what they are saying is important or not.<eos> What they are saying is serious, it's not just anything.<eos> - I totally agree with you.
Think you can get us home?<eos> The humans, they have escaped, my Queen.<eos> They are heading for Earth now, but we aren't able to pursue.<eos> The damage to our ship is too extensive.<eos> I have failed you, My Queen.
- He's not my friend.<eos> - So you say. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Why else would I call you?<eos> That's what we're going to find out.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you guys?
I understand, um, but do you tell all of them that they're gonna be touched by death?<eos> Okay, let's just drop the act.<eos> We both know enough about interrogation technique to know that you manipulate people into offering information about themselves that you feed back to them.<eos> Esmerelda also knows a thing or two.<eos> First thing is, you can't force me to talk to you.
We can only take four flavors to represent our cupcake business.<eos> See?<eos> Not one word, ever, about anyone else.<eos> I have a pet ferret, if anyone gives a damn.<eos> Well, I have some big news I want to share with you all as well.
She's just out.<eos> You don't have anything else you want to tell us?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You know, the way you're clenching your fists suggests that you do have something you want to tell us.<eos> We can't talk to you.
It was an accident.<eos> We were up in Carrington for the retreat.<eos> Dilmer, Phippsy, Lem, and I were out in the--the woods.<eos> You know, drinking a little, shooting a little, blowing off steam.<eos> Did Lem go shooting with you?
Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's not 9808.<eos> We got the wrong container.<eos> All right, we're coming back to you.
- I get that a lot.<eos> - Maybe in another life.<eos> Where are they taking them? I was a secret agent, betrayed by my own people. Robbed of my face, my memories, my history.<eos> Xu is now decapitated.<eos> I asked the board to meet because someone wants to talk to you.
You're very good to play.<eos> I don't know why I made such a fuss about it.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> If I were to say I'd live with you while Sybbie's little, and that we wouldn't move out until she's older, would you mind?
If the vice squad saw that, they'd be pretty upset.<eos> - Zipper, not buttons.<eos> - You're bad.<eos> I wonder what Kate would say if she walked in on us in the bathroom in the next 15 minutes?<eos> She'd probably say, "I can't believe you're doing this" "and I'm deeply disappointed in both of you."
Doubt the fat man will see it like that.<eos> Fat man got one foot in the grave.<eos> What's goin' on back here?<eos> - This ain't your business. - Now...<eos> I-I-I don't want no trouble from you negroes.
Please?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'll be back for the rest tomorrow.<eos> Um- I'm going home, Dad.<eos> All I know is, I need to figure out what to do... with the rest of my life now, and I can't do that here... with you all just hovering over me.
I have no idea what you're talking about!<eos> I think you do.<eos> "Witness the Revelation. Tonight. 9:00."<eos> What's this Revelation?<eos> Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!
Especially Colorado.<eos> Parker, if we...<eos> No.<eos> This is not good-bye.<eos> - Take me with you. - No.
I know you better than you know yourselves.<eos> Max Verrier?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> There's more.<eos> Your activist friend, share any of this with you?
Artie, don't!<eos> What's tha--<eos> It's a noose that belonged to Isaac Parker.<eos> He was the most famous hanging judge in the old west.<eos> Now I'm finally done with you.
Just don't shoot me.<eos> I was having lunch at the commissary, minding my own ham and rye, when my boss came up steaming that he was going to get the DOJ bean counters to look into your budget.<eos> We have the highest conviction rate in the district.<eos> And the highest cost per conviction.<eos> And they're blaming me, too, 'cause I work with you people.
- He's having another episode.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Restrain her.<eos> You cannot hurt me with that.<eos> I know.<eos> Walter, maybe you should stay in the van.<eos> I'm coming with you.
We're not people.<eos> I am gonna be at the hospital most of the day.<eos> I'm pulling a double.<eos> Are you covering the ER again? ♪ Hey ♪<eos> Maybe I'll come have lunch with you guys.
How do you feel about spanking?<eos> For eight bucks an hour, you can do whatever you want to me.<eos> I'm available.<eos> Dad, we know.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
Order, arms!<eos> Parade, rest!<eos> Aloha.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> It's good to be with you here on this beautiful morning, and it's great to see such an incredible turnout here on historic Palm Circle to help me honor my friend, my old friend, General Krakower.
Murphy!<eos> Murphy!<eos> Murphy!<eos> Murphy!<eos> What am I going to do with you?
- Well, thank you.<eos> Uh, I'll go put those in water.<eos> - Is everything all right?<eos> - You and I should talk. Alone.<eos> - Everything okay between the two of you?
Programs of Argon, your support in coming out to such a momentous occasion proves that you care deeply about the future of your city.<eos> But I can't help but notice the absence of one of you.<eos> That's right, Argon... where is... the Renegade?<eos> You see?<eos> The Renegade doesn't care about any of you!
She proved to be an asset to the CBI on many occasions.<eos> Nothing else?<eos> Ohh... You and Summer?<eos> Look, are you gonna make a deal or not?<eos> It's always something with you guys.
There's no Sally or Thomas here.<eos> You're nobody's victim, Liv.<eos> I belong to you.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> We're gonna be here all night with you.
This is America's most wanted man.<eos> Average height, average build, wearing a red hoodie...<eos> In Washington, D.C., home of the Redskins, that narrows it down to about 100,000 people.<eos> Don't.<eos> We're gonna be here all night with you.
Why?<eos> Formality.<eos> Actually, I think I'll just use your facilities first.<eos> I think I had a dodgy egg.<eos> I'll join you presently.
Keep going.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What is with you guys? It's not our fault.
The New York Times travel section just named Springfield "America's Coolest City."<eos> See?<eos> That means Springfield is played out.<eos> Please!<eos> Please take me with you!
(chuckles) Peter, what did I say about you volunteering me for (bleep)?<eos> All right, let's do it!<eos> MAYOR WEST: Well, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna need someone who's very good at disguise.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I'd love to go with you, but I can't.
They kept crying yesterday.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> We should do something for them.<eos> to bring back some serenity.<eos> Can I count on you to help me with that?
And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.<eos> I know they're making a rhetorical point, I just don't know what it is.<eos> See you, boys.<eos> We are going drinking.<eos> Uh, wait, can I come with you?
I like your spunk... heavy.<eos> - You believe it?<eos> - Ah, it's from the dick handbook.<eos> He's supposed to say that.<eos> All right, I gave you a chance, you don't want to take it, that's up to you.
What is this, third grade?<eos> What do you wanna know?<eos> Do you get all of your clothes from Goodwill?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Let me make this easier for you.
We've roped off some seats for you.<eos> All right.<eos> You go on ahead.<eos> - Oh, are you sure?<eos> - Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.
Steady the buffs, old girl.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Congratulations, Prime Minister.<eos> - I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust placed in me by the British people today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility.<eos> And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St. Francis of Assisi.
They go way back.<eos> I got my misgivings, though, Matt.<eos> There's an argument to be made to max it out.<eos> We only do this once in a lifetime.<eos> I wanna work with you guys, I do.
Rain--that's a movie.<eos> I'm not allowed to watch that.<eos> Gary--okay, okay.<eos> We won't be needing you anymore.<eos> You have to take me with you.
I'm not allowed to watch that.<eos> Gary--okay, okay.<eos> We won't be needing you anymore.<eos> You have to take me with you.<eos> I can stop her if you take me with you.
He needn't worry.<eos> Because this case isn't about how she makes her money.<eos> This case is about her actions.<eos> How she saw a young man with signs of wealth... as a ticket out of the life she was in. And chose to target him.<eos> Now, what she didn't count on, was you.
Three, two, one.<eos> Think we should've rented a bigger car?<eos> Hey, wait for me!<eos> I wanna help save the studio!<eos> I wanna go with you!
Come on.<eos> We don't belong here.<eos> And that's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Stop. I'm coming with you.
Stop. I'm coming with you.<eos> Good choice.<eos> So, tell me about your mutation.<eos> Well, I adapt to survive.<eos> So, I guess I'm coming with you.
Don't make me!<eos> Stand back!<eos> Charles, that's enough!<eos> Erik, stop!<eos> Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.
Aye. That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape. But I'll have one last fight, by God.<eos> Kill 'em all!<eos> Hang on a minute.<eos> I just... I just need to understand something.<eos> Right, so, you will fight against them, They will fight against you.
I won't!<eos> I'm not going anywhere!<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> Let me go!<eos> I'm not going with you!
Since ho-ly pla-ces only al-low the prac-tice of things that serve the ven-er-a-tion of the Lord,<eos> and every-thing is for-bid-den that is not fit-ted for the ho-li-ness of the place, and since ho-ly pla-ces are vi-o-lated by the great in-jus-tice of ac-tions that have ta-ken place within them<eos> that scan-dal-ize the con-gre-gation, for this rea-son no ser-vice can be held there Un-til, though a ce-re-mony of pen-i-tence, the in-jus-ti-ces have been put right.<eos> The ce-le-brant tells the con-gre-gation:<eos> The Lord is with you!
Just hanging around them, being around them.<eos> The elders.<eos> And yes the family is very important to me.<eos> And, uh, I just kinda wanted to honor that.<eos> So, I'm sorry, okay, that I'm not where all of you are.
In Africa long way before there lived a great warrior<eos> Come, Chakabazz.<eos> He provided medicine to the sick.<eos> Guys!<eos> What's wrong with you, people?
- so it'll set and...<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, now that Nancy has agreed to do her... her job looks like we've got a rematch.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
- Everybody paid?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - They always do now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's been nice talking to you.
That is Shockwave.<eos> Why was he after this?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> This is an engine part from a long lost Autobot ship.<eos> Pleasure working with you.
I hope you feel bad.<eos> You should feel bad.<eos> Look at the jalopy I'm driving now. I feel bad every single day.<eos> Yo, let's go, both of you.<eos> Lennox wants to see you.
The city is secure.<eos> The humans cannot stop us.<eos> As the afternoon falls, the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.<eos> This is the victory I promised you so many years ago, where we rebuild Cybertron together!<eos> I have deigned to work with you that our planet may survive!
No!<eos> No, no, no. Sorry.<eos> You misunderstood.<eos> We're looking for our friend, 16 years old, Teddy?<eos> Teddy? Yeah, he was here with you guys last night.
And it was all a whirlwind, because we went from vans to playing little clubs to a little bit bigger clubs, and then we get in "Lollapalooza," and then you have everything blow up.<eos> I remember not being able to sleep for entire nights after the show because you'd be so buzzed.<eos> I finally figured out years later that if I took a bath, that sometimes put me to sleep.<eos> Is it like you can...<eos> Like you're just walking down the street one day and all of a sudden you feel like you're getting a lot more exposure by a lot more people coming up to you?
Come with me.<eos> I'll show you where Dad hides the good booze.<eos> - Is Charlie meeting us at the winery?<eos> - It was nice of him to invite us to the wine tasting.<eos> - It's not you guys he's upset with.
I think you're all, uh, missing the sensitivity of the situation.<eos> The hostage negotiator has the money the man wants, the gunman has agreed to release the kids.<eos> It's sensitive because of the kids, guys.<eos> You never go in with a flashbang grenade in a room full of children.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Why aren't you at the feast?<eos> Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.<eos> Well, you're always welcome on the Wall.<eos> No bastard was ever refused a seat there.<eos> So take me with you when you go back. - Jon...
That's it.<eos> You're going down, Frenchy!<eos> We're gonna do this.<eos> Let's tell Sam.<eos> What's gotten into you two?
There's a big, bad wolf. Someone has to stop it.<eos> Is that the beast that killed our mother?<eos> It may very well be.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll join you soon.
We must leave you here.<eos> I need to attempt a defence.<eos> As soon as you can, you must leave the city.<eos> It will become very dangerous.<eos> Take care, Rezo. God be with you.
My father told me all his secrets.<eos> All of them.<eos> Though the most fascinating was not made known to me until after his death.<eos> He hated you, Edward.<eos> But still, he married his only daughter to you.
Motherfucker took my fucking gun!<eos> So what are you're bringing him to the bathroom?<eos> We are in the fucking '80s?<eos> Cameras all over the place here.<eos> What's the matter with you?
You can try and bind me, but it ain't gonna hold.<eos> Oh, he didn't get it.<eos> Do it again. No.<eos> No, no, no. No, believe me, I get it.<eos> I think I need to speak slower to you two.
How much you think we've got here?<eos> I reckon about 4 or 5 loads.<eos> So, let's get cracking?<eos> Really? Now you decide to save the bank?<eos> No, man, I wanna go with you.
Really? Now you decide to save the bank?<eos> No, man, I wanna go with you.<eos> There's a fucking murderer in here!<eos> Well, I'm going too.<eos> I'm totally freaked out. - I wanna go with you.
I met with them a few times, but the damage had already been done.<eos> Their marriage was weakened by, ... sexual, ... issues.<eos> What kind of sexual issues?<eos> I don't wanna go into that right now.<eos> Brothers, God has put it on my heart to speak freely with you tonight, okay?
Fiquay, followed us even though he he ran to meet his death.<eos> He was closer to something which he had ever believed that he would not survive.<eos> I know another entrance to the nest.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ishmael I can not go with you.
She's not there.<eos> You're just gonna have to take me home.<eos> We don't have time.<eos> We have stuff to do.<eos> Then I'm just gonna have to come with you.
I did not. Yes.<eos> Phil just told-<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> She's a liar.<eos> What's wrong with you?
It's fake.<eos> Amy is ours.<eos> Don't say anything, Denise.<eos> Dr. Brennan has determined that the abuse started at age three, which means she was safe until then.<eos> How did she wind up living with you?
Ooh, well done.<eos> Of course, making your phone disappear doesn't make your problem disappear.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, come on, kiddo.<eos> What's going on with you two?
A warrior with the strength to defeat me.<eos> If I am defeated, I must obey his slightest command.<eos> There have been none, who are strong enough.<eos> But everywhere I've been, it is said, barbarians are the strongest warriors, so maybe a barbarian from your village can defeat me.<eos> - That's why I went with you.
It's good news. There's nothing wrong with either of you.
- You're welcome.<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> ID card from the Department of Energy.<eos> Shooters used plastic explosives to level your bikes.<eos> Probably think the blast finished you guys off.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, finally.<eos> Sam, I'm coming to you guys.
What's he doing in your apartment?<eos> Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over.<eos> Now I regret it.<eos> Why do you regret... Uh, never mind, stupid question.<eos> Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?
She used to be much more fun until Leonard punched her in the heart.<eos> We thought you might wanna go out, have a good time, maybe go dancing.<eos> Oh, gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.<eos> You do understand it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving your ex-boyfriend is receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.<eos> Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys will you stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya? - Yes.
Uh, well...<eos> I mean...<eos> What you did was sort of twisted.<eos> So all of you guys think that I'm some horrible person?<eos> I thought I could count on you.
Hi all you kids out there.<eos> How are you doing today?<eos> Good?<eos> Great. Guess what.<eos> I've got something very, very special to share with you today.
Do you have any problems? I mean, do any of your people know about our deal?<eos> My guys?<eos> Oh, they would -- they would never. All right.<eos> Well, wait.<eos> There was -- there -- there was one -- there was one guy that was pissed that I was talking to you.
Joe, what do you actually expect to do, man?<eos> The town's closed.<eos> We're not allowed to go back.<eos> Look, I have an idea.<eos> I'm going whether or not you come, which I really hope you do.
Do you have anything to add?<eos> No.<eos> I have nothing to add.<eos> I don't molest my daughter.<eos> He's playing you.
- We have another hour and a half.<eos> I know, but Stanley's gonna move you along.<eos> Just follow Stanley.<eos> Go with Stanley, get to the bus.<eos> I'll meet you out there.
Then don't make love like a slave.<eos> Very good, Khaleesi.<eos> Out there he is the mighty khai, but in this tent, he belongs to you.<eos> I... I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.<eos> If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
News flash, just because were on this side of the building... doesn't mean that we can suddenly light candles and slow dance.<eos> That's the opening night party.<eos> "Hello, Aria." "Hello, Ezra."<eos> Are you finished?<eos> It's not like we'll be able to go on a double date with you.
- Wait... not the Tory burches.<eos> - Hanna.<eos> No, sneakers.<eos> They wanted my laptop, but my mom said no, it wasn't in the search warrant and they couldn't have it.<eos> Look, you guys should know that there's a chance that they might try to pull this on you.
- Yes, that's true.<eos> Because of me.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All that matters is the rest of you are safe.<eos> And that's why I'm not going with you.
Oh, there's our guy.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> NCIS. We need to speak with you.<eos> Please turn around, Max.<eos> Maxine, and I don't have to talk to you.
" It'll all be okay "<eos> - Good morning!<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Before we take roll,<eos> I want to tell you that today will be my last day with you.
What is this, the 1800s?<eos> I just think it's time we all turned in.<eos> Gosh, he's Mr Fun, isn't he?<eos> Must be a laugh a minute on the team these days.<eos> I'd love to come with you.
- You did.<eos> - We did not.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Was I supposed to sue you?<eos> Was I supposed to never speak to you?
- Patty!<eos> Who's there?<eos> AC?<eos> Praise God, and good evening.<eos> Fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
Is that clear?<eos> - No, can you repeat it?<eos> - Get the fuck out of my car.<eos> Praise God. And good evening.<eos> It fills my heart with joy being with your... Being here with you tonight.
- Her mother.<eos> Yeah. Why not?<eos> Praise God.<eos> And good evening.<eos> It fills my heart with joy to be here with you tonight.
I'm gonna need some help in the kitchen... you, you, you, and you.<eos> Now.<eos> By the way, I know somebody who can really help you with that hair.<eos> Renee!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Okay, Mother Superior.<eos> You think you can get those girls to behave, be my guest.<eos> Oh, and if the little one charges, move.<eos> It's like someone dropping a sack of flour off the Empire State Building.<eos> Girls, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, we're blowing you off.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, we get it.<eos> You guys can't stand to be alone.<eos> But that's the whole reason we came here, so... nice hanging out with you, but... see ya.
A chance to start over.<eos> A chance to get it right.<eos> Welcome to Terra Nova, folks.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Taylor wants to see you, without the children.
The kid is also alone.<eos> He doesn't speak Spanish.<eos> I don't speak chinese.<eos> He's here because I found him in the street, couldn't leave him there.<eos> What I'm saying is, just until his real uncle is found, why doesn't he go with you?
I shouldn't be saying that.<eos> Fuck that book!<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> Leave that man alone!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Are we sure this thing is safe?<eos> I don't want to end up a wall decoration.<eos> Try to relax.<eos> We'll be unfrozen as soon as we arrive.<eos> May the Force be with you.
Master Plo is already en route.<eos> Gunships will arrive to evacuate you and your men, but do not delay, only a small window of opportunity shall we have.<eos> Your rendezvous point will be this island.<eos> Understood.<eos> May the Force be with you.
Any other questions?<eos> When do we drop, captain?<eos> 05:00.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Stross, cho, Kuttner, Rin, we would like to speak with you.
My, uh... My mother is a part of this organisation, she's a Gold Star Mother as well.<eos> Our house is filled with many memories, just like yours.<eos> We, uh, we see my brother, we see his smile everywhere, and my mother cries for him.<eos> And there isn't a day that goes by that we don't think of Joe.<eos> He'll always be with us, the same way that your sons will always be with you.
Am I in time?<eos> Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.<eos> Copy Neil.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you mind if we come and talk to you?
Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?<eos> Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing. Nah.<eos> It's just fingers, int it, lover?<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> I'll catch you lot up.
But how lame is it that it's a lunch?<eos> I mean, late lunch?<eos> Really?<eos> Lunch is good, lunch is low stakes.<eos> I just want to stay here, though, and go to the park with you guys.
Carbon monoxide levels are rising. We're not in the red zone yet.<eos> No jet packs or hover boards to speed things up?<eos> Oh, I knew I forgot something.<eos> So, Worth shows up here half-dead in 1908.<eos> You guys show him mercy, you heal him. He lives amongst you until 1935...
My father.<eos> Yes, he'll be staying with us. It's his choice.<eos> And all charges against him have been dropped.<eos> Well, then, I truly hope we have full diplomatic relations soon.<eos> We have a lot to learn from you.
- All right.<eos> So is she here?<eos> Where is that gorgeous girl anyway?<eos> Oh, she's off on the avion publicity tour.<eos> Oh, that's too bad 'cause I would have totally had a threesome with you guys.
She did not care, but this will scare her.<eos> Okay, listen. Do not tell yet, okay?<eos> I will not tell.<eos> Lock everything.<eos> I'll get back to you soon.
Mate, I am not fucking leaving him down here with whatever the fuck that was.<eos> Steve, listen, listen to me.<eos> I'm not fucking leaving him.<eos> Look, right now my priority is with you and Nat.<eos> I'm not going to let what happened to Tangles happen to both of you, alright?
Fair enough.<eos> Pete r?<eos> Mel.<eos> Very soon this group is gonna begin its journey.<eos> I won't be with you.
Too bad they never caught him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dosvidanya, son of a bitch.<eos> Sinners, pigs, impure ones.<eos> This is the Plague Spreader, speaking to you from the New Church of Purifying Evil.
But Tommy's so scared, you know?<eos> Asking questions.<eos> I just don't know what to say to him, Stan.<eos> I could pick them up from school.<eos> They should be here with you, right?
We want to see our mother, now.<eos> - Excuse me. Hold on, please.<eos> - What's going on? I got this.<eos> The news reported that you found the bodies.<eos> Have the police spoken to you?
What a face of love!<eos> What a mess ...<eos> Poor mothers ...<eos> Even dead, they are separated.<eos> What happens to you?
Just let us take you home.<eos> I can get home on my own.<eos> - She means our home.<eos> - Don't you get it?<eos> I don't want anything to do with you.
Daryl, you're in charge.<eos> Me and Rick, we're just gonna hang back, search this area another hour or so just to be thorough.<eos> You're splitting us up.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, we'll catch up to you.
- Are you sure there's nothing we can do?<eos> - Yeah, I mean, the FBI they said that we're good for at least $250,000 of the reward money.<eos> And in my opinion, I think you more than earned your share.<eos> That's 25 percent.<eos> I mean, I'm assuming that's okay with you guys.
What's going on?<eos> Welcome, volunteers. The Latin Quarter is all yours.<eos> You have our deepest thanks... for helping us to preserve this magnificent cultural landmark.<eos> Remember, men.<eos> The heavy lifting is up to you.
[gunfire] - No super hearing required now.<eos> - Swing wide, steer clear.<eos> - Yeah, as soon as I find Rob.<eos> So much for the stealthy.<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
Uh, can Red Tornado do that?<eos> You think I'm Tornado?<eos> Ironic.<eos> Fine, then.<eos> I won't deny you children have power. Playing hide-and-seek with you will not help me achieve my objectives.
- No.<eos> Smile!<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> This camera is only worth one guitar actually.<eos> - But I couldn't do that to you. Here.
- Is there nowhere to party in Ankara? .<eos> Sure there is.<eos> How about Manhattan, say? .<eos> I have take this call.<eos> I'll be right with you.
We've found a compatible heart.<eos> - Really? .<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm tired of losing myself as I look for you<eos> A colleague will talk to you shortly about the necessary forms.
Mama.<eos> Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> Come on.<eos> No, it's a very attractive offer, and you know I would love to work with you guys.
Help!<eos> I can't swim!<eos> I'm gonna drown!<eos> Gédéon and Gaspard...<eos> What will I do with you?
Keep walking.<eos> No one shoot.<eos> She's a Volkoff.<eos> Thank you, Bank of Macau.<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
My testosterone.<eos> I'm on 250 milligram right now.<eos> Guys...<eos> Today is my 25th shot.<eos> That's why I wanted to share with you.
You make me hope.<eos> And I'm afraid of hope.<eos> Hope for what?<eos> For days like this.<eos> In the future, with you.
Very well, unitrix... Eunice.<eos> Come with me.<eos> We'll find you someplace safe to live.<eos> I can always use more help tending primus.<eos> Thank you for letting me go camping with you.
You're My Lady.<eos> One day we'll be married in the throne room.<eos> Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them.<eos> I'll never disrespect you again.<eos> I'll never be cruel to you again.
Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I've had worse, my lady.<eos> Perhaps it's time to go home.<eos> The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
- Lord.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.<eos> What's that got to do with you?
Arya Stark, come with us. Your father wants to see you.<eos> And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? - I am wondering.<eos> - Mind your place, dancing master. - This is no concern of yours.<eos> - My father wouldn't send you.<eos> And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
I must briefly to talk with these gentlemen.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Saddle Mountain is destroyed.<eos> Good.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
She's right, Glenn. For once, I'm not here to steal your woman.<eos> I'm here to ask you to forgive me by letting me help you.<eos> I want to put more effort into giving you a proper Bar Mitzvah than I ever did into stealing those girls from you over the years.<eos> Now, Valerie and I have to talk over the particulars of the ceremony.<eos> I'll come with you.
I'm not the regular announcer.<eos> - That is all.<eos> - Cat, great news.<eos> [ Cat sighs ] This is your biological dad.<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
To the stupidest- est- est!<eos> Lady- ady- ady. In school!<eos> Iris!<eos> Hey. Hey...<eos> I'm talking to you!
Luffy!<eos> Return to the Sunny!<eos> We can also fly!<eos> OK!<eos> I'll leave it to you!
Okay, we'll just talk to everyone who he bowled against then.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> It's a tournament.<eos> And you're not gonna get these people to talk to you.
-l will. -All right.<eos> So is she here?<eos> Where is that gorgeous girl anyway?<eos> Oh, she's off on the Avión publicity tour.<eos> Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I would have totally had a threesome with you guys.
None of the above.<eos> So...<eos> Come on, share.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I found something out, and it may be the first thing I can't share with you guys.
What, pawning Grandma's necklace?<eos> Oh, my God, I don't think<eos> I've ever seen you without it.<eos> Luke probably took it off last night to give you a proper "Welcome home" hickey.<eos> By the way, Mads asked me to swim with you guys.
If you really want a story, you should look under the dome.<eos> I'm growing an ear.<eos> There's another body.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
You mind if I have a sip of your fax machine? Okay.<eos> What a delicious fax machine!<eos> Just calm down.<eos> You lied to me, man, and now I find you at a sports bar with a bunch of very attractive black men, one who looks like Dwyane Wade.<eos> Why can't I hang out with you?
I don't know what you're talking about, okay? !<eos> I don't! Oh, shit.<eos> No, no!<eos> Lying bitch!<eos> Hey, man, what's wrong with you? !
Make sure it doesn't leave the reservation.<eos> You a lucky man, Opie.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> Brothers and sisters we come together today under the all-seeing eye of nature to witness the blessed joining of Opie and Lyla.<eos> I'd like to share with you a blessing of the Apache.
But in order to protect the girl<eos> - A "lady" is enough on this trip.<eos> I did not ask permission.<eos> What if you change all and there is no one to protect her?<eos> Take as is, I'm with you.
I do not think so.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We must apparently a dragon hunt.<eos> I do not think the boy can travel.<eos> I'm with you.
See, we've done all the leg work.<eos> Now all you have to do is just radiate.<eos> - Good morning, sweetheart.<eos> - Morning.<eos> So I wanted to talk to you guys about something.
What happened in Pohang?<eos> Fuck Pohang... August 17, 1950 Pohang<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Retreat!<eos> Take us with you!
Bachir means "bearer of good news."<eos> And what's the good news?<eos> No homework with Bachir Bazaar!<eos> And Lazhar means "lucky".<eos> And the good news is, I'm lucky to be here with you.
Give it back to me!<eos> Give it back to me! Now!<eos> What's going on?<eos> He started!<eos> What's with you two?
Stop.<eos> You can't follow Dorothy.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> So you two promised you'd protect Dorothy, huh?<eos> Then take me with you.
Do I look okay?<eos> What, you come in here to get your licks in, too?<eos> Josh.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I told my mom I didn't want to talk to you.
And you're aware that you're going to get yourselves killed without Casey?<eos> I decided to let her in after we had an adult conversation.<eos> - What are you doing here, Verbanski?<eos> - Ease up, I'm not here to steal any of your "precious secrets."<eos> I'm here because I'm going on this mission with you.
- Well, you should be.<eos> - You guys passed the test.<eos> - What test?<eos> The way you guys came charging in here...<eos> I know I can count on you now.
Yes, sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines where I literally can't see three feet in front of myself.<eos> But I love these kids.<eos> And I'm sorry I kicked you out of group, but one thing you can't do with these kids is make it about you.<eos> Jess, I don't see what the big deal is, okay?<eos> I only practiced with you guys a couple of times.
Not to mention a cubic inch of bone is four times stronger than concrete.<eos> You'd have to sever the cervical vertebrae plus 18 muscles and tendons.<eos> And both carotids, the trachea, the esophagus.<eos> Now on top of murder and trespassing, he's looking at life plus 30 for ridiculous.<eos> Okay, you guys are so much fun to watch a movie with.
Awesome.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> You know, when I kissed her, I was totally picturing you.<eos> Welcome to Colombia land of lush forests, spectacular waterfalls and wily little Division assassins.<eos> Wish I was there to share the view with you, but mine is stellar thanks to our friends in U.S. Southern Command.
It's okay if he wants to come.<eos> Fine.<eos> But next time, we get a sitter.<eos> All right, I got to go to work.<eos> I'll walk down with you.
I feel that Nick is not honoring the Feeling Stick.<eos> I feel me, too.<eos> I feel Schmidt's had a particularly bad day, and I feel that if Nick is truly Schmidt's friend, he would show Schmidt what's in his pants.<eos> I feel supported.<eos> What is going on with you two?
You want your people back?<eos> Give me the girl.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> The girl will decide her own fate.<eos> If she wants to leave with you, she's free to go.
I make a promise to watch after these boys.<eos> In many ways they're my own.<eos> Then something like this happens.<eos> Colonel, so you're saying Josh was in his room the night that Bailey hung himself?<eos> What is it with you people?
We'll take them both.<eos> We need to wait.<eos> Dåådh's gone to Uppsala- -In Wåhlstedt's carriage.<eos> For how long?<eos> The secret lies with you now, Hedvig.
You're obviously not a zealot.<eos> You don't believe in radical Islam.<eos> You love the West.<eos> No more questions.<eos> I am done talking to both of you.
Hey-Hey, what's going on here?<eos> I better call 911.<eos> Oh, it's always busy when I call.<eos> What a bunch of idiots.<eos> Hey- - Aw, I can't stay mad at you.
Boss, I got here as soon as I could. Are you okay?<eos> I think your new partner is setting us up.<eos> You're out of your mind!<eos> - Am I?<eos> I did a sweep of our shop, and I found a couple of bugs, as in listening devices -- listening devices that weren't there before we did business with you.
Let's start the timer for Dr. Yang.<eos> Okay, laser, please.<eos> Is that them?<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will stay at the practice.<eos> Amelia...<eos> I said I would stay at the practice. I did not say I would hang out with you.
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will stay at the practice.<eos> Amelia...<eos> I said I would stay at the practice. I did not say I would hang out with you.
Can't we destroy the supply ship?<eos> We're trying, but with little success.<eos> Their fleet outnumbers ours, and the extra ships, we were promised have not yet arrived.<eos> We'll just have to take that capital regardless of the missiles.<eos> My battalion will meet you at the rendezvous coordinates.
I mean, no offense.<eos> You keep a lovely home.<eos> Your brother Bruce gets back from his cruise tomorrow.<eos> And as humiliating as it might be to tell him that we need his help, it's nowhere near as bad as living on a budget.<eos> Take me with you.
If this goes well, you're gonna grow up wearing name-brand clothes and get braces.<eos> How ya doing, Natesville inventors?<eos> Sorry I couldn't be there with you in person, but I got a lot of Hollywood projects, and these jackets don't cut the sleeves off themselves.<eos> Still got it.<eos> But I'm still able to be there with you because of the technology of the video chat, which somebody invented.
Say aunt!<eos> - Aunt!<eos> Aunt! - Aunt!<eos> Aunt!<eos> I knew I should've gone with you.
In the "Vzor" (window) I am watching the Earth<eos> I can distinguish folds in the terrain...<eos> Snow... forest...<eos> I'm feeling great.<eos> How are things going with you?
If you wanna wear a black leather hood and whip your own ass, work at Bank of America.<eos> So you'll be taking over his account, Mr. Davis?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Working holidays?<eos> We've been very patient with you with regard to the Fitzhugh foreclosure, but the bank is ready to sell.
You want me to stay that long?<eos> I thought you were going on your big cruise.<eos> Jill, I want you to come on the cruise with us.<eos> Pagogo, I can't believe it.<eos> Of course I'll come with you.
We're better with just...<eos> I don't even know where Jack is right now.<eos> He's avoiding me.<eos> That's where he is.<eos> Can I work in with you guys?
Mommy!<eos> Is Mama dead?<eos> Listen.<eos> You go on with Maggie and the other kids upstairs now, okay?<eos> You go up to the attic and you stay there until I come get you.
I outgrew them.<eos> I've been growing an awful lot lately.<eos> I tower over everyone in Umbradge.<eos> They laugh at me.<eos> So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like.
Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Hey. guys. we weren't expecting you.
- Fight!<eos> Fight!<eos> Fight!<eos> Fight!<eos> Come on, what's wrong with you guys?
So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.<eos> No, I'm not an orphan.<eos> Horribly tragic, I know.<eos> But by the mercy of Glaux you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.<eos> And, in time, you'll come to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.
So we what?<eos> Are you going to make the phone call?<eos> Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl?<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Don't try and take me down with you.
We know how to get home.<eos> Yeah. We know... Mr. Dorchen anticipated that you might say that, so I took the liberty of printing up some Lougle maps for you.<eos> - You mean "Google"?<eos> - Lougle maps.<eos> What's the matter with you guys?
- Oh, well.<eos> Hello. Yes, we are the Tripplehorn. Horns.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Who, might I ask, are you, to be asking us who we are?<eos> We just wanted to have a few words with you, if that's okay.
Nothing.<eos> No need to wait for him, let's have it.<eos> Feed yourself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What's with you guys?
Hee?<eos> I'm not hungry, I just wanna sleep.<eos> Me too.<eos> Bring them something to eat, go.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Don't leave me behind...<eos> Hee, wake up!<eos> Don't leave me behind...<eos> Take me with you...<eos> Take me with you...
A little exhausting.<eos> But listen, I really want to be there for the book launch.<eos> What?<eos> You're too busy.<eos> I want to be there for you.
Maybe a little 'Time-off' will be the thing.<eos> Who else could run your army?<eos> Our new General, Gulliver!<eos> I won't let you down, King.<eos> And I look forward to working with you, Vice-General Edward.
For he will be taken and sent right back here.<eos> I can promise you that.<eos> Am I disappointed?<eos> Yes, I'm.<eos> I disappointed in you.
Thank you.<eos> The problem is you've been told and not told.<eos> That's what I've seen while I've been here.<eos> You've been told but none of you really understand.<eos> So I've decided I'll talk to you in a way that you will understand.
It was good.<eos> It was really good.<eos> What?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you lot about.
- Poor you!<eos> Then we can talk about London during form time.<eos> That'll be fun.<eos> Now please get out your history books.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.
If I forget a lyric or if I hit a bad note or my rhythm gets off, that's on me.<eos> But why do I have so much pressure in my fucking life and everyone else seems to be having fun and on a free fucking ride?<eos> Can y'all hear me down there?<eos> A.J.! It's a crazy time and it's real exciting and shit.<eos> I'm nervous, but I'm glad to share it with you.
Do you want a cup of coffee?<eos> I'm good.<eos> So, what happened with Rick?<eos> What?<eos> What happened with you guys?
He's this Latin dude who gets, like, tons of babes.<eos> All right. Let's go.<eos> Hello?<eos> W- w- We're here.<eos> Oh. We'll be with you in one minute.
Look at Vauxhall.<eos> They don't have any problems with the unions because General Motors has a more collaborative approach to management.<eos> Whereas at Ford, you... Well, you only deal with the unions because you have to.<eos> You tolerate them.<eos> And as a result, they're more entrenched and they're aggressive in their dealings with you.
Connie.<eos> George!<eos> Connie! Connie, let me in!<eos> It's okay. Dear God.<eos> May the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be with you always.
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.<eos> Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday.<eos> We should move.<eos> All right.<eos> - Cobb, I'm coming with you.
Don't jump too soon.<eos> We only got one shot at that kick.<eos> We gotta make it.<eos> I'll play the music to let you know it's coming.<eos> The rest is on you.
- Hang on, hang on!<eos> What about mine?<eos> Mine's practically brand new.<eos> See?<eos> What's wrong with you people?
What about mine?<eos> Mine's practically brand new.<eos> See?<eos> What's wrong with you people?<eos> Yah, what's wrong with you?
Frankly, I don't see how I got saddled with the cost of the shear pin.<eos> It's your windmill.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Do I still get your horse?<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Yes.<eos> Da Qiang.<eos> Fang Deng.<eos> Don't think I'm annoying.<eos> Each year... we talk to you both.
"I knew that I alone?<eos> -I ...<eos> I thought you said going to bed.<eos> My room is half crowded now.<eos> I thought about staying here with you.
Acting behind my back.<eos> Armando the circus.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> How?<eos> What's wrong with you?
I mean, every time I looked up, he was looking at me.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - It was a bit unsettling, to be honest.<eos> Well, you're here now.<eos> Exactly, and I'm very happy to be here with both of you.
And I know there's not a man, woman or child in this church today that has not sinned.<eos> But God did not bring you down on this Earth to be perfect.<eos> No.<eos> God wants you down here to be saved.<eos> And when you're down with God, God is eternally down with you.
There's something corrosive in their shit.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wish I was there with you guys.
How are things with Jordana?<eos> Fine.<eos> - You ever going to let us meet her?<eos> - Maybe if you get a terminal illness.<eos> So things are serious between you two?
This is getting crazy.<eos> Hey, all my people, how are you feeling?<eos> Boy, I wish I could lift my arse up to do that.<eos> Make me some noise for that move right there.<eos> I'm not joking with you people.
Make me some noise for that move right there.<eos> I'm not joking with you people.<eos> What you got?<eos> Alright, Surge.<eos> It's on you.
I've been thinking about what we talked about. I wanna move back with you.
Jack, it's Chloe.<eos> You should be receiving a consolidated timeline plus files for travel and residency.<eos> Have they downloaded to your PDA yet?<eos> Yes, we got it, Chloe.<eos> Dana would like for me to review the facts with you, if that's okay.
Yes, hello.<eos> I was just informed of your situation.<eos> Yeah, my situation.<eos> I'm running out of time and you guys keep putting me on hold.<eos> -What the hell is wrong with you? -I'm sorry.
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?<eos> We may only get one chance at this.<eos> All right...trap's set.<eos> - Hey...he's awake. - (Tucker coughs)<eos> What the hell is wrong with you kids?
- Más de 100 metros.<eos> - Wow. 150 metros.<eos> Do you feel safe staying here?<eos> Si, in the high grounds you know you're safe. In the rivers you are not safe.<eos> If you don't bother them, they don't bother you.
Put a tracker and a bug in his car.<eos> How come you're not out with Sam?<eos> Your boy and Sam got a peculiar way of doing things.<eos> Sam thought it'd be best if I kept a watch on things from here.<eos> - What happened with you two?
He will steal your light.<eos> What light?<eos> Sookie.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Oh, are we doing this for her or for you?<eos> - Hey, you better let me hold on to that notebook. - You can do it!<eos> You can do it!<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I'll meet you over there.
Give her this note and she'll look after you.<eos> You're not coming with us?<eos> No.<eos> No, if I do, I'll put you and the children in greater danger.<eos> Masuku will be with you.
Now let's just keep this our little secret, shall we?<eos> I'll be watching you.<eos> Anybody learns about this and, well, I'll find out about it.<eos> I think you both know I'm capable of much more than just a really good blueberry crepe.<eos> Remember, hand of fate... It's on you now.
These are blueprints to the plant where Beth works.<eos> That Nazi's been imitating a Yank so he can get access to the plant.<eos> He's planning on blowing it up.<eos> We've got to find a way to stop them.<eos> I knew I could count on you guys.
You're lucky I don't cable tie you.<eos> - Why are you carrying cable ties?<eos> - Just in case.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> What is it with you men?
Wait a sec. Are you still gonna get paid?<eos> It's construction, honey.<eos> No work, no pay.<eos> Now, his ligaments are gone, which will probably mean he'll be out for, like, three months.<eos> Which is why I wanna talk to you girls.
You and me would not work out.<eos> We have nothing in common.<eos> You're Top 40.<eos> I'm rhythm and blues.<eos> I am very disappointed in you guys.
I'm just trying to spare you disappointment.<eos> I think we get your point.<eos> Aw, well, Schuester here's a prime example.<eos> He used to have that glimmer ofhope in his eyes... that I can see right now in all of yours.<eos> But... he couldn't make it happen for himself... so he now has to try and convince you all that it'll happen for you.
You have a soul, a ghost.<eos> When we see our uniqueness as a virtue... Only then will we find peace.<eos> Safely reconfiguring the child's genetic Structure.<eos> Families built better.<eos> What was going on with you at the hotel last night?
You were born of lessons... from my failure.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body, and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table... Listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not matched with the shell. That they had built.<eos> I'm projected to 2571... had failed... and they had to move on... to you.
And here we go, we are underway!<eos> I knew you would do it, Xander.<eos> You brought the world to us.<eos> The world is big, but always fits in your heart.<eos> Always have it with you. Now, go, go.
Yeah, I don't know.<eos> It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.<eos> Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care, when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa, about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?
Ed.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> No.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.
That is why I'm here today.<eos> Rodriguez Hayes must be overjoyed.<eos> Actually, I heard they were fighting.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Teddy broke up with you.
How did you...<eos> My sense of smell is my best feature.<eos> Was that a bread roll?<eos> Happy Anniversary.<eos> What's wrong with you?
This is dancing.<eos> Watch it!<eos> What?<eos> Keep with me forward all through the night<eos> It was lovely to dance with you.
It was before.<eos> And you were looking for a way out, man!<eos> I get that now.<eos> Everyone we know says we were wrong together.<eos> Your mother wouldn't stop saying that I was not the kind of girl who ended up with you.
No, not really.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> My junior prom is tonight.<eos> But my mom said I'd probably have a better chance here where nobody knew me, so...<eos> I would have danced with you.
Okay.<eos> Well, I'll see you at tryouts.<eos> All right, C.J.<eos> That was amazing to watch.<eos> She came up to you, she was very nice and warm.
- Yeah?<eos> The problem is, that's not the course.<eos> That's not the course?<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.
Brody!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That was such a great plan, just to see fire and just swim right into it.<eos> You care about me.<eos> I care about you.
They need you.<eos> Hi, Mitch.<eos> Just checking in on you again.<eos> Please call us back.<eos> We're worried about you.
I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.<eos> The mind is capable of extraordinary things.<eos> It is your mind that is speaking to you, Jakob, nothing else.
I'm not saying that that what you hear isn't real, because anything we experience is real in its own way, but it's it's not what it pretends to be.<eos> It's important to understand that.<eos> I want to hear you speak.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> I care about you.
Yeah, psycho.<eos> Have you noticed that nobody likes you?<eos> - Yeah, psycho.<eos> - Psycho.<eos> Has anyone at this party... - Has anyone talked to you?
I'm going back to sleep.<eos> I'm going to sleep in my room.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You were friends with Juliet?<eos> No one even talked to you in fifth grade, and I don't hold that against you.
Hey, it's okay.<eos> Here.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> No, I'm sorry I've always been so mean to you.
Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> It's like waking up in...<eos> In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.
I know what happened back there.<eos> Get away from me. And I feel really bad about it, and I know this may sound crazy, but I have a feeling I may be able to understand you better than you think that I could.<eos> You hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I know we haven't always been the nicest to you, but the thing is that Lindsay didn't mean anything by it.
How come you never told me about your parents' divorce?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why would I talk about something that happened a thousand years ago?<eos> Because it happened to you.
I have been a bitch. We all have been bitches, and I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go. Listen to me. I'm trying to tell you how sorry...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You said that. I'm sorry, but I have to come with you.
Put it away.<eos> So, how is Magda?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> She worries about you.
Well, we're happy to have you.<eos> Um, so I've been meaning to say we... Uh, we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim.<eos> Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe Hannah's hiding something in her mouth.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nothing in there.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> What's going on with you?
If there's a point, Roxy is the point.<eos> Wait.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Um, Maya?<eos> There's been something on my mind that I've been wanting to talk to you about.
Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.
Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?<eos> Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> Yeah, let's get the fat girl some ice cream.<eos> Hey, not everybody's out to get you, Claire.
Bullshit.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I just had this thought of like...<eos> What if I showed up with you and Claire?
Nothing.<eos> Tell me, friend, have you heard the good news?<eos> Oh, no, I'm...<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm just fucking with you!
It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?
The little fucker might like me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really have to just take stock of my life.<eos> Start counting my blessings.<eos> The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.
How'd you get money from a Viking?<eos> I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.
Am I a good person?<eos> You made so many... so many sacrifices for me.<eos> So that I could have a chance to do the things that you couldn't do...<eos> Even want to be?<eos> And I failed you.
I never thought I needed it.<eos> Or not as much as other people do.<eos> You asked me if I wanted to come out, too.<eos> I've never been out West before.<eos> I'll come find you.
I got plenty of room. You got room.<eos> Yeah, I got room.<eos> What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with.<eos> You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!
All right.<eos> I'm following you in.<eos> Please have a cold beer ready for the weary traveler.<eos> You got it, darlin'.<eos> I will join you for a cold one.
Covenant. Do you read me?<eos> Covenant.<eos> Covenant, do you read me?<eos> Covenant, come in.<eos> I'll always be with you.
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't go to Ecuador.<eos> You know it's a non-refundable trip, right?<eos> I don't want to make it about money because money comes and goes, but I don't have any more coming right now, so<eos> I'm breaking up with you.
Then she opened her mouth and showed it to me.<eos> He's lying again.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> This is supposed to be fun.<eos> I know what's going on with you, man.
Because you know what?<eos> He was the best you'll ever do.<eos> Mom, can I eat upstairs?<eos> No!<eos> I would like to eat right here with you, mom. Mama.
Who said I'm not going on that trip?<eos> I'm definitely going on that trip.<eos> I'm just trying to pick which friend to bring with me right now because, like, everybody wants to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't deal with you evaluating my life right now.
Let's go.<eos> What we need to focus on is that we got out.<eos> I don't know why I let you talk me into this in the first place.<eos> I should have stayed at the hotel.<eos> I can't fight with you right now.
You're just perfect.<eos> Okay, hold on tight.<eos> And, remember, when you get down there, get to the embassy.<eos> No, mom!<eos> I want to stay with you!
But we are gonna get you an escort to the airfield base...<eos> And then someone will get you home from there.<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without my mother.<eos> Can I be candid with you?
Yeah, that's morgado territory all right.<eos> Who's morgado?<eos> Who's morgado?<eos> Let's just say he's none of your goddamn business.<eos> - Let me come with you.
Good job with morgado.<eos> We've been looking for him for a while.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> He's so mean.<eos> Anyway, your brother really cares about you.
Where are you?<eos> In there.<eos> In where?<eos> - In there.<eos> With you.
But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I have to at least warn that lost village.<eos> Well, we're Team Smurf, and we stick together.<eos> So, we're coming with you.
- Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Before you say anything, just listen.<eos> Now, I know yesterday I might have been a bit tough on you and the boys, and I know there are times I'm a little overprotective.
Are you done crying in the woods?<eos> I've shed enough tears for those Smurfs.<eos> What's this?<eos> I'm done pretending to be something I'm not.<eos> I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.
Boys, boys!<eos> You're boring me.<eos> Let's play, shall we?<eos> My luck's running as hot as me naughty bits.<eos> But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.
Sure, Joe.<eos> But only because you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, kiddo.<eos> You're going to do it all.<eos> What's going with you today?
Sorry, Mr. Garner.<eos> Thought you were tougher than that.<eos> I'm not tough.<eos> I'm a very sensitive person.<eos> I'm going to be honest with you.
And... Not quite over.<eos> Escape route's on your phone.<eos> Right.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> The airport. He'll meet you in Bucharest tomorrow.
- A head doctor?<eos> - A head doctor?<eos> You know, a psychiatrist.<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> I'm a trainer. After we get finished here, no bully in the entire United Kingdom will dare mess with you.
The ring, if you please.<eos> Where's the girl?<eos> Bring her up.<eos> Send her up. Here.<eos> Finish the job, or I finish you.
Get on it.<eos> Oh. Enjoy syverson.<eos> He's a blast.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> All right, look. Hide this up your asshole, I will split it with you.
You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.<eos> And tomorrow we're punching back in.<eos> We're going back to work.<eos> Ocre!<eos> Someone here for you.
Shut it.<eos> Veronika...<eos> I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.<eos> Shut up!<eos> What's the fucking matter with you?
I cannot live on a promise.<eos> Soon.<eos> I promise.<eos> Come on, Spud!<eos> I'm with you, Mark. Go on, Mark.
I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.<eos> And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway.<eos> - No, it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Is she actually even with you?
Well, we can last a couple of days without food.<eos> - Someone's guaranteed to come by then.<eos> - How long can we last without water?<eos> I can't believe this is actually happening.<eos> I know I've been too hard on you.
You know that.<eos> I know you know it.<eos> Yes, but almost... you know?<eos> I know.<eos> We care about you.
The fact that you are considering this plan. Means that in three weeks there will be no money left in that bag.<eos> Is not true.<eos> This is going to have a happy ending.<eos> There will be no happy ending.<eos> You never have a happy ending.
- I like it.<eos> - Very good.<eos> I had a great time.<eos> I know.<eos> - I had a great time with you.
My thumb got stuck.<eos> Well, I'm going to pitch.<eos> That hurt.<eos> How good.<eos> He cared about you.
I will come early and ask as many questions as I can.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I will strive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm fucking with you.
- Thank you.<eos> - I will strive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm fucking with you.<eos> I'm fucking with you.
- I will strive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm fucking with you.<eos> I'm fucking with you.<eos> I'm not mad at you.
- Cutz, man...<eos> Get off the fucking car.<eos> - You sure you can handle it, yeah?<eos> - Well, it's easy, man.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Should we start talking to you now?
Gotcha!<eos> Come on, hold her down.<eos> As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Very much like you.
Understand what?<eos> How you can eat while our children are starving.<eos> Well, I have to eat, don't I?<eos> Danny.<eos> What is going on with you and Jenny?
Mary?<eos> Are you in there?<eos> Carla told me you were futzing around back here.<eos> Mare?<eos> I just need to speak with you for a moment, dear.
Is it a scorpion?<eos> - No!<eos> Is it white?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That time, I wasn't fucking with you. - You okay?
- Hey, are you okay?<eos> - Jay.<eos> We shouldn't be here.<eos> Hey. Gretchen, what is...<eos> What's wrong with you?
He's a little angel.<eos> No!<eos> Andy?<eos> Andy?<eos> Who's in there with you?
Honey.<eos> I wanna go live with Dad now.<eos> You're my boy.<eos> You'll always be my boy.<eos> I've got you, honey.
- Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell Ally I'll see her at 2:30.<eos> Daddy says he'll see you at 2:30.
That's such a shitty situation he put us in.<eos> And, you know, I feel somewhat responsible, you know.<eos> I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.
I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today, I might not have a job either, but, uh...<eos> You know, I got a baby due any minute, and I can't be losing my job, so I hope you understand.<eos> I'm gonna fight you.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I am going to fight you.
And he's goin' on and on, and he's calling you a bitch, and a big fat pussy, and a little fucking pussy bitch, and he says that you're his bitch.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> He just keeps going on and on and on that he wants to fight you.
You could just go over there.<eos> And I'd stay here if you're worried about losing your seat.<eos> I can see that that's not it.<eos> Okay. I tell you what.<eos> I'll go over there, and if he nods like this that means he wants to fight you now.
Fight's off.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> First, I was just pissed off at you.
- Let's get out there. Let's go.<eos> - Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.<eos> I don't fuck with you
- Okay, let's do this.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Trisha, this song is for you.<eos> I don't fuck with you<eos> You little stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you

It's not fair to her, and she needs to know.<eos> Hey.<eos> I agree.<eos> I just wanted you to get here and get a chance to get settled.<eos> Let Lily get comfortable with you.
No, I shouldn't have talked to you like that.<eos> I know I can come on a bit strong.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have snapped at you.
Because she's fucking crazy, David.<eos> Why can't you see that?<eos> I left her.<eos> I left her, okay?<eos> And I am sitting here, across from you, and I wanna marry you and I really don't wanna spend the rest of my life playing "she said, she said."
So I did what I had to and left.<eos> Maddie and I lived in my car, motels.<eos> And then we found these people who take care of women like me.<eos> They helped us disappear.<eos> I'm just sitting here rambling to you.
- I think it's perfect.<eos> - I don't give a shit what you think.<eos> What else do you two talk about when I'm not around?<eos> Angela, come on, what is this?<eos> Lately they've been talking a lot about how worried they are about you.
Does she have braces?<eos> Sir?<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> - No.<eos> - What's wrong with you, man?
They'll be static at first... but if I do my job, they'll go clear.<eos> Now, when that happens, I need you to find a place to hide and start yelling.<eos> The good guys will be listening and they'll come.<eos> When you get through, wait for me.<eos> I'll come for you, all right?
I'll come for you, all right?<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> Pinky swear.<eos> You got this?<eos> Can I count on you?
Let's meet at... l-37.<eos> Copy that.<eos> On it.<eos> Three times today.<eos> This morning, with you at the bar... and my hideout.
Apparently, the fire set off a bunch of grenades.<eos> Not grenades, they were blackfire's balls.<eos> I've heard about your theories.<eos> "Hulk smash!" Right?<eos> Yeah, we wonder about you sometimes, Nitti.
Yeah, that's the sound.<eos> Should be good, buddy.<eos> Jacob, you got a call inside.<eos> Yeah, Jacob here.<eos> Jacob, finally, I've been trying to reach you for a week.
What the fuck are you doing with that razor?<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> What the fuck are you doing in a ski mask?<eos> Look, I saw the lights on, took a chance.<eos> Look, I was fucking with you, okay?
Really?<eos> That's a great tradition.<eos> Happy birthday. Man, I didn't know it was your birthday.<eos> It's not, it's tomorrow.<eos> Anyway, what's up with you, man?
Reprogramming them, so to speak.<eos> Eloise was the biggest asylum in the world at one time.<eos> It had its own zip code, farm, fire department, train station.<eos> The first X-ray machine was developed here, tested on patients.<eos> Not you, Emma...
Okay, well then, tomorrow we can call the staff and get back to you guys.<eos> No, no, I was gonna use my new camera!<eos> He wants to use his new camera.<eos> I just said that.<eos> I need to talk to you outside for a minute.
Hold on, I think I hear something.<eos> All right, I'm pulling around.<eos> We can check back after dinner, I'm starving.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Yo, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.<eos> Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.<eos> - I'm right behind you oops!<eos> - I'll hold her up!<eos> Kim, I'll go with you.
City wide.<eos> Is there a, uh...<eos> There's gotta be coverage on whatever the hell this is.<eos> I mean, the TV's still working.<eos> Hey, mom, um... It's been a super weird day here and I just would love to be able to talk to you.
Reles, taking an R and R day, or you good to go?<eos> I'm good to go, sir.<eos> Chapman to all stations.<eos> Recon environment.<eos> Cole, what's wrong with you?
When you call me back on Wednesday, just ask for me directly, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I'll talk to you then.
In a minute.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That girl cannot get away with it.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Can I talk to you a moment?
Not that she'll notice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I had car troubles out her in Mitchell, but they're working on it now, so I'll probably be back tomorrow.<eos> All right, I'll talk to you then.
Millie, are you up here?<eos> Millie.<eos> Millie, are you up here?<eos> There you are.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Well, you're afraid of your own shadow.<eos> Do you think you could help me change one of the guest beds, please?<eos> These god damn fitted sheets.<eos> I hate them.<eos> What's the matter with you?
I'll kill you, you sick fuck.<eos> Sometimes mother does bad things.<eos> Sometimes mother does very bad things.<eos> Sometimes she makes me do very bad things, things that I don't wanna do.<eos> She wanted me to do bad things to you, but I wouldn't do it.
Thank you.<eos> You keep your eye on him, Billy.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Yes, mother.<eos> Oh my god, what have they done to you?
-Losing control of my vocal chord-- -[laughing] [both grunt, groan]<eos> Uh, let's just say they... have a lot of experience cleaning up stuff.<eos> You can trust us. I swear it.<eos> I accept your offer, on one condition,<eos> I must travel with you -to save our beloved dragon. -[tribesmen gasp]
I had a very vivid dream that I choked on a stun dart and lost control of my vocal chords.<eos> Come on, it's up to us to stop the lava flow.<eos> -Chocked on a stun dart.<eos> Thor help me.<eos> We shall not fail you, my queen.
Viggo went North with the dragon!<eos> Thanks, bud.<eos> Saddle up.<eos> Come on, Mala.<eos> No. I will not be flying with you, Hiccup Haddock.
If there's a queue, join it.<eos> For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases.<eos> You might wanna close that window. There is an east wind coming.<eos> You have to sit in the chair.<eos> They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.
The puzzle will save the plane.<eos> The wrong dates.<eos> She used the wrong dates from the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.<eos> Is this strictly relevant?<eos> Yes, it is. I'll be with you in a minute.
They were having a meeting.<eos> There's something about puppies.<eos> It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.
There's something about puppies.<eos> It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.<eos> No, we're mad at you!
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.<eos> No, we're mad at you!<eos> Exactly, we're mad at you.
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.<eos> You better start packing.<eos> What?<eos> You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula. I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
But how do we get past Scary Poppins down there?<eos> Okay. There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What's the matter with you?
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.<eos> I created... what I imagined biological life to be like... down to the most minute detail.<eos> Did you make a penis?<eos> Dude!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Rocket?<eos> Rocket, are you there?<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.<eos> I said shut up!<eos> I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.
It's in the caverns... below the surface.<eos> Yondu?<eos> Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
You think she should keep all her emotions bottled up inside?<eos> - Who does that serve?<eos> - "Am I missing the math?"<eos> Bitch.<eos> Can't she see that it has nothing to do with you?
- Oh, like we used to be?<eos> - Maddie, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I heard you're working at the community theater.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about the petition thing, about the play.
Emancipation...<eos> "Emancipation, mobility, music."<eos> Are you making fun of me, Gardner?<eos> No, Tulsa.<eos> I just wish I could go with you.
We have a deal.<eos> This thing is worth a lot of money.<eos> Make sure our customer and her purchase get home safely.<eos> Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
Bro.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Swear.<eos> Never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you though.
Swear.<eos> Never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you though.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry i laughed at you before, but that's not funny.
Talking.<eos> -You didn't hear me?<eos> -We weren't doing anything.<eos> -You didn't hear me?<eos> -Elliot, for the last time, bro, we wouldn't do that to you!
No.<eos> -You swear!<eos> -Elliot, stop it!<eos> Swear!<eos> What's wrong with you, Elliot?
I'd hug them.<eos> Please don't make me say it.<eos> I haven't hurt anyone.<eos> But I'm afraid of putting this into your head.<eos> All I have to do is talk to you, and you and your kids-- you're all dead.
Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do.<eos> Okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.
Oh, fuck!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What are you doing, Elliot?<eos> What's-- what's wrong with you, Elliot?
I'm sorry, but--<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't call an ambulance, 'cause you're gonna say it.<eos> You will.<eos> You will, 'cause I messed you up.
Where the hell they got ya?<eos> Oh, no kidding.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry, Harry.<eos> Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.
You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry.<eos> Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie?<eos> What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier?<eos> I saw you... walk into his office carrying a bunch of files.<eos> Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie.
No one is here.<eos> Really?<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
It's okay, honey. I hav...<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Could, uh... could you tell me what this is about?<eos> We can talk about that at the station.<eos> I want to come with you.
Nobody's listening.<eos> So what do we do about Cooper?<eos> I got another call from Jeffries.<eos> You have to hit Cooper if he's still around tomorrow night.<eos> That means you now, Darya.
_ _<eos> _<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
Nobody's listening.<eos> So what do we do about Cooper?<eos> I got another call from Jeffries.<eos> You have to hit Cooper if he's still around tomorrow night.<eos> That means you now, Darya.
Chantal, come here.<eos> You're nice and wet.<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
You're not even dressed!<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> What's go...<eos> For God's sake.<eos> What is with you?
Red purse.<eos> When?<eos> Noonthirty tomorrow.<eos> What a mess you've made of our lives, Dougie.<eos> Now, what am I gonna do with you?
Where the hell they got ya?<eos> Oh, no kidding.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry, Harry.<eos> Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.
Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie?<eos> Hmm?<eos> What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier?<eos> I saw you... walk into his office carrying a bunch of files.<eos> Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie.
No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Come on, Master Dick.<eos> We need to help him.<eos> I'm with you, Grandpa!
Respect!<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,<eos> "I hate you, Joker"?<eos> Not once.<eos> Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.
I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You and I are done!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Hey, um...<eos> Don't move until your sister comes to get you, okay?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Uh, just gotta go outside for some air.<eos> Can I go with you?
- Yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> hey.<eos> - Hey. - What are you doing here?<eos> I've been waiting to talk to you. It...
huh?<eos> See?<eos> He loves me.<eos> Dad.<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
she will.<eos> son.<eos> This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?
You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.
They don't have to.<eos> They own the pier.<eos> I just need you to watch my back.<eos> You're joking.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.
Why do you ask?<eos> What happened last night can't happen again.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm on my own here, Ward. I...<eos> We have real trouble, and you...<eos> I mean, I have no idea what's going on with you.
Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> I'm going with you.
Too risky.<eos> Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.
Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.<eos> I mean, you... you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.
Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?<eos> Did you know about the offices on the 13th floor?<eos> Well, if I had known, I would have had Ward charge her rent.<eos> Hey, I've always been honest with you, Danny.
Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?<eos> Okay.<eos> The hell is wrong with you?
I've seen someone else take on the Hand.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.<eos> I'm going with you.
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
I need to get into this building, and you're in my way.<eos> Maybe you could finish your nap elsewhere?<eos> I'm quite comfortable here.<eos> Oh, you could try to make me move... but I wouldn't advise it.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.
But it's the safest place I know.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.
Guarding an entry.<eos> If that's why you're interested in me, then... you got the wrong man.<eos> I don't need a guard, Danny.<eos> I need a partner.<eos> With you at my side, no one would stand against us.
Danny?<eos> Uh, I've been meaning to call.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Well, Danny, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.
I'll make him. If I have to.<eos> it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.
- Danny told you.<eos> - So it's true?<eos> You're in the Hand.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> I don't know that he wants to talk to you.
I need antibiotics for a wound that might have gotten infected.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> The infirmary at the compound should be stocked if that's...<eos> I can't really go to the compound.<eos> Not now. That's why I came to you.
- Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.
I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.
It's nonsense, really, but it kept us in line.<eos> Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.
That whole thing with Davos was...<eos> - Ugly.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.
You hear me?<eos> You stop this now, mark.<eos> I don't like you like this.<eos> All this anger, it's no good.<eos> I won't live with you, understand?
"Danger wank."<eos> I found it funny.<eos> What the fuck do you know?<eos> You don't even like my material.<eos> What is wrong with you?
- Do not say the H-word.<eos> - Jess, I...<eos> - I've got enough of a headache as it is.<eos> I'm just saying, you might wanna consider going home, getting some sleep, rejoining society.<eos> I'm talking to you.
Harlem's gone through changes.<eos> It was bound to happen.<eos> What's Mariah doing?<eos> The same shit she was doing when you left.<eos> Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.
We fix this thing together. Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?<eos> I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.
No.<eos> She hesitated.<eos> She didn't kill me. She had... She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.
You wanted to stay with the elders.<eos> You wanted to... use our discoveries only for good.<eos> It's time for you to know the truth.<eos> I did not want to stay in K'un-Lun at the time.<eos> I simply did not want to leave with you.
Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.<eos> Ever since you burst into my office, my life has become one big kung fu party.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.
You didn't have to do that.<eos> I know.<eos> It's been a hell of a week.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had it with you.
You might want to save this for another night.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see that you have drank the cheap stuff.<eos> Well...<eos> I will talk to you tomorrow.
So do I.<eos> Did you speak to your mom?<eos> No, why?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> She spoke to you again, didn't she?
If you don't get out of this car and march up to that house right now, I'll kill you!<eos> Anne, sit down.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> But mom promised me she's gonna stay with you.
Why can't you stay?<eos> Anne, you have got to stop acting like this.<eos> I have to go to work and you know that.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Mom's doing us a huge favor by staying here with you.
Mm-hm. Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> So glad to see you all here.<eos> Now a bunch of you are new to the company since I last spoke, so can the guppies all stand up?<eos> - Right, that's you.
Let me take you for dinner.<eos> You gotta eat sometime.<eos> Your camera and me looking so terrible.<eos> That sounds fantastic, but, no.<eos> I just... I'm worried about you.
And I'm a shit friend.<eos> I should've said something sooner.<eos> I should've, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's just so horrible.<eos> Have they spoken to you about it?
Hey, Gus.<eos> I saw your Instagram and I figured you might come here, so I...<eos> I'm, um... I just wanted to say...<eos> - Jesus, Mickey, come on...<eos> - Just, I just want to apologize to you 'cause I know I fucked everything up and I'm really sorry, and I haven't been honest with you.
- There's a real reality TV vibe about it. - Hmm.<eos> Like The Real Divorced Dads of Sherman Oaks.<eos> Yeah, or, uh, Home Makeover:<eos> Sad Asshole Edition.<eos> What is this thing you're always carrying?
Yeah. 'Cause if I stay, you know, it's gonna be...<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no, no. I get it.<eos> Well, can I go with you?
No, we do not need to talk.<eos> I'm not leaving until we talk!<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?
You want someone who is gonna fight for you!<eos> No, Dustin, I don't.<eos> Please, I don't.<eos> You don't know what the fuck you want, okay?<eos> I'm being direct with you.
_<eos> _<eos> The Marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.
You know you can just say you don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Let's go. They'll be missing us.<eos> Uh, I just need a minute.<eos> I'll meet you downstairs.
You can't keep me locked up in your penthouse.<eos> What if I gave you a key?<eos> I mean, what if you had a key, and you kept some of your stuff here?<eos> Keep all of your stuff here and you slept, you know...<eos> Are you asking me to move in with you?
Miss Steele.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.
I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.
I mean, none that I can think of. Hmm.<eos> I mean, there was a little thing of asking you to marry me, but aside from that, no.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Don't mess with me like that.<eos> No? How should i mess with you?
No? How should i mess with you?<eos> Like this?<eos> Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele...<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's actually... It's going really well.<eos> Um, but I was calling because I, um... i wanted to talk to you about Christian.
How did we end up with those kids?<eos> Would you be a sweetheart and go get me a nice pillow?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Well, the oasis belongs to the green snakes, right?<eos> I'm not planning on dying with you, you know?
Go back to the station.<eos> I'll take a last look around.<eos> They lost us.<eos> -Are you coming?<eos> - You want me to come with you?
God!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you... I was really mad at me.
Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear.
I didn't get a chance to say this... earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you... for what you did on the beach.<eos> So... you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..
Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless<eos> - I marry you.. - I...
I sleep with you if you want.<eos> - I'll sleep right there. - There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind... - No, it's up to you.<eos> - I know... - I'm just fine.<eos> - Coming to sleep with you. - Okay.
The pleasures of the flesh.<eos> Do you know about that?<eos> I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's criticism on earthly pleasures<eos> - 12 huh? - Mm hm.<eos> Did you bring any of those with you?
- I understand that.<eos> - Women and children!<eos> - We need to make our - next position by sunset.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> What is the matter with you?
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> How you like that, daddy?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - What's the matter with you? !
Because of weather up here, request permission to descend to 28,000.<eos> Roger, Speed-bird 709.<eos> Descend and maintain 28,000.<eos> We gotta notify the captain, reroute the plane.<eos> All right, I'll go with you.
What the hell?<eos> Move!<eos> Fuck!<eos> You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> - What the hell happened to you?
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.<eos> I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.<eos> Deckard?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
So, here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna go to all the local art galleries show them the picture, just try to absorb as much cock as I can.<eos> In, uh ocularly, through my eyes, not...<eos> All right, well...<eos> I'm gonna go hop on this and I'll check in with you later.
- Why you asking?<eos> You a cop?<eos> No, no, I'm not a cop.<eos> No, no, no, I'm just a friend, I'm just looking for her.<eos> She messing with you, too?
- So, a day?<eos> - One day.<eos> All right.<eos> Remind him of the due date, huh?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew, I just don't know what happened to you.
- Jesus Christ.<eos> Hey Lew, you think you could... loan me $5,000?<eos> You want me to lend you... fuck you!<eos> Steve!<eos> And what happened to you?
I know when I do my gang gestures, I like to practice in the mirror.<eos> See this watch?<eos> This watch is shit.<eos> Fuck your watch!<eos> What's the matter with you?
Listen, that little bitch Miriam sent a letter to the sheriff today.<eos> You got to intercept that motherfucker.<eos> Oh, that ain't gonna be real easy, Richard.<eos> What a pussy you are!<eos> Don't let that fucking letter get to the sheriff, you chickenshit, or I'll fuck you up bad.
Is Johnny okay?<eos> No concerns for me, as usual.<eos> What do you mean, Johnny?<eos> It was me he attacked.<eos> Sylvia, of course I'm concerned about you too.
Knock 'em dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Red door.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is with you, bradley?
We'll figure it out.<eos> But for now, I'd really like to get back to this fine Bordeaux.<eos> What kind is it?<eos> 11:05.<eos> Albert... sometimes I really worry about you.
It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy.<eos> I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.
Renege on a contract?<eos> That's what I will do.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Okay, Audrey.<eos> I'll go with you.
Oh, right, yeah.<eos> You're looking beautiful.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> So, uh, to what do I owe this pleasure?<eos> Norma, I had to make the drive 'cause I got last month's reports this morning, and I was so excited to share them with you.
- You sure?<eos> - You go.<eos> - I thought you were finished.<eos> - No.<eos> To that end... now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
- Why is that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm guessing he's very busy.<eos> Probably.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?
Andy's gonna have to work on this, and pronto!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - This is goddamn unacceptable.<eos> No, no, we need to talk.<eos> I'll talk to you later, Dick.
All right? We're gonna work this shit out.<eos> Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?<eos> I need ANA guys going in first.<eos> Trey!<eos> You take those first two guys with you.
- Sir.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Dick.<eos> Glen.<eos> The president wants to see you in DC.
We know everything about you Mister Hinds.<eos> We know more than you think.<eos> What school you went to...<eos> How old you were when you stopped wetting the bed...<eos> The names of every man your wife dated before she married you.
John I've been fucking kidnapped!<eos> By who?<eos> They have me locked in a furnace...<eos> They say they're going to cook me.<eos> I need you to calm down and tell me who is doing this to you.
How's he doing, is he alright?<eos> He doesn't know who I am when I visit him...<eos> Last time he called me Edith for an hour and a half.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that but that's actually part of the reason why I'm calling.<eos> Always the same with you, isn't it?
Are you sure, Ryan...<eos> Have I really taken everything?<eos> I think it's for you.<eos> Ryan, is that you?<eos> He said I could talk to you.
It's what I do but...<eos> I saw opportunities and I took them...<eos> Rich women, bankers, private investors...<eos> I told them what they wanted to hear and I took their money.<eos> Leslie, I'm sorry I did that to you.
I remember your wedding.<eos> I was there and it wasn't some rich bitch.<eos> You should have come to me when you found out.<eos> Why?<eos> Adam was already dead and I was so pissed at you...
And what do you have on me?<eos> The goods.<eos> The goods?<eos> Oh, that sounds bad.<eos> Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?
It's not like I'm going anywhere.<eos> Sorry about the village.<eos> But it's just the same old village, though.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'd give up a million villages just to be with you here forever.
- Amen.<eos> - Hey, you got a girl friend?<eos> - No.<eos> Really?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Easy.<eos> Easy peasy.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Got a sticky knob...<eos> Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you there like in five minutes? Okay.
Get in.<eos> Usually we come here on Sundays because mom says it's too much sugar to have more than once a week.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wow.<eos> So, Hugo I wanna talk to you about Arden...
On a less positive note, I believe I failed you miserably.<eos> I thought Harry was just a stupid stuffed animal for babies.<eos> He is.<eos> Mom?<eos> - Can we sleep with you tonight?
- Stay in the car.<eos> - Ma'am!<eos> I'm just gonna be a minute.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Bonnie, can I talk to you for just a second?
Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions about Planned Parenthood, Bonnie answered them.<eos> Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.<eos> There was no parental usurps of any kind, I promise you that.<eos> But I can discuss that whole thing with Maddie.<eos> What I wanted to take up with you is...
You do almost 50-50 in the childcare.<eos> You even cook.<eos> Right, so you're the guy who likes to fish and hunt, and I'm Mr. Girly-Man?<eos> - That's not what I meant at all, man.<eos> - Okay. I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you.
They're ignoring me.<eos> They won't call on me anymore.<eos> I don't know, Billy Boy.<eos> Maybe we oughta drop this.<eos> I don't wanna have to worry about you.
Okay?<eos> And I need you.<eos> Scott, you're my brother.<eos> All right, so...<eos> So if we're gonna do this, then, I think you're just gonna have to take me with you.
Ojo said the girl went round the pass.<eos> Ojo was lying.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
- Because I know you.<eos> I know the man you are.<eos> And I'll prove it.<eos> I'll clear your name.<eos> Let me come with you.
Go to hell.<eos> How did you get those?<eos> Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.<eos> So, August, can I count on you to build my arsenal?
What kind of Magic is this?<eos> Magic strong enough to kill a witch. What is it?<eos> A bullet more powerful than Magic.<eos> Sylvie, did you do this?<eos> Can I count on you to build my Arsenal?
But I wasn't tortured for my sins.<eos> I was rewarded for them.<eos> My punishment...<eos> My punishment is that I remember.<eos> As will you.
Not the only one.<eos> When she gets to Glinda, she'll stop this war before it even starts.<eos> Randall.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Can I count on you to build my arsenal?
Where is he?<eos> The Wizard.<eos> Gone to Ev.<eos> With our army.<eos> Guess we'll have to settle for you, then.
You think I'm talking of love?<eos> Love means nothing compared to survival.<eos> Then go back north.<eos> If you do, The Wizard will have no reason to fight you, and you and all of your girls can live in peace.<eos> I do owe you some gratitude for protecting this girl.
Right now, we have to go before it's too late. - Why?<eos> - Dorothy...<eos> Why did you leave me?<eos> I made a promise to keep you safe.<eos> Well, I would have been safe with you.
Hey, Ann. I gotta go to work.<eos> Hi, it's Karen from SwimTech.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> I was hoping to catch you.
I'm an officer.<eos> That's my partner, Francis Poncherello.<eos> - What's up, bro?<eos> - Dude, that is awesome!<eos> You know, my cousin competed against you in freestyle.
He was amazing.<eos> I wish he would've stuck with it.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well, hey, look, man, welcome.<eos> I cannot wait to work with you.
You have something going on intestinally and you're too proud to stop at a Walgreen's or a CVS to deal with it.<eos> Is it a chronic thing, or did you eat something dicey last night?<eos> Just drop it!<eos> Listen, okay...<eos> Don't pull away. I'm worried about you.
- So just grab me and get it over with.<eos> - Fine! You're such a homophobe.<eos> Stop calling me that!<eos> - You won't even look at me!<eos> - You'd have to be gay for me to be homophobic towards you!
So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> When I am healed, I am gonna physically destroy you.<eos> Get the fuck out of my room.<eos> Call Peterson. He's looking for you.
Fuck.<eos> Pull a fucking gun on me?<eos> - I didn't know it was you!<eos> - You're not gonna answer your phone?<eos> You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA to talk to you?
Let's make love on that desk right now.<eos> No, you know what? I take that back.<eos> - Let's fuck on that desk right now.<eos> - Don't make fun of me.<eos> I am not making fun of you.
Or the time when we went camping? I said, "Fucking mosquitos bite the shit out of me."<eos> Doesn't matter as long as our skin doesn't come in touch with DEET.<eos> What is your point, Nathan?<eos> My point is I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage, a lot of hoops I jumped through for you, and now I'm doing those same things for Bonnie.<eos> Personally, I'd rather shove an electric eel up my ass and have it gnaw through my intestines than sit down with you and fucking Psycho Ed.
Stick that up your tight ass, bitch!<eos> You were fucking brilliant!<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Um, yeah.<eos> It's actually kind of annoying that you look like that and you're smart and educated and intelligent and sympathetic. You even had Cruella agreeing with you in the end.
The last time we had pizza and we went to the zoo, you told me we were moving to Monterey.<eos> What now?<eos> You're gonna go see a child psychologist.<eos> I think he plans on signing up for a class, that's all.<eos> Did he hit on you at all?
- What are you doing here?<eos> - To talk to you.<eos> Have you been following me?<eos> - No, I haven't been following you.<eos> - Oh, my God. I wanna talk to you about what I did at the theater. You can't do this out of nowhere!
I mean, what kind of project is this, Nathan?<eos> Well, if it's a secret project, then that's probably why I don't know about it.<eos> I mean, why are you on Abby's Facebook page?<eos> How did she friend you?<eos> I'm not her friend, I'm her mother. And it's my job to be on it and it's yours, too, particularly when she's living with you.
Did you make a copy of the tape?<eos> No!<eos> I... - Miss, the seat belt light is on.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> What is going on with you?
I'll fight you for it.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not fighting you.
Try that on for size.<eos> Is this Wisconsin? That's our next stop.<eos> Welcome to Kentucky.<eos> Now be nice to the lady we're visiting, but not too nice.<eos> She might take a fancy to you, and that would not be good.
- G'day.<eos> That is an actual woman, by the way.<eos> Hey, Griffin.<eos> So, are you good?<eos> Are you all right?
Yeah, of course I know that.<eos> This is all just a ploy to get to you.<eos> It's not too late for us.<eos> Okay, get your own girl. Goddamn.<eos> She's all mad at you 'cause you never take my advice.
Okay, that was my fault.<eos> You were one of my favorites.<eos> You hear that, Chris?<eos> Huh? You're one of her favorites. Chris?<eos> Hey, it's Chris. I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
You hear that, Chris?<eos> Huh? You're one of her favorites. Chris?<eos> Hey, it's Chris. I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.<eos> Chris!<eos> Hey, it's Chris. I'm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.
I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.<eos> Or I will break him open...<eos> Shh! Shh! - ...<eos> I'm not going with you anywhere!
His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.<eos> That's okay.<eos> If I die, I'll just come back here to you.
I'll see you around, Clay.<eos> Tony.<eos> Am I side two?<eos> Hey, Helmet.<eos> Can I eat with you?
Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Listen, Clay, I would like to talk to you sometime about Hannah Baker.
But you saw it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't, like, trace the handwriting.<eos> I didn't think it was that big a deal.<eos> Do you think she's right?<eos> Does everything that happened to her go back to you and that list?
It's just graffiti, right?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> In honor of Halloween, your in-class essay today will analyze this quote from chapter four of Beyond Good and Evil:<eos> "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster."<eos> I'm worried about you, Clay.
Group-texted half the school.<eos> Okay, look, calm down.<eos> No one can tell that's us.<eos> You don't think they'll figure it out?<eos> I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.
No snapping of arms.<eos> For days after Tyler's picture went around, I tried to catch your eye.<eos> You ignored me for weeks.<eos> But I decided enough was enough.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, that smell is me.<eos> You're really not doing so well.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Hey... it's good to talk to you about this.
- Listen...<eos> - Nope, no "listen."<eos> What follows "listen" is nothing good.<eos> Let me put it this way. Repeat after me:<eos> "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you."
Let me guess: You two are seeing Never Say Goodbye for Valentine's Day.<eos> No, we're seeing Thirty Ways to Die.<eos> You're a classy date.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I am.<eos> What's up with you, man?
Relax.<eos> - Come on, Jess.<eos> - Jess.<eos> - Relax, it's fine.<eos> Jess, what the fuck is going on with you?
You get back here, young man!<eos> Zachy!<eos> Poor Zach!<eos> Yo, Zachy!<eos> You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.
How you doing today?<eos> What do you want, Marcus? Did you and Tony talk yesterday?<eos> We sure did.<eos> Okay, and you're just... doing your own thing.<eos> Okay. Okay, look, I understand that you're going through your own process or whatever, but I'm worried about you, man.
Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.<eos> Do you have any idea who?<eos> Who told you to check my bag?<eos> Start with them.<eos> Your classmates are concerned about you, and so are we.
But it was a party.<eos> Everyone had too much to drink.<eos> And besides, how can you blame someone for something that happens while they're unconscious?<eos> Look, I know you're mad right now and you have every right.<eos> Honestly, Clay, I'm not mad at you.
People are not gonna find out. Why are you protecting Bryce?<eos> What does he have on you?<eos> I'm not protecting Bryce, you little fuck!<eos> God, I'm protecting Jessica!<eos> I care more about Jessica than I do about Hannah, than I do about you, than I do about anybody else. All right?
- Why aren't you?<eos> Cut it the fuck out.<eos> - Throw it back.<eos> - Jess, stop.<eos> Jess, what is happening with you?
Well, I look forward to it.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I actually didn't ride my bike here, so we can't do that.<eos> So, but I'll go get the drinks.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.
- Why?<eos> - My parents need me to work at the store.<eos> Which kind of sucks, because I really like working at the Crestmont.<eos> I do too.<eos> What I mean is, I like working with you.
- Yes, you did.<eos> When you saw that picture!<eos> I didn't believe it.<eos> I was angry for a minute because... because I was jealous of Justin.<eos> And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.
Hi.<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> - Great.<eos> - Uh, is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine, I just wanted to talk to you about... something.
I don't care.<eos> You will.<eos> Someday, you will.<eos> Someday.<eos> Even if you can persuade her to keep you... she'll no longer be enough.
The car stays outside.<eos> You gotta hand over your guns.<eos> We only have two.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.
Then you can stay.<eos> We can talk.<eos> How many people do we have?<eos> To fight?<eos> I'll go with you.
Yeah.<eos> You went to see them, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.<eos> I will go with you to Alexandria, if you want to make the trip... if you want to talk to him.
Benjamin not -- would not -- Man, I said now not!<eos> I said...<eos> Y'all just go.<eos> Do you really want to know what happened in Alexandria?<eos> What happened to you?
Even if you shoot and graze him, he doesn't die.<eos> I won't miss.<eos> If we go in and get caught...<eos> I won't get caught.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Whatever you decide, so it shall be.<eos> No pressure.<eos> And, again, I am sorry you had to see that, even though I know you have seen some things.<eos> I just want you to understand... we are not monsters.<eos> What did they do to you?
Jerry's going to... spend some time... divorced.<eos> Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie.<eos> I hope I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.
Is Rune involved in what happened?<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - I know you're trying.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm talking to you as your sister.
- What are you gonna do?<eos> Choke me?<eos> - Excuse me! - Don't you...! - Stop, stop!<eos> - My God, my eye!<eos> - What the hell is wrong with you?
Get in the car.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you trying to be funny?<eos> Trying to be serious.<eos> What is going on with you?
She suspects, she doesn't know.<eos> I did a good job of denying it.<eos> Not that my capacity for denial would be a fraction of yours.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm busy.<eos> - The thing about you, Madeline, is that...
Do you actually feel sick or do you just not want to go to school?<eos> I feel sick.<eos> You don't sound congested.<eos> I have aches.<eos> Is it possible your heart aches 'cause the other kids were told not to play with you?
You're coming, I presume.<eos> Yeah, I'll be the one dressed as Audrey Hepburn.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Listen, um, Bonnie and I went to see a counselor today, one that specializes in teenagers.<eos> And I just wanted to share something with you.
You do?<eos> It's your turn to have one now?<eos> Max, look at me.<eos> It's all right.<eos> The tooth fairy's gonna come for you, okay?
I think she just needs a minute. I...<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I'm talking to my wife, not you. Celeste, let's...<eos> let's just go now.<eos> - We have to talk about it. - No!<eos> I'm not coming home with you.
You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky.<eos> I can help you.<eos> - First, you must do something for me.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Gotta fight you?
Hold on.<eos> Hey, you called me.<eos> I'm just having an honest reaction here.<eos> And no, it isn't business as usual.<eos> I'm gonna fight you on this.
Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.<eos> Where's my lawyer?<eos> Where's Mr. Hashem?<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
- What'd you say?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> Delete the recording.<eos> You're really something, Mathison.<eos> I gotta hand it to you.
You got all your friends here.<eos> You want to make an entrance.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> That's not why I wanted to meet you here.
- You're just sayin' what?<eos> Just want everyone here to know that...<eos> I'm a law-abiding citizen.<eos> You serious right now?<eos> We're just messing with you, man.
Then stop the bad advice.<eos> How can you be so sure. Iran's not building a bomb in North Korea?<eos> I can't, but neither can you be so sure they are.<eos> And that's the point, isn't it?<eos> I came to you as a friend, Carrie, an admirer even, and I'm telling you this in the same spirit...
I don't think you understand how vulnerable you are.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> Mommy, can we go now?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, we can.<eos> Nice talking to you, Carrie.
For what?<eos> Exposing an FBI informant, for one thing.<eos> That asshole?<eos> He deserves what's comin'.<eos> It's you I'm worried about.
- That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
Brought where?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> They'll tell us when we're airborne, ma'am.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll catch up with you.
Hey, sweetie.<eos> Can you wake up to get to the car?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> She's had a long day.<eos> You sure it's okay, us staying with you?
A bomb has been planted.<eos> An FBI agent is dead.<eos> I-I don't know who these people are, but they are serious.<eos> And they're connected.<eos> I'm worried about you.
I'm gonna ride with Keane.<eos> You sure?<eos> - What about Quinn?<eos> - Is he there, too...<eos> With you now?
You're still out there going a million miles an hour.<eos> You will hit a wall.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm worried about you.
I will.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> So don't be upset.<eos> - Don't be upset?<eos> I've been trying to reach you all afternoon.
I thought it would be better in person.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> We should.<eos> I don't even mean the immunity part.<eos> I mean, you know, what's going on with you.
- Who was that?<eos> - Work.<eos> I need to go to Australia.<eos> Just for a couple of days.<eos> Can I come with you?
- Right.<eos> I'm gonna find them and I'm gonna destroy them.<eos> Wait!<eos> Is this real?<eos> I didn't know how to handle you talking to a dead person.
Someone is standing by to meet you in Melbourne.<eos> Can you be there with $20,000 in cash?<eos> Yes, I can do that.<eos> I need to go to Australia.<eos> Can I come with you?
I have to go.<eos> - Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They want me to get on a bus.<eos> - You want me to go with you?
- Oh, so sorry.<eos> Would you like us to add your name to the room so you can have access to all the guest amenities?<eos> Yes, that would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam, but at least I get to be having pancakes with you here this morning, right?
No, I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> The last time I told you everything, I woke up handcuffed to a bed and you were gone.<eos> Kevin.<eos> I didn't know how to handle you talking to a dead person.
Where's everybody?<eos> Inside, sleeping.<eos> I drugged their food.<eos> Jesus, Laurie.<eos> Well, I wanted to talk to you.
To who?<eos> The Prime Minister of Australia.<eos> Gentlemen, can the president and I have the room, please?<eos> Yes, if you can...<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?<eos> Did I wanna call you?<eos> Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?
It's fucking unnatural.<eos> They'll all follow you.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Flint thinks these people would run when confronted by the governor's men.<eos> He's so convinced they won't stand behind you and fight, he's ready to hand over the cache to avoid the outcome.
That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.<eos> I would far, far rather do this with you than against you.
You fall asleep, dream you're French-kissing Ryan Seacrest, then you wake up, and it's two rats fighting over a hard-boiled egg in your mouth.<eos> No. I broke up with Bobby. And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No.<eos> He killed you, and now you're a ghost?<eos> I don't want to make sexy pottery with you.
Um, no one knows.<eos> They found him lying by the soccer field.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He really cares about you.
Listen, son, I...<eos> I don't expect you to forgive what I've done, but you have to understand the consequences here.<eos> If you go to Rebecca, you will be ruining yourself.<eos> - Dad. Dad. - I beg you, please.<eos> I was just coming to talk to you and your father about campaign managers.
Please, Isaac... No, you gotta believe me. No!<eos> The rest of y'all, get your phones out.<eos> I wanna know who you've been talking to.<eos> I said get your phones out!<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna see you then.
Let's do this.<eos> You got some balls coming back here again.<eos> I got business.<eos> Something for Gabriel.<eos> You think he's gonna do business with you again?
I can't help you with that.<eos> Find someone who can. And bring them to us.<eos> You let my wife go, and then we'll talk.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I'm not negotiating with you.
Tell me where Nicole at.<eos> Where's Nicole?<eos> Isaac.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I was worried about you. I'm all right.
He's going through a lot right now.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> I just... Look, no, Nicole.<eos> I, um...<eos> I wasn't being honest with you. And for that, I'm sorry.
When he hears the news we are bringing, he will grant us an audience.<eos> No, no.<eos> There's no "we."<eos> I have as much to gain and more to lose than any of us if we fail to see Governor Rogers removed.<eos> - I believe I should be with you.
Not only that, but when I told you this story, you insinuated yourself into it.<eos> The latest in a line of ill-fated partners, situating yourself such that... were you and I ever to come to blows...<eos> I'd be forced to hesitate before doing you any harm.<eos> - Slow down, I...<eos> - I'm not angry with you.
But give me what you can find on Lila Facchini.<eos> Lila Facchini.<eos> Got it.<eos> I know you got some kind of really complicated problem here.<eos> And while some people might get a bit freaked out with you talking to empty space all the time, you know, I'm totally cool with shit like that.
Did something else happen?<eos> Something's always happening.<eos> Something happened to the cluster?<eos> There was a protest in India, a riot over water in Nairobi.<eos> But mostly I was just worried about you.
Get used to it, get used to it!<eos> That's the most fun I've had in my entire life.<eos> That's what you told me once.<eos> Joaquin, what are you doing here?<eos> I wanted nothing to do with you.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.<eos> Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere... I have to leave.<eos> I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.<eos> Mom... I miss you.<eos> I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
- Nothing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.
- Whoever's after you is probably after her.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> It also means they're gonna come after anyone who tries to help us.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He's just worried about you.
For six months, I trained with the best bartenders in all Mexico.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For my role in Blood-Stained Tequila.<eos> Relaxing, isn't it?<eos> I feel I can talk to you, Wolfgang.
Come home to me.<eos> See you later.<eos> I must go.<eos> I would like to continue this conversation.<eos> I'll find you.
- You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.<eos> I could get offed just for talking to you.
No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.
It sounded serious.<eos> It's just late.<eos> - You should go back to bed, Kala. - What about you?<eos> I'll... I've got some things to do.<eos> I'll join you.
Riley.<eos> Is Nomi okay?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Lola says she's a bit concussed but she'll sleep it off.<eos> She was more worried about you.
- Call an ambulance.<eos> - No, no. - Call an ambulance, please!<eos> - I can't get to a hospital.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Come on, what's wrong with you, baby?
I care about one thing and one thing only.<eos> You touch me here, I'm yours.<eos> You don't, I don't care how many fans you have, you mean less to me than the shit I took this morning.<eos> Sit.<eos> I'll be honest with you, I watch your films and I see the same male apery that has spread like a cancer through this industry, and I'm sure this meeting is a waste of my time.
- Hi.<eos> - We saw your speech.<eos> - It was beautiful.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> I love that you brought him up there with you.
It's to be admired in a sense, but that is the last time you use it today.<eos> I'm a man who could make things difficult for you, but I won't.<eos> As long as you'll understand this.<eos> Your next opponent is that boy.<eos> And I want him to have a very good time playing against you.
The time to recognize that has long since passed.<eos> We are at an inflection point.<eos> We have to make big changes to the company. We have to make it quickly.<eos> And I am getting conflicting advice from my people.<eos> The kind of things that I bounce off you and it all makes sense.
Stop it, put me down!<eos> How about... We start in the kitchen?<eos> Well, to be fair to the entire house, I think it should be included.<eos> It's a lot of rooms. You sure you gonna be up for that?<eos> As long it's with you, I'm sure I'll rise to the occasion.
It's just, we've been having some timing issues, that's all.<eos> - So, are we talking. Like, premature? - No!<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look, he wants it and I'm not ready, and then I want to and he's not into it. I don't know.<eos> You know what, I feel really uncomfortable talking to you about this.
Paul, hey.<eos> Hey, what happened?<eos> I missed you this morning.<eos> I had an issue with the plumber.<eos> - Hey, what happened with you and Jen?
I've always thought it's totally overrated.<eos> - Oh, great, it's working.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, my phone was out, earlier.<eos> Stacey, would you mind if I made a really quick call and I just meet you downstairs in a couple of minutes.
Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.<eos> "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.<eos> I'm really happy for you, Devon."<eos> I am happy for you.<eos> You've been an asshole ever since I told you I was gonna buy my place.
Looks like someone forgot to do laundry.<eos> You wanna move it to the side for me, cowboy?<eos> It's in my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm super mad at you.
I have to run a school, and you have to go enroll in one.<eos> You know the saying,<eos> "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.
You know the saying,<eos> "If you see something, say something."<eos> Please stop.<eos> Honey, I care about you and your friends.<eos> But mostly, I care about you.
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> We summoned some kind of killer moth man from another world.<eos> My friends who got separated and I just...<eos> I can't let them fight The Beast on their own.<eos> You want me to come to Fillory with you?
Alice.<eos> Apology accepted.<eos> That was you apologizing for what you did.<eos> I just... if we survive this, I hope we can be friends still.<eos> I know it may sound stupid, but that's what I'm mad at you for, not... not the cheating part.
Shade.<eos> It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.<eos> And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.<eos> And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.
Yes, I'd love to.<eos> That'd be so much fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know it's only, like, 5:00 in the afternoon, but I've been drinking a lot of wine today.<eos> I kind of want to make out with you.
Special edition. Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Grazie mille.<eos> I'm not gonna say "prego mille."<eos> What's up? What's wrong with you?
- into computer programming. - Yeah.<eos> I don't really like it, but I'm kind of good at it, so...<eos> You're amazing at it.<eos> Norman, you should see the Website she's making for us. Oh.<eos> It's easy with you.
Don't get all sanctimonious.<eos> There's a party on Saturday night.<eos> I'll be home late.<eos> Carlos, sit down.<eos> Your mother and I want to talk to you.
Where are you going?<eos> - Have you seen my boyfriend?<eos> - No, but if I were him, I wouldn't leave you on your own.<eos> When will you give me a chance?<eos> I'd never get involved with you.
- All right.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Carlos!<eos> - Swear that you told no one!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I swear.<eos> Go back to your friends.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'd like you to be happy.<eos> I'm happy with you.
It's true.<eos> Until a good dick appears.<eos> I think I did it to try to forget you, and so you'd forget me.<eos> Did you fuck him?<eos> Being with you was the loveliest, most romantic thing I've ever known,
You're safe now! You're safe!<eos> - I'm getting the hostage!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - You could have killed that guy.<eos> - What's going on with you, man?
There's a landlord-tenant confidentiality clause in your lease.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> Okay, there's not, but I really wanna know what's going on!<eos> Fine. They're anti-depressants that Dr. Berkowitz thought I might need, but he doesn't know what he's talking about, so...<eos> Yeah, it sounds like he really cares about you.
Not today.<eos> Move over.<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm going to spoon you.
I have a boyfriend.<eos> - Okay, I didn't know that.<eos> Obviously.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've spent exactly zero seconds thinking about hooking up with you.
Zack, listen to me.<eos> Let me go.<eos> If you don't, Booth will find you, and when he does...<eos> Stop. I'd prefer you not talk about him.<eos> Zack, what has happened to you?
Got it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> We tried to get you over the intercom, and then when you didn't come, I might have kind of panicked.
Hey.<eos> Whoa. Hi.<eos> Dude.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry about the mess.<eos> Erika's super pissed at you.
Why didn't you text me?<eos> And who is she?<eos> - I'm Mickey.<eos> I work with Truman.<eos> - Uh-huh. Tru, can I talk to you on the balcony?
So...<eos> Relax, Gus.<eos> Jesus!<eos> You could use some weed.<eos> I'm not wasting this weed on you, though, 'cause this stuff is unreal.
He wasn't easy to find.<eos> All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know.<eos> It's my job now to take care of things, okay?<eos> Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen.<eos> You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now.
So Aubrey asked me to look into communications between Austin and his colleague, Matt.<eos> And I found this online portal. "Tutor Talk"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've looked through most of the messages and they're almost all work-related.<eos> Hey, has Hodgins been acting different around you lately?
Aubrey, didn't they tell you there's cake in the break room?<eos> Look at that, huh?<eos> Hey, no, I'm okay.<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you? Come on.
Guilty of ethnic cleansing.<eos> That pretty much confirms it.<eos> Look, my unit was the one who killed him in the '90s.<eos> I was the one who took the shot.<eos> Too many links to you, Seeley, for this to not be about revenge.
We need to get him to the hospital now.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Oh, that... No, I'm fine.<eos> No arguments.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.<eos> No, I'm-I'm not mad.<eos> But for future reference, it's preferable to be informed of any pending medical procedures.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I was just dreaming about you.
He loved you.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, I mean, I don't know... why I'm crying with you.
All right?<eos> Come on, Bone Crusher.<eos> Get in there, Wanda.<eos> Come on, Wanda-tanda from Buffalo.<eos> She gonna take you down, Mad Dog.
Oh. Actually, uh, these are both for me. Wow.<eos> Anxious about the big move?<eos> I guess you could say that.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the opportunity, it's just...<eos> You haven't asked Jessica to move with you yet.
Quinn, Charlie wants to take you to the Caribbean so he can propose to you.<eos> Unless he wants to kill you.<eos> Which one is it, Charlie?<eos> Do you want to murder her or you want to marry her?<eos> I want to marry you, if you want to marry me.
Liv.<eos> I wanted to offer my condolences.<eos> Thank you, Liv.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> I was worried about you.
Wait. Did you drop something?<eos> No.<eos> Rapunzel, from the moment I first met you and you knocked me out with that frying pan, I knew it was love.<eos> You're my light, you're my best friend and I want to be your partner in all things.<eos> I can't wait to laugh with you and share with you.
There you are, um...<eos> Look, Rapunzel, I am sorry.<eos> I am sorry, I should never have put you on the spot like that.<eos> But I want you to know, I meant it.<eos> I want to marry you, I love you.
Alpaca?<eos> Sorry, look...<eos> I know there's still a ton of details we need to figure out... and I may have jumped the gun a little.<eos> It's just that... growing up poor and alone... I got used to having nothing.<eos> But now with you, I finally have something, you know? We have something.
Helped villagers rebuild their war torn homes.<eos> Mom, is this yours?<eos> Did you actually do all this?<eos> Rapunzel, before I met your father,<eos> I was so much like you.
- So you admit that you freaked out?<eos> Wait a minute, I didn't freak out.<eos> You haven't been trying to get me to talk because you're freaked out that I freaked out?<eos> No, I've been trying to get you to talk because, you know, I'm...<eos> Well, I'm worried about you.
We did it, Mike.<eos> However this plays out... I have no regrets.<eos> Michael!<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.<eos> I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.
"By your hand "you shall know the glories of your Progeny "and our world will be made right forevermore."<eos> Hell if I know what that means.<eos> But just like that envelope's addressed to me, those words are addressed to me.<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm trying to work with you here.
Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> C-Note told me what's going on.<eos> He tell you to talk me out of it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming with you.
What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but... No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.
You are using him as bait. You son of a bitch.<eos> She knows not to hurt him.<eos> You were so obsessed with Michael that you would risk my son!<eos> Michael?<eos> You mean you.
He was taking yang to my girl.<eos> - Took me one second to do it.<eos> - Don't do it!<eos> Listen to him. He's a very smart man.<eos> I'm talking to you, Whip.
- You don't have to explain yourself...<eos> - No, let me finish.<eos> Sex never meant anything to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> And things are so different with you, and...
Just sit.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Holly?<eos> - We have a lot to talk about.<eos> I haven't been completely honest with you.
It worked.<eos> She's in.<eos> Your king's on the table.<eos> Well, go save him.<eos> She won't talk to you.
No, I didn't.<eos> - Sorry we couldn't pick you up.<eos> Work.<eos> Did you get settled in?<eos> So, Jack is very upset with you.
- That's it?<eos> No, you're definitely judged.<eos> When you eat, points magically appear.<eos> What he means is, if you're maintaining or moving towards your goal, you go up a level.<eos> - How you do it is up to you.
- Yeah, me too.<eos> We get along great.<eos> She was the only one who had something to say that wasn't entirely self-serving.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
- Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?
- He did?<eos> What did you say?<eos> - Well, that you'd decided to leave.<eos> He wanted to make sure you were okay.<eos> A boy wanted to speak with you.
You betrayed your troop chief.<eos> You might as well have gut-shot him.<eos> I didn't tell Rip anything he didn't know himself.<eos> That's why he left.<eos> You lose it like he did, I'll do the same thing to you.
And the new guy? What's his name?<eos> Chase?<eos> He's getting there.<eos> Well, he's lucky to have you.<eos> You know, we should invite him over for dinner, like rip did for you.
Jimmy McGill.<eos> Hey, Jimmy. We are almost done here.<eos> - Great.<eos> Can I, uh... - We're almost done.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
- Okay.<eos> - Early.<eos> Great meeting you, Ricky.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
Maybe you bury her, too.<eos> She didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> - Richard, you can't just...<eos> - Na'omi.<eos> Your whore digs with you.
You know a hospital that has rape kits?<eos> Dharma, don't joke about that.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna take him out?<eos> Jesus. I'm just messing with you.
The Emir...<eos> Let me worry about the Emir.<eos> I have his blessing.<eos> Are you with me?<eos> The answer is, "Yes, I'm with you."
We got your back. Gotcha.<eos> - Joe, how you doing?<eos> - Good to go, sir.<eos> Remember Captain Pearson?<eos> Wanted to talk to you about how things went down in Nigeria.
The guy that rip killed?<eos> He might come over here and kill Anabel and Ricky Jr.?<eos> Ricky, I made peace a long time ago with what you do.<eos> I don't care if rip killed him.<eos> I care about you, about us.
I can't tell you anything that I don't know.<eos> You have to give me something. I've been out for two years.<eos> It's all changed by now.<eos> Waterboarding didn't work with me.<eos> It won't work with you.
This is Michael's handwriting.<eos> Swan was his calling card.<eos> He's reaching out to us.<eos> But why is he being so mysterious?<eos> Back in the day, he never talked to you straight, as in - not in code?
Did you?<eos> Like who shot JFK?<eos> I am trying to be serious here.<eos> No, you're doped up on painkillers and you're thinking too much.<eos> I promise this has nothing to do with you.
I'll leave you two be.<eos> Let me know if you need anything, sir. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Sorry, how did I end up with you again?<eos> You asked for the State Department's help.<eos> I wanted the State Department, not you.
- Sorry, how did I end up with you again?<eos> You asked for the State Department's help.<eos> I wanted the State Department, not you.<eos> Yeah, you've lived so many lives, I don't know who you are.<eos> That'd be a consistent theme for you, wouldn't it, given that you were married to a man who never existed?
That's why I couldn't pull it off when I was in that cell, because the guy across from me, the guy in this cell, wouldn't cooperate.<eos> We have to work together. Come on!<eos> - No.<eos> - Cross!<eos> I'm not working with you.
- You're not that fast.<eos> - One second.<eos> Please don't do this. You will lose.<eos> Listen to your friend.<eos> I'm talking to you, Ramal.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, Alexis.<eos> - Alan called, he wants to see you.
I, uh, I ran into town to get some coffee.<eos> - Do you want anything?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm good. Thanks, honey.<eos> I'm almost done here. I will see you at the lake in a little while, okay?
The airport's the only play.<eos> The airport is five miles away. The border is hundreds.<eos> Look, the airport might be the right choice, but I trust my instincts. They've gotten us this far. And my gut says we can still make it out through the north.<eos> Choice is yours.<eos> Look, man, I agree with you, even if I don't know you from Adam. But... got to go with the horse that got you here, you know?
Oh, man!<eos> Now that's a voice I never thought I'd hear again.<eos> Man, you got some explaining to do, brother, - risen from the dead and all.<eos> - Soon.<eos> Where can we meet you?
We stay clear of CIA, any offensive action.<eos> We're surveillance only.<eos> We just want to put eyes on him.<eos> I think I can get you in as observers under interagency auspices.<eos> I knew I could count on you.
He was... honest and hurt, and I bought it.<eos> Who is he? Really?<eos> He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?
"But in return, you must take a life."<eos> show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.<eos> Wait. Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.
We don't do anything.<eos> Your part is over.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing. Poseidon... he knows your face. Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.<eos> You've been a warrior, and I owe you.
Naw, I'm gonna skip today.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> - I fucked up my wrist.<eos> - Hey, Sal. - Hey, baby.<eos> Listen, I need to talk to you about Mikey.
Use property as collateral against some cash loans.<eos> All of it.<eos> Rob, do you understand?<eos> Yeah, yeah, no, I just...<eos> I'm just worried about you, man.
I'm not convinced.<eos> Yeah, let's get you convinced.<eos> Rusty, open up!<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - I need to talk to you again.
Vicki, you're doing the best you can, okay?<eos> - Who's she been running with?<eos> - I don't know, some punk kids.<eos> This kid is your best shot to finding Eddie king.<eos> Now you're going to have a much better chance if I don't go with you, 'cause they're gonna make me for sure.
I hate both of you.<eos> You're so lucky 'cause you had each other!<eos> Well, that's the King brothers.<eos> That's why I can expect something different from you.<eos> Jesus, man, I did that to you?
- It will be all right.<eos> Everything's going to be all right!<eos> JP Lindell.<eos> I work for Eddie King.<eos> Mr. King would like to have lunch with you today.
And you make sure that you bring the money, that your brother owes me, and then you will fix this.<eos> All right, now I'm not hungry but... lunch is on me.<eos> Alexis, it's your uncle, JP.<eos> You gotta call me, okay?<eos> As soon as you can, I'm really worried about you.
Everyone who crosses your path ends up a fucking casualty.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hey, Stacey, I'm sorry I'm so late.<eos> Oh, no worries.<eos> She had trouble sleeping. I'm sorry. She kept insisting on FaceTiming you and Michael.
Needs pecorino?<eos> Do you remember your fifth birthday? And I made you spaghetti? Your absolute favorite.<eos> Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.<eos> Just try some.<eos> You really think I want to have a meal with you?
I had no choice, Jonathan.<eos> My enemies were closing in.<eos> I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.<eos> Father of the year.<eos> Look, we had ten years together, and sure... I may have been hard on you, but... It's because I loved you, son.
I can smell it.<eos> And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.<eos> - Now, get off of me.!<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
And I should've stuck to my guns.<eos> But no, I let you convince me.<eos> How many years of memory wipes was it?<eos> Twelve.<eos> Look, I owe you. Let me help with Alec.
As if you haven't been through enough, now the Clave wants to rip your family apart?<eos> - I'm talking to Aldertree.<eos> - It's not his call.<eos> The transfer orders came from the Council.<eos> Then I'm going with you.
- How is she? She's hurt pretty badly, but she's gonna pull through.<eos> It's nice to hear something positive. Yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> About Idris...<eos> There is a part of me that wants to come with you... but... I have to learn to stand on my own.
The Clave is reassigning me to Idris.<eos> I just got you back.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> The Clave wants to rip your family apart?<eos> Then I'm going with you.
Your shoulder still hurts, huh?<eos> A little stiff.<eos> Uh, don't worry about me.<eos> Keep an eye on Clary.<eos> I should have just said I'd go to Idris with you.
Clary, I am so sorry.<eos> I would do anything, I mean anything, to take back those 30 seconds. To get your mom back.<eos> Alec, maybe we can get her back.<eos> I found a warlock who claims she can do it. But there are risks.<eos> I'll go with you.
Let's do it.<eos> Are you here to see Dr. Rouse?<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> I think she's expecting me. My name's Clary.<eos> I was indeed expecting you.
If you're lucky enough to be accepted into the sisterhood, you're marked by sacred runes.<eos> It's what allows the Iron Sisters to shape pure adamas.<eos> The Sisters call upon the power of the angels to imbue our blades with their energy.<eos> I hate to leave you.<eos> Then I guess I have to come with you.
It's Maia, right?<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Probably just going through shock.<eos> How about I sit right here?<eos> Ride with you to the hospital?
The first time... that's always the worst.<eos> But you learn to control it.<eos> You just can't give in to yourself.<eos> You gotta fight.<eos> And those who care about you... they'll fight with you.
- Seventeen thousand?<eos> - It was all in the past.<eos> Ancient history.<eos> But right now I'm here.<eos> With you.
You think that I don't wanna be there for Clary?<eos> For all of you?<eos> But what use am I if I can't control myself?<eos> Luke, you've gotta fight.<eos> And those that care about you will fight with you.
Hopefully.<eos> Do you wanna sit?<eos> I mean, standing works, too.<eos> Okay. What's going on?<eos> I get this weird text to meet you here at, like, 11:00 at night?
And that includes me and Magnus.<eos> Together.<eos> - If Dad were here he'd understand...<eos> - Well, he's not.<eos> Alec... I don't want to fight with you.
How so?<eos> Alec told me that Robert proposed to you in Barcelona.<eos> I wanted to celebrate a joyous memory.<eos> Especially since he couldn't be here.<eos> How sweet that Alec feels comfortable sharing our personal family stories with you.
- Mom says you're not even part of our family.<eos> Jace, I...<eos> This is your fault.<eos> I've tried to keep Max out of it. The hell you have.<eos> He learned this behavior from you.
Sorry.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I was so selfish, hiding in the woods like that.<eos> You would have never went to Iris if...<eos> Luke, this has nothing to do with you.
You've seen my file. You know what I've been through.<eos> You know I get claustrophobic.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm doing this for your own safety.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.
I'm myself again.<eos> good story, but I've heard better.<eos> Wait, in the vision from Ithuriel, the demon that destroyed the Sword had a clawed hand.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.
OK.<eos> Help me. Help me!<eos> I'm fine. Just a little tired.<eos> Nothing a good night's sleep won't fix.<eos> I can come back home with you, if you'd like...
It's no use just tracking the dead bodies.<eos> With his ability to dematerialize, he could be anywhere.<eos> Maybe we can help.<eos> Izzy!<eos> We've been so worried about you.
Rosa's right.<eos> You're a catch.<eos> Clary.<eos> - Hey. - Um...<eos> Look, I... I'm sorry if I was too hard on you tonight.
Definitely good enough to hunt down whoever's murdering our people.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll take all the help we can get.<eos> Just report back with any leads, okay?<eos> -[Alec] I'm going with you.
You're telling me that this burnout used repressed memories<eos> - to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped
Just my colleague merely frequents this establishment at this hour.<eos> Sorry, Jefferson.<eos> You should go back to the Waverider.<eos> I can handle things from here.<eos> What the hell is going on with you, man?
Even the hippie knows it.<eos> And he also knows that the only way to stop Thawne from screwing us over is for us to work together.<eos> Two former members of the League of Assassins versus a speedster.<eos> I am liking those odds.<eos> Dude, what is going on with you?
Love and hate, they're so close. It's easy to mistake one for the other.<eos> You're gonna spend the rest of your life with him. But I remember giving you the ring. Singing to you.<eos> I can't do this. No, yes, you can.<eos> Okay?<eos> I will be here for you.
That's the Speed Force.<eos> Barry isn't going to hell.<eos> But like all runners must eventually, he's reached his finish line.<eos> His race is over.<eos> You can't take him with you.
It is not your place to question my agenda.<eos> Your freedom, your life is contingent on following my orders.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey. Thanks for coming in.<eos> No problem. I wanted to talk with you, as well.
I mean, ever since the party, you been off.<eos> You're supposed to be the happy one, remember?<eos> Like what?<eos> !<eos> Like this? ! What the hell's gotten into you?
What makes me so special?<eos> If you stay in the same spot for more than a minute, and I'll get a chance to tell it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna make a sales pitch, make it good.<eos> You went through something traumatic.<eos> For the past 3 years, you've been trying to understand it because you're afraid of what happened to you and of what you've become, so you're running from it.
Let me guess.<eos> You're trusting me with your mask off, so now I'm supposed to trust you.<eos> I just thought that if you weren't gonna listen to the Green Arrow that you might listen to Oliver Queen.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I spent 5 years in Hell, not unlike what happened to you when you were undercover in Sonus' organization or what he put you through when he discovered you were a cop.
Why do you deny your father's wish for you?<eos> You saw the reason tonight.<eos> I am not the man that my father raised!<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're afraid of what's happened to you, of what you've become, and you're running from it.
So instead of marrying the blonde, you marry Ra's al Ghul's daughter?<eos> Uh... Nyssa talks too much.<eos> She hasn't explained your beef with Chase.<eos> My past is coming back to haunt me.<eos> Seems to be a recurring theme with you, kid.
No. Upstairs, please.<eos> Start your homework.<eos> I'll be right up, honey.<eos> Hi, Jean.<eos> I have been trying to get a hold of you. I wanted to see what you guys were doing for Dolly's birthday.
It's not real.<eos> Now just go be with your friends.<eos> Go on, enjoy the party.<eos> You're not mad at me anymore?<eos> Oh, honey, no, I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're my girl, right?
I don't know.<eos> I don't necessarily mean that.<eos> - Hey. Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
- Hey.<eos> - Arya's not here. - Okay, I'll just...<eos> I'll come back later.<eos> Uh, no, no, no. Nope, come here.<eos> - I need to talk to you for a second. - All right.
$850. It's for my rent.<eos> $850?<eos> I thought she gave you, like, 100 bucks.<eos> And you took it?<eos> What the fuck's wrong with you?
All right.<eos> That's... an astute way of putting it.<eos> I was just reading them, you know, 'cause...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm worried about you with Witchita ending, right?
Don't say that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You just want me to work so you have a job.<eos> Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?<eos> I just prefer to have a job with you, 'cause you're cool, all right?
I heard you.<eos> I heard both of you.<eos> Honey, listen.<eos> Obviously, we love you so much.<eos> It's nothing to do with you.
Sounds like the reason an astronaut died.<eos> "We don't know what to do.<eos> He was in Gravity Subzero."<eos> Truman. I can't.<eos> - I can't with you right now.
I slept with you because I thought it would save my job, and it was a mistake.<eos> Sure.<eos> Repressed emotions are something I'm very familiar with.<eos> I deal with it all the time on my show.<eos> - I'm gonna be honest with you.
Well, she does.<eos> Her name is Patricia, and she's a pretty fuckin' big deal in young adult publishing.<eos> Are you bringing anyone?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Great talking with you! Great!
I know I messed up, and... I'm truly sorry.<eos> I'm sorry too.<eos> It's really not you.<eos> It's him.<eos> He was shitty to you.
I've been hooking up with an ex.<eos> Ever since Witchita ended, I need something stable in my life.<eos> - Oh, totally. I hear that. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, so what about you?<eos> Is Mickey staying with you this whole time you've been in this dump?
You're, like, keeping tallies on me all the time.<eos> Like, four meetings this week, three meetings last week, and you're fucking, like, checking up on me.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you go find some rich old guy, and you can be his kept woman... and he can fucking ignore you, which is what you want.<eos> You don't want anybody caring about you, you don't want anybody looking out for you.
- Is that really lame to say?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, look, you're living out of a suitcase in a hotel room in Atlanta.<eos> I get it.<eos> But I'm not sure I can have phone sex with you after you said the word "homesick."
I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for checking in, Dr. Gus.<eos> - I'm just... concerned.<eos> - Don't be concerned, dude!<eos> I'm not concerned about you.
- I think I have to end it.<eos> - You're gonna break up with him?<eos> I prefer to think of it as setting us both free.<eos> Here's my advice.<eos> Do it over text, and then block his number so he can't yell at you.
Something that's gonna open up your life in many ways.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> What did we, like, win something?<eos> We did not.<eos> Um, I'm breaking up with you.
We're looking for a U.S. general that has gone rogue.<eos> We have reason to believe he's trying to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.<eos> What concern is that of yours?<eos> Are you gonna help me find this man or not?<eos> After business with Leonov, just me sitting with you squares us with Gregor, yes?
The people in this data cache, they're not good people.<eos> I'm starting to believe that purpose on this earth is to stop people like them, like Walker, no matter what the cost.<eos> Sometimes, you got to fight fire with fire.<eos> I'm not worried about them.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Uh, there is a whole mess of angry Russian dudes outside.<eos> I have location for Walker and men to help in fight, but we have to leave now.<eos> Your strange friend's pronunciation is horrible.<eos> Yeah. I'll tutor him later.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.
Oleg said that you needed to tell me something.<eos> It can wait.<eos> You know, if visiting Star City's sister city is what it took to get you to bed, I would have bought you a ticket to Russia months ago.<eos> A friend of mine told me that my...<eos> My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.
You know, if visiting Star City's sister city is what it took to get you to bed, I would have bought you a ticket to Russia months ago.<eos> A friend of mine told me that my...<eos> My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.<eos> Looking at all this, I can understand why.<eos> What exactly happened to you on that island anyway?
I was working on a different story, and, well, some things came up that relate to you.<eos> And then you just immediately jumped to the most insane conclusion possible.<eos> So that's... that's a no for the record?<eos> No. For the record.<eos> Well, good because I think our relationship is complicated enough already just with you being mayor.
Don't worry about my men.<eos> - They are loyal to me.<eos> - So am I, and look. I am gonna stay here until we take out Gregor and we protect the Bratva.<eos> Ty skazal, "stay"? Were you going to leave?<eos> Look, Anatoly. I realized I have to get back to my life, but then I saw what Gregor did to you because of me.
Yeah? You and what army?<eos> This one!<eos> It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.<eos> Take them down.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching them take you down.
Look. Forget I asked.<eos> I'll bring you guys the visor, ok?<eos> Copy that.<eos> We're here.<eos> Curtis, this is on you now.
It means Kovar is planning something very big and very terrible.<eos> What is he gonna do?<eos> Oliver, maybe time is best for you to go back to America.<eos> Anatoly, we're brothers.<eos> What's happening to you is happening to me.
Confess your secret, Oliver, and all this ends.<eos> I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out that door and go back home.<eos> Adrian, you're sick.<eos> And you're a hypocrite.<eos> There is nothing that I've done that compares with you.
Chase had me--<eos> And he let me go.<eos> Go slow, man.<eos> It's over.<eos> Oliver, we're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
You don't kill because you have to.<eos> So why?<eos> I wanted to!<eos> And I liked it!<eos> We're gonna get this son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.
Where is she going?<eos> No place good.<eos> Well, the city council bought my story about your, spiritual retreat.<eos> And it turns out councilwoman Pollard is a big fan of all that stuff. You know, the woo-woo zen stuff.<eos> Look, I'm not asking what he did to you, all right?
I had to see you.<eos> I'm so sorry. This wasn't you, Oliver.<eos> It was him.<eos> Well, I... I created him.<eos> And I know that that might sound weird, but, this happened to you because of me.
So you got Anatoly to kill Chase so we wouldn't have to.<eos> I created Prometheus, John.<eos> I created this whole thing.<eos> Chase's death should be on my conscience, not yours.<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, man, to convince you to think that any of this is ok?
This isn't you, man.<eos> The Oliver I know would never let a group of dangerous criminals crawl into his city, let them steal medicine.<eos> You don't know what kind of man I am.<eos> What? !<eos> What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?
Bad guy on a yacht.<eos> - Dang. - Thank you for the assist.<eos> See?<eos> Help is good.<eos> I will contact you when I'm on site.
Well, it will give us some time to talk about something, like this crazy idea that you enjoy killing.<eos> That's why you disbanded the team, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oliver, you said that I don't know the kind of man that you are.<eos> I wouldn't have fallen in love with you or wanted to marry you if I didn't know exactly the kind of man that you are.
We just put out an APB on him with a shoot-to-kill order.<eos> This is going south fast.<eos> - Where's Captain?<eos> - He's in his office.<eos> Listen, has Nick contacted you?
I am so sorry.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> No, Mama.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I've been so hard on you.
Who disappears for half a year only to show up here.<eos> Come here, you gorgeous Englishman.<eos> It's good to see you, Aline.<eos> Sorry, excuse me.<eos> We were all so worried about you.
Demon blood... it changes a person.<eos> I should never have let him come to the Seelie Court with me.<eos> From what I gather, he wasn't really taking "no" for an answer.<eos> I gotta find him before anybody else does.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
I gotta find him before anybody else does.<eos> - I'm coming with you.<eos> - No. In his emotional state, I don't want you anywhere near him.<eos> He's the way he is because of me, Luke.<eos> Please. Let me go with you.
I want everyone carrying additional weaponry.<eos> Duncan, prepare Valentine's restraints.<eos> The rest of you secure the perimeter.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Sebastian, I have to be honest. I'm really worried about you.
That's why we need to find him before the police do.<eos> Then what?<eos> We're supposed to turn him over to the Clave.<eos> Can't we just keep this quiet?<eos> You know, like Alec did for you.
I mean, I... I didn't even tell my family I was dating Clary.<eos> And how would I explain this?<eos> Hey Mom, meet Maia, my werewolf friend who knows I turned a guy to dust and now she's kinda worried that I might hurt you,<eos> - okay, look.<eos> Just let me come with you.
They never did.<eos> Then who does?<eos> Oh, I bet you'd love to get your hands on your precious Soul Sword now.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> I'm gonna be sending it with you.
Great. Ah... I need a minute with your queen.<eos> Your Queen stands before you.<eos> You were a child, and now you're confusing.<eos> Different outfits for different occasions.<eos> You're wary of me, aren't you? Is it because of the little game I played with you and your friends in my Court?
And the shit that he gets for being born on earth.<eos> And if he'd been willing to talk, you'd be thrown in the brig right now.<eos> But he wasn't.<eos> Current appearances to the contrary, he is one of the toughest dusters I've served with.<eos> So this is about you.
What's the limit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe 15-20Gs?<eos> We could probably handle that if we're juiced to the gills, but eventually one of those little blood vessels in your brain's gonna go pop.<eos> The Roci will stay with you on auto-pilot, long as it takes.
Stop it.<eos> Stop.<eos> You never have to apologize to me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just know, I want to be there with you, and help you with that sad little garden.
You don't back off, we don't even have that.<eos> Alex.<eos> Power down.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's all on you now, Miller.
What do you want?<eos> I want to know where you and I stand.<eos> I would've thought that was pretty clear by now.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Now, I've been straight with you since the first time I approached you after the Donnager.
Take a shot.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Is this your messed up way of telling me you're sorry?<eos> Was it messed up?<eos> Jesus Christ. You don't even know why I'm mad at you, do you?
- I'm glad you like it.<eos> Do you like any of the rest of me?<eos> Oh, what I meant was in the card playing...<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> I was just flirting with you...
But, just so you know, I'm not gonna fall for that.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Chardonnay, please.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> That I was trying to fuck with you?
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I actually have to run.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I have to pick something up.<eos> Oh, well, I have a little time.<eos> I could come with you.
I think you should leave.<eos> Are you okay with that, Allison?<eos> Fucking joke, the both of you.<eos> You think she cares about you?<eos> I'm the only one who actually gives a shit about you.
It limits you.<eos> Having to be so strong for someone else.<eos> Everyone else.<eos> I don't know if it's the weed or... it's just in this moment...<eos> I feel like I can see myself. With you.
Sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> I, uh, wanted to apologize for yesterday.<eos> You were... right to say something.<eos> I haven't been honest with you.
I'm happy to see you.<eos> Believe me, I could use the escape right now.<eos> I love it, your place.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your niece looks exactly like you.
Said they've been trying to reach her.<eos> Oh, right, yeah.<eos> She didn't mention anything about a... a speech, go figure.<eos> You okay?<eos> I was a real dick to you after Texas. - And I'm not a dick.
Plus, if I'm wrong, which I'm not... I get rich.<eos> So I'm down with it, Dinesh.<eos> Jared, what do you think about this?<eos> I think this is crazy.<eos> I left my job at Hooli to... to come work with you, Richard.
Guests first.<eos> Oh, no, I couldn't.<eos> You don't have enough.<eos> My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.<eos> Strangers will be kind to you.
Well, this is the third night in a row.<eos> I know something else that's happened three nights in a row.<eos> It's a fire.<eos> Richmond Heights.<eos> Go, Wally's gonna beat you there.
Okay, I deserve that.<eos> No, um, I just came to check on you.<eos> We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.<eos> That's very sweet of you.<eos> I'm doing well, thank you. You know, what Savitar did... forcing you to hurt people...
Have you seen my times in the Speed Lab lately?<eos> - I'm almost as fast as you.<eos> - Okay, this isn't about speed.<eos> This is about gaining knowledge and experience, so please just trust me, all right?<eos> Look, I am as overprotective a father as you can get, but I gotta be honest, Barry, I'm... I agree with Wally.
I'm sure you have.<eos> This might just be a quicker process if I did it alone.<eos> What are you doing? The gradation is darker on the palm of his hand from the point of contact.<eos> I see, I see.<eos> You know, I used to think Barry was overreacting when he complained about sharing a lab with you.
I'm gonna go to CCPD, see if I can find anything that might lead us to Yorkin.<eos> Well, that went swimmingly. Joe's right.<eos> We should've told him before now.<eos> What you should have told him is that I'm the one responsible, that the meta trying to kill him is one that I created.<eos> Julian, you can't change what happened to you.
I'm going either way.<eos> Harry's my friend.<eos> I'm not gonna just abandon him.<eos> I'm going back to Earth-2.<eos> And I suppose you'll want somebody to come with you who's gonna open those breaches for you?
- Killer Frost. - Ah.<eos> She's the one I'm always afraid of becoming.<eos> And where is she now?<eos> Dead.<eos> That's not gonna happen to you, Caitlin.
I know it now.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> Do what?<eos> Stay positive in the face of overwhelming odds.<eos> Because I plan on living a long life with you, and nothing's gonna take that away from me.
I did make breakfast.<eos> We got pancakes and waffles, some French toast, bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.<eos> And I picked up some of that dark roast that you love so much.<eos> Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?<eos> Being with you makes me want to do things like this.
You sure you still don't want to look into the future and see what's changed?<eos> No. Think I'm done with that.<eos> - Good. - I'll see you at home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I'll walk out with you.
- I know you're mad, but...<eos> - No, Barry, that's not it.<eos> I just want you to listen. Okay?<eos> I need you to... let me say what I need to say.<eos> I'm not angry... at you.
Ground.<eos> Air...<eos> I can feel again.<eos> I can breathe again.<eos> I've beaten you, finally.
Yeah?<eos> Is this really you, or is this... just another Speed Force test?<eos> Yeah, kid, it's really me.<eos> How?<eos> As soon as the team lost contact with you,
Wait, where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right, well, I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs is working on getting us out of this.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad they brought me to your Earth.<eos> Mon-El seems like he really cares about you.
We gotta bring him in.<eos> No, not we... me.<eos> I'm the reason Barry got whammied.<eos> We win and we lose as a team.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Oh, probably should've made that out of carbyne.<eos> Rookie mistake.<eos> You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.<eos> You know, you probably should've spent a little more time finding a cure for what ails me.<eos> I care about you, Caitlin.
And I'm done with this.<eos> Thank you for not making a big deal about me wearing this.<eos> Cecile Horton... I love you.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> And I'm sorry that I was dishonest with you.
Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Who are you?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Imagine: me inspiring you, and you applying that inspiration, and us changing the world together.<eos> And drinking so much coffee!<eos> Tracy Brand.<eos> Will you do me the honor... of joining Team Flash?<eos> With you?
That's not my name.<eos> - Barry.<eos> - That's not my name!<eos> Please! Stop, okay?<eos> I will go with you, just please, do not kill them.
I know why you said yes.<eos> You want to spend your life with him, in spite of everything.<eos> I get it, but I can't watch you marry him.<eos> Can't watch him be happy.<eos> And it's really hard for me to say that I won't be there with you.
Damon.<eos> - Oh, God. - This is not my fault, Caroline.<eos> Impromptu weddings call for impromptu bachelor parties.<eos> Oh, please, don't be mad at me, Caroline.<eos> I'm not mad at you.
Katherine knows your girl's not gonna have a small, intimate gathering.<eos> Traditional opening waltz of the Founder's Ball.<eos> The exact same one you and Katherine danced to in 1864.<eos> She won't be able to resist. You girls will go in front of Mommy, and then Mommy will just walk herself down the aisle, and it will all be fine.<eos> Or I could walk with you.
Dorian and I were trying to find a way to destroy Cade's hell. We figured we needed a few million volts of mystical energy, just give or take.<eos> It kind of took the wind out of our sails.<eos> Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire?<eos> Bonnie, is everything okay?<eos> Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you.
See where I'm going with this?<eos> Well, look, man, the good news is... Because none of them cared enough about me to murder.<eos> Woman:<eos> Thanks for calling me in.<eos> I actually wanted to speak with you.
Chloe: Okay.<eos> Any sign of Burt? Dan:<eos> Not yet, but I'll stick around until someone approaches.<eos> What?<eos> I think I just figured out what's wrong with you.
I'd love one for Lux.<eos> I'm not sure where I'd put it...<eos> I want my package.<eos> Now.<eos> I should've known Jana left it with you after I saw her at Lux.
Her spleen?<eos> Her heart?<eos> 'Cause, believe me, there is no winning when you play by a twisted tyrant's rules.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
Don't mess with us<eos> - right now, man, it's my wife...<eos> - Ex-wife. My ex-wife's life is on the line.<eos> You... so you're trying to help your ex-wife?<eos> Something's wrong with you, buddy.
Who's in? This is a terrible idea.<eos> I absolutely forbid it.<eos> I hate to agree with Her Highness, but she's right.<eos> You'd be on your own.<eos> We both know I can't go down with you.
I forgot he was even doing music.<eos> You should have given me the heads-up, Lucious.<eos> Theoretically, we are co-CEO.<eos> Theoretically, you weren't talking to me.<eos> Well, I'm speaking to you now.
Maybe you could help me get her comfortable with Bella.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Girl, that's Mamie Smith, queen of the blues.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Hakeem is directing Tiana's next video that will be on her album that is released next week.<eos> You're all caught up.<eos> Look, Becky, I know that you wanted the job.<eos> But not too long ago, you were Lucious' assistant, and so you might not be exactly ready to run a department.<eos> But listen, I am so excited to work with you.
Do you hear this?<eos> - ♪ We bow down at his feet ♪ - Jamal.<eos> It's just music, man.<eos> ♪ Take back his throne... ♪ You just keep playing with me, man.<eos> No... it's like I don't know what to do with you anymore, man.
I mean, I can't remember the last time I was so nervous. But I've been hiding, y'all.<eos> I've been hiding my entire life.<eos> I'm about to lose somebody that I love because they can't be with me because they can't stand me not being true to myself.<eos> So, Jamal, yo, I'm out here in these streets, baby.<eos> I'm coming up to see you. - Philip.

What about my friend's night, Hakeem?<eos> You haven't even asked about Kennedy.<eos> Okay, I was about to ask you. Is she okay?<eos> She's in the hospital, and that's where I'm going right now.<eos> All right, we coming with you.
And I'm happy it's up-tempo.<eos> Can I dance a bit in it?<eos> Your ass just want to dance.<eos> Just get it, get it, get it.<eos> Our concept for the video is idealized young love with you and Delphine as Lucious and Cookie, showing us what that crazy, mad love looks like.
It's about... a lifetime, about the risks two people take when their lives and their destinies cross.<eos> It was always about the music.<eos> Lucious's music was the very air that I breathed.<eos> It was the blood pumping through my veins.<eos> And when music can do that to you, whew, that's when you know.
We all will. She's safe.<eos> No.<eos> You.<eos> Personally.<eos> I need Bella to live with you.
One step at a time, though.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> And speaking of steps... I am about to take a pretty big one.<eos> Um, and I don't... I don't want to put a foot wrong with your moms.<eos> So, I figured that I would come and-and speak with you first.
We're just kind of freaky together, you know?<eos> That should work out fine for you, 'cause you ain't nothing but a freak.<eos> Well, you're the one that taught me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> There's only been two women who could deal with you, Lucious, and that's been me and Anika.
It's not about Lucious at all.<eos> It's about me.<eos> And I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that.<eos> I still have feelings for him.<eos> You still have feelings for Lucious. I wanted to be honest with you. I don't want to hide that.
Look, I got to go.<eos> I'm sorry about Angelo.<eos> You seem upset, sweetie, what's wrong?<eos> Nah, I'm good.<eos> So I'm-a be honest with you, man, I'm a straight-up perfectionist, like you, and I love Tommy, but his vocals wasn't right for this track.
Yeah, but Inferno's gonna change all of that.<eos> I've already laid the groundwork with the Nevada Gaming Commission, Snoop, we're good.<eos> Look. You know, be 100 with a brother, man.<eos> What's up, dude?<eos> All right, let me keep it real with you, yo.
This is family.<eos> The lions have successfully safeguarded their pride.<eos> All right, you put your shoulders back, look him in the eye, and you'll be okay.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> All right, Jamal, I have nothing to say to you.
Yo, how many of y'all been shot before?<eos> But you haven't.<eos> Dad, nobody told you how to deal with your father getting shot, so don't tell me how to deal with taking a bullet for mine.<eos> And I'm sorry, but you play it hard and-and being hard-headed and doing it your way, that's why Bella was taken.<eos> Now, I want to work with you, but I ain't backing down.
Know that much.<eos> H-Hey, Ma. Do you think I'm a good father?<eos> You're not even a good person.<eos> True.<eos> Boy, what the hell is wrong with you?
That's just how he dresses, sweetie.<eos> No. I don't trust him.<eos> Thirst, you like that champagne?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take it with you.
You're not a Mormon, are you?<eos> No, brother.<eos> Yo, you gonna need all the family you got.<eos> Wait till you find out where I found Bella.<eos> What in the hell is wrong with you?
I would never leave you alone.<eos> Well, what about Anika, Ma?<eos> Don't worry about Anika.<eos> Anika got her own mama, she's got her own daddy to look after her.<eos> - Yeah. - You worry about you.
I would tell you to watch your back, but I think you already know what I'm capable of.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Right now, you capable of getting escorted out of the club that we took.<eos> Bye, bitch.<eos> You just gonna let her talk to you like that and threaten you?

Well, look, I'm-a fly back on the jet tonight.<eos> I want to get back so I can be ready with Bella.<eos> All right.<eos> Give her a hug for me. Kiss her for me.<eos> Wait for me 'cause I'm-a roll with you, a'ight?
He was begging for help and then he just stopped.<eos> I need to know if he's still alive.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Well...<eos> We'll come with you.
Castiel's right.<eos> It won't work.<eos> We have to try.<eos> He's right, and we're not askin'.<eos> The way you let those simians talk to you...
It's kinda what they do.<eos> Well, if she's a liar, she's pretty good at it.<eos> You, on the other hand, kind of suck.<eos> Who are you gonna believe?<eos> Your brother, or some filthy ape who's always talking down to you, always mocking you.
At 10:45, demon comes home.<eos> Sam and I will be waiting for him.<eos> I'll pop him with a devil's trap bullet.<eos> I'll finish him off with a demon blade.<eos> And I will wait at the back with you in case he comes in that way.
I suppose you think that's funny.<eos> I know that look.<eos> Sam and Dean have got you down.<eos> Well, I still can't believe that you're working for the Dukes of haphazard.<eos> Do you really think they care about you?
You sure?<eos> Okay, rain check.<eos> Hey, I love you.<eos> You're an excellent liar, Mary.<eos> I haven't told my sons I'm working with you.
It's just...<eos> It's so sad.<eos> Hope you like the taste of floor.<eos> There's a spot there needs scrubbing.<eos> And worse, you're not even gonna see it comin' when you get taken down.
You brought a swimsuit?<eos> No.<eos> I read through more of Mick's lore books. Really?<eos> Wow.<eos> Those three stars are wasted on you.
Let us know if you find anything.<eos> Of course.<eos> You ready, brother?<eos> He sound weird to you?<eos> Is that your computer talking to you again?
Then you should have!<eos> You should've shot her between the eyes immediately. Why?<eos> 'Cause that's what you would've done?<eos> Kind of like you killed that werewolf?<eos> 'Cause from what I remember, that really messed you up.
But, uh, you were too busy with, um...<eos> What was it?<eos> Nothing?<eos> Dean, I...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you, man?
He's not.<eos> My baby's not evil.<eos> He saved me. That's what you think happened?<eos> Uh, he saved himself.<eos> He doesn't care about you.
No, I'm not being terse.<eos> Look, if you haven't seen her, do you know where she is?<eos> No, I'm not being curt either.<eos> Look, I don't have time for manners 101 from you, okay?<eos> If she's with you, I wanna know about it.
That wasn't idle chat.<eos> Mom?<eos> Look at me.<eos> It's us. Please.<eos> What's wrong with you?
What?<eos> Thought you'd get your mum back?<eos> Sorry, Dean.<eos> Not how this ends.<eos> This ends with me ending you.
Of course it's on me, Beth!<eos> I wasn't there for him.<eos> I should've been there for him.<eos> You scare me, Mark.<eos> I don't know how to reach you anymore.
Every man who was at that party.<eos> Right.<eos> Pasta.<eos> Again.<eos> What's up with you?
I'm Chloe.<eos> Latimer.<eos> Is your dad in?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Good, 'cause it's you I wanna see. - Me?
Why would they be judging me?<eos> Well, no, that's what I'm saying.<eos> They're not judging you.<eos> You know, we're all here for you.<eos> Cath, I-I need to talk to you about something.
You're stupid but you think you're smart.<eos> That's a very dangerous place to live.<eos> I could set fire to your life whenever I choose.<eos> If I were you, I'd be shitting myself right now.<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to check in with you about Trish Winterman, see how you're doing.
- Right. - Right.<eos> You have one new message.<eos> Mark, it's me.<eos> Can you call me, please?<eos> I'm worried about you.
I feel like I'm sinking, Beth.<eos> It's not a straight road.<eos> Some days will be harder than others.<eos> You're strong, Trish.<eos> I'm so impressed with you.
You can't talk to me like that.<eos> I'm not your ISVA. You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me? With the man who did this to you.<eos> But, yeah, with you, a little bit.
Because I... I blew what we had.<eos> And my life since then has been so empty.<eos> There's this... chasm... where you used to be.<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Be with you.
You just got out of hospital.<eos> It's fuss over nothing.<eos> Not really.<eos> Didn't expect to see you awake. I couldn't sleep.<eos> I was worried about you down here.
200 spears.<eos> In return I shall require the head of Osbert.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Guthred showed clemency, but still betrayed me.<eos> You will become a slave, Uhtred, and Halig with you.
When you go to Eoferwic... will you kill my brother?<eos> Are you asking if I will, or are you telling me to do it?<eos> The first one.<eos> I have sworn to Alfred that Guthred will not be harmed.<eos> I want to go with you.
She's gathering my men... whatever is left of them.<eos> You will meet them where?<eos> Loidis.<eos> I'd ask you to come with me, but I hear you've been making more of your oaths.<eos> I will be with you.
What?<eos> Hey. Hey, come on, Red.<eos> You never give up.<eos> You're like that bunny that keeps on going and going 'cause Meth-Head Charlie fed him Adderall.<eos> And to be honest with you, I was kind of counting on you to-- to see a double rainbow or make friends with a carriage horse, and then I would snap out of my Artie funk and I would run to the airport, all romantic,
Oh, now you need my help.<eos> Anyway, where were we?<eos> Vincent!<eos> Look, you're... you're making my placement student uncomfortable.<eos> I have to talk to you now about something very important...
No, Eric, believe me... that is not what is happening at all.<eos> I'm sure, Eric.<eos> I've so fucked up.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I hardly see you in town anymore.
And I want to know who's leaking classified information.<eos> Emily, Aaron, you were both in Command Ops when MacLeish gave the order... Find the leak.<eos> I want them in my office by nightfall.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Seth, can I borrow you for a second?
But MacLeish's men decided that Lozano was going to have to pay for the buddies they lost,<eos> MacLeish jumps in, stops it, says that he was just following orders.<eos> So, MacLeish saved his life.<eos> If it weren't for MacLeish,<eos> We're worried about you, pal.
Dan Anderssen killed Vladek. That's not the Dan Anderssen we knew.<eos> That's some kind of monster.<eos> What Doctor Khatri thinks is, is that monster,<eos> it could be... could be the hope we're looking for.<eos> If I sit here with you honey, and I don't try this one last thing... And I lose you?
I got to find out if this is bullshit or if it's real.<eos> If it is real,<eos> - I have to make some moves before we... - I know.<eos> We prepared for this.<eos> But I'm not running with you.
And sometimes it seems like you want them to succeed.<eos> Maine state law requires sexual education.<eos> But local boards decide which topics.<eos> And the topics they don't want covered, do we imagine they just disappear if we ignore them?<eos> I may personally agree with you, but when you teach topics that aren't covered by the board, you're telling them about stuff that we've decided they're too young to know about.
Okay, Mia, tell me where it is.<eos> Tell me where it is!<eos> You goddamn junkie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Rob told me I can do whatever I want to you, as long as I make you talk.
Oh, like a little shelter puppy.<eos> Yeah, then we can watch cheesy eighties movies every night.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure Kevin and Eve would love that.<eos> Yeah, of course they would.<eos> Mom's always 30% less annoying when you're around.
Sweetie, I just...<eos> Please.<eos> You just don't want me to do what you did.<eos> But guess what.<eos> I won't, 'cause I'm nothing like you.
-Do you think I like living like this?<eos> Can't you see that I'm trying, Ava?<eos> I'm doing the best that I can.<eos> -It's not my fault you screwed up your own life and it doesn't mean you get to relive it through me.<eos> -It never ends with you, does it?
-Someone's up early.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, here, um... let me clean this up.<eos> Do you want any of this? -No, I... I'm good.<eos> -Oh, OK.<eos> -Hey, need to talk to you about last night.
I'm gonna find a way to get back!<eos> -Hey,Ava!<eos> -I don't have time for this.<eos> -You literally just told me you love me and now you're blowing me off?<eos> What's gong on with you?
Jake. Yeah, not "Mr. Jake," just Jake.<eos> Damn, not again.<eos> Alex!<eos> You said you weren't gonna set things off anymore.<eos> I said I wouldn't set things off while you were in the room.
I-i can't believe what you've been going through.<eos> How long has it been?<eos> You're here to help. Because all this is so stressful for me.<eos> Is that what Jimmy told you?<eos> He's worried about you, Chuck.
It's crazy.<eos> Reddington was...<eos> He's lucky to be alive, really.<eos> What about her?<eos> Did she ever go down for you?
I want to know who Lambert is, his connection to Bray, and how we get into his estate.<eos> I want it an hour ago.<eos> Thanks for the heads-up, sweetheart.<eos> Get to the safe house.<eos> I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I suppose he was still hoping for a miracle.<eos> But the lawyers are working to have our son declared legally dead so the company can be put in my trust.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Under a minute.<eos> Sorry to dump all this on you.
- She knows you hid things from her, and if she looks closely enough, she's gonna find out it's me.<eos> Let me worry about her. You worry about the op.<eos> What is all this?<eos> It doesn't... It doesn't matter, not now.<eos> Look, if I'm gonna work with you, I need to know that you have a clear head, that you're not...
I misjudged you.<eos> S-Somebody...<eos> Somebody told me that you weren't to be trusted.<eos> And because of that, I haven't really been... myself.<eos> I haven't really been honest with you.
What are you doing?<eos> His source claims the threat level has been raised in Manhattan.<eos> The official says the city is working to assess the credibility of the threat...<eos> You look like crap.<eos> Radicalism doesn't suit you.
You got a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> What is it, Bryan?<eos> I guess I'm... I'm...<eos> I'm a little worried about you.
Talk to you boyfriend.<eos> Bryan, help me.<eos> Asha...<eos> Help me, Bryan.<eos> I know that he's there with you.
- Home? - I'm not gonna sanction a suicide mission.<eos> You going down there on your own is not gonna save Asha Flynn, and it's not gonna be an end to Mejia.<eos> It's just going to be the loss of one good man for nothing.<eos> And no one here is going to standby and let that happen.<eos> Like it or not, you are too important to us all now and to what we do, and I'm not going to debate this with you.
We're two minutes out.<eos> Focus on me.<eos> Help is on the way. Just stay with us.<eos> Here comes a bird.<eos> I'm gonna be with you all the way, okay?
Mm, mm.<eos> No. No, no, no, no.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Bye.<eos> We've been trying to get a hold of you for the past 15 minutes.
What?<eos> Excuse me, this is a closed rehearsal.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> Josie, right?<eos> I was hoping I could talk to you about some songs that I wrote?
Multiple secrets, actually.<eos> And maybe we could've done something to help Jason that morning, or maybe we couldn't have.<eos> And I won't tell anyone anything, but you need to help me.<eos> This summer, the only thing that kept me sane was writing these songs.<eos> So here's my not-so-indecent proposal. I want to do an independent study with you, as many mornings a week as you can spare, and I swear that's all it'll be.
Between us, she's a lot more high-strung than she looks.<eos> You shady bitch.<eos> Betty's cell is off.<eos> - I'm getting an Uber.<eos> - Can I come with you?
You're as handsome as your father was.<eos> I'll see you at home, Mom.<eos> Uh, wait.<eos> I'm sure Archie would happily escort you.<eos> Is, uh, Betty still mad at you?
Stab in the dark.<eos> I'm guessing she cares more about herself.<eos> She's the one who's telling you not to say anything, right?<eos> Look, I saw you guys.<eos> She's messing with you, man.
Maybe this is one of those times.<eos> And Sheriff Keller's grilling me, Mantle the Magnificent.<eos> 'Cause I'd want Blossom dead.<eos> When he was, like, the only good quarterback we had.<eos> And speaking of offensive tight-ends, I should've sent the cops to you, Moose.
Daddy! Seriously?<eos> - Polly? - Dad...<eos> Stop filming me!<eos> Say hi to the camera, Polly.<eos> I can't practice with you watching!
Castillo says you are bad, and now you think you're bad?<eos> I just... I want to get this right.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> You want me to wallow with you?
Be the Jay to my Bey?<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> Look, Val. You don't sing on the bridge.<eos> Actually, the bridge is meant to be sung by two voices.<eos> What is up with you today, J?
Hold up, hold up.<eos> Look, Val. You don't sing on the bridge.<eos> Actually, the bridge is meant to be sung by two voices.<eos> What is up with you today, J?<eos> What is up with you today, Mel?
♪ We're animals breaking' out of our cage ♪<eos> ♪ There's nobody, no one, no way ♪<eos> ♪ Who gets me like you do ♪<eos> Are you gonna do that on the day?<eos> Because if I'm gonna be up there with you, - we need to be on the same page.
♪ Who gets me like you do ♪<eos> Are you gonna do that on the day?<eos> Because if I'm gonna be up there with you, - we need to be on the same page.<eos> - Yeah, and we will be, Val.<eos> What's goin' on with you?
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no.<eos> However you're rationalizing what you're doing with Archie's dad, I don't want any part of it.<eos> It's so perfect when you play it.<eos> We wrote a good song, Archie.<eos> I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
Maybe that's for the best.<eos> If you don't mind, Fred.<eos> Whatever you want, FP.<eos> It's between the two of you.<eos> I'll go with you, Dad.
Screw em, then.<eos> Anyone who'd rather work for Clifford Blossom than you is crazy, Dad.<eos> Dad?<eos> What is it?<eos> You always make me talk to you about my problems.
Do you think that you can just waltz in here, with a bedbug-infested Trojan Horse, wave a blank check around and steal my daughter?<eos> I didn't think you wanted her, else why would she have been exiled like some pariah?<eos> To keep her away from your family.<eos> And not because you're ashamed?<eos> Why is your own daughter not living with you?
See you tomorrow.<eos> I'd give that back if I were you.<eos> Dad, come on. The Blossoms, they're helping me get into that summer music program.<eos> Like, the best in the country.<eos> And since when did the Blossoms ever give a damn about you, Archie?
Oh. "Clifford", please.<eos> And just so you know, you don't have to keep doing me favors.<eos> I like Cheryl.<eos> And I'm happy to be here for her, as a friend.<eos> You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
Polly, can we talk about what's going on here?<eos> Just keep dancing.<eos> And smiling.<eos> Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.<eos> As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.
Archie!<eos> I thought it was Cinderella that ran away from the ball, not Prince Charming.<eos> Cheryl, I can't do this right now.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Archie Andrews, if you leave, the radiant sun that is the Blossom family stops shining on you.
We're past that point, Archie.<eos> I spoke to Mom last week, she didn't mention any of this, Dad.<eos> Your mom moved out two years ago.<eos> She didn't tell you because she wanted me to be the bearer of bad news.<eos> What if I came with you?
It's just I would be happier if it was just the four of us in a booth at Pop's.<eos> Yeah. But we always do that.<eos> I wanted to do something special.<eos> "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."<eos> Why is everything so doom and gloom with you, Jug?
My mom likes almond milk in her coffee, and we don't have any, so...<eos> I'm gonna go get some.<eos> Well, you are a terrible liar, Archie.<eos> Off to a late-night rendezvous with a certain raven-haired princess?<eos> Relax, man, I'm just giving you a hard time.
Tonight, I have two.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm having major deja vu.<eos> Remember when this was our lives?<eos> The best of times...<eos> Betty, tonight after the dance, I'd like to talk to you about something.
- What does Betty think?<eos> She thinks it's weird.<eos> Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...<eos> I need to see this through to the end.<eos> We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
What did he say?<eos> It was basically just a warning. Said to lay low.<eos> No one uses their one call to say "lay low."<eos> Joaquin, do you know something?<eos> I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend, I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
He allegedly committed suicide by overdose, and there was a bag of money on-site that links him to Hiram Lodge.<eos> Everything is tied up into a nice little bow.<eos> Too tidy, if you ask me.<eos> Kevin?<eos> We'll meet you there.
I'll do my best.<eos> Not a doubt in my mind.<eos> Go on.<eos> ♪ My love, my heart ♪<eos> ♪ I wanna share it with you ♪

They're moving Julie and Mary, let's go.<eos> Okay, I can make out ten guards, but I don't see your family.<eos> Copy.<eos> We need to take one of them alive,<eos> - find out where they are. - With you.
- Where are you?<eos> Can you see us?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, where are you?<eos> I'm right there with you, Julie.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for doing that, bro.<eos> Any time, my bro, any time.<eos> I'll talk to you.
Come to the meet and watch a real sniper work.<eos> You'll see the difference.<eos> There you go.<eos> I got your bag.<eos> I'll see you in a second.
All of it.<eos> It's all yours.<eos> I'm sorry I dropped the pan.<eos> You don't need to be sorry.<eos> I'm sorry that I got mad at you and yelled.
About half of them.<eos> Why?<eos> Because their loved ones are gonna be expecting an update soon.<eos> Yeah, we should get ahead of this, reach out to their families.<eos> Monty, we need to control what gets out, so it's best they come to you. That's a lot of people.
I guess.<eos> I feel like I've been here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you go with me?<eos> With you?
Wait, Moreno?<eos> South Side Tracy...<eos> That Moreno?<eos> And you turned him down.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you, kid?
- I want to see you.<eos> - Show yourself.<eos> Harold, make yourself known.<eos> Rachel's here.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
Precautions in place.<eos> Bobo Winthrop, I love you.<eos> Well, I'm here with my beautiful girlfriend and I was hoping that you would do me the honor of becoming my wife.<eos> Aubrey, marry me.<eos> - Yes, I'll marry you!
I stopped by your house, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, lot of flies, bugs.<eos> I'll talk to Bobo if I decide to stay.<eos> Well, I just wanted to apologize for before.<eos> My dad's weird and I didn't want to get into a thing with him, so if I was cold to you, that's why.
Well, this is a new low for you, for us.<eos> I told myself that this was true, that this was you.<eos> You can't be the one person who destroys every relationship I ever have, can you?<eos> Mellie... Why are you doing this?<eos> ! What is wrong with you?
Instead of leading me to believe that this was something that you wanted, like I'm some idiot.<eos> Mellie, you should be proud.<eos> Oh. Is that what you tell them?<eos> "Them"?<eos> What's going on with you?
It's been over a year now, okay?<eos> I get it.<eos> You're perfect.<eos> You never made a mistake before.<eos> Dated you.
Reasons to kick out the poor kids?<eos> It's not about that.<eos> Hey.<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, it's like the other day where it was weird and awkward, and I yelled at you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I, uh, saw on your schedule that you have practice after school, so I was just hoping to catch you.<eos> You know my schedule?<eos> Well, I wanted to speak to you about Jason and Alice...
- Bye, guys.<eos> - Bye. See you.<eos> So... is your boyfriend coming to pick you up?<eos> No, that's over.<eos> I'm really sorry I let him talk to you like that.
He's putting the money together, but I'm starting to get the idea that this isn't just about the money.<eos> In my profession, there's nothing more frustrating than a shy client...<eos> Too embarrassed to tell you what he really wants.<eos> I always tell my girls, the key is to make him feel safe.<eos> Sounds like her father's got to level with you if he wants his daughter back, so you need to find a way to make him feel safe.
$5 million.<eos> What about the perpetrators?<eos> Filed descriptions, but, if I'm being honest, in all likelihood, they're long gone by now.<eos> Anyway, if you'll excuse me...<eos> Meet you at RHD.
Not a word.<eos> So it all worked out like I said it would.<eos> I don't intend on going down with you, Frank.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I don't intend on going down with you, either.
How about I put a silver bullet up your ass, homey?<eos> Straight up, dawg.<eos> All you kids, man, get the hell up out of here.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Pleasure doing business with you.
Must be four, maybe five guys inside.<eos> It's Quanstrom, for sure.<eos> Hey, trainee.<eos> Kyle!<eos> What's with you?
Be that as it may, Frost insists on having an audience with this young man.<eos> Frost believes he will help bring Hollow Sky into a new stratosphere.<eos> Your services are required.<eos> This young man can trust you.<eos> He can relate to you.
Careful.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> That thing I did outside, with the wolf and the... and the... if this isn't a dream, how was that even possible?<eos> The reason you were able to do what you did... it's because of this place.<eos> I think it agrees with you.
Simple, straightforward, no-drama relationships.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> For a change.<eos> I'm messing with you.
I was sent here.<eos> To find you.<eos> You what?<eos> By a guy named Isaac Frost.<eos> He's the leader of this group called Hollow Sky and he wants to meet with you.
I need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Where?<eos> We'll come to you.
These days finding information on people is a piece of cake.<eos> Everyone is connected.<eos> Do you... do you really think the universe shows you where to go?<eos> The universe has a way of course correcting.<eos> It talks to you.
It's, like, cool now to be gay.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She wants a piece of that sweet bullying and persecution because being a teenager's not hard enough.<eos> You know what? I'm not joking.<eos> And I'm not here to fight with you.
I've got a transit pass.<eos> Then show me.<eos> You know, what's to stop me from just killing you and keeping the pass?<eos> Because it'd be bad for business.<eos> People come to you knowing that you'll make a fair trade.
In the alley, near 28th.<eos> In the alley near 28th.<eos> Hey.<eos> A little word to the wise... the street changes a kid.<eos> So don't blame him if he doesn't want to go with you.
Katie.<eos> Is this an ambush?<eos> If it was an ambush, I'd be wearing a mask.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I... I wanted to talk to you about Bram.
I... I wanted to talk to you about Bram.<eos> I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about his situation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wondered if there was anything else that you can do for him.<eos> - Maddie didn't talk to you?
Thank you.<eos> I just wondered if there was anything else that you can do for him.<eos> - Maddie didn't talk to you?<eos> - She did.<eos> I just... I thought maybe if I spoke with you directly...
Lots of it.<eos> Please lower your voice.<eos> Will basically admitted it, you know, before he went through the Wall or whatever the hell he did.<eos> Drink that.<eos> What is it with you and Will and the whiskey?
I believe the authorities look unfavourably on child labour.<eos> Oh, didn't I say?<eos> I'm a slow healer.<eos> I've been thinking -- if the baby's another girl, I might move out.<eos> I might come with you.
But losing someone?<eos> Nope.<eos> Not good at that at all.<eos> We only fail when we do not try.<eos> Now, are you sure you don't want me to wait with you?
Wait.<eos> He can't go without an 'ankle.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> Take this from your mother, Andrew.<eos> And may God's love go with you always.
The world is clamoring to know what the hell is going on, and we can't tell them.<eos> We can't tell them that the President of the United States has allowed his ex-mistress to brainwash him into thinking his former Chief of Staff is a murderer...<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> You are being played.<eos> This election is all about you.
So how's everything?<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, fine, I won't... ask about your mom.<eos> How's 1R? Did you start yet? How's 1R?<eos> Did you start yet? I don't really wanna talk about that with you either.
And I thought you were too good for us, being one with The Light and all that.<eos> You know what? It's fine.<eos> I don't need to. I don't need to.<eos> And I'm not too good for anyone.<eos> Dude, I'm fucking with you.
Okay.<eos> There's a break room just down the hall.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Radovan, I'm coming to you.
We're not...<eos> We're gonna consider it. - We're not taking it yet.<eos> Sometimes, we don't think we're gonna like something, but then you try it, and then suddenly you realize that you're having fun.<eos> Think about your trampoline. I mean, your father and I fought about getting that for years.<eos> And then, all of a sudden, what happened? Next thing you knew, the two of us were doing backflips out there with you.
Yeah, it has been awhile, that's why I'm calling.<eos> Be good to catch up. Uh...<eos> How about you and me go and grab some beers, now?<eos> Yeah, now, now.<eos> I can come to you.
Hey, Ben, good to see you, man.<eos> Let me just find a place to park.<eos> I think I see a space right over here.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right, I'll be with you, just one minute.
Gladys Perkins has an idea.<eos> I think she must've gone mad.<eos> She... she...<eos> Hello.<eos> - She wants to live with you. - Hey.
Come on, what have you got to be sorry about?<eos> Oh, 'cause, it's taken us so long to get to this point, and...<eos> I don't know, it should've happened sooner?<eos> But... we're here now.<eos> I wanted to celebrate with you.
I should, should I?<eos> What if I don't like duck?<eos> Oh, it's always good, is it?<eos> - I don't know. - Psst.<eos> I'm thinking about bringing this duck home and sharing it with you.
No minders.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... nothing's wrong.<eos> Or they're calling him back, and they're going to arrest him when he lands.<eos> They'd have to put a hell of a lot of pieces together to tie William Crandall to Oleg talking to you, especially this fast.
And the climate.<eos> The climate.<eos> You're free to go, ser.<eos> This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.<eos> Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.
It's been a while since I trained.<eos> I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.<eos> He didn't beat the Hound.<eos> You did.<eos> I want to train with you.
Don't be so sure.<eos> Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.<eos> Bad things are coming.<eos> You came to get me.<eos> You want me to come with you.
Nobody glowers quite like you.<eos> Not even Grey Worm.<eos> This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?<eos> It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.<eos> Take it with you.
It's fate.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> I'm redoing the wedding.<eos> This time with you.
2:00 pm, can't be late.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> - Can I interrupt?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> What happened with you and Henry?
Hello there.<eos> I see you're not quite feeling yourself.<eos> But we are gonna get that all fixed up.<eos> Now come on, son.<eos> I know you got folks out there worried about you.
It's pretty.<eos> Why didn't we ever come?<eos> Well, it wasn't really a happy place for me and Aunt Megan.<eos> I gotta go see someone.<eos> I wanna go with you.
You hear that?<eos> The odds are stacked, and we've got the winning hand.<eos> The only question is, which life do you value most?<eos> Hers?<eos> Or that cockroach you got down there with you?
Hey.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If I had known the facts, I never would have let it get this far.<eos> Cyrus, Tom Larsen recanted.<eos> He said you had nothing to do with him killing Frankie, and the only reason he ever said that you were involved is because he was angry and wanted to hurt you.
I do.<eos> But I cannot accept curiosity as a mark against my character.<eos> And isn't imagination the sign of an active intellect?<eos> I know too much independence is not becoming of a lady, but it just...<eos> - There is nothing wrong with you, Isabel.
In fact, I think it'd be best if you came home.<eos> - No. I have to stay until I'm healed.<eos> - Of what? !<eos> What sort of nonsense are they feeding you?<eos> - I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that you're afraid of what you don't understand, but I will not be leaving with you.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> - "The gardens at midnight... beneath the gnome."<eos> - Isabel.<eos> - Ah! Foul demon, leave me be!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- You keep calling me Isabel.<eos> I am Mary.<eos> But I remember you.<eos> Margaret!<eos> - Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?
- Did I hurt you?<eos> Margaret!<eos> No!<eos> How can it be?<eos> Why would you help me if I did this to you?
Come play our little game tonight.<eos> You will be rewarded later.<eos> - This is not the trial!<eos> - Now it is time for you to play your part.<eos> I can't wait to do this to you when we're alone tonight.
- No way.<eos> - Sophia...<eos> No, Dad. I'm not moving back home.<eos> God.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Charlie?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was thinking... there must be a lot of places you wanna see.<eos> What if we didn't go back to Fort Reed?<eos> I'm having an amazing... time with you, Charlie.
At the house late the other night, Mom.<eos> Seems pretty... dedicated.<eos> I was up waiting for you and I was upset about how we parted ways.<eos> Pastor Ian's been counseling us since the accident and last night, he offered to keep me company.<eos> He was worried about you, Holden.
Then I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I woke up and ruined your life.<eos> You're back less than a week and Mom's already got you doing chores?<eos> No wonder you're the favorite.<eos> Maybe it has something to do with you sneaking out after Mom and Dad are asleep.
Because as soon as I sell this car I'm using that money to buy a ticket.<eos> I'm serious this time.<eos> You're not gonna talk me out of it, okay?<eos> You're...? You're still coming with me, right?<eos> Yeah, I'm coming with you, okay?
- Come on. I'll even get us real tickets.<eos> - You pack before the concert, and we leave first thing tomorrow morning. You got it?<eos> - My word is my bond.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You. Danny wants to see you.
- I gotta bounce, so, hurry the fuck up.<eos> Make sure he pays for the tickets.<eos> I gotta drop this off real quick.<eos> Hey, yo. Make sure he pays for the tickets.<eos> I'm talking to you.
All of their food is sourced from local farmers.<eos> Brooke, could you be a princess and go tell Chester to come in here and see me, please?<eos> Organix.<eos> They're not just a name, they stand by it.<eos> - Danny wants to see you.
- That hurt.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look, we've been together six years.<eos> I'm just trying to get you to be honest with yourself.<eos> I'm honest with you every single day.
Sometimes I like women.<eos> Sometimes I feel like a woman who likes women, coz.<eos> Just give me the fucking baggies, get the fuck out of here.<eos> I'm fucking tired of these labels.<eos> I'm just trying to be honest with you, man.
What the fuck?<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Danny.<eos> - What's up, girl?<eos> there's some people here to see you.
- Danny.<eos> - What's up, girl?<eos> there's some people here to see you.<eos> It's 8:00 in the morning.<eos> I don't know, but they asked for you.
The more worship facilities we build, the stronger our influence will grow.<eos> - I love it. - Yeah?<eos> I love it!<eos> And it's only the beginning of what we're gonna accomplish together.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
It's like we talked about last night.<eos> You're gonna get to go up to the green zone with your auntie maddie and with your cousin.<eos> Grab your bag.<eos> Mom, I don't want to go to the green zone.<eos> I want to stay here with you.
Think about that before we talk again.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Stockpiling food.<eos> We got to get him to open up, Will.<eos> He'll talk to you.
Our Humvees had a weak spot, and the IED must have hit it just right.<eos> First thing I saw was one of my best friends.<eos> When I got home, I never said anything about it to anyone, not even your mom.<eos> I just carried it around inside me, and I can still feel it sitting there.<eos> That's why we need to talk about what happened to you in Santa Monica, 'cause I don't want you to carry it around like I did.
Him?<eos> Now I'm in charge.<eos> That's the attention I was looking for.<eos> You can be impressed.<eos> I'm impressed by you.
I knew that the day I met you.<eos> You got married.<eos> To the wrong woman.<eos> If...<eos> I was going to break the rule, I should have broken it with you.
You ever have to kill anyone? Could you at least tell me that?<eos> I don't want to talk to you!<eos> Look, just... Here.<eos> I-I just don't understand how you can tell everything to Olivia but nothing to me.<eos> Oh... I mean, what is it exactly with you and this sister that you never had?
Your phone, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jake!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> What is wrong with you? !
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> You should come over, celebrate.<eos> Yeah, I have news, too.<eos> Olivia agreed to talk to you.
Quinn, call it off.<eos> Stand down!<eos> Hi.<eos> Get him away from me.<eos> We need to talk to you.
Your phone...<eos> Answer it.<eos> Yeah. Patch me through to Webster.<eos> Call list is a mile long and growing.<eos> You want me to go over it with you now or...
Vargas' body is at St. Anne's Hospital.<eos> We're gonna need you to go there and lock it down...<eos> Secret Service, medical staff, local authorities.<eos> The only way to stay out of jail tonight is if they're taking their orders from you.<eos> No. An associate of ours will meet you there.
I do not have to forgive her.<eos> You forgave me.<eos> That was different.<eos> I forgave you.<eos> You know what happens to you when you're in that Oval.
If anyone can pull her back, if anyone can save her, it's the one person who got out.<eos> It's Olivia Pope.<eos> God, how could you be so stupid?<eos> How can you look out for everyone around you and not see danger looking you right in the face?<eos> I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?
At least until Alberto grows up!<eos> Thank you!<eos> 'Bye!<eos> Vanesa, are you crying?<eos> Alexis, I wanted to talk to you. We're all set.
- Yes?<eos> My clothes are in that bag.<eos> She told me yesterday to get out and never come back.<eos> I've spent two days walking the streets, with no money and nowhere to go.<eos> I was thinking of staying here, with you...
Aren't you gonna kick me?<eos> No, now we're gonna give it to you.<eos> Vanesa hasn't come to work today.<eos> She says she can't come in because she's sick.<eos> She also says she wants to talk to you.
I just don't know how they feel about the sound of gentle lovemaking.<eos> Or raunchy lovemaking.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just sounds in general.<eos> Why did I come here to see you?
Open it!<eos> New arrivals just left, they must have locked it on their way out.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's time.<eos> He wants to see you.
- Is she in there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Go get your woman back.<eos> I'll come with you, man.
Assist Lillian and Lena Luthor.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> When you go to meet her, I'm coming, too.<eos> You can't fight for me.<eos> But I can be with you.
I think it goes far beyond "the right thing".<eos> I couldn't have done it, Kara.<eos> You don't have to try to make me feel better.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm humbled by you.
- Our tax-exempt status was denied.<eos> The money situation is critical.<eos> Fix it with the IRS. Get our exemption.<eos> Get me the money to do what I need to do to live with everything that you've done.<eos> - Lisa, I wanted to talk to you about the exemption.
I mean, I did it. - I promise you, I did not have anyone follow you, Eddie.<eos> How long are they keeping you here?<eos> - Till they think I'm fit to leave, I guess.<eos> - What are they doing for you? - Just tests, meds, I don't know yet.<eos> - They don't know what's wrong with you.
- Why? - Why would you do that?<eos> - Sarah, Sarah. He showed up here ranting and raving.<eos> He threatened to kill me.<eos> I don't know, he seemed out of control.<eos> And, frankly, I was worried about you.
The Ambien. Please.<eos> - Honestly, I don't want to take any of them.<eos> - Why? Because the Meyerists and Sarah don't think that you should?<eos> - No, it's just, I've lived all these years without needing them, and I don't think I need them now.<eos> - Eddie... I care about you, okay?
I need it.<eos> The more it burns, the less time we have.<eos> If it hurts, then...<eos> Not everything that hurts is bad.<eos> I hate that all of this is on you.
Our friends with the red hands seem to think differently.<eos> Catchy PR campaign they got going.<eos> Any luck making contact with 'em?<eos> They're a closed loop.<eos> As far as I can tell, they want to talk, they come to you.
I'm gonna get ahead of this.<eos> And a messenger, uh, dropped off clothes for you.<eos> Katie, what are you doing here?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Well, can I just speak with you for a couple seconds in private?
I know.<eos> Even if we dropped him at the Green Zone gates, best case scenario... they'll just get him healthy enough to torture.<eos> Then he gives up you and everybody else.<eos> There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
Get me Alan Snyder.<eos> Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> She wants to meet you at a neutral site.
Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> She wants to meet you at a neutral site.<eos> Why didn't she come here with you?
Since childhood, you just think of what you want.<eos> We did whatever you wished.<eos> What about me?<eos> Have you ever asked what I want?<eos> I don't want to go with you
Dead or alive.<eos> You must stay with me.<eos> It's a must.<eos> Peng Hong...<eos> You go to hell lam not leaving with you.
Hold tight.<eos> Let go.<eos> You're fine.<eos> Be brave I'll get you out of this.<eos> When they are ready I will go with you.
Fragments started falling down.<eos> They hit our dome.<eos> Luckily, the safety blisters held, it was the only reason that we were able to get out.<eos> What happened to Mei?<eos> You were really badly hurt, the doctors had to induce a coma, and I stayed with you.
We're traveling together.<eos> Inners only.<eos> -I guess I could stay.<eos> -Prax: No, no, it's okay.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.
You're gonna throw that in my face?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Amos!<eos> Amos!<eos> Amos: I don't want to fight you, Alex.
Xie-xie.<eos> That'll do it.<eos> You know, you're just like I was, Martin.<eos> But you ain't so old, you can still change your path.<eos> I'm nothing like you.
- I was quite happy where I was.<eos> - Dr Powell's orders.<eos> - There you go, Mr Bright.<eos> He'll be by later to discuss your X-rays.<eos> Did they talk to you?
- Well, good luck. - Wait.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I've never ditched before.<eos> Hang on. I'll come with you.
- Please, eat it.<eos> Eat the foot!<eos> Eat the foot!<eos> Eat the goddamn foot!<eos> I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Burkhardt's a dead man.<eos> Whatever happens to Nick is gonna happen to you.
It's Renard.<eos> Hey, captain.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Put him on the phone.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.<eos> My son.<eos> Can you get Adalind and the kids, bring them back here?<eos> - I should go with you.
She has amazing abilities, ones I don't understand, and I don't know where they came from.<eos> And Sean doesn't know either.<eos> We have to protect her.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so happy to be back here with you.
See what happens when I don't do what I must.<eos> Kenneth Slater?<eos> He's one of the victims that was kidnapped on the case I was looking into.<eos> But he was returned alive.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
Diana knew you were down there.<eos> She knew you were drawing.<eos> She was drawing the same thing.<eos> A lot of them are the same.<eos> I think it's time I told you I'm sorry for what I did to you.
- He alone?<eos> - No, no.<eos> He's here with a bunch of friends for a birthday.<eos> Gonna be here two nights.<eos> I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to you.
Yeah, sure. I think so.<eos> Maybe one too many last night?<eos> Yeah, that's probably it.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> I can go with you.
Maybe one too many last night?<eos> Yeah, that's probably it.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> I can go with you.<eos> Or I can just bring you one. No, go ahead. I'll meet you on the patio.
Eve, there's something I've never told you.<eos> I admire you so much for everything you've been through.<eos> For losing Nick.<eos> For losing yourself.<eos> Are you all right?
- Rosalee.<eos> - Nick!<eos> - Eve.<eos> - Monroe!<eos> Monroe! What is wrong with you?
I got to head home.<eos> Yeah, I'm getting a little worn around the edges myself.<eos> - Coming?<eos> - I can't. Why?<eos> It's not great, me staying with you and adalind.
- Because it saw you?<eos> - That's what Eve thinks.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> I think it knows I'm a Grimm, but this skull thing is connected to Eve in some way.<eos> Maybe because she's a Hexenbiest, which is why I'm worried about you.
She's a Hexenbiest.<eos> I suspected this.<eos> Are you together?<eos> No, it was complicated.<eos> Sean, everything with you is always complicated.
Coincidence?<eos> I think not.<eos> The old man was within one block of both crime scenes.<eos> Hope we can ID this guy.<eos> Hey, Nick, I need to see you in my office.
Wait, Nick.<eos> I don't think this is such a good idea.<eos> We don't even know what kind of power this thing has or where it came from or what effect it's gonna have on you or us.<eos> It's the only option we've got, and we don't even know if it's gonna work.<eos> If it does, I'm going with you. - No.
He's coming!<eos> Hey, the bathroom's for customers only, so...<eos> I don't want any trouble, so just... aah!<eos> He's here.<eos> Honey, we're not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?
The other Grimms fighting with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can bring them all back to life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If it worked for you, it can work for them.
I need this one, Frank.<eos> And I want mi angel de la guarda there watching my back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, boy!<eos> With you and Billy 2.0 over here on the case, it's gonna be like old times, man.
If you want to take a minute, now is the time.<eos> Hold on a sec, sweetie.<eos> I was... No. No.<eos> I was gonna get both of you out of town.<eos> We belong here... with you.
We belong here... with you.<eos> I'm sorry... for all of it.<eos> I'm not.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She looks just like you.
Okay, I'll cross-reference Sliger's alias with motels, flophouses, snitches.<eos> It might take some time, but if he's using it, I'll ferret him out.<eos> Fire off a flare when you do.<eos> We'll be at my place fixing the roof. Right, Kyle?<eos> Sure, I'll meet you there.
Just gonna leave me with a hole in my house?<eos> He's getting a little too cocky. I know.<eos> I like that.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Good chance these two are done for now.<eos> 10th floor sees it different.<eos> Brass is worried these suspects are escalating their violence.<eos> You mean they're worried they're doing it in Hancock Park?<eos> What's up with you?
We're dropping our weapons.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Keys.<eos> Out.<eos> I ain't goin' anywhere with you.
Okay, so, we've officially got both the ATF and The Black 23's coming to kill us, and we've got maybe a five-minute head start before word gets back to Lynch that we sprung you.<eos> So whatever the hell is going on here, you better spill it now.<eos> Wanna hear a funny story?<eos> Paid a visit to the archives.<eos> Turns out the Waterstreet case had nothing to do with you.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were just a kid.<eos> You were scared.<eos> I-I shouldn't have stayed mad at you.
You're using him, frank.<eos> Kyle's just too good of a man to realize it.<eos> Understand something, alyse.<eos> Billy was my partner.<eos> So I'm not gonna apologize to you or anyone else for trying to solve his murder.
The only one who can't see it is you.<eos> I still don't get why you came to frank about this.<eos> Why didn't you just come to me?<eos> I'm not gonna have this conversation over the phone.<eos> I'll talk to you about it when you get home.
Thank you.<eos> Figured you might want this back.<eos> Can I pour you a drink? Sure.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, just I need to talk to you about something.
-Let her tell me that.<eos> If you shout, I swear I'll kill you.<eos> Calm down, I'm begging you.<eos> [Pedro] I will when you tell your friend you're coming with me.<eos> -She's not going with you.
We're not a rich family, and you haven't got a husband to support you.<eos> I won't let you stay here for the rest of your life looking after an old lady.<eos> You gave up enough for your mother.<eos> God rest her soul.<eos> Sure, Grandma... but I was happy with you and my mother.
-Good.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> -See you tomorrow.<eos> Ángeles!<eos> Wait, I'll go with you.
[Carmen] It's not as if we're royalty.<eos> Since when do you mind being the center of attention?<eos> Who said I minded?<eos> Will anything ever be good enough for you?<eos> I thought marrying you was good enough.
If you love him, why think of me?<eos> You know Carlos didn't deserve to be left nothing.<eos> I agree with you on that.<eos> That's not what hurts me.<eos> I know you love the company as much as he does... but with you in charge, people won't be laid off... and that preposterous agreement with the Uribes will be invalid.
-Yes.<eos> You want to send me to Barcelona?<eos> If you want to be rid of me, just say so!<eos> -Or maybe you don't love me!<eos> -Marga, no, I'm going with you.
Come on, I need to talk to you.<eos> Call me back.<eos> Mom is fucking freaking out.<eos> I can't deal with it.<eos> I can meet you wherever you are.
Without help, you're not gonna be able to get back up.<eos> I've had my name first for too long.<eos> I can't go back to having it last.<eos> Tara Messer, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.
I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.<eos> If I'm not in your league, why is she loyal to us instead of you?<eos> - Watch yourself, Harvey.<eos> - Robert...<eos> I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.
And whether you believe it or not, I loved your father. And I am sad to see him go.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't believe it, and I didn't come here to see you.<eos> I came here to honor my father, so get up there, say what you're gonna say, and let's get this over with.<eos> Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This is wonderful. I thought maybe you wanted to get dinner tonight.<eos> There is nothing I would rather do than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.
- Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.<eos> If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen. Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.
If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen. Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.<eos> I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you.<eos> She got to you, didn't she?
- You son of a bitch.<eos> You think you can just walk into our lives and... and rip open old wounds? Your lives?<eos> You better get the hell out of my face before I do something that you'll regret.<eos> You already did something I regret by talking to your mother the way you did.<eos> That woman gave up the right to be called my mother when she got together with you behind my father's back.
Well, maybe you don't consider her to be your mother, but she's my wife, and if anyone else spoke to her the way you did, they'd be on the floor right now.<eos> You want to take a swing at me? - Harvey, Harvey... - No, no, no.<eos> Let him get it out of his system, 'cause I know I want to get it out of mine.<eos> I didn't come here to fight, Harvey.<eos> I came here to tell you I've never seen your mother more excited than when she was heading out to have dinner with you.
- I came to apologize for yelling at you<eos> - You don't have to do that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> I know you only had my best interest at heart. You always do, and...<eos> I shouldn't have snapped at you.
- God damn it!<eos> Be serious.<eos> - I am being serious.<eos> - Well, you know what-- never mind.<eos> I shouldn't have come to you.
Now, are you gonna let me do that or not?<eos> - You're gonna do it, do it, but you're gonna be the one to tell Oliver.<eos> - You wanted to see me?<eos> - Yeah, I, uh--i did. Come in.<eos> I want to talk to you about the, uh, Sofia price case.
You had the power to stop it, and you better believe that you can turn it the other direction.<eos> - And in return, you'll do what I want. - No.<eos> You're gonna do it, because it's the right thing to do.<eos> But I'll do what you want for something else.<eos> - I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> We talked about it, and I agree with him.<eos> - Mike, I know this wasn't Oliver's idea. It was yours.<eos> 'Cause you don't think he's ready.<eos> Which is why I'm coming to you.
- I told you he'll lose.<eos> - Then he'll lose.<eos> Now I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> - God damn it, this is a woman's life, and you're going to a goddamn movie.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Sir, open your mouth in my courtroom again, and you will be removed, and this case will be dismissed.<eos> Mr. Grady, do you have an objection to Ms. Johnson's statement or not? - I don't.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> - Then the court has no choice but to dismiss this case with prejudice.<eos> - Benjamin, before you ask, i already told you- what if I could make it more like you?
to learn from your quips, i might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart, but it would require your help.<eos> - You really think we could do that?<eos> - I don't know, but I know we can try.<eos> - Well, then the first thing that you need to learn is never, ever, ever sit in my chair.<eos> - Relax, Benjamin, I'm just messing with you.
Our children are out there somewhere scared and alone and you just...<eos> And you just leave?<eos> You just...<eos> Are you done?<eos> It's got nothing to do with you.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Feel better.<eos> Don't be mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you?
I didn't have you pegged as a cliché.<eos> Bartender at sugar foot said you might know where he is.<eos> Which bartender's that?<eos> Tall black guy.<eos> Said I should talk to you.
Completely taken me by surprise.<eos> It's actually very exhausting.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Don't let me forget.<eos> I've lined up my lawyer to talk to you if this whole Al Parker business gets out of control.
He wanted a swig, too.<eos> We drank it together straight from the bottle and, even before we'd finished, we were kissing each other, completely out of control.<eos> And the next day, after the pash in the car, I went into the office, and I expected him to be really cool and withdrawn and act as if nothing had happened.<eos> But he came straight up to me and he said,<eos> "I want to sleep with you tonight, if that's what you want, because that is definitely what I want."
Are you OK?<eos> We're thinking of going for a wander down the beach.<eos> It's a bit late.<eos> I'd like to go.<eos> I'm not doing that with you.
That's the best that you can do?<eos> I cared about her, too.<eos> For what, like, ten minutes, including foreplay?<eos> Are you mad at me because I cared too much or too little?<eos> I'm mad 'cause you fucked up the one thing that - we were counting on you for.
Sorry, I just--I panicked. I don't love blood.<eos> Who loves blood?<eos> I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God! I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!
I'm not gonna feel anything, so fucking go!<eos> - I don't think I can do this.<eos> - Oh, my God! I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!<eos> You are so fucking pathetic, you--you--you floppy-haired, limp dicked dork.<eos> Fucking--no wonder Alice couldn't get off on you.
What?<eos> It's a good picture.<eos> Sandy already asked me to do that for him.<eos> I have some interesting news.<eos> Capitol Records wants to meet with you next week.
He's a pompous know-it-all, smarmy little Ivy League pussy.<eos> - He went to San Diego State... actually.<eos> - You're kidding me right now, right?<eos> You corrected me 'cause he went to San Diego State?<eos> No, I'm agreeing with you.
Pick up a People magazine every once in a while.<eos> That was three boyfriends ago.<eos> Oh, hey, I gotta start writing some of these names down.<eos> I'm getting lost.<eos> I'm joking around with you.
I mean, he could be the next Buttons.<eos> - Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say?<eos> - Yeah, great.<eos> Hey! There's a caterpillar on your face.<eos> What's with you?
- What's his problem?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just do what he says.<eos> It's an international call, so talk fast, okay?<eos> Can I count on you?
- Oh, no, doll.<eos> That's just how she looked.<eos> - Harriet Connick Jr.?<eos> Oh, they just called for me.<eos> I'm just gonna call in sick, and I'll come meet you.
We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?<eos> She lost her eBay rating and then all of her customers. Oof!<eos> That sucks.<eos> Well, my Sophia, I would love to stay and help you brainstorm, but I gotta go let Dax buy me dinner, because I'm totally regressive that way.
Well, I don't mean to be a threat to you, grand poo-bah.<eos> Okay, that's not funny.<eos> Holder of the drink tickets that I never get.<eos> The drink tickets are meant as a reward for those who bring in other people, and you two are always by yourselves, okay?<eos> Now, I really need you to just clear the area, because I've been talking to you for way too long.
- I'm going on tour for several months.<eos> You're right.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm obsessing.<eos> But, hey, I promise you, as soon as I get my insurance card and get my hernia fixed, I'm flying out to see you, and then watch out.
Somewhere along the line, you... gave up on yourself.<eos> Maybe I did, too.<eos> You're awake.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was so worried about you.
It was in both.<eos> - Wha...?<eos> Oh, you're the best.<eos> - You win.<eos> Sophia, I was worried about you.
Yes.<eos> Remembrances.<eos> How weird.<eos> I've been talking about you.<eos> I'd like to speak with you about the pants.
Oh, I totally saw Saw.<eos> - Shane, did you see Saw?<eos> - Don't want any part in this.<eos> Come on, you have to play along.<eos> I'm still mad at you.
They're best friends.<eos> - They're our amphibian doppelgangers.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So, Sophia.<eos> There is something I wanna talk to you about.
- I've been promoted to manager at work.<eos> - Annie, that's great!<eos> Holy crap. Look at us, we own this town.<eos> Suck it, Nash Bridges.<eos> Yeah, but, um... I'm not gonna take it, because I'd rather work here with you.
Holy crap. Look at us, we own this town.<eos> Suck it, Nash Bridges.<eos> Yeah, but, um... I'm not gonna take it, because I'd rather work here with you.<eos> Aw, that's sweet.<eos> I like working with you, too.
She's completely lost her mind.<eos> We all eventually lose our minds.<eos> Did no one read the link I sent about chemtrails?<eos> Find another outlet, Sharon.<eos> We're all worried about you.
I just had to get out of there.<eos> So, you don't think that I'm... a garbage person?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It had nothing to do with you.
But it'll be mine.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Wait.<eos> May I sing with you?
You're right.<eos> That was too far. This is on Shane.<eos> But still, woman to woman... so not cool.<eos> Sophia, please.<eos> Two years of my life wasted on you.
- No, of course not.<eos> When did it start?<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Tell me again.<eos> Can I be honest with you?
Okay, today at the pool, that shit you pull in front of Josh?<eos> Oh, you mean Dr. Josh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Dude, that guy is a tool.<eos> I would never let anyone speak to me the way he speaks to you.
This the kinda shit you pulled when you were at Pearson Specter?<eos> On occasion. Then I want you to say the next time you think to pull something like this, you have the common courtesy to tell me before you do it.<eos> I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.<eos> Because if you're not good to yourself, how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?<eos> And for your information, the initial program was vanilla bean and an Enya CD, but it learned from you.
My gift to you was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch by involving me in this case.<eos> Seriously, Harvey, I appreciate you rolling with this thing.<eos> Especially when I had to improvise.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The truth is, I like getting the chance to work with you again.
- Hey. You ran out of the presentation so quickly, I didn't get to ask what you thought.<eos> I had to get to class, but I thought it went great.<eos> What about Louis?<eos> He was over the Moon.<eos> I'm sure he's glad to have you back.
Ay, Leslie, this is not necessary.<eos> I fell.<eos> I have a bruise that I will cure with the power of my mind.<eos> In the car you told me you were dizzy.<eos> I just wanna make sure you're okay because I care about you.
No.<eos> I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did not come here to talk you out of anything, all right?<eos> I'm only here to let you know that whatever you decide, I'm with you, Padre.
Now, the police did a drive-by, but they didn't see nothing.<eos> And it's... it's got me wondering.<eos> It's best to be sure.<eos> I'm gonna go have a look, okay?<eos> - I'll come with you.
- I'll come with you.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> The best thing for you to do is just keep working here, all right?<eos> I got this.<eos> Vincent. Take this with you.
They'll be here, Kol.<eos> And while we have a moment, I wanted to say thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For coming to get me.<eos> So I could be sitting here, annoyed at you.
But I am gonna find you, Anton. And then I'm gonna read your book, you blurry son of a bitch!<eos> We have that open house today.<eos> Maybe you should take the day off, let me cover it.<eos> What? Huh?<eos> Well, it's just that everything's been so intense lately and I'm worried about you.
- That's not what...<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> I was just trying to prove my point.<eos> Because you're not into me.<eos> But you just lied to protect me so I wouldn't get hurt, like your parents are doing to you.
Do you think that I'm gonna send Jimmy pictures of you for 15 years to run a con?<eos> I thought he was your dad.<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Well, Erin.<eos> He... He really cares about you.
Make it hotter around here?<eos> It's bad for business.<eos> All right, those two guys hiding in the church, Miles and Jaylen, they part of your crew?<eos> Man, I seen them shorties around, but they ain't with us.<eos> Look, man, I'm telling you straight.
Tonya starts making accusations, that opens the door to this thing being thrown out in court.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You can't actually...<eos> You aren't going back in that room.<eos> She's playing you.
"I'll take care of it."<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> We have enough.<eos> I know that you had Vince signing you in and out in exchange for sex and cash.<eos> And I guarantee you, when he's charged with statutory rape, his loyalty to you is gonna disappear real quick.
Two weeks ago.<eos> Four people died.<eos> And as upset as you all are...<eos> I didn't hear anything about it until...<eos> I'm just worried about you and JD. Well, why are you...
Yeah. It's just a change of plans.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm sorry. I know it's bad timing, but you guys are gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna catch up with you when you get back.
Well, I'm sure that...<eos> I'm tired of playing games, mack.<eos> Coulson said that if I wanted to know where you went today, I should ask, and he's right.<eos> I went to see my ex.<eos> I-I've been wanting to talk to you about this, and...
Agent Coulson, come with me.<eos> I'm going with them.<eos> So, what was it like growing up with four of them?<eos> There was a lot of crying.<eos> - They picked on you?
I'm sorry.<eos> What are you apologizing for?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> It makes sense to take this step.<eos> I would love to live with you.
I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.<eos> Your new body will be stronger.<eos> That's who you were meant to be.<eos> I just have one request.<eos> Take me with you.
What do you mean?<eos> I'll keep the signal going, hold the fort as long as I can.<eos> No, ward, you -- you don't have to do that.<eos> That's --<eos> I know I'm not going with you when you leave, but I can still help out from this side.
And when she's sad... when she's sad, I hold her.<eos> No.<eos> She's real to me.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I know how hard this is, but you have people... who really care about you... who love you very much.
Now where do we plug this into?<eos> - Over here.<eos> You've got to be kidding me!<eos> - Come on, Davis!<eos> What are you doing?
There's music and art.<eos> And smashing heads on the floor.<eos> That's the one I like the best so far.<eos> Did you know that blood has a copper smell?<eos> Okay, Ophelia, I'll go with you.
We can go away, start again.<eos> Too late.<eos> This is making me feel better.<eos> Fitz, why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer?<eos> Because there's something wrong with you, you psycho!
Daddy!<eos> Time's running out.<eos> That door is the only way out.<eos> Please, mack.<eos> Everyone who cares about you is on the other side of that door.
I love your cooking.<eos> Get the fire extinguisher.<eos> Funny.<eos> Now you get to set the table.<eos> So, listen, I wanna talk to you about yesterday.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about zooming in on the gun to find out who shot it.<eos> You just zoom in, then you...<eos> Okay.<eos> Seriously. What the hell happened with you and this girl?
Well, um, in the Kabbalah, the number 28 is the symbol of the wanderer, who, after many years in the dating desert, finally stops his wandering.<eos> And so we give a gift associated with the foot...<eos> Finally at rest.<eos> You're so full of the bullshit.<eos> My God, what am I going to do with you?
Just leave it be.<eos> Okay, this is the hardest part, saying good-bye.<eos> Ezra, you must move on with your life.<eos> You are a good man with a great heart.<eos> If you weren't, this probably wouldn't have happened to you.
Improvising.<eos> Why the hell didn't you know he was traveling today?<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> You have to take it as close to the flame as possible, don't you?<eos> And with you, that is always too goddamn close.
And then they eventually heal.<eos> Trust me on that.<eos> Ezra, get your ass in here now!<eos> God damn it, Arthur, take it down a notch!<eos> Do you want me to go in there with you?
You know, if she thinks she can intimidate me with this bullshit letter, try.<eos> Bring it on!<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, let's do that.<eos> Hey, Mom, can I come talk to you for a second?
And you did it.<eos> That's not all they're saying, though, you know?<eos> I know five women at work who've had miscarriages.<eos> Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.
Good for...<eos> Look.<eos> It's not good for me.<eos> Red wine is good for me.<eos> Odette told me if you get any fatter, she's gonna kick you out.
- It's just a package.<eos> It could be anything! A bomb.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What is wrong with you?
I can do this alone.<eos> I got a new kill poncho.<eos> It's pink, you know, because why not?<eos> You know, I'm not just talking about Dan.<eos> I'm saying I'm not going with you at all anymore.
I don't care.<eos> Wait... are you just doing this because you feel bad about not kissing me?<eos> No.<eos> A little.<eos> So much stuff has happened to me over the past couple of weeks but it's been okay because I've had you to talk to.
- Really?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Huh.<eos> Excellent news. I got the pen.<eos> Oh, my God. I was so worried about you. [sighs]
Joel, you just had your little moment, but let me tell you how this is gonna go down.<eos> You're gonna keep doing what I tell you to, because if you don't, I'm not only gonna put you away, I'm gonna put your wife away too.<eos> - She has nothing to do with this.<eos> - Really?<eos> I saw her with you the night you sprayed your lawn where you killed Gary.
Frozen is the closest thing to fresh.<eos> What if we got a meat freezer and put it in the storage unit and when we kill somebody, we can just chisel off chunks of it when I need to eat. No more waste.<eos> There's gonna be chiseling.<eos> Sweetie, I can do this on my own.<eos> No, I'm going with you.
I don't know how much longer I can go without food.<eos> We'll get you the Italian pedophile.<eos> We'll just take the risk.<eos> What if you find out he's supporting his sister and you have to become besties?<eos> I don't wanna fight with you, honey.
Of course I'll come.<eos> And I'll bring Joel and Abby.<eos> We love Eric.<eos> I wanted to adopt Eric, but Joel said no.<eos> Seriously, what's going on with you?
Uh, I'll tell Lisa you're here.<eos> Look at them.<eos> All rugged individuals, yet working together.<eos> In another time, they would've been cowboys.<eos> What is going on with you?
And don't just say you're okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I see things I feel are true and I share them.<eos> I've noticed.<eos> And I'm worried about you.
That's how I got Gary out of my shoes.<eos> I shouldn't have made such a big deal about Loki.<eos> It just freaked me out you two having so much in common.<eos> But then I realized we've spent half our lives together.<eos> No one will ever have more in common with you than I do.
- No, Harvey, it's enough. You promised Rachel that you'd pull the plug if things got too risky.<eos> Well... It just got too god damn risky.<eos> - Mm. Hey. - What's going on?<eos> You got out of bed before it was light out. - Mm. - And you never came back.<eos> - I want to talk to you for a minute.
- I want to talk to you for a minute.<eos> - I know you went to Harvey and you made him promise to pull the plug on my getting into the bar if things got too risky.<eos> - He wasn't supposed to tell you that.<eos> - Did you really think he wouldn't?<eos> - Mike, I only made him promise because I care about you.
Because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life with a man who gave up on his dreams.<eos> And I know that you don't wanna be that man either.<eos> - Louis?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> - Rachel, can I talk to you a second? - Of course.
- Take out your wallet, pay for this coffee, and let's bring this thing home.<eos> - well, that was the most amazing 27 minutes of my entire life. - Which part?<eos> When you sat there with your mouth glued shut or when you shit the bed describing the operating system?<eos> - Oh, my god, I knew I should have stopped after the design specs.<eos> - Benjamin, I'm teasing you.
- Why? - Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.<eos> - Wait, you actually think they would do that?<eos> - Of course they will.<eos> - These guys are vultures.<eos> - Well, then shouldn't I go with you so we can stop it?
Oh, and just so you know, when I put my money where my mouth is, I throw everything I have into it.<eos> - I wouldn't expect anything less from a big mouth like you.<eos> - done?<eos> - Done.<eos> - I gotta say, the world's gonna be a better place with you as a lawyer.
- Thanks, Harvey.<eos> - Technically, I wasn't really in. - Actually, you weren't really<eos> - in the bar, ever. - Yeah.<eos> I'd ask how your day was, but last time I did that, it didn't go very well.<eos> - Tara, can I be honest with you? - Of course.
How dare you say that to me after what I had to find out about you.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - It means you're sitting there like you're the high priestess of moral authority, when the first time we slept together, you were with another man.<eos> - How can you say that to me?<eos> I was up front about it with you and with him.
Oh, you can just do everything else silently.<eos> - Schneider, you came here to watch porn?<eos> - No!<eos> Why won't it stop?<eos> No, I don't wanna chat with you!
And don't open it either.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.<eos> Look, you came to me.<eos> And this is what they need now.<eos> Can they count on you or not?
Moira, do you know Rachel?<eos> Hey.<eos> No. Okay?<eos> No.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Oh, so now we're mashing up mosquitoes for a lizard?<eos> Seriously, Siobhan.<eos> We're not in London any more, Dad.<eos> You have to expect things to be a little different.<eos> I was going to talk to you about that.
Makes you scared to leave your own home.<eos> Is David back?<eos> He was.<eos> Went straight out again.<eos> He spoken to you?
Now, my boys have already started.<eos> So back off and let us get on with it.<eos> All right.<eos> Untwist your knickers, Clifford.<eos> I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
- Of course.<eos> I told them to get out.<eos> You go.<eos> I'll stay here and wait for your dad and John.<eos> I'll go to Reg's place and meet you there.
I'm guilty.<eos> I did it.<eos> What will be will be.<eos> Jesus, Alex.<eos> I don't wanna talk about this with you anymore.
Should take us right to the drop spot.<eos> I call dibs on all the edibles.<eos> Posting this shit on the Internet?<eos> It's like he's throwing it right in my face.<eos> God, she even looks like you.
Motherfuckers!<eos> - Do you wanna be one of the judges?<eos> - Finally.<eos> Someone appreciates me for my biting wit and of course, impeccable taste.<eos> Not you, Ca-Boo-to.
No hideous puffy coats.<eos> No pants.<eos> And no flat-ass fucking hair.<eos> I mean, Jesus H...<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, tits-on-a-stick Stacey.
Clearly, it's working great.<eos> Think of this as nature's CPAP machine.<eos> Now when you inhale, make sure to contract your lower abs and squeeze your Kegels.<eos> New one from Reg.<eos> "Concerned about you.
You're all bullshitting around, making demands no one's ever going to listen to.<eos> I'm the only one doing the real work around here.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Uh, some sort of coin locker baby.<eos> Red, what is going on with you?
But I have the thing that just might turn things around.<eos> Peppermints! Delicious peppermints!<eos> My second favorite candy when I was a boy.<eos> You can eat them in the taxi on the way to meet your dowager aunt. - What's that?<eos> - Oh, Violet, I'm surprised at you.
Got it!<eos> My family fear I'll wander off into some forest.<eos> So where are you going?<eos> Well, that forest over there.<eos> Mm, I better come with you.
Why do you like that kid again?<eos> Because he seems like a--<eos> Like a dick?<eos> Yes, but that's not okay that you said that.<eos> Anyway, I wanna be straight with you.
Companies even make dolls anymore?<eos> Um, Isaac's more of a dinosaur kid.<eos> You guys are good parents.<eos> Clementine, I'm sorry I didn't recognize you earlier.<eos> Once your grandfather gained custody, he didn't want us to make contact with you.
- If I have to.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'm sure the NYPD would love to know they're working with a criminal.<eos> Jamie.<eos> I care about you.
They all had blood work done a few days before they disappeared.<eos> Blood work?<eos> That's weird.<eos> It's missing persons.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
It's your second day.<eos> Yeah, didn't wanna overdo it.<eos> No, actually, I'm working.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> I'll come with you.
- Just stop.<eos> - Winn, let me help...<eos> Just stop!<eos> I'm good here, maybe.<eos> Or you know, at a desk, but I can't go out there with you again.
Hello, Sara.<eos> Good-bye, Sara.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Mr. Rory, we meet again.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
You're suffering from hypothermia.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're not thinking clearly.<eos> You're the one who doesn't think seals are cute.<eos> Whatever, I'm tired of arguing with you.
A small price to pay for the Spear of Destiny, don't you think?<eos> Imagine the power we would wield if we reunited the fragments.<eos> You mean Eobard Thawne.<eos> You're just his errand boy.<eos> It's a job that the Legion will reward me handsomely for, as they would you.
I-I just thought that you would want my expertise.<eos> After all, I have already retrieved two fragments of the Spear, but...<eos> Word to the wise, speak to me with respect.<eos> That little thing on your head doesn't control me.<eos> I don't want to fight with you, Amaya,
Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?<eos> I was gonna kill you for what you did to Sara, but she stopped me, and I'm glad.<eos> But make no mistake, you are not Captain, and this is not your ship.<eos> Not any more.<eos> So if you even think about hurting anyone on my team, I will not hesitate to end you.
You've already defeated her twice.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> The deal is that she brings death and destruction.<eos> J'onn?<eos> Need you for a minute.
You saw him, he left civilians unprotected at that fight which I had to go back for.<eos> - Mon-El's still learning.<eos> - At what cost, Kara?<eos> There was a cop that took a lightning bolt because "Mon-El's still learning."<eos> He cares about himself, he cares about you, and that's what he fights for.
You kissed me when you were sick.<eos> Yeah, um, says you.<eos> Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?<eos> I want to work with you, Kara!
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to find Livewire and her soldiers because someone has to.<eos> And apparently I'm the only person in National City that appreciates how evil she actually is.<eos> - Well, let me come with you.
- We're here, J'onn.<eos> All right.<eos> M'gann?<eos> This is where it happens.<eos> What is happening to you?
I don't want to be the guy at the office anymore.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to just be stuck behind a computer.<eos> We're going to do this.<eos> And we're going to do this alone if we have to.<eos> But we would love to work with you.
*SUPERGIRL* Season 02 Episode 11 "The Martian Chronicles" Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> I didn't know if we'd see you tonight.<eos> Why wouldn't you be?<eos> Thought you might be off Guardian-ing or whatever.<eos> You understand I'm just worried about you.
I feel it, too.<eos> I have for a while.<eos> I just didn't...<eos> Know what it was.<eos> I've just had one of the hardest nights of my life, and I'm heading into something I probably won't survive, but standing here with you,
I don't understand why it's so hard for me to get yours.<eos> That was good.<eos> Is there a technique to that or were you just giving it a swift kick in the caboose?<eos> Because if there's a technique, I wanna know it.<eos> I've missed training with you.
I have been cold.<eos> - And distant. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And I'd like to apologize for that.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad to know that it's not me adjusting to Earth's chilly climate.<eos> I was mad at you, because I thought you were dating Eve.
Could've, should've, would've.<eos> It's a... That's a thing I heard at the bar.<eos> It's not...<eos> Yes, but I don't want to do that anymore.<eos> With you.
This was all you?<eos> Don't you... Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> She's been slumming it with you for so long, she doesn't realize what's out there.
- Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> You may have cut me off from the Fifth Dimension, Daxamite, but I still know a thing or two about the old fisticuffs.<eos> How could you think she'd ever want to be with someone like you?<eos> Why, do you think she wants to be with you?
- Kara.<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> This volatile maniac tried to kill me!<eos> It'll be better for all of us once I snuff him out.<eos> I'll marry you!
- I can hear you.<eos> Where's the dress? The flowers?<eos> The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.
It's not going to work between us.<eos> Ever.<eos> But you said...<eos> - You don't love me?<eos> - Love isn't making demands of someone, or forcing them to marry you.
It's in the rules.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's only room for one crazy person in this relationship.<eos> Maybe we should just, um, control-alt-delete this, and we can talk it over with a cup of Thoni tea.<eos> Being with you would mean being at odds every day with my heart, Mxyzptlk.
Jeremiah!<eos> Eliza.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My God, did I miss you?<eos> Hey, Kara, can I talk to you for a second?
And bingo.<eos> Find anything?<eos> Yeah, GPS coordinates for everywhere this van has been.<eos> I know where Cadmus is.<eos> - Want me to go with you?
Oh, hey.<eos> Okay.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Well, I think it's time we give the noobs the old Supergirl welcome.<eos> I'm coming with you.
No!<eos> There's no time.<eos> - Please, don't leave me.<eos> - Leave her, come on!<eos> Take me with you!
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - What does she want?<eos> - You.<eos> - She wants to talk to you. - I'm not going back there.
...as a violent alien wages an all-out attack against innocent civilians.<eos> Laser eye patch.<eos> That's new.<eos> Well, duty calls...<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
I cook now.<eos> I'm not going to hide.<eos> I'm the Girl of Steel.<eos> I don't bend. I don't break. I don't stand down for anyone.<eos> I know none of us can stop you if you choose to go out there, but please, as the people who care about you, give us a day to try and get ahead of this thing.
I'm not going to let you get in my way now.<eos> Your family awaits you.<eos> No!<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll go with you.
He sent me a personal invite to this press conference.<eos> - Are you gonna go?<eos> - Jack's my Kryptonite.<eos> But it's just gonna bring up a lot of painful things, and I'm not sure I can relive it.<eos> But if your good friend Kara came with you...
Seems petty for you.<eos> Just stop, Jacky.<eos> You know I wish you all the success.<eos> But?<eos> I'm still not going for dinner with you.
Okay.<eos> It's been a while since I had a best friend.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And I haven't felt like that since Clark.<eos> And working with you, it makes me happy.
And there are several heavily armed guards coming if you have trouble finding your way out.<eos> - Ricky.<eos> - Dad.<eos> All that time in prison, I imagined a day when...<eos> I could talk to you without a pane of glass between us.
Supergirl is bigger than me.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - Maggie?<eos> - I'm right here!<eos> - Maggie, I need to speak to you alone.
- I just really have to say it now. - Alex... Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.
Hey, look at that. It's like the...<eos> The... The Mona Lisa.<eos> You said that he connected with you.<eos> He thought the Guardian was a monster, and then I took my helmet off, and I guess he saw someone who looked like him.<eos> He identified with you, James.
We're under attack.<eos> - I've evacuated the DEO.<eos> - Hang on! I'm almost there.<eos> Whoa! - There's no time.<eos> - All right. I'll meet you outside.
That is an order.<eos> Ah, my son.<eos> The Prince, and his beautiful, brilliant bride-to-be.<eos> Finally, all is right with our worlds.<eos> I'm insane to even try to get through to you, Mother, but here goes.
Why is it turning back on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not in control of myself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm not going with you.
You're all cut up.<eos> Why aren't you healing?<eos> You know, I never really bought into that whole wolf pack mentality.<eos> I thought there was something wrong with me.<eos> But I'm a model citizen compared to you.
These are the ashes of a witch that lost his way and it might just be the key to helping us find ours.<eos> This thing, um, the Hollow... its magic has a very unique signature.<eos> I felt it on this witch the other day when Marcel and I took him out, so if I can trace that energy back to its source...<eos> You can find the rest of these fanatics.<eos> So this thing which haunts my niece... has it spoken to you?
You'll make me turn all hairy.<eos> I got the threat the first time.<eos> You just go.<eos> Help your family.<eos> I'll meet you wherever you tell me to.
Freya, you're bleeding.<eos> - Oh... - You need stitches.<eos> It'll have to wait.<eos> You're not gonna do your brother any good if you have head trauma.<eos> At least let me go with you.
So, we tell them the truth.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> Demand the sacrifice.<eos> I'm not demanding anything of anybody, Elijah!<eos> Look, I'm working with you because I want to defeat the Hollow.
We're done here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Done?<eos> - I got distracted today.<eos> I was worried about you and I made a mistake that could have cost lives. And that can't happen again.
I'll talk to Hope.<eos> Well, hey there.<eos> Uh, it's me again.<eos> Hope, uh, all is well where you are.<eos> You know, I really would love to talk to you about a few... hundred things.
I'd rather rip out your vocal chords.<eos> Hey, sorry, we're closed.<eos> Well, maybe you can make an exception.<eos> Davina?<eos> I don't know how long I have, but I had to see you to thank you.
You guys put up a good fight. I respect that.<eos> Still, at the end of the day, too little... too late.<eos> And that is the last one.<eos> I suppose I should say thank you for your hard work.<eos> Don't make me fight you, Rebekah.
- Mom! - Tillate...<eos> Hope, stop!<eos> Aunt Freya, please, do something!<eos> Hope, I need you to focus on the spell.<eos> I'm not trying to fight you.
Well, you're gonna have to kill me first.<eos> She was hoping you'd say that.<eos> We should be celebrating your return, brother.<eos> Perhaps later.<eos> Hayley's still not talking to you, then.
So it reaches out, and it whispers to the desperate.<eos> There have to be others, someone else, someone who could speak to us of its desires, of its weaknesses.<eos> You think this person might be at your party?<eos> I'm counting on it. Mm.<eos> I'm counting on you to help me identify them.
But if we don't stop the Hollow, then Hope will die.<eos> You can save her, Marcel.<eos> - And everyone in New Orleans. - Stop this.<eos> This is about your grievances with me.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.
You may.<eos> Will I not like you when you get very angry?<eos> I'm repurposing.<eos> Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?<eos> Is it driving you crazy?
Why don't you help me clean up?<eos> We could do it together.<eos> Busy hands could help clear your head, huh?<eos> My head hurts, all right?<eos> I want nothing to do with you.
Suppose that same man, Breerling, suppose he took the map.<eos> Suppose that's why he were here.<eos> Suppose that's why he were killed.<eos> If I had a map, would I be sitting here now?<eos> I ain't arguing with you, Davie.
But Verity says you're afraid of nothing.<eos> Do you think you know this place, woman?<eos> Let it be, will you?<eos> I know that if a true man such as you hides his head when he could save a life. It will be a torment to him.<eos> I owe no debt to Silas Sharrow or to you.
I am so glad you did not resist.<eos> Forgive me for calling you out late at the night, Christopher.<eos> - Did you call me?<eos> - Isn't that why you're here?<eos> I am here Jocelyn because I wish to speak with you.
How do you think I feel?<eos> I watch you and Lisa all the time.<eos> I'm not flirting with her to rile you up!<eos> - Forget me and go dance with your wife.<eos> - I wanna dance with you!
I was careless.<eos> It really has been over with Marie for some time, but...<eos> I didn't want to hurt her, so I... didn't say anything at all.<eos> I've made it clear.<eos> And... as unfair as I was to her, I've been ten times more so to you. I was...
No, you need a job.<eos> Why not ask your father could he set you up in the factory in Milan?<eos> Because he humiliated me.<eos> I'm done with him, after the letter to Weber.<eos> Did it ever occur to you that perhaps your father reached out to Weber because he cares about you?
Neither is Marie.<eos> Well, at least she isn't Slavic.<eos> What does that mean? Mother.<eos> Be...<eos> She'll be the end of you, Albert.
I'm fairly certain I just said it.<eos> Don't act like you want to marry me.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I missed the train because I was distracted.<eos> I couldn't wait to share my ideas with you.
He only stops crying when mother holds him, and...<eos> Don't worry, Miza.<eos> I'll make sure you have whatever you need...<eos> How could you refuse him?<eos> I didn't marry you for a dowry, Dollie.
Yesterday's, today's and tomorrow's.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Albert?<eos> Albert? I'm worried about you...
That's lovely. But I can appreciate a blue sky without knowing anything about physics.<eos> Why would you need to know anything about physics?<eos> You're a sparkling conversationalist, a wonderful cook, a talented seamstress.<eos> Tell me about your wife.<eos> She went to school with you?
No! I said stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Eugene? !<eos> I called your father!<eos> He's gonna be very upset with you!
It's still a damn fine book.<eos> I don't imagine you smoke?<eos> Are you sure you're okay?<eos> No, I'm not sure about that at all.<eos> Just yesterday, I might have waded out there with you.
There she is.<eos> Amber?<eos> Mommy!<eos> Hey, baby! What are you doing here?<eos> She was worried about you.
She's sorry she ditched you.<eos> I'm glad all's well.<eos> You didn't have to stay.<eos> I don't think there's much more either of us can do.<eos> Kyle, the reason I came looking for you in the first place, there's a young man I was locked up with.
- Why?<eos> - Because he knows where to look.<eos> He has a map.<eos> That is why I must go now.<eos> If Silas had been with you, he might've saved you.
He's headed high up into the mountains.<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I will come with you, Silas.
And now, finally, here you are.<eos> You made it all happen, Elsa.<eos> Oh, I wish you could spend the night.<eos> It would be so lovely to make you breakfast in the morning.<eos> With you, it's all sunshine.
I will not be forced to do it in my own home.<eos> I was under the impression it was our home.<eos> Mileva, I am trying to prove the most important discovery of my life.<eos> You of all people should understand how important it is.<eos> I moved here with you, didn't I?
I never wanted it.<eos> But what about the boys?<eos> You can't have everything, Albert.<eos> You have your kite with you? Yes, papa.<eos> Good, I'll come and fly it with you very soon.
No parents.<eos> Just a boyfriend and a tiny room in his nasty aunt's apartment, then...<eos> Then I got pregnant.<eos> She told us she'd kick us both out if we kept it...<eos> You.
You think you could give me that grand in cash, up-front?<eos> What? Did someone tell you you were gonna get paid?<eos> We can't pay our guests.<eos> It's against...<eos> - I'm just fucking with you, Ape.
This is not some shiny extracurricular, Piper.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is actually very important.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It's far too hot to fight with you.
We're sacrificing the one for the many.<eos> And what's the difference between her and me?<eos> Hey.<eos> You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
No, don't do this!<eos> - Go.<eos> - Please!<eos> Hey, Boo.<eos> - Let me talk to you.
Well, I soldered six more spindles than yesterday.<eos> - Oh... Ah. - So much job satisfaction.<eos> - Punching out early again, Galina?<eos> - One minute early.<eos> There should be some perks to dating you, no?
Red, what's the, uh... What's the frying pan for?<eos> For hitting him with.<eos> Okay.<eos> You need to get some rest, okay?<eos> And when we see Nicky, we're going to have her kick that girl out of bed and come find you.
It's gonna be all right.<eos> The doctors, they're gonna take care of you, and I'mma be there real soon.<eos> I'mma be there when you wake up.<eos> I got a plan... and I'mma be right next to you before you know it.<eos> Mama's coming for you.
But, sadly... still sober.<eos> You gonna tell me what happened, or you... you gonna keep stalling with all your words?<eos> Uh, for now, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> You know, I don't wanna think about it.<eos> All I want to do is just sit here, you know, with you.
Love is not beauty.<eos> - It's pain. - Mmm...<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Well, she's my ex-girlfriend.<eos> Oh, I'm all gay, all the time, so I'll never fuck you, Frenchy.
Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go to Arkadia. What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm a better thief than I am a hunter.<eos> - I'll come with you.
What are you waiting for? Go.<eos> Be doctors.<eos> Give it to the child first, and if it works, you give it to the others.<eos> I'm glad you're back, John.<eos> I was worried about you.
-You don't have to.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -I'll take a cab.<eos> -I'm taking you home.<eos> What is going on with you?
I was looking forward to hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.<eos> Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.<eos> I came here to thank you.<eos> I took it down... off the Internet.<eos> It's weird, talking to you about this.
It's never happened before in South Carolina.<eos> -Well, you have nothing to say about that?<eos> -Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.<eos> Oh, you don't believe that for a second.<eos> I can't win with you.
Okay.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yeah. Come on.<eos> Ruth Wilder.<eos> Looks like you.
I wanna kick your ass.<eos> And then I never want to see you again.<eos> No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm not gonna fight you!
Am I in trouble?<eos> No, it's not about being in trouble, sweetie.<eos> No, you're not in trouble.<eos> 'Cause I didn't mean to do anything wrong or anything.<eos> I know. We just wanna talk to you about what's going on, you know.
We're the aliens. We go to Mars... take the place over, wipe out all the Martians and, like, try to make it our own.<eos> But then we realize... it can never really be ours, like... even the people that were born there, never known any other place, they'll still always be aliens.<eos> And the best part is, like, all these people move to Mars, try to escape their problems on Earth, and they get there and... it's like life on Mars isn't any different.<eos> Like, they just bring all their old problems with them.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?

That's a stupid fucking policy!<eos> This is a large public school, Mrs. Byrde.<eos> Voicemail.<eos> Hey, Jonah? Have you seen Charlotte?<eos> Charlotte came into school with you, didn't she?
Doesn't mean shit.<eos> I... I can do this.<eos> Try again, but don't push so damn hard.<eos> You'll blow it.<eos> Can I talk to you, Boyd?
Fifteen years.<eos> I'm gonna kidnap Marty... get his money and kill him.<eos> With feds in town?<eos> The boys and I will be in Canada before they know what happened.<eos> I'm coming with you. - Boyd...
I tried.<eos> - What the fuck do you want?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I've been calling you.<eos> - I don't wanna talk to you, Kevin.
Off of Dusenbury Creek.<eos> Some shack or something.<eos> I'm gonna need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be in touch with you.
This is a new market.<eos> But we need product.<eos> How much?<eos> The demand will be high.<eos> Gilbert told me to meet you.
Pine Ridge.<eos> - Kimara?<eos> - Yeah? - Are you there?<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm here. I'm gonna stay on the phone with you.
You have to be looking at the...<eos> You're looking at me like I'm a magician and I'm gonna pull a fucking rabbit out of my hat.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are they doing this to me?<eos> This isn't about you and the Rayburns anymore.
You're looking at me like I'm a magician and I'm gonna pull a fucking rabbit out of my hat.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are they doing this to me?<eos> This isn't about you and the Rayburns anymore.<eos> It's about you and the 12 people in that jury box.
Yeah.<eos> What was your name again?<eos> You know, I've been talking to Eric.<eos> He's in really rough shape right now.<eos> And he just asked me to come over and talk to you man to man, no bullshit, no lawyers, and, you know, just... Just...
I thought we'd got rid of you.<eos> When was it?<eos> Four, five years ago?<eos> Put that gown on, keep the whiff out of your clothes.<eos> You know, if I'd have had a bigger penis, I would've tried to marry you.
- Can I just get a water without lemon?<eos> - Yeah, just waters for everyone, thanks.<eos> - OK.<eos> All right. - Cheers.<eos> - She keeps coming up to you.
You know that.<eos> She blew me without a condom.<eos> Yeah, and then after, she say, "I don't normally do that." Yeah?<eos> Pretend.<eos> She can't go with you to Gold Coast.
- OK. Call me any time.<eos> - OK.<eos> - OK. Um... - Thanks.<eos> - I'll stay because it's wasteful, and...<eos> - Take it with you.
Hey, you know, you wouldn't believe it, but I have Asian friends who have never been to the beach, and I was going to take them and teach them to swim, so if you can swim...<eos> I can swim.<eos> Cool.<eos> Oh, Rob, you didn't need to come in.<eos> Just wanted to speak to you about a strange result.
Jasper!<eos> Clarke, what do we do?<eos> The sky is... falling.<eos> The sky is falling.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Honey, you okay?<eos> Ever since, I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.<eos> It's like I can't... trust happiness because I know it could be taken away any second.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What's going on with you?
Ever since, I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.<eos> It's like I can't... trust happiness because I know it could be taken away any second.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I've been so happy with you and Rocky.
Best thing you can do for John... is for you guys to get as far away from here as possible.<eos> You're a beautiful woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> - What's up with you tonight?
Mom, she's not the answer.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - This isn't it.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I want to talk to you outside.
Well, you went out alone.<eos> You were lucky.<eos> You should never go diving alone.<eos> Diana called.<eos> She was worried about you.
Okay?<eos> Nolan stopped by while you were napping.<eos> How long was I asleep?<eos> Maybe an hour.<eos> He wants to talk to you, John.
Now, begone.<eos> Begone!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Christ!<eos> What the hell is got into you?
I'm... sorry?<eos> In certain lights, you're very pretty?<eos> - Certain lights?<eos> - Any light.<eos> The reason I don't want to do it with you is not because you're unattractive.
_ - I will write the greatest plays this world has ever seen.<eos> - What the hell has gotten into you?
I should have burnt it sooner.<eos> I kept it only out of obligation.<eos> And that is better, that you risk our lives through cowardice?<eos> You are a liar and a fraud.<eos> I ignored it when your hands were stained with Baxter's blood, but I won't ignore it again, nor waste another second upon you.
- No hurting anyone. - No casting magic. No sex.<eos> Trust me, you locked down any possible fun.<eos> I held up my end of the deal, Q.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Or box me now 'cause I'll drive you insane.
- Your highness, we would not advise...<eos> - that worked for Jane?<eos> - Sold.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'll come with you.
- Shit what?<eos> - Just... dead ended again.<eos> How's Mayakovsky?<eos> - Oh, still a jerk-off, you know.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Damn it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Before you ask, no.<eos> No luck with the adoption records. No luck with the hospital. And no luck with the nurse.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.<eos> But it's more fun with you.
Maybe one of those things taken hold inside of him, too.<eos> No.<eos> No, that was all him.<eos> Evil fuck.<eos> Either way, I'm worried about you.
Chief, you were rounding people up with those things inside them and keeping them in a cage.<eos> Is there anything else you want to mention?<eos> No.<eos> That's all I got.<eos> Something you need to see you, Chief.
She did something to... to make 'em more powerful.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What about him?<eos> Byron!<eos> I'll catch up with you.
What about him?<eos> Byron!<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been trying to reach you all afternoon.
How was that?<eos> I got your messages.<eos> We're on the next flight out.<eos> Yes!<eos> See, that's why I'm marrying you.
Father, do your thing.<eos> - Rob!<eos> - Would you just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> Please, would you just, baby, just leave the pigeons alone?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Oh, God.<eos> Baby, how did you get up here?<eos> I'm not gonna lie, it took a couple of tries.<eos> I can't believe you're here.<eos> I was so worried about you.
I mean, baby, since when do you care what he thinks?<eos> I know, but, baby, it's not just your dad, it's everybody down there thinks you're making a big mistake.<eos> And I think they're right.<eos> I feel like such a fool.<eos> It's not about you.
Um, can we talk?<eos> That's what we're doing...<eos> I can't do this while I'm in my office.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I'm sorry he came to you.
I told you to mind your own!<eos> You bitch!<eos> She was in my stuff.<eos> What the...<eos> What the hell's wrong with you? Oh, my God. Hang on.
Disappointing.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Alice!<eos> You got her attention. Now what?<eos> I'm sorry for all the times I was a total dick to you.
I remember how much Liza liked coming here... and Jay.<eos> But I think he was here more for the doughnuts than my sermons.<eos> What's on your mind, Father?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> I remember, like it was yesterday... when you asked me to be there with you and Liza.
You... were supposed to take care of me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wasn't a mother to you.<eos> All I ever wanted to do was to take care of you... but I was frozen on that sofa.<eos> I begged myself to get up, to go to you... but my mind wouldn't let me.
Raven!<eos> Get the hell away from me.<eos> - Get off me.<eos> - Raven.<eos> - Get off me. - What's wrong with you?
Only one way to find out.<eos> Um, Aberdeen is an army facility with army men carrying army guns.<eos> And it's standing between me and that cave.<eos> Noted.<eos> - Okay, then we'll go with you.
They all hate you.<eos> Face it. "The Widow." Not exactly a term of endearment.<eos> Have you made the other preparations that we discussed?<eos> Everything's in place.<eos> I'm glad I'll be there with you.
- Stop your thinking, hmm?<eos> Use that fear pumping through your heart and cut me.<eos> Cut me.<eos> Where?<eos> Well, that's entirely up to you, Gabriel.
I did, yes.<eos> See it's been much too long since I met someone whose skill matched my own.<eos> I want that challenge, Sunny, and honestly that thrill,<eos> even if it's just one last time.<eos> I have no quarrel with you, Nathaniel, and no wish to spill your blood.
- That's bullshit.<eos> - What does the water have to do with your case?<eos> Just get Penetti something and get the fuck out of there.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> What's going on with you?
- She hates surprises.<eos> - That's all I'm saying.<eos> - Here, put this in the car for me.<eos> Hey, Eddie, is everything okay?<eos> - Better than... - We're, uh... We're coming to see you.
How could you leave our son with that psycho?<eos>  Benson.  That's what he is. His whole family is.<eos>  Stop.<eos> Please.<eos>  What the hell's wrong with you?
You'll need an escort out of the no-fly zone.<eos> Call when you're ready to launch.<eos> Prax.<eos> Go with them. No.<eos> I'm going with you.
What are you doing?<eos> What do you think?<eos> You can't do that. That's someone's child.<eos> I came here to destroy the protomolecule and that's what I'm going to do.<eos> I'm not going with you
He's been here.<eos> I smell abs.<eos> Ugh, I smell us.<eos> When did I have a hot dog?<eos> I shared one with you while you were sleeping.
I'm going.<eos> Just to make sure he recognizes me.<eos> Here you are. You two wander off more than my stepson's left eye.<eos> You're late for your scene.<eos> Um, I just need two minutes with that guy who just left, and a condom if you have one on you.
- No.<eos> My relationship is really over, and I'm starting to lose feeling in my downstairs.<eos> Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged you across the country.<eos> You didn't drag me anywhere.<eos> I wanted to be here with you.
When you get back to your country house tonight, go out back and take a sauna.<eos> Get focused.<eos> That's an order.<eos> You know, I usually get a full-on Woodrow Wilson going when I'm billing a client for hundreds of lawyer hours a week. But, every hour I spend with you,<eos> I'm aware little by little, you're getting wiped out, and that's even though I'm underbilling you.
It's gonna take some doing to get rid of that ass tattoo.<eos> I have terms...<eos> A dozen laser sessions, at least.<eos> And one of them is, I don't talk about my clients. What happens in my office is sacrosanct.<eos> I don't talk about my sessions with you or anyone.
Look at these.<eos> 1998 Special Fundadores.<eos> Aged to peak complexity.<eos> And if they're not smoked soon, they'll go one-dimensional.<eos> I was hoping to smoke them with you at Foley's party, but while I've received my invitation, you were left off the list.
You sound like a fucking hippie.<eos> I know that this is difficult to grasp, but the age of the kingmaker is past.<eos> I don't need a power broker. I have my own power.<eos> And when it is made manifest, Foley will zip his fucking pants up and look me in the eye.<eos> Foley won't talk to you. He won't even talk to me.
You're really that worried about the world ending?<eos> Yes.<eos> What about your own world?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Well, before that existential dread racks you, buy some offsets.
I came all the way out here, Victor, on the recommendation of a dear friend, to look at you.<eos> - What do you see?<eos> - A man who's stuck... at a boutique firm, a glorified day trader. Making good money, but not as good as it used to be.<eos> But that's not the sticky part.<eos> You can't be who you are, and it's ripping you up.
- He wanted to get over you.<eos> - He got caught dealing marijuana.<eos> I'm not having this conversation.<eos> - I need to because having him here is throwing me off.<eos> - I'm with you, Hank.
- He got caught dealing marijuana.<eos> I'm not having this conversation.<eos> - I need to because having him here is throwing me off.<eos> - I'm with you, Hank.<eos> You...
Are you and Cal?<eos> - No.<eos> We could never be together like that.<eos> I promise.<eos> - I'm worried about you.
What's going on?<eos> We've been waiting for our next round of drinks for, like, ever.<eos> Wow, Max.<eos> Are you really gonna let the cast of "Pitch Perfect"<eos> talk to you like that?
I rest my case.<eos> And tomorrow I'm taking golf lessons thanks to our community board.<eos> Apparently, I don't meet the weight minimum for Krav Maga.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll go with you.
Yep, according to my "Hustler" watch, it's 11:69.<eos> Can't be right.<eos> Feels earlier.<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> Oh. I was screaming at you for three blocks to wait up.
Real low.<eos> Shake you up?<eos> All shook up.<eos> Hey, get your ass out of my face, razor hips.<eos> Did he spin you around and slide right out of your life?
Hey, buddy.<eos> - Hey. - What's going on, man?<eos> Bobby!<eos> Hey, I was just on my lunch break, thought I'd stop by and almost see you.<eos> Well, it was nice dating you.
Oleg, shouldn't we be getting off at the next exit?<eos> Do you think we should exit at 33B, Misty?<eos> Ooh, that exit is closed for construction, naughty boy.<eos> Since we're having a day off from Barbara, I put the GPS on XXX.<eos> Can't a woman just talk to you?
Speaking of Bobby and people he knows, uh, does he still talk to what's-her-name, Jessica?<eos> Pfft, no.<eos> Bobby never brings her up.<eos> We just talk about our common interests, like how much we like my hair or how pretty I am.<eos> Yeah, but circling back to other people, which is very hard with you,
Does it suit me?<eos> So beautiful.<eos> Come here.<eos> My gosh.<eos> I'm coming for you.
I'm coming for you.<eos> You okay? Yeah.<eos> Good thing I went with the bigger helmet.<eos> Wait.<eos> Let me get to you.
Where have you guys been?<eos> Just skating.<eos> Your mom's been looking for you.<eos> Of course she has.<eos> You know, it's not a bad thing to have a mom that gives a shit about you.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> Who's that out there?<eos> It's Alex's dad.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did he give it to you, too?
He went nuts.<eos> Adrian, come here.<eos> All right, hold that on.<eos> He wasn't in his right mind, all right?<eos> I'm just... I'm sorry. I should have come with you no matter what.
Jeez.<eos> - Don't bring shit up like that, man.<eos> - What?<eos> History is a beautiful thing.<eos> I haven't talked to you since the...
And I'd forgotten how much I could feel until I saw you again.<eos> I haven't been Alba for a long time.<eos> [Francisco] I lost you here once.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> [Alba] Whatever you do, no matter how much you change your life, your appearance, your name, the memories always, always stay with you.
Then it has started.<eos> - What?<eos> - The end of the peace.<eos> You stand too close, girl.<eos> Do not make me speak to you again.
No, we're fine. Thanks, Emori.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Honey, you should go with her.<eos> I just got here.<eos> I want to be here with you and help.
I want a fucking discount!<eos> - Réduction, s'il vous plaît!<eos> - I want to go home.<eos> - Réduction, s'il vous plaît!<eos> - Can I come with you?
- Réduction, s'il vous plaît!<eos> - Can I come with you?<eos> Ada, I think it's better if you go home with your Mom tonight.<eos> No!<eos> I want to come with you.
- Can I come with you?<eos> Ada, I think it's better if you go home with your Mom tonight.<eos> No!<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> Georgie, please let me come with you.
Wait, we're phasing out the diner?<eos> I have really gotta stop falling asleep immediately whenever you speak.<eos> Max, think about it.<eos> Why...<eos> Han, we need to talk to you.
I just got over you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Oh, please!<eos> You think you can just come in here in your suit and be like, "Uh, I wanna be with you, Max."
I am.<eos> I can't understand it, but I want to.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Your dad is very upset with you.
I see next time.<eos> I need you to stay for a minute, actually.<eos> I stay?<eos> I've had a really shitty day.<eos> I'd just like to sit and talk with you.
- Not even a little?<eos> Does he want to fuck you?<eos> He seems interested, yes.<eos> Well...<eos> I heard he got upset with you today.
I don't know.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - Guys, come on.<eos> If she comes at me with that stupid offer, all Alicey and shit, is like, "This is the real me."<eos> I wasn't faking it with you."
But you were always so pragmatic, even to the point of, of marrying my weak, traitorous son.<eos> Why not admit it?<eos> The only difference between us is that, is that I'm honest about who I am.<eos> You are deluded.<eos> And I was only pragmatic in marrying you.
She wants this boy.<eos> Why?<eos> She thinks that when he's cut, he unleashes a dark power.<eos> He doesn't. But she's convinced.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with you?
If the freikdreina dies...<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> If she dies saving the world, that is a good death. Luna, please.<eos> You're wounded.<eos> And I don't want to fight you.
He wants me to come on as HUD secretary.<eos> What?<eos> He said he was really taken by my housing initiative in Bedford Park and that he thought his cabinet could use fresh ideas like mine.<eos> - Well, y-y-you said yes, right?<eos> - No, I wanted to talk to you about it.
Talk to me, Emily. What's going on?<eos> I'm not at liberty to discuss this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means I can't talk about this with you.
Okay, Tom, I need to tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> Minutes before you got shot, Emily found out that it was Aaron - who made that call to the Pentagon.<eos> - What?<eos> Why the hell is Emily talking to you about stuff like this?
But there has to be a way to keep him at arm's length without arousing suspicion.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> I mean, the resources involved and the planning... a conspiracy that reaches all the way to the vice president.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> It's not just the Bureau. The whole country owes you a great debt.
Is it about what I said earlier? No.<eos> No, I promise.<eos> I just got a lot on my mind.<eos> Come on, let's get ready.<eos> Tom, I'm worried about you.
So, I've... I've been thinking about you all day.<eos> You know, the story.<eos> I-I think I understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> You shutting me out at the hospital when that FBI agent came to see you... the way you react every time Mike enters a room... the reason you can't let the family come back to the White House.
- Previously on Stitchers...<eos> You have a sister.<eos> Her name's Ivy Brown.<eos> Your mother is still alive.<eos> I shared information with you that I promised to keep secret.
I'm not leaving.<eos> This is no place for you.<eos> If you... stay here, you will die.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want to be with you forever.
Blair wants to kill your mother.<eos> Do not trust him.<eos> Find out where she is, and find a way to tell me.<eos> Together, we can save her.<eos> I'm counting on you, sweetheart.
I'm not sure you've ever experienced anything real your entire life.<eos> And that's our cue to leave.<eos> Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet.<eos> You got involved with her. You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play - and ruined everything.<eos> - Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too. It didn't ruin anything.
Let's go!<eos> I'm sorry. Do you know where room 412 is?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I keep getting turned around in here.<eos> This is what I get for flying across the country to surprise you. - You're alive.
Just full waterworks... like a little boy.<eos> We're not getting the security deposit back. But I'm gonna figure something out.<eos> Okay?<eos> - I will. I will figure something out.<eos> I would much rather you get in this tub with me - than these magazines.
Because if we're just sleeping together, that's... that's totally fine. I... I mean, 'cause I can't, like, totally process<eos> - what does that even mean?<eos> I don't understand what that means.<eos> Listen, here's the thing. I like you. Okay?<eos> A lot. I like sleeping with you. I...
But she's also British, which makes her hot librarian sexy, as well,<eos> - Oh, my God, man.<eos> Are you kidding me? - kind of by default... - This is...<eos> - What?<eos> Two beautiful women wanting to be with you,
About an hour.<eos> - What? - Uh... Sorry.<eos> - Yeah. - Toby.<eos> Did you mean all that stuff?<eos> I would totally marry you if that's something you're down with.
- Yeah. - Toby.<eos> Did you mean all that stuff?<eos> I would totally marry you if that's something you're down with.<eos> You would?<eos> I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.
I missed it.<eos> Randall is not free of vice. It's his compulsive drive to be perfect.<eos> Randall, do you know Sanjay Jahiri?<eos> Sanjay's gonna come aboard, help us land a new wind farm client.<eos> - Really? - I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.
Thank you.<eos> One laugh, that's it?<eos> It was... you can, uh, all thank my beautiful yet unfunny wife, Shelly, for that last one.<eos> Rebecca, actually, I have to apologize.<eos> For the first two months of your relationship... Jack bailed on me so much to go out with you that, uh, I started referring to you as Yoko Ono.
Yeah.<eos> That's not really fair.<eos> Neither is Ben keeping you out till, you know, well beyond 11:00 most nights.<eos> He doesn't keep me out past 11:00.<eos> I'm teasing you.
All right.<eos> Tell you what, let me help you out there, 'cause she's gonna be coming in hot any minute now.<eos> You know what I mean? Excu... Lava fries.<eos> Oh. You look phenomenal.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you, Kevin?
I did take the morning off. It's getting to be the afternoon.<eos> I can't miss the team meeting.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm tired. I, uh...<eos> I'll catch up with you tonight.
Where we left off? Kevin, where we left off was you cheating on me and ruining our marriage.<eos> Look, okay, hey, listen, listen, that's fair.<eos> You want to talk about the cheating?<eos> Fine, let's talk about the cheating.<eos> I don't want to do this with you.
The surgery.<eos> I just don't want you to freak out, okay?<eos> Don't worry about me freaking out.<eos> Uh, well, I do have to worry about it, Kate, because the thing is, is that I'm kind of in love with you.<eos> I'd marry the hell out of you, Kate Pearson.
You always have to go big, don't you, Pearson?<eos> For you, Sophie... always.<eos> Kev.<eos> Hey. Come here.<eos> Sophie is Kate's best friend and she's spending the whole party with you.
Something to put in your stomach?<eos> No, no, I'll be fine.<eos> My God, woman packed a half a produce department in here.<eos> With instructions.<eos> She worries about you.
I'm sorry. Cuz? Like cousin?<eos> This is your cousin?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son, Randall.<eos> Yeah, he look like you.
Whoo!<eos> He's a bad kid.<eos> Why don't you listen?<eos> What's wrong with you? - You are stupid.
- Stupid, stupid, stupid.<eos> You're an idiot!<eos> Yeah, you'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.<eos> Lose your damn head.<eos> Nobody cares about you.
I lost it twice.<eos> - No, three times.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I don't want to talk about this anymore.<eos> I am really disappointed in you.
- Wait, wait.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What's going on? I tried to call Ma today.<eos> She's still not answering.<eos> She's really mad at you.
Sit down.<eos> What's going on? I tried to call Ma today.<eos> She's still not answering.<eos> She's really mad at you.<eos> She's so mad at you, she even got mad at me.
We thought we would help With the Mae Wilson interview.<eos> Prentiss send you?<eos> I think she was just trying to utilize our skill sets. Thanks.<eos> But I got it. And...<eos> She's a little worried about you.
- You belong in an asylum.<eos> - You'd love that, wouldn't you?<eos> Just me all chained up and drooling and... and lobotomized with my balls cut off.<eos> You never had any balls to begin with.<eos> I did before I married you!
- Oh, no, are you kidding?<eos> Guys, I've had ten strippers and a baby pool in this puppy.<eos> Cram your asses in here!<eos> Come on, get in.<eos> I'll ride with you.
Naked already?<eos> You see me.<eos> I am raising a baby with someone I can't even talk to.<eos> And if I leave him, where do I live?<eos> Do I live here with you?
Now is not the time.<eos> Well, I just always thought he was very controlling.<eos> Please don't put me in the position of having to defend the man I just left.<eos> I'm not asking you to defend anybody.<eos> I'm just worried about you.
I will destroy all you hold dear.<eos> Russians, best villains since the Nazis.<eos> It's too bad you can't do it for real.<eos> Why can't I?<eos> Well, if you're Russian, you have to fight the all-American hero, and Debbie's not talking to you.
Is it too much to hope you're here to buy me a drink?<eos> So, you're the Evil Queen.<eos> I presume you're here to take back the necklace that I stole.<eos> Uh, actually, no.<eos> I'm here to talk to you.
Regina, we do have to go.<eos> Can you just give me a minute?<eos> I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.<eos> I like an adventure.<eos> I want you to have this.
Can you just give me a minute?<eos> I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.<eos> I like an adventure.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> So a piece of Robin is with you always.
Do you realize what happens if you're convicted of a felony?<eos> ! Mer, the trial's tomorrow.<eos> It could be our last chance for like 8, 10 years.<eos> Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.
Bailey.<eos> I would never put myself in a position to be in here.<eos> Nobody intends to be here.<eos> I'm just saying... you get hungry and desperate or broke and desperate, and stuff happens.<eos> Stuff does not just happen to you.
Tell her I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell her... tell her I wish I could take it back.<eos> Tell her that, and... and maybe she'll come.<eos> Please?<eos> We're here with you.
Good, good, good... just like that.<eos> Here we go... another push.<eos> I need a big push, Kristen.<eos> Push, push. All right, give me that pain.<eos> We're here with you, Kristen. We got you.
Almost.<eos> We just gotta get a new car.<eos> One that they won't recognize.<eos> Wait. Wait here.<eos> Hey, we're coming with you.
- The heat wave is back.<eos> - I'm here, baby.<eos> - Just breathe, baby.<eos> I got you, I got you. - Okay.<eos> I got you, I got you.
- I'm here, baby.<eos> - Just breathe, baby.<eos> I got you, I got you. - Okay.<eos> I got you, I got you.<eos> Baby, I got you.
I really wanna practice saying the secret words.<eos> Why?<eos> So you could take over and you wouldn't need me anymore?<eos> - Someone has trust issues. - Of course I do.<eos> I dated you!
Three of those names in that list fall within the unsub's comfort zone...<eos> Jason Lu, Jane Yang, and Natalie Huang.<eos> I'm sending you the addresses now.<eos> Let's divide and conquer.<eos> Woman's voice: Michael, what's wrong with you?
It looks good on you.<eos> Too bad this is the only place I can wear it.<eos> Or... was the only place.<eos> Or is?<eos> You know that I can't talk to you about FBI business now that you're no longer an FBI agent, including where the new safe house might be, or... if there even is one.
I just don't know why.<eos> I'll tell you why... if you can keep up with me.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was just thinking about you.<eos> Listen, I know I said I couldn't meet you tonight, but the conference I'm attending in Philly might not go as long as I thought.
That is what I need, too.<eos> Look, it's okay that we met, and it's moving fast.<eos> You're different from anyone I've ever know.<eos> I-I can't explain it, but it's just...<eos> I know that I feel safe when I'm around you, and I hope you do, too.
But all... I mean, this place rocks!<eos> Oh. Thanks for inviting me.<eos> You only turn 18 once.<eos> We might as well do it right.<eos> True that. And about time you finally invited me down here with you.
No, no, I'm not a criminal.<eos> I'm an entrepreneur. I provide a much-needed service for senior citizens who can't afford prescription meds.<eos> So you're buying prescription meds in Mexico, bringing them into America, for what reason, out of the kindness of your heart?<eos> No. But I'm charging pennies on the dollar compared to what Big Brother charges.<eos> Hmm. And all the different boys who follow you there and tag along, do they get a small percentage
She's had a shock.<eos> She's not the only one.<eos> Enough of this foolishness.<eos> Come along inside.<eos> I'm speaking to you, child.
If you refuse, oh, it'll be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl.<eos> Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde! There, there.<eos> Get up, child.<eos> Of course I forgive you.<eos> I guess I was a little hard on you, but I'm just an outspoken person.
They came here looking for you.<eos> What'd you tell them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Katie, I have an unmarked dark SUV headed south toward you.
Where is he now?<eos> He's doing inventory with Mom.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Came to ask you why you've been leaving the bunker.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
They can't hurt you.<eos> I'm not so sure those are memories.<eos> David?<eos> - David? - Mad at you.<eos> - I'll always be mad at you.
The tunnel's just through those woods.<eos> How long are you staying? If you forgot anything at the lab, let me know.<eos> Or I could keep you company.<eos> Right.<eos> Clarke, can I talk to you for a second?
This'll go well.<eos> You'll talk to him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me out!<eos> I'll relieve you in 6 hours.
Einstein, Mozart.<eos> And I choose Raven Reyes over those 3 hacks any day and twice on Sunday.<eos> Enough.<eos> Raven, what makes you think that the future will be any different than the past?<eos> Even if you live, the pain will still be with you.
No.<eos> Let them come.<eos> It's time to face the music.<eos> Yes?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
You try to rip that from them now, and, believe me, they will fight.<eos> No one's saying it's gonna be easy, but we need to make the people listen to reason.<eos> Someone still needs to get Raven.<eos> I'd like to volunteer.<eos> And I'll join you. No.
Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We'll share it.<eos> Someone still needs to get Raven.<eos> - I'd like to volunteer.<eos> - And I'll join you.
This is over.<eos> You and I are done.<eos> Then perhaps I should speak to Miriam.<eos> I'm sure she's dying to know what kind of business you and I have been conducting.<eos> It's up to you, Robert.
For some reason, I want him to like me.<eos> Hey, Max?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, my gosh, look who's here!<eos> - Can we talk to you?
"Hello."<eos> All of a sudden, the gorilla's energy comes down.<eos> She starts looking at the lady, like...<eos> "What's uh...<eos> What's wrong with you?"
I laid out all of Caroline's charts.<eos> Chinese food is on the way.<eos> I know things are not the greatest between us right now, but if we're gonna do the surgery...<eos> Yeah, no, I need to prep alone.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow.
We lost the donor, Caroline's repeat scans show more extensive esophageal invasion, her parents are a wreck, and... And you're... you're here getting drunk?<eos> Jackson.<eos> I got off work, and I had a beer, April.<eos> Four beers, actually, and, uh, some whiskey on top of that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Okay. So what's your idea?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> What? You just...<eos> Yes, I lied, but they can't move her, and I just needed a little more time.<eos> What is the matter with you?
He is very strong.<eos> Well, you're strong just like your mom.<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> How are you?<eos> What's going on with you?
There's a fundraiser in the city.<eos> You going with Cal?<eos> - What do you want, Eddie?<eos> - Look,<eos> I was worried about you.
She's The Guardian of the fucking Light!<eos> This is Cal Roberts, I look forward to speaking with you.<eos> - Uh, hey, it's me again.<eos> I was just calling to see how Hawk is doing.<eos> And I haven't spoken to you for a while, so...
This is Cal Roberts, I look forward to speaking with you.<eos> - Uh, hey, it's me again.<eos> I was just calling to see how Hawk is doing.<eos> And I haven't spoken to you for a while, so...<eos> Anyway, call me. And I will speak to you then.
I swallowed one of them.<eos> Let me see. Wow, that is disgusting.<eos> I hope you didn't look for it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Want to talk to you, Summer.
He got in touch with me. You know my dad?<eos> Hey, come on upstairs, Summer.<eos> Let'slet's all go upstairs.<eos> Come one.<eos> What did Eddie want with you? I don't know.
The only thing that's keeping me here is you.<eos> You asked why I broke up with you?<eos> I know things were difficult with your family and everything.<eos> Yeah, but it was more than that.<eos> Cal offered us a house if I broke up with you.
Do you realize what happens if you're convicted of a felony?<eos> ! Mer, the trial's tomorrow.<eos> It could be our last chance for like 8, 10 years.<eos> Jo Wilson isn't my real name.<eos> That's why I couldn't marry you.
Go!<eos> Just promise me you won't turn her into a fish-lipped monster with an immobile forehead.<eos> That's not something I do.<eos> I'm just reminding you that you swore a sacred oath as a physician to give sound medical counsel to women who are already beautiful. To you.<eos> I'm not worried about you.
She's really gonna let you do a whole surgery with no help?<eos> No hand-holding, no training wheels, no safety belts, no gutter bumpers.<eos> Phase two, baby!<eos> Shut up, baby.<eos> Yeah, what happened to you?
- You are in the middle of everything?<eos> Yes, me, Miranda.<eos> I'm a resident, you know?<eos> So I want to side with them because Minnick is great for us, but the attendings are my friends.<eos> Now they stop talking when I'm around, because I'm married to you.
My name's finally on the O.R. schedule again, and I'm not even allowed to do any of the surgery.<eos> Yeah, welcome to phase two.<eos> Prep the patients and run labs?<eos> That's resident scut. Sucks.<eos> Well, the good news is I'll be right there with you.
Dr. Webber, you tell her.<eos> Robbins wants new wireless fetal monitors, when the ones we have are...<eos> It's not my concern.<eos> Well, damn.<eos> It's not you, it's me.
This is a big...<eos> Maggie.<eos> This is a big renovation.<eos> Maggie.<eos> I-I don't want to discuss this with you.
We can beat this.<eos> You have to fight.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Sweetie...<eos> Sit down and let me talk to you.
No.<eos> I just wish my dad was here.<eos> Maggie?<eos> Meredith doesn't get it.<eos> She's just worried about you.
Oh, it was right... right on the beach.<eos> They got valet at an AA meeting?<eos> Fucking Santa Monica.<eos> Fucking Santa Monica.<eos> All right, look, I'll meet you back here in an hour, all right?
That's great.<eos> - I'll see you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Man, I used to be so good at this.<eos> What's wrong with you, man?
I'm probably not as qualified as you are.<eos> You don't need a masters in clinical psychology from Yale to help people.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> A clinical psychology professor I had at Harvard.<eos> Look, man. I don't wanna tangle with you.
The package moves. The package moves.<eos> Freeze, motherfucker!<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - Shit, Dennis.<eos> Dude yells at you and the first thing you do is get down on all fours.
Allahu akbar.<eos> Allahu akbar.<eos> Welcome to L.A., brother sadiq.<eos> Kyle!<eos> What is wrong with you? !
Something we've brushed up against made these people nervous enough to break cover.<eos> Ivers is the muscle.<eos> The real lead is behind us somewhere.<eos> Before we make a run at Ivers, let me look back and see what we did to trigger him in the first place.<eos> Kyle, you know where I am on this, what I think it's doing to you.
Miss Jalisco.<eos> Ass like a couple of dogs fighting under a blanket.<eos> Hey, you asked.<eos> Get away from the door!<eos> I'm assuming they're not with you.
I'm your boss.<eos> I thought you were more than that.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> It's okay, honey.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
Listen, I realize it's a misdemeanor for a black man to ride alone at night in L.A., but I'm on the job.<eos> Where's the key?<eos> Billy!<eos> No!<eos> I got you, Billy.
We still got to finish stratego, right?<eos> Cabe, I'm gonna do everything in my ability to bring you back.<eos> If not...<eos> It's not your fault. Cabe, you cannot leave me alone with these guys, okay?<eos> It's been a pleasure working with you.
You told him it's been a pleasure working with him.<eos> Any idea how messed up that is?<eos> We were pressed for time.<eos> Please, Walter!<eos> I've been working so hard with you for 2 years now.
I'm full of iron and proteins. Num-num.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You should be jumping at the chance to gobble up this little fella.<eos> The only reason you wouldn't feed would be because you're pregnant.<eos> But in that case, there should be a daddy snake down here with you.
Yeah, okay.<eos> I'm sorry I-i...<eos> I'm sorry I didn't use appropriate words before we stopped your heart.<eos> As you know, I have... I have issues expressing myself.<eos> It's been more than "a pleasure" working with you.
Thought we'd bring our sunny day to you.<eos> We brought you some iced coffee.<eos> I think I'll try to avoid ice for a while.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Hey, roomie, you might hear that I yelled at you a lot when you were dead.
Five figures worth of rare motorcycle parts.<eos> I have a problem.<eos> We're both broke?<eos> Mm. That's great.<eos> 'Cause the truth is, I would marry you in Kovelsky's parking lot.
- dressed as somebody else.<eos> - I thought this weekend<eos> I'd take you for a little getaway. - My God. - Don't you wanna know<eos> - where we're going?<eos> - Anywhere that's away with you is exactly where I wanna be. He's an assignment, sweetie pie.
"What, dear Lord, is the world coming to?"<eos> Would that be the Connecticut Langmores?<eos> Would that make it easier for you to do your job?<eos> Welcome.<eos> So what's going on with you?
- I get it.<eos> Fancy yourself an artist type person.<eos> I fancy myself?<eos> What, money makes you not as good at art?<eos> - That's on you, dude.
We're not gonna be able to talk our way out of this.<eos> What if we never make it back?<eos> I... I don't get to meet my baby girl.<eos> Hey, don't talk like that.<eos> That family of yours is counting on you.
I'm hiding an icicle in my butt!<eos> When he comes at me, I'll stab him in the eye and drive it into his brain!<eos> I'm Kimmy.<eos> This is Cyndee.<eos> The Reverend wants to marry you, okay?
You're okay.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, of course I'm okay.<eos> Don't be so silly.<eos> Lucifer, I was really, really worried about you.
It's called "acting as if."<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, well done, Candy.<eos> I think I know exactly how to get back on the case.<eos> Gosh, I wish I'd talked to you earlier.
I begged him to quit, but no.<eos> My hubby's all about his work.<eos> He is?<eos> My God, it's "Detective this," and "Detective that."<eos> Working with you means so much to him.
Nice catching up.<eos> I'll see you in a few millennia.<eos> Lucifer, wait.<eos> I appreciate your honesty.<eos> And now, I'd like to be honest with you.
For helping me peek inside that scheming head of hers.<eos> Well, it's the least I could do.<eos> After what you did for me in Vegas?<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Pretty sure I'm gonna owe you for the rest of it.
As my grandmother used to say, it's good to have friends in low places.<eos> When dembe said you had a case, I thought, how quaint.<eos> It's not.<eos> You looked at the photos I sent. Yes.<eos> Judge culpepper was above reproach, which means many people would like her dead, but none I could connect to you in any way.
- You're welcome.<eos> - I love your smile. What a lovely smile.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What is going on with you?
Okay, you little shit. Now you've narced me out and called me a hooker, so I'm gonna give you an ass beating your mom should've given you a long time ago.<eos> Big threats from such a little chick.<eos> - I'm not so little!<eos> - Let's do this thing.<eos> - I'm ready. - I'm gonna end you.
Glad you pervs are having fun.<eos> - No. No, we're not.<eos> Um, we were just trying to convince Emma that she couldn't have given Hal a heart attack.<eos> Well, nobody forced him to find the best cheeseburger in every state, right?<eos> Oh, I'm just fudging with you.
Put 'er there, partner.<eos> Uh, what's going on?<eos> Well, I did a... a little maneuvering. You're heading up the Hamilton Theater Project again.<eos> Press release for your promotion goes out this afternoon.<eos> Uh, can I talk to you for a minute?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> My neighbor, Lori Matherfield, she was clenching in such a big, fat, juicy secret this morning...<eos> She's gonna tell me.<eos> Fine, if you really must ruin it.<eos> What, you mean expose this bullshit piece of theater starring you as the magnanimous senior partner?
House rules.<eos> House rules... what does that even mean?<eos> It means it's your house.<eos> You got to answer the door.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Positano's where Jeff's taking me on our honeymoon.<eos> That's great.<eos> No, it is, you know?<eos> You... you always wanted to go there.<eos> I wanted to go there with you.
Someone did show up.<eos> You.<eos> Ever since Nikki escaped, you've been trying to keep me from going after her.<eos> You said, "Let other agents handle it."<eos> I was concerned for you.
Man, I been shot at by terrorists, tortured on three different continents, and landed a plane with no wings and no engine.<eos> I ain't fleeing some wedding just 'cause I'm... a little uncomfortable.<eos> And now, if anyone can show just cause why these two may not be joined, they may speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you... husband and wife.<eos> Hey, can I be honest with you, man?
Right there.<eos> Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> Hey, you know, this is all stuff my mom told me not to do.<eos> Then stay here.<eos> No, no, I'm coming with you.
Riley, you'll run surveillance from Phoenix.<eos> And Bozer... what exactly is it that you do here again?<eos> I... work in the lab?<eos> I know.<eos> I was messing with you.
We were so close.<eos> Sarah. We're gonna find the person who did this.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Man, I have known Matty a long time, and I've never seen her like this.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, what happened between us, in Chechnya, that was all my fault.
- Fine.<eos> Cheers.<eos> We got your message, boss.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> What's wrong with you, Dalton?
Let's just figure out a way to grab him and all get out of here in one piece.<eos> Yeah, you think you can figure out a way to piss these guys off?<eos> Billy!<eos> How come you didn't get a piece of pie, huh?<eos> - Mama mad at you?
Remember when I said this job was boring?<eos> Well, it's not... and for the time being, this is all the excitement I want.<eos> So fieldwork is no longer the primary goal?<eos> Oh, it's still a goal, but from now on, the primary goal is staying alive.<eos> Which means right here with you is exactly where I want to be.
"Never give up" on three.<eos> Everybody in here.<eos> One... - Everybody in here.<eos> - This is Webber.<eos> That means you, young lady, thank you.
Looks like it's been halfway around the world and back.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So if that can't find him, I don't know how I'm going to.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you really want to find him, I'll go with you. I'm down.
- and I think that...<eos> - And it's a pretty big operation, Pierce.<eos> Yeah, yeah, exactly.<eos> So send me the chart.<eos> Well, it was nice almost working with you.
I...<eos> What was the question?<eos> I might have found something in your sea chest that I shouldn't have.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> How could I ever be mad at you?
Look, if we have a problem, you can talk to me about it in a normal way.<eos> You don't have to confront me in the middle of a store.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go ahead and pay for the gift, and I'll meet you outside.<eos> I can't talk to you right now.
She could emerge anywhere in the city.<eos> Alex, where the hell are you?<eos> Don't try to come after me.<eos> If you want to help, just find a cure.<eos> Alex, we can do that with you here.
Burn.<eos> You burn...<eos> You must burn for me.<eos> You must join the eternal flame.<eos> I am ready to burn with you.
All the outside vents are closed.<eos> Well, what if tell the system that the air supply has been used up?<eos> Then it would have to switch into backup mode and vent air from the outside.<eos> Wait-wait, you're going in through the air duct?<eos> Yup. I should go with you.
Yours.<eos> How bad did you hurt yourself?<eos> The doctor said workout injuries like this, um, they're not so bad.<eos> Be better in a few days.<eos> Baby, I got to talk to you about something.
Well, what's the mission? It's about making the world a better place.<eos> You and Mr. crane are what's known as witnesses.<eos> Witnesses.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means a lot of people are gonna be counting on you.
I'm a demon killer.<eos> Grand title.<eos> You are... experienced in the ways of demons.<eos> You have had a demon invade your body, control... your soul.<eos> Be one with you.
By drawing those symbols.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No. It was my fault.<eos> I should have just been honest with you.
I'm sorry I brought you here.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> I guess I just needed someone to talk to.<eos> You were always the one who listened.<eos> I guess I should have been talking to you, Mom.
Now, you, Miss Molly, are a natural-born actor.<eos> But your dancing, though enthusiastic, lacking a little precision...<eos> Okay, you made us so proud up here.<eos> Did you ask her yet?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, Mom, Kendra is having a sleepover for all of the girls in the cast, and if you'd rather I go home with you, I'd really like to...
Well... if you didn't, trust me... I've heard that lie many times before.<eos> Many times.<eos> Malcolm, you emptied the prisons, right?<eos> After executing Crane and the other political prisoners?<eos> My dear, you've got to stop letting these whispers get to you.
The last of my spell crystals.<eos> Quasi per aquam.<eos> More Atlantean magic.<eos> I still owe you for the last time you used one of those, girl.<eos> We came to treat with you, demon.
Fetch, Mick.<eos> Good boy, Mick. Woof!<eos> I'm no one's... pet.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> They may act all friendly to you, but they'll never trust you, never.
We gotta go!<eos> Not without the engraving!<eos> You actually care about these losers.<eos> Mick, come on, let's go!<eos> Because I guarantee they don't care about you, Mick.
Then it's time for you to start acting like one.<eos> Now, sit up straight and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.<eos> Gideon, for the thousandth time, I've got no way of getting the reserve power back online, and I've got no way of...<eos> Of sending out any signal of any sort, which means...<eos> Which means that I am destined to live out the rest of my days right... here... with you.
I know it's hard, but you're so lucky, Xan.<eos> I would die to come here!<eos> Stop trying to cheer me up by saying you'll die.<eos> Right now, it probably feels like the world is ending, but I know if you don't give up and you think positive, things will work out.<eos> -I want to fight you.
And you intentionally targeted this image of a horse because the Voorhees fortune came from making glue from horses' faces.<eos> [Koontz] So thank you, Xanthippe.<eos> The university should've removed that offensive crest ages ago.<eos> Wait, what about horses?<eos> Koontz, I need to talk to you about a special admission case.
It's numbers...<eos> What year was the FBI invented?<eos> Like, the '70s or something?<eos> I-I don't know, man!<eos> Nah, I'm just messing with you.
- Uh-huh.<eos> - I'm impressed.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Good work, Ezra Bloom.<eos> Nice working with you, too.
Max, my right-hand man.<eos> You have to leave them alone for this to play out.<eos> I don't think the Bureau is going to offer immunity to all these people.<eos> I don't care if they get immunity.<eos> Look, whatever happens with them after this is over, that's up to you.
Got any quarters?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh.<eos> Stupid.<eos> You know she's playing you, too, right?
Yo.<eos> You got a visitor.<eos> John Berris.<eos> He's Kanuha's P.O.<eos> He just came down here, said he wanted to see you.
They're preparing to move in.<eos> You could stop them by giving up Kanuha.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> Excuse me, Chin.<eos> That gentleman... he asked to speak to you.
Akemoto wanted you to let me go, didn't he?<eos> He was trying to help me.<eos> He felt guilty for what happened all those years ago.<eos> And he was trying to make it right.<eos> You think Akemoto cared about you?
No question this is meant to shock and terrorize the gay community.<eos> But he keeps coming back to the same area despite increased patrols here.<eos> To justify that risk, he must have a very personal target in mind.<eos> Someone who's connected to this neighborhood and this victim, and that's why he deviated from his preferred physical type.<eos> These murders, they made me realize how awful I was to you.
Still shying away from controversy, I see.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Why does everyone keep asking me that?<eos> Because they're concerned about you.
Go away.<eos> What you need to do is un-focus.<eos> Relax.<eos> Neuroscientists say that the best way to solve a tough problem is to focus on something else.<eos> So let your subconscious do the work while you tell me what's happening with you and Wallace.
- What?<eos> - Sesame seeds.<eos> - To SeeFood.<eos> - To SeeFood... and to a full-expensed meal on Raviga's tab, and to you, Ed Chen, who pulled the wool over Laurie Bream's eyes and got us two-hundo-thou sight unseen.<eos> Well, she had some concerns about getting into business with you again, but I can pretty much talk that broad into anything.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> SeeFood has to be great.<eos> My job depends on it.<eos> Ed Chen bailed and dumped the whole thing on me.<eos> Richard, can I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
Marcus Weber is Owen Hall.<eos> We use the pattern of life that we established for Marcus. We split up, we find him, we meet at the rendezvous point a few clicks outside of the border.<eos> I'll go with Alex.<eos> I-I'll be fine by myself.<eos> Yeah, but I'm better with you.
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I overstand.<eos> Uh, put on a Holocaust movie till I get there.<eos> [Perry] Everyone please stay seated, and, white passengers, for the last time, please do not touch my hair.<eos> -[Perry] Kimmy!<eos> I was worried about you.
I don't even know where to start.<eos> Is Cork even your real name?<eos> No.<eos> It's Titus Andromedon--<eos> Why would you want to make me think I slept with you?
- What do you want?<eos> You're going to the owners' meeting this year, right?<eos> Yeah. It's gonna be epic.<eos> Steve Harvey's performing. He's just gonna hang out afterwards.<eos> Well, I'm coming with you.
You still let me deal with people like the Department of Energy rep when you know I shouldn't!<eos> Abandoned you?<eos> Please, Paige.<eos> You know, I-I might have no EQ, but I am more than capable of picking up when someone is trying to distance themselves from me.<eos> It happened at school when kids could tell that I was different, I felt it with my parents, and now, then... then i-it happened with you.
I owed you.<eos> Owed me?<eos> For what?<eos> For, uh... for letting me sink or swim.<eos> See, at first, I was... I was mad at you because I-I didn't understand why you would do that to me.
Walter, can I be honest?<eos> Mm, of course.<eos> You're the most honest person I know.<eos> Okay. Here goes.<eos> I-I tried being mad at you for the whole Tim thing, and that just... well, it felt crummy.
No, that's not an exit as much as a 40-foot plummet. To her death.<eos> Great, so we're screwed.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Love bug, We'll check in with you later.
Or what, you gonna arrest me, too?<eos> No, and I know I can't stop you.<eos> You're smarter than me and you'd just. Figure out a way to go behind my back.<eos> Like you did to me.<eos> I tried to help your dad. Because I care about you.
What if I can't?<eos> Either way, you must.<eos> Heed my advice, Killian... please.<eos> Seek forgiveness.<eos> Because whatever happened, it will always stay with you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey. So, I saw her again.<eos> Oh, the gym lady?<eos> You ask her out this time?<eos> What is wrong with you?
- No.<eos> But maybe with this Paige stuff, he'll at least consider it.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Hey, so, listen, I wanted to, uh, talk to you about Paige.
I'm sick of treating her like a goddamn kid.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just, uh, going to bed.<eos> Uh, we just need to talk to you for a minute.
My father died when I was six.<eos> In the war?<eos> No, after.<eos> But before... Before he died, there wasn't enough food.<eos> Not as bad as you, but... We went hungry a lot.
Hello, Anatoli.<eos> We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> In case you can't tell from our suits.<eos> We're sorry to disturb your lunch.<eos> We only want to talk to you for two or three minutes.
- Hi.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is... everything okay with you?
No, it's not you.<eos> I'm just ready to go home.<eos> You don't need me anymore.<eos> You have each other.<eos> But, Philip, as long as you're here, the Centre is going to continue to be concerned about you.
No.<eos> There weren't any pictures anywhere.<eos> It's a place we can all meet safely.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> He cares about you, too.
Okay.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> We don't have to make out anymore.<eos> That's it, you're not gonna argue with me?<eos> Do you want me to argue with you?
Moscow was nice city with my mother.<eos> I know I made a mistake.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I f- - I failed you.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Would they just go around Moscow as Paige and Henry Jennings?<eos> Well, they should take your name.<eos> What about you?
- He's not your friend from high school?<eos> - No.<eos> But he knew your name.<eos> I think you're confused about something.<eos> Um, can I talk to you for a second?
Thank you so much for cooperating!<eos> That was amazing!<eos> That was fun!<eos> One big blob.<eos> I should have blobbed with you, Arnold.
I think, maybe, what's happening is that you're just not understanding the technology I'm trying to build here.<eos> Oh, so now I'm stupid, too?<eos> I know what the technology is, Richard.<eos> I have a patent on it.<eos> What the fuck is a matter with you?
Oh, and now that I'm out of the company, you'll need to tell Monica what transpired.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gentlemen, I'm off to be out and about in the 'Vette.<eos> Be back for supper, that is, of course, unless I get fucked to death by the fairer sex.<eos> Gilfoyle, Richard would like a moment, if you don't mind.
His blood is flowing through my veins, Richard.<eos> Make this right.<eos> Fucking blood boy.<eos> What do you want, Richard?<eos> Bryce, I wanted to swing by and apologize for yelling at you when you offered your very unsolicited opinion.
Lydia apparently touched down at Andrews two hours ago, and she wants to see me.<eos> Crowds can be a great distraction.<eos> It's crazy in here.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> I drove 2 1/2 hours to see you, and I'm seeing you.
We've lost our jamming signal.<eos> I need someone to run interference here, fast. Sorry, mate.<eos> I can't leave my desk.<eos> Got a woman watching my every move.<eos> Alex, he's coming up to you.
She's lying to you, Sebastian.<eos> She was not a senator's aide.<eos> She never was.<eos> She's CIA.<eos> She's a rogue operative, and she only married you for cover.
What, uh, what would you like us to do?<eos> Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.<eos> We'll stand down.<eos> Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one.<eos> What would you have me do with you now?
Okay, meet me at Patton's van.<eos> I'm parked just across the street from the OTB.<eos> Showtime.<eos> Garcia's on his way.<eos> All right, Loretta, you're up.
All right, come on, knock it off.<eos> - No, no, no, you know... it's, uh... it's one thing you guys have in common, I guess, uh... devotion to your work.<eos> Well, I don't know if I'd put it that way, but I suppose.<eos> You know what she told me?<eos> She said that with you... it was real.
But that's what I have to do, right?<eos> I mean, I have to give it up.<eos> But hey, without pain, there's no wisdom.<eos> - Yeah, I gotta go.<eos> - Yeah, talk to you later.
- I don't want to talk about it!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So what...<eos> so does destroying your art...<eos> What, does it like disqualify me from being with you again?
Crazy genius.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> You deserve to wear this.<eos> - Really, you sure?<eos> - Yep, it suits you.
- What?<eos> I know.<eos> It's not even our fault, there's a fucking car...<eos> - I know.<eos> What's going on with you?
Pizza.<eos> - Her name is not Pizza, it's Lisa.<eos> - Right, yeah.<eos> And I'm not competing with them, I'm talking about them, I'm processing.<eos> I'm trying to download with you.
I represent a huge YA writer.<eos> Named Shawna Hess.<eos> I told her how talented you were, blah, blah, blah.<eos> She read your book.<eos> She loved it and she agreed to meet with you.
Time for some more field work. Oh.<eos> The cartel is building a foundation.<eos> Legitimate companies give them the ability to wield influence.<eos> Your family is one of the most respected in New Orleans.<eos> If he marries you, it gives him access to politicians, to decision makers.
He's careful.<eos> Eliza was there when Ernesto Blanco murdered an innocent man on Javier's yacht.<eos> She had three million in cartel cash at her stables.<eos> He's not that careful.<eos> Now, I'm trying to work with you, Pride.
I mean, even after everything you've been through?<eos> Duty calls.<eos> I'm sure you understand, Dwayne.<eos> Of course.<eos> Maybe I should come with you.
 You have to.<eos>  I am not cut out for this, Richard!<eos> I don't want the responsibility of other people's lives!<eos> I can barely deal with my own!<eos> Cal offered us a house if I broke up with you?
 You're pathetic.<eos>  We never meant to hurt you.<eos>  Are you fucking serious?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> She may have settled for you, but she chose me... just like Steve.
Sorry.<eos> Have you heard anything more about Eddie how he might've found out?<eos>  No, I haven't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos>  I've been calling him, and he keeps sending me to voice mail, so...  I guess he doesn't want to talk to you.
 Yeah, I'm okay.<eos>  I think they're gonna let us go.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos>  I'm not.  Hey...<eos> I... I came here looking for a new life, and I found it with you.
 I think they're gonna let us go.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos>  I'm not.  Hey...<eos> I... I came here looking for a new life, and I found it with you.<eos>  I found it with you.
Leave me a message, and I will return your call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I messed up.<eos> I told Sarah.<eos> She might come to you.
And maybe... ask if you had a spare couch I could use.<eos> Just for a few days.<eos> You left The Movement? In a manner of speaking.<eos> The couch would be just for a few days.<eos> I haven't spoken to you for 20 years.
I completely understand.<eos> You didn't call last night, so, um... I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.<eos> Um... and... and, yeah, and we're okay, um...<eos> Ha.<eos> I've been... so, um... aand, you know, being with you has been.
I'm sorry, Richard.<eos> I really am.<eos> but... but the last rung of The Ladder is Augur.<eos> It requires no work, no study.<eos> It will come to you, so you will see!
How's, how's everyone doing?<eos> I'm sorry, Sarah.<eos> I take all the responsibility.<eos> I was asleep, intoxicated.<eos> I don't know what I was. I can't be mad at you When I had all the information.
There's this really hot... I'd love to sneak her...<eos> Ah, vodka Gibson, four onions.<eos> Yeah, right away.<eos> So what do we do when he wakes up and starts kicking the door?<eos> Whatever it is has nothing to do with you.
♪ And yet with you, my world has started ♪<eos> ♪ One more day all on my own ♪<eos> ♪ Will we ever meet again? ♪<eos> ♪ One more day with him not caring ♪<eos> ♪ I was born to be with you ♪
I'm not ready to have a kid.<eos> I've seen how hard it's been on my mom and Darlene to raise kids by themselves.<eos> But you're not doing this by yourself.<eos> - Colt!<eos> - I'm gonna be there with you.
So you can see how this isn't the perfect date then.<eos> I'm just talking about going out and having some fun.<eos> I don't do that.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't like change, but change is coming to you.
"Janice, do we have to do this now?"<eos> Oh, they fucking did it then.<eos> Anyway, still smoking.<eos> That sounds really tough.<eos> I'm just happy to be here with you.
Uh... before you say anything...<eos> After the other night, I went home, and I put a cigarette out on our prom picture. And our winter formal picture.<eos> Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.<eos> I never wanted to think about you again.<eos> I was so pissed at you.
After the other night, I went home, and I put a cigarette out on our prom picture. And our winter formal picture.<eos> Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.<eos> I never wanted to think about you again.<eos> I was so pissed at you.<eos> Then I started worryin' about how you were doin', which pissed me off even more.
What's the deal, huh?<eos> You're just gonna... Have a kid with another woman and I'm supposed to go along with it?<eos> Well, say somethin'!<eos> I don't know what to say. I...<eos> I love you, and I wanna be with you, but I also... I get how messed up all this is.
- Heather's gettin' a 'bortion.<eos> - It doesn't make it better.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> - Abby... - I don't have to fuckin' listen to you!<eos> I don't have to talk to you!
I can try.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Look... we're probably not gonna ever see eye to eye on this... but I want to support you.<eos> I care about you.
It's freezin'.<eos> Well, from this spot, I just barely connect to the house Wi-Fi.<eos> Don't tell Dad.<eos> Out here, my fridge and my bathroom are in the same spot, so that's cool.<eos> So... what's up with you?
Yeah.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's why I come out here.<eos> To hang out and get drunk with you.
You wanna talk about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's why I come out here.<eos> To hang out and get drunk with you.<eos> Well, can't get drunk with you, but I can maintain drunk with you.
Only bar within 50 miles.<eos> Yeah, well, I've never said this before, but you are a smart man, Colt.<eos> 'Sup, dipshit?<eos> Shouldn't you be back on the ranch tagging some cows?<eos> Yeah, I care about you too much to leave you here.
I don't get it.<eos> I tried to get them to make me one for Colt, but they wouldn't put "Shithead" on it.<eos> Hey, the storm's settling in.<eos> You're welcome to come in for a drink till it lets up.<eos> If I come in, I'm gonna talk to you.
Why don't I play you another song?<eos> What's your favorite?<eos> "Angel from Montgomery" by John Prine.<eos> Well, you got good taste.<eos> I could talk to you all night long.
Smarter than a lawyer.<eos> Yeah, well, have a good night.<eos> - Goodbye, Jerry.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What's up with you?
Now they won't let me stack anything higher than my waist.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Hey, uh, remember when you used to be a pro football player?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Well, I just came here to get a case of beer and make fun of you, so one down.
I don't know what life looks like without you.<eos> I mean, we get separated.<eos> And now divorced.<eos> But you were always close by.<eos> You're the one I'd come talk to when times got tough.
You got to be kidding me.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Another one? Does it look like I'm kidding?<eos> She's the sun in my sky.<eos> Yes, I'm talking to you.
Well, Joe just needs to know that this type of gift is not okay.<eos> And you're right, and I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> You did take something out of your mom's drawer without asking.<eos> But I'm gonna give you a pass on that one.
Is the party over?<eos> We had an incident.<eos> Your son gave my Bailey a very strange Valentine's gift.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Didn't your father talk to you about this already?
Kendra June Gable, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I already said yes.<eos> So yes, I will still marry you.
I believe Lord Uhtred is hoping you can tell him about Kjartan's fortress.<eos> It is tall.<eos> Tell him that and you're a dead man.<eos> Then let me speak to him.<eos> He will speak to you when he is ready!
Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy I think you might know.<eos> Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?<eos> You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?<eos> I know this white person. You might know 'em?"<eos> Well, he said he went to college with you.
I mean, New York, the food was amazing. And John Legend just played the piano in a room, and I was in that room too.<eos> Yeah, you were.<eos> This is insane!<eos> I mean, nobody's gonna believe me.<eos> I had so much fun with you tonight.
I don't know if that's in the cards, though.<eos> You're cray, okay?<eos> You need to get with that.<eos> Okay, so... we are getting close to the end of the season.<eos> So... wanted to check in with you.
I guess I would just ask myself, who do I feel more strongly about?<eos> Like, when I wake up in the morning, who do I want to spend the day with?<eos> Hmm. That's a nice way to solve the problem.<eos> I will break up with Linda. At once.<eos> So Linda, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
I must break up with Ellen.<eos> And then we found the spreadsheets were in the hot tub the whole time.<eos> I mean, it was the craziest audit I've ever done.<eos> That's an interesting story. Mm-hmm.<eos> - Ellen? - Hmm? There's something I need to talk to you about.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> Have you talked to your parents about Rachel yet?<eos> No.<eos> - They don't know y'all live together?<eos> - No. I feel like all three of them are gonna be mad at you about that.
I turned it off.<eos> Oh, you turned it off, huh?<eos> - Yeah, we're just friends. - Okay.<eos> Well, just be careful, okay?<eos> I'm concerned for you.
Really?<eos> Yeah, you want to go?<eos> - Can I?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I come with you?
"What are you talking about?<eos> You're the one that suggested tapas."<eos> "No, I suggested Thai food."<eos> "Oh, I can't believe this.<eos> I should have never married you. I should have listened to my father."
Get that fucking huggy away from me.<eos> I want kissy, or I want red hearts only.<eos> Ah, come on, man.<eos> Let's just go. It'll be good to see what's up with them.<eos> All right, I'll go with you.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I'm sorry about tonight.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Can I meet you at your apartment?
Look at this.<eos> Yeah, it's nice.<eos> Nice?<eos> I mean, it's amazing.<eos> Come on, what's going on with you?
Yeah, it's nice.<eos> Nice?<eos> I mean, it's amazing.<eos> Come on, what's going on with you?<eos> Dev, what's wrong with you?
It means not hot, not cold.<eos> It's in the middle.<eos> I don't want to be lukewarm.<eos> No.<eos> See? I just want to do this with you.
It's in the middle.<eos> I don't want to be lukewarm.<eos> No.<eos> See? I just want to do this with you.<eos> I want to laugh with you. I want to define random English words.
Um... How are you?<eos> How is everything?<eos> Um, things are good.<eos> They're, uh, really good.<eos> How are, uh, how are things with you?
Three, two...<eos> - Not again.<eos> Well done, Your Highness.<eos> My head feels like it was stomped on by The Colossus of Rhodes.<eos> Yeah, well, Valerian sleeping drugs will do that to you.
And what about your associates?<eos> Are they willing to take that risk, too?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, greed comes at a price.<eos> Are you really gonna pay his? Especially considering what he's about to do to you?
Really?<eos> If that's so true, why are you here all alone?<eos> Alone?<eos> Oh, I'm not alone.<eos> Ahem. Some of you possessions are not very happy with you.
What else?<eos> The future.<eos> Hey, let's take a road trip.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I want to spend all my time with you, travel, see the world before it's too late.
- Why do you have that plate?<eos> - I...<eos> They'll call you a thief too.<eos> No, no, the lady brought it to me yesterday, when she was distraite.<eos> Why anyone would worry over you is a mystery for sure.
Please go away.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You need to walk away right now.<eos> I-I'm sorry, I, uh, can't...<eos> I'm not supposed to talk to you!
I bet she does very well at school.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Hey...<eos> Carrots!<eos> I'm not talking to you!
It was mistake not to kill us.<eos> I want to go here.<eos> To this sea.<eos> But I have to sail along your coastline to get there.<eos> Only if you allow me to come with you.
They call me Egil the Bastard.<eos> But you would like to be Earl?<eos> It's good that we have met, Egil.<eos> We need ambitious men.<eos> I still have a bone to pick with you, Sigurd.
I don't care about Lagertha.<eos> You are now a free woman.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you'll have to be free in order to marry one of us.<eos> I want to talk to you about books, Alfred.
Can it be you have forgotten?<eos> Of course I haven't forgotten.<eos> You saw me, but you did not bother to come and say hello.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to marry you.
I'm trying to be very important.<eos> And I'm almost there.<eos> Believe me.<eos> - I'm already married.<eos> - And when I succeed, become king of Norway, I can cut my hair and I can marry you.
He loved me.<eos> But you should stay here with tanaruz.<eos> You have new responsibilities now.<eos> No.<eos> We are coming with you.
We do.<eos> What about you, Sigurd?<eos> You've been very quiet so far.<eos> I'm sure you have an opinion.<eos> I agree with you, Ivar.
You make me laugh.<eos> Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!
After the incident at the training field you met with members of the team without me.<eos> Yeah, we talked.<eos> But it wasn't a meeting.<eos> Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?<eos> They went to you.
They know about Robin.<eos> Slade:<eos> They don't. Raven, being nice?<eos> And there's nothing scheduled.<eos> They know I'm working with you.
Jaime has a family that loves him.<eos> And, because of the bug, odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.<eos> I think pain is what makes a hero.<eos> It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.<eos> But what about you, chuckles?
Me, I'm having waffles, after you're dead.<eos> By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?<eos> I think you've met.<eos> Hey, team, how's things?<eos> Terra, what did he do to you?
Could there be anything more perfect than you speaking a romance language?<eos> My two favorite things together. [giggling]<eos> Mother plans to send me to finishing school in France.<eos> Really?<eos> Will you take me with you?
Anyone else would've made a show of giving it to me.<eos> You knew I collected buttons.<eos> I told you when you walked me home that time.<eos> It wasn't long after... that you left school.<eos> I was worried about you.
And how is Marilla? Still feisty, I hope?<eos> Dad, what are you doing?<eos> You shouldn't be walking!<eos> My son worries too much.<eos> It seems this young lady has urgent business. With you.
Her best friend forever and ever.<eos> Aunt Josephine never married.<eos> Neither of them did.<eos> They lived with each other their whole lives.<eos> I'd live with you forever if I could, but I know you'll leave me the day you get married to some wealthy and handsome gentleman.
To the horse, Jerry.<eos> Why are you so annoying?<eos> You're a good horse, Burty.<eos> Try to remember that.<eos> Somebody will be very lucky to have you.
Matthew, you know too well the impact of an untimely death.<eos> Anne has suffered so much loss.<eos> She finally belongs.<eos> Here.<eos> With you.
All right.<eos> Hey, listen, we just caught our second homicide for the day.<eos> Guess the Coast Guard just fished a body out of the water.<eos> Do me a favor, would you stay here and make sure these two don't kill each other please?<eos> I'll meet you back at the shop in a little bit.
The crown jewel of Agrabah, freely given.<eos> Remember this, Princess, for this is the moment you truly failed your people.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You vain woman.<eos> I never wanted to marry you.
Oh, it's not being destroyed, just taken beyond mankind's grasp.<eos> What more can you do to me?<eos> You've already taken everything from me.<eos> You have a point there.<eos> I have no more business with you.
Yeah, and when we smoked it, it smelled suspiciously like my balls.<eos> Everything's fine, Marjorie,<eos> I was just too tired to make the meeting.<eos> Yeah, I need a good night's sleep.<eos> Thanks, talk to you tomorrow.
Hey, if we all get captured, that'll end this debate real quick. Let's go!<eos> They're cutting us off!<eos> We've got rocket troopers incoming!<eos> Ezra, I need you guys up top now.<eos> Saw, can I count on you?
I would follow you.<eos> So would I.<eos> And I mean it.<eos> You've come a long way in a very short time.<eos> Where you go from here is up to you.
- Run?<eos> Run where?<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> Um, you... you need a new identity and a new passport.<eos> Your family will come with you too, of course, and then I need to set up an offshore account for you, and that way you can...
What are you doing?<eos> We're doing school.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Come with me.<eos> He wants to see you.
What time is it?<eos> Bell rings in two hours.<eos> There must be at least a dozen men between here and the school.<eos> But thanks to our misspent youth, I can get in and out via the basement, no problem.<eos> When we do this, they are going to come down on you hard.
You can't know that.<eos> I don't feel her any more!<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I want to know why I am like this.<eos> And I don't want to go with you!
The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended Russia's sports drug-testing lab, and the head of the lab resigned.<eos> Grisha, be careful what you tell him now.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> I am just...<eos> They're holding on the phone for you.
I'm very sorry.<eos> I'm sure you have very intelligent people who can explain all this.<eos> Honey, I already spoke to the children.<eos> Grisha, now it's another problem.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Kevin, you're with Adam.<eos> Al, you got Burgess.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's good to be working with you, Detective... or Al.<eos> You too, kid.
We're gonna need that footage.<eos> Don't you need a warrant?<eos> Burgess, you bring the warrant?<eos> I didn't...<eos> How much you got on you?
Let's go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Chin.<eos> Kono's inside.<eos> Actually... I came to talk to you.
What you did for me yesterday, coming all the way down to Mexico, that was above and beyond.<eos> And I think it was a violation of your parole as well.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't have to say anything.<eos> Actually, you know what, I do.<eos> Listen, man... when you and Kono first got together, I was hard on you.
That was nice of you to punch that girl in the face for my sister.<eos> Oh, yeah, you're welcome.<eos> Hey, do you want to go out sometime?<eos> Go out?<eos> With you? Yeah.
I'm proud of you for putting yourself out there.<eos> I should never go on another date. I should just stay away from girls.<eos> Sam, look, you got some stuff to figure out, but you will.<eos> You're a good guy.<eos> You're sensitive, and you're funny, and the woman who ends up with you will be lucky.
Just ignore him.<eos> Hmm. At least he took an interest.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, what's going on with you?
Unbelievable.<eos> I invite you into my home...<eos> You locked us in a room!<eos> I gave you marbles!<eos> All we wanted was to hand out with you!
Had a dorm full of future senators convinced I was an exchange student from Iceland.<eos> Point is I get it.<eos> I'm shockingly progressive for a Lorian.<eos> We get married, I'd still let you speak in public. - I'd make sure that you...<eos> - Jesus, I'm not marrying you.
She hasn't threatened anyone else.<eos> That's because she's in another realm... only able to break free long enough to steal other children before it pulls her back in.<eos> But if she should break free for good...<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> I handled you.
Oh, you really have sunk to a new low.<eos> If the jewels aren't enough, I do have... one more thing I could offer.<eos> Oh, and what's that?<eos> Well, I hear tell that you haven't had a vessel for some time... not since you lost the Jolly Roger in Arendelle.<eos> I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
So, what next?<eos> Hook just walks in?<eos> Next, you must arrange the ingredients.<eos> Now the tear.<eos> This is about you... your love, Emma.
You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> I'm the one who took you in, gave you a home, taught you, fed you, shared with you everything that I had!
Don't come any closer!<eos> Not any closer!<eos> D'Andre, put down the gun.<eos> Please, just stop.<eos> Is Irvin here with you?
What do I need to do to prove it to you?<eos> Just talk to me.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> How are you really doing?<eos> You know, with everything that happened to you?
Nah, you would've still put that gun down.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know all that good we've done here would've been torn up.<eos> Yeah, you would've never let that happen.<eos> Great working with you, Sam.
Because I've done that before and it leads nowhere.<eos> Juan-Luis.<eos> Cómo Te Va?<eos> I'm Jay Whitman.<eos> Secretary McCord sent me to talk to you.
I can't help you because I couldn't find any information in the DHS phone logs.<eos> Well, maybe our witness lied.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I'm gonna show you something.<eos> You don't get to take it with you, you can't take a picture...
We can't double-cross them.<eos> So, what, we put Jesse James in jail?<eos> Is that your big plan?<eos> He can't hurt anyone else if he's dead, like he's supposed to be.<eos> What is with you?
I'm so scared something's happened to her.<eos> What is wrong with all you people?<eos> Mom, I'm over here.<eos> Lindsey.<eos> I was so worried about you.
We're going home right now.<eos> No, mother.<eos> Cyndi needs me.<eos> I have to be here for her.<eos> What have these people done to you?
You see, we're the Librarians.<eos> What didn't you say so?<eos> Please come join us.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> That's it? Why does that always work for you?
Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really do look different, Gibbons.<eos> Did you lose weight?<eos> Augustus always had such, well, not exactly nice things to say about you.
Just happened to know I spoke English.<eos> Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.
They're ghosts, in a day and age where that kind of thing is almost impossible.<eos> Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.
Okay, you get that I don't work for suits.<eos> What makes you think I'm gonna want to ruin all their fun?<eos> Well, if you won't do it for me, do it for Gibbons.<eos> Your country needs you, Mr. Cage.<eos> The Triple-X program needs you.
I'm gonna say something else.<eos> Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.<eos> Oh. Smile!<eos> Hey, just something for you to think about.<eos> Me to you.
I just took my pills.<eos> You know what, you can have grandma's potatoes.<eos> I don't want hers.<eos> Tyler, knock it off.<eos> Okay, egg white omelet for you.
You can get away.<eos> If they asked me, I won't know anything.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> As long as my son is in that car... I will not stop.<eos> Wherever you go... I will be right behind you.
Oh, God.<eos> Mitch, this is for you.<eos> Wait.<eos> No, Victoria.<eos> I have something very special planned for you, for everyone.
What you got in the cooler?<eos> Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?<eos> You mean this?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is actually for you.
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...
Please.<eos> I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice certain resemblances between you you and my wife.
He needs me.<eos> - I can help him.<eos> - And yet he has still said nothing.<eos> It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here to take care of Jakob and and to take care of you.
You don't have to leave.<eos> I want you to stay.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - No, Jakob needs you.
I devoted my life to the study of genetics, and I'm well practiced in the study of animal breeding.<eos> I'm an expert in that field.<eos> And I think I know more than anyone.<eos> Even more than you.<eos> Herr Göring must respect you very much.
It's pig meat.<eos> I'll bring more when I can.<eos> I can get you out.<eos> People know your books.<eos> They will take care of you.
I wasn't expecting you today.<eos> A good surprise, I hope.<eos> Of course.<eos> Always a good surprise.<eos> I have another surprise for you.
Times are very hard.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You have always been so good to me, Miss.<eos> You and your husband.<eos> Now, I'll be good to you.
Just the opposite.<eos> I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.<eos> I... I brought this for Claire.<eos> I thought she might be interested in her family tree, and there's photos.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't want you or your book.
What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys.<eos> All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
Me and my partner got the call.<eos> You did?<eos> Anyway, I was just looking out for a fellow officer.<eos> You should put some ice on that. Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'll get some for you, too.
Get back! Get back!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Stanley Rubino, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Really sorry.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Just drop me wherever suits you.
I need to sleep.<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> El rancho?<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> It's for you.
Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton... is: Who exactly are you?<eos> In theory, I know all about you.
Yeah.<eos> Bad.. bad.. gotta..<eos> You see Evil is the shadow that exists just outside our world... continuously searching for a way to come in... for a way to become flesh and blood.<eos> Either.. we wait for that day to arrive... or we can fight it on our own terms.<eos> Which brings me to you.
The red lights spin around in a circle.<eos> You won't be able to miss it.<eos> Where do I wait?<eos> The guest lounge.<eos> We're ready for you now.
He's been neutered.<eos> All the papers are in the proper order.<eos> You take your cut?<eos> No.<eos> Not from you.
If we can find this artist, then we can find our perp.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> Eh, it's a tragedy.<eos> FBI.<eos> Behind you. Six o'clock.
It would pain him greatly to know what I have done.<eos> He was a proud man.<eos> He would never stoop to begging, as I have.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Your father would be very proud of you.
And remember, it takes courage to ask for help.<eos> The generosity you have shown my country has been overwhelming, and it will certainly help the healing process, but sadly, it's still not enough.<eos> Did you ever think that 2.5 billion dollarswouldnotbeenough?<eos> Well, that's why I'm here.<eos> I pledge to you, and your country, all of my talents.
Well... family heirloom.<eos> It's very dear to me, actually.<eos> It serves as a reminder, of a time long ago, when the world was very different. Less complicated. When good men banded together to fight for what was right.<eos> It motivates me to this day.<eos> It brought me here, to you.
I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.<eos> I almost gave it to him.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's pathetic, just like the man I took it from.<eos> You've kept it all these years, it must mean something to you.
All right.<eos> Get on with it. Time's a-wasting.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Simon templar, you're the most peculiar thief I know.<eos> Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.
Have you got my money yet?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Just tell me what I gotta do.<eos> Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.<eos> How can I trust you?
Which authorizes the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects.<eos> You see, we don't like to rush into anything without the facts.<eos> Facts that could take a long time to unearth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And as for you, Mr. temp...
- Yeah, but they won't help.<eos> Working with the Americans is very dangerous.<eos> How can you guarantee their safety?<eos> Well, they won't be seen collaborating with us.<eos> Everything goes through you.
Nobody has to know.<eos> Look, it's your terms, okay?<eos> You bring us the workers, we give the water at the pumping station.<eos> And look, we're gonna pay them in cash.<eos> And you.
- You not fucking notice?<eos> - Of course, of course.<eos> Diminished responsibility.<eos> If that Cunt in the original trial had put on a proper defense of diminished responsibility, I could've walked out that door a free man.<eos> I think, for you, that the best policy...
"Miguel Kaba."<eos> I got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I want you to wait here.<eos> A man is going to come with me.<eos> If you don't ask any questions I'm gonna give you another $100.
- Okay.<eos> - I did not kill that girl!<eos> It was an accident!<eos> And my wife and my son are out there!<eos> - Hey, Kevin, I believe you.
If you don't, you're never gonna catch me.<eos> We called Jorge's number, whoever picked up got spooked.<eos> The signal disappeared.<eos> If it was Jorge then he's probably on his way off the island for good.<eos> Kevin, I believe you, but you're wanted for murder.
I have to watch him for my damn sister while she goes to school to learn how to clean teeth, and it's against the law for me to take him to the track.<eos> And I can't push him off the roof.<eos> You're in a real pickle.<eos> - Well, how about that.<eos> I thought he'd be afraid of you.
What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?<eos> - You think that I...?<eos> - He was your competition, right?<eos> You got somebody watching over you.
Your husband was the writer I always measured myself against.<eos> And I always came up short.<eos> Well... won me over with a card.<eos> I'm afraid I wasn't the greatest prize.<eos> Well, he talked about you.
Well, he talked about you.<eos> A lot.<eos> I pushed him around.<eos> I didn't kill him, though.<eos> I don't recognize you.
Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Detective Miller. He works for me on the side.<eos> I thought Styvesan worked for you.
Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.<eos> So I write the card for her and I give it to you.
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $50,000.<eos> How did you find me, huh?<eos> 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!<eos> The people after you, they're on my ass now!
You did your job.<eos> Fellas.<eos> Shit.<eos> Knock yourselves out.<eos> I'll tell you what. Eight grand... I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires... mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information... to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she's impure.
What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> We need to intervene.<eos> Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.
You actually believe me?<eos> I believe people have agendas.<eos> This crazy world, I swear.<eos> I'll go somewhere they'll never, ever find me or little Andy or Jenny.<eos> - Godspeed to you, Mrs....
MacBook Pro.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.<eos> Are you trying to blackmail me?<eos> Want me to lie for you or not?
You nodding at me?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> That nod was not for you.
- Gandhiji?<eos> It won't work<eos> Nope<eos> Why don't you come tomorrow?<eos> I'll make real glasses for you.
So?<eos> We'll work for Jairaj Seth<eos> He sells imported liquor<eos> It's difficult, Amit<eos> But I'll give it one last try for you
Not aces<eos> We're mere servants<eos> My tiger's not in the mood<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Seth, I've been working for years under you
Listen up<eos> If I wanted to take orders, I wouldn't have set out to start a business<eos> Take the money and scoot.<eos> Move it<eos> Musa sent it for you
Actress Sridevi<eos> Why do you always beat about the bush?<eos> I can't help it.<eos> When you smile, it strikes me dumb!<eos> And I just feel like watching you!
- Devji.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Tea time<eos> "Your beauty, mesmerizing"<eos> "The entire neighborhood is crazy for you"
Climb up and check<eos> Thanks for the help<eos> I had heard that Damla Seth rules the seas, not the government<eos> I witnessed it today.<eos> I've heard lots about you, too
No more bulldozers<eos> Just cameras flashing<eos> Officers posed for the cameras and made the front pages of newspapers with 'seized' liquor<eos> The press, the police, the government, all were a satisfied lot<eos> Raees has sent shirts for you
There was one man who could tilt the balance<eos> Salaam, Pasha bhai.<eos> The leader of the opposition<eos> Raees wants to lend color to your life<eos> He sends a color TV for you.
So many phones!<eos> Have you changed your business?<eos> Are you selling phones now?<eos> I'm not changing business.<eos> These are for you
To heck with Sadiq!<eos> Sadiq, did you hear...?<eos> Look at me<eos> What did you say?<eos> 'I did this for you, I did that for you'
Ass!<eos> Freaking Four-eyes!<eos> Scared you, didn't I?<eos> A bit<eos> I pine for you Don't torment me more, O cruel one
A bit<eos> I pine for you Don't torment me more, O cruel one<eos> O cruel one<eos> I'm drunk in your love Don't intoxicate me more, O cruel one O cruel one<eos> Those eyes, mesmerizing Your words, alluring I fall head over heels for you a hundred times over
Fear?<eos> She was a terror!<eos> Don't mention it to her now.<eos> We're here to give her the invite<eos> She won't hit you for that
'So what if five laborers die? '<eos> 'You will employ twenty-five more' 'to fill your coffers'<eos> - Bhimani Seth.<eos> - What is it?<eos> The laborers toiled for you for years.
Isn't it beautiful?<eos> It's really very beautiful<eos> Why did you have to do this?<eos> It's not a gift, son<eos> It's our blessings to you
He is a constant pain in my neck<eos> He's a police officer, not a pawn I can play around with<eos> He arrested Damla<eos> Majmudar has started a fire in Kutch<eos> The flames could torch me and eventually reach you
Order hundred, sir.<eos> Involuntarily, Raees pulled me closer to him<eos> From this spot, I could hear his very heartbeat<eos> From this point to that,<eos> Twenty acres of land has been transferred to you
Really?<eos> Only 22,000?<eos> Darn it!<eos> Freaking duffer!<eos> Business meant life to you
'Coalition politics completely wipes out Raees'<eos> I told you to get used to tea at the cop station<eos> Get ready to contest the elections<eos> Raees, politics is not meant for us.<eos> I'm arranging bail for you
Make sure you don't give me an opportunity<eos> Never.<eos> I never gave you one<eos> Hang on, SP<eos> If you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you
Never.<eos> I never gave you one<eos> Hang on, SP<eos> If you say, here, in Our World, I'll book an apartment for you<eos> I'll book a place for you in my world
Right now!<eos> You know that it's the only safest place for them<eos> - And you?<eos> - You know that, Sadiq<eos> I'm not going anywhere without you.
Enough of the adoration!<eos> Let's go<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Take him away<eos> When you knew how this was going to end for you, why did you return?
But after the restraining order was up, you tried to resume contact.<eos> You tell me, Ms. Banks, after all this why would you wanna go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?<eos> No.<eos> We downloaded the contents of Mr. Vargas' phone.<eos> I have almost 50 pages of Facebook messages between you and Mr. Vargas.
I promise.<eos> I love you, Julia.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Leave that clear for the ME.<eos> And we'll do everything we can for you.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.<eos> - Son.<eos> - Son! Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Thank you very much for coming.<eos> We've heard a great deal about you.
Um... yeah, is there any way we could maybe just, you know, bend the rules a little bit on this just once?<eos> Oh no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But here's what I can do.<eos> Fill this out for you.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.<eos> Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> You can't stop him..<eos> She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth..will die.<eos> And we need you? Because you were so successful in stopping her last time.
Go have some fun.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> Colonel Packard!<eos> There's a phone call for you.
Fire at will!<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> - Pull out now! Pull out!<eos> - I don't take orders from you!
They never smile.<eos> Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.
- Not our fight.<eos> - Whose side are you on, Captain?<eos> Okay, Colonel.<eos> You'll find your Sea Stallion three klicks up that ridge.<eos> Now, I'm gonna take these civilians back to the boat, and we'll wait for you there.
Yes, but I'm very busy at the moment. I have to drink a cup of tea.<eos> This cup of tea... - Code?<eos> - It's a cup of tea.<eos> Because you might prefer some coffee.<eos> You're my last hope.
Those markings, do you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left hand side, so you weren't driving. You were in the passenger seat.<eos> I came in a taxi.<eos> There is no taxi waiting in the street outside. That's what I checked when I went to the window.<eos> And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one, and look at you.
- Mrs Hudson.<eos> Do you have any idea what speed you were going at?<eos> Of course, not.<eos> I was on the phone.<eos> - It's for you, by the way.
- It'll have to be a hug.<eos> - I know.<eos> Sherlock.<eos> Sherlock. What can I say?<eos> Thanks to you, we're, we're everywhere.
Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ward 73.<eos> Dr Watson...<eos> It's for you.
Sir.<eos> I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side, and frankly, this is embarrassing.<eos> Oh. Doing a cavity search?<eos> The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.<eos> But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.<eos> I'm only trying to help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.<eos> I don't trust you.
- I remember Redbeard.<eos> - Do you, now?<eos> Tell me what I don't know.<eos> Touch the glass.<eos> I put my trust in you. My implicit trust, as governor of this institute.
I was the luckiest kid ever.<eos> My parents even had cool jobs.<eos> They worked for the biggest pet company in the world... Puppy Co.<eos> Yes, Mr. Francis'?<eos> Puppy Co needs you.
Okay, guys, check the loading dock.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, you can go.<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.
Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You're hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> And you wanna know what?<eos> We've been shouldering East Texas for you.
Panfried 'em right out there by the river.<eos> I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.<eos> Mighty good talking to you, Doc.<eos> I'll give your good wishes to Harry.<eos> Whatever this is about, well, I hope it turns out all right for you.
I want a friend in the glove compartment...<eos> One a.m. tonight.<eos> Smooth and safe.<eos> And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs.<eos> I'm not interested in you.
Deputy Hawk,<eos> Margaret Lanterman's on line one.<eos> It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you?
It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you?<eos> Hawk.<eos> My log has a message for you.
There's been a mistake.<eos> All right?<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
But you have to promise me something.<eos> You'll come back and try your luck with us again... soon, anytime... day or night.<eos> Or night.<eos> That's right.<eos> We're watching you,
Where have you been all these years?<eos> Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague<eos> Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.
Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.<eos> I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.
I was on my way to present it to you.<eos> I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident.<eos> Yes, Coop.<eos> This is how and why we found you.<eos> I need to be debriefed by you, Gordon.
He likes...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, officer.<eos> Come on in. Ma'am?<eos> There's an envelope here for you.
I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mighty good talking to you, Doc.<eos> I'll give your good wishes to Harry.<eos> Whatever this is about, well, I hope it turns out all right for you.
Thank you, Tammy.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Patched in through the office, it's a Colonel Davis for you at the Pentagon.
It's usually about money, Bushnell.<eos> Pure and simple.<eos> Nobody needs more reason than that.<eos> So what's his background?<eos> How long has he been with you?
- Well, children can be cruel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great to see you, Bruce.<eos> - Nice to see you, sir.<eos> - So, I had a question for you, sir.
So, what do you say, Commish?<eos> Will you work with me?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
What kind of trade?<eos> If you sign these... then... I will leave you this.<eos> 000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.
I understand.<eos> just one last favor.<eos> What?<eos> Deliver these to Joy Meachum.<eos> Someone's here to see you.
I don't want a hospital.<eos> - Mr. Radovan...<eos> - I... I want my daughter.<eos> Danny's taking care of that.<eos> Right now, we need to take care of you.
I hurt it.<eos> Looks like it.<eos> Car door.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> Why don't you have a seat? We'll be with you as soon as we can.
It's too late.<eos> It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.
I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.<eos> It would be my privilege to teach you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.
I helped them all.<eos> When they were beaten up and bleeding and looking for help, they came to me.<eos> But where do they all end up?<eos> Ruined.<eos> And the only thing they have in common is you.
- Mr. Meachum, you didn't...<eos> - Oh, please... call me Harold.<eos> Now, I think...<eos> I think I'm gonna have this organic cornflakes one.<eos> In all the time I've worked for you, I don't think I've ever seen you eat any dairy or sugar.
Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> A way out.<eos> A return to public life for you.
But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.
If he's angry, he'll come back.<eos> Just give him time.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> You need something to eat.<eos> Come on, let us look after you.
You mean Upavase (Fasting)?<eos> Au revoid (Goodbye).<eos> Upavase (Fasting).<eos> Bon appetit (Enjoy your meal).<eos> So, does he always cook like this for you?
Jones.<eos> Uncle Jack!<eos> Skip uncle, just call me Jack.<eos> Jack.<eos> Look at you.
May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?<eos> I'm Kyra.<eos> It's a very pretty name.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look at you.
Hey, can you hear it?<eos> The alpha wolf is calling his mates.<eos> Where?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Right behind you.
Got it?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'll do it my own way.<eos> OK.<eos> After you.
Look!<eos> What?<eos> Diamond of Magadha is to be auctioned in Dubai next week.<eos> Ashmita forwarded that to me.<eos> Professor, she left you a message.
Hit this low life!<eos> My hand...<eos> Go!<eos> Don't hit me!<eos> For you!
My hand...<eos> Go!<eos> Don't hit me!<eos> For you!<eos> For you!
Take it!<eos> Run!<eos> - Give me that!<eos> - Don't hit me!<eos> For you.
No.<eos> I'm the younger sister.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Jack, we need you...
How are you going to get down there with that many hyenas?<eos> I think these are all she-hyenas.<eos> The females should love... tender fresh meat. [Also Chinese slang for "handsome young men"]<eos> Watch out!<eos> Xiaoguang, behind you...
The females should love... tender fresh meat. [Also Chinese slang for "handsome young men"]<eos> Watch out!<eos> Xiaoguang, behind you...<eos> in front of you!<eos> This's for you.
Guys...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Can you help me down?<eos> Let me figure it out.<eos> We'll come back to you.
Mom, are you okay?<eos> Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine.<eos> I still have one last wish granted to me.<eos> And I'm willing to make a deal.<eos> I'll agree to wish for you to have unlimited wishes, giving you complete control over the box.
I know damn well what is happening here.<eos> I know too much.<eos> And next, they'll come after my family.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
- How do you know that?<eos> - I just do. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time... I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.
Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.<eos> Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The more I tell you, the more danger I put you in.
He'd sit at the piano sometimes, but he wouldn't play.<eos> Not like he used to.<eos> He didn't do anything like he used to.<eos> I missed him.<eos> Long before my mom came to you.
Mae Holland!<eos> Well, hi, Mae, how are you?<eos> - Terrified.<eos> - Mm. Don't be nervous.<eos> Easy for you to say.
"My kid."<eos> Did you notice that you just said "my kid"?<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, I...<eos> I've been thinking lately that maybe I want to start a family.<eos> What exactly is going on between you and Mickey right now?
Now he's free of the Marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.<eos> He was already back.<eos> Oh, he came back for love, not for you.
Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die. Or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> For how long?<eos> And how much blood?<eos> You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.
He was a good dog.<eos> I have enjoyed his company.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Mr. Wick?<eos> If you would be so inclined.
I think you guys should head out back.<eos> We've had enough fireworks for the day.<eos> Hell of a day.<eos> How many more days of this do we have?<eos> For you, 21.
If I don't have proof this wasn't arson, we're done.<eos> Hello, Mr. bussey.<eos> You don't seem surprised to see me.<eos> Nope.<eos> Darling, you have someone very powerful working against you.
I am so underfunded and understaffed.<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> - Yeah. I was told that some of the horses were burned alive, and one of the inmates is a convicted arsonist.<eos> The horses are fine. They're right over there in that corral.<eos> I believe you, Ms. Davis, but unfortunately some folks above my pay grade feel that these horses are unsafe.
- Mm-hm, it's a good offer.<eos> You're a real hero.<eos> Is there a burr in your saddle, cowboy?<eos> Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.
- Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Because we're a team.<eos> Listen, her offer's only good if I discredit the program, the guys and you.
Good luck with your continued work.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You've got a great horse here in old buster.<eos> He'll do it for you.
Thank you.<eos> Don't let this place burn down without me.<eos> No chance, brother.<eos> Hey, Jon.<eos> They're ready for you now, Ms. Stella.
Come with me.<eos> There's something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here, i was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> After you.
I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC.<eos> This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre.<eos> I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening.<eos> If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, in any way, we will stop.<eos> Everyone will be led by you.
Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate.<eos> We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.<eos> I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.
I'm at Axehampton House. We have a possible crime scene.<eos> Sorry. Sorry. It's been one of those days.<eos> Who am I kidding? It's always one of those days.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's talk about you.
Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.<eos> You've got something special to offer, Beth.<eos> We need you.
Can we talk in private?<eos> One of your staff members. Trish Winterman... she won't be in for a while.<eos> Erm...<eos> Personal reasons.<eos> Why am I hearing this from you?
You've uprooted that little girl and brought her here for one reason only.<eos> To do harm to your mother.<eos> You blamed her for your sister.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And Mary to you is just a pawn in all this.
Wait for me to die?<eos> I know Diane was hard.<eos> I know she was angry.<eos> But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.<eos> She needs you now.
We have run out of time.<eos> As soon as the Kaiser sees the newest weapon... he will not sign the armistice.<eos> - But without my notebook...<eos> - We will get your book!<eos> It is you that I believe in, not it.
I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, it come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
Yep, that's not gonna work.<eos> Please put the sword down, Diana.<eos> Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.
There are shortages of food... meds and ammunition.<eos> Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives.<eos> One attack and the world could be ours.<eos> As we speak, my chemistry...<eos> We stand against you and your... witch.
We stand against you and your... witch.<eos> Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now... this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.
Yeah.<eos> I put a lot of work into getting you here today.<eos> Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?<eos> I want you to work for me.<eos> Work for you?
Letty. I wanted to thank you.<eos> No need.<eos> Well... Cipher's still on the loose.<eos> There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon. Thanks to you guys.<eos> So, I got you a party favor.
Oh, oh, wow, okay, uh great, that was a lot easier than I thought it would be.<eos> Thank you, uh, gracias.<eos> Oh, he spit that pit on your floor.<eos> Uh, you know what that is legitimately all I needed to know, so all right, I'm gonna let you keep that and thank you so much for your time.<eos> You can actually have the beer, that's for you, my tip.
No, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang.<eos> For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.
You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.<eos> I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> James...<eos> You could have written to your father just once.<eos> In the end, he was calling for you.
Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.
You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.
I was rescued by an African.<eos> Who saved me, and he cured me,<eos> and he showed me to myself.<eos> The things I did in Africa make your transactions look paltry.<eos> I witnessed and participated in darkness that you cannot conceive.
From miss Delaney.<eos> Robert: Mr. cholmondeley!<eos> Mr. cholmondeley.<eos> Mr. cholmondeley.<eos> I have a message for you, sir.
People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.
Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.
I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.
We are an angry nation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.<eos> Post for you, madam.
Really.<eos> I don't know why I'm even thinking about furniture.<eos> Andy and I hardly ever get home.<eos> What's up, lucy?<eos> Margaret lanterman for you on line two, hawk.
Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie,<eos> Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work Has exposed a ring of organized crime<eos> Flowing through this office. The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you,<eos> Also, thanks to you, we now know that The mitchum brothers' case was not arson But a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,
There you go, brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.
Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh.<eos> This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day,
I like it on the rocks.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age.<eos> Diane, we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose.<eos> Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau, we'd like to deputize you.
Yes, sir.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Been meaning to stop by.<eos> Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.
How are you?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> What can I do for you?
I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Anthony... Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did?<eos> Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.
He did?<eos> Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.<eos> Dougie even implicated himself.<eos> And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.<eos> I trusted you, Anthony.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.
- Do you really like it?<eos> It... it's magnificent.<eos> And those drapes are completely silent.<eos> This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.<eos> Thanks to you, I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!
Uh, it's gonna sound strange.<eos> Something's been found, something Deputy Chief Hawk found.<eos> Missing pages from a certain Laura Palmer's diary that could indicate two Coopers.<eos> I don't know any more than this, but, uh, I-I just thought you should know it.<eos> Uh, maybe it means something to you.
Uh, maybe it means something to you.<eos> Thank you very much, Frank.<eos> Although I can't comment on this information, I want you to know I really appreciate it.<eos> All right, Director Cole, uh, I understand.<eos> And all the best to you and all the best to Harry.
I hate her, so...<eos> I haven't talked to her in years.<eos> Tammy, get the Las Vegas office on the line.<eos> Las Vegas office, please.<eos> Uh, I have Director Gordon Cole on the line for you, sir.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.<eos> I'm not sure we ever will.<eos> Kandahar's the same, of course.<eos> Can I be completely frank with you, sir?<eos> If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
And... we got people here from Spain and Italy and...<eos> - You know, places like that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Have you voted?<eos> - I wanted to report to you first.
Sorry.<eos> No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.<eos> And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
You both look beautiful.<eos> Really.<eos> Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there, I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.<eos> Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.<eos> He's been doing that profile piece on you.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
Your people.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.<eos> But I am behaving like a leader.<eos> I'm unavailable.<eos> I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
Yes, and I was thinking maybe it's time we paint.<eos> We haven't redone the exterior of the motel in a few years now, and that hardware store just reopened.<eos> I wish I could go down to the village with you and look.<eos> I know, Mother.<eos> I know it's hard for you always having to stay here in the house.
This feels deep enough.<eos> Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear it. - I'm trying.<eos> - Norman, hurry.<eos> Just chuck it in the water! Make it shut up.<eos> An inmate at the Bend Correctional Facility is attempting to contact you.
The number on the bottom doesn't work anymore but the top one is good.<eos> Call any time, okay?<eos> You want a drink?<eos> The bar here's incredible.<eos> Well, I don't have to tell you.
No!<eos> You take it easy.<eos> Or I'll shoot you!<eos> You're not shooting anybody.<eos> I'll shoot you in the Lorax!
If anyone's in need of self-reflection, David, that'd be you.<eos> I bet Bill Jr. would beg to differ.<eos> Our guest tonight is Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the American Atheist who removed the Bible from public schools.<eos> She's at the university for a speaking engagement.<eos> O'Hair, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Yeah, I wanna ask Mrs. Murray...<eos> - Uh, Murray O'Hair.<eos> How can you look at yourself in the mirror every day?<eos> Only a godless bitch like you would go to court to stop prayer.<eos> Thanks to you, this country's on its way to hell in a handbasket.
Queen Mother!<eos> Sava-gami!<eos> Bhalla?<eos> Have you everthought... of killing your mother?<eos> I wanted to do so instead of nursing only you when you were a newborn... she also nursed thatjackass.
The way I wielded a sword when I was your age... you know chaste maidens will be dumbfounded?<eos> Those are bygone days.<eos> Pindari tribe. They plunder the whole kingdom. And then drowning people is their pastime<eos> I got wild elephantsjust for you to play with from the Dark Kingdom.<eos> On the banks of the river Mayanitha... is the Spring palace I am building for you.
Pindari tribe. They plunder the whole kingdom. And then drowning people is their pastime<eos> I got wild elephantsjust for you to play with from the Dark Kingdom.<eos> On the banks of the river Mayanitha... is the Spring palace I am building for you.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I had this bow made for you to kill a target 1000 feet away.
Does it mean you can kill?<eos> That too, kill me?<eos> !<eos> Wretched fellow!<eos> How well l took care of you in your childhood?
I did it.<eos> Monitor lizard's tight grip.<eos> 'Bull's blow'<eos> 'Eagle's keen eyes' 'Elephant's might' Tiger's body Panther's speed.<eos> 'Lion's magnificence' I can see the entire jungle in you, my lord.
'Bull's blow'<eos> 'Eagle's keen eyes' 'Elephant's might' Tiger's body Panther's speed.<eos> 'Lion's magnificence' I can see the entire jungle in you, my lord.<eos> - My lord.<eos> - l like you 'l shall teach you also to wield the sword'
- l hate flattery.<eos> - l know only too well.<eos> Devasena, we must preserve these arrows lt will be a lesson of faith to disciples of archery.<eos> What a vision-ary!<eos> I had my own doubts the 1st day I set my eyes on you. Your acting skill. And his extra meekness.
Son of Queen Mother Sivagami Devi.<eos> Bravest of braves, achieved the impossible by defeating the invincible Kalakeyas.<eos> Amarendra Baahubali.<eos> Affection between kith and kin will do. Why do we need respect?<eos> Queen Mother asked for Devasena's hand for you?
"Like your veena's melody boundless make me forever your precious princess"<eos> "ln a swan sailboat in tranquility when your breath falls on me"<eos> "l, Devasena, am reveling in this love-ly heavenly feeling."<eos> Do not worry about anything, Your Highness.<eos> Our Queen mother will take care of you as her own daughter.
You killed your mother when you entered this world.<eos> And she nursed you Was that wrong?<eos> 'She shared the fame and fortune of her son equally with you'<eos> 'Was that a crime? '<eos> She was happy to make you the crown prince.
'So your mother's promise has no value or respect? '<eos> No need.<eos> The pearls of wisdom you spoke now... have fallen on deaf ears.<eos> Amarendra Baahubali...!<eos> You have 2 choices laid before you.
When I have given you pride of place... why did you prefer that lowlife Baahubali to me?<eos> Bhalla.<eos> Now you are the king.<eos> Order Baahubali to be killed.<eos> No one can oppose you.
The sun cannot rise in the west, Bhalla.<eos> The sun will never rise in the west. But I shall bury it in the east.<eos> Sivagami, you nursed a snake and nurtured it on your lap lt is now baring its fangs and spewing venom ln another few days it will bite you.<eos> You never understand what I say.<eos> Team drc I am the cause for your mother and you drifting apart
After the umbilical cord is cut for the newborn according to our custom... he will be handed over to his grandfather.<eos> To be blessed to see 1000 full moons.<eos> Both our fathers are no more.<eos> Will you do us the honor, Kattappa?<eos> For a slave who has no right to even stand near you... you have elevated me to a father's position
Baahubali is very innocent.<eos> He will never believe this evil side of his older brother I can see only one way out.<eos> Please tell me.<eos> That is also only in your hands ln my hands?<eos> Palvaldeva should be killed by you!
Kattappa!<eos> You blundered, Sivagami!<eos> A grave mistake indeed.<eos> You did not understand Baahubali's true nature.<eos> You thought he was opposing you.
Stoked a fire.<eos> But running off like he did is a blood crime,<eos> Mistress-New-Mistress.<eos> Running off is a blood crime. Understand?<eos> Mistress never spoke of you.
Don't be frightened.<eos> No one deserves that fate.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.
You're the worst human being I've ever met.<eos> What am I even doing here?<eos> You obviously hate me and now you want me to, what?<eos> Eat candy apples with you?<eos> Or am I supposed to trail behind you like some kind of pet?
Dorothy's reunion with the soldier.<eos> Did it reveal anything new?<eos> You knew it wouldn't.<eos> Yet you let her see him anyway.<eos> What sway does she have over you?
Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.
He was a smart man, a kind man.<eos> He died in the accident that brought us here.<eos> I'm sorry, Dorothy.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I don't trust you.
He died in the accident that brought us here.<eos> I'm sorry, Dorothy.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> Look at you.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm not your enemy.<eos> I'm trying to save Oz from them.<eos> Call your men off and tell them to surrender, or I swear to God, I will shoot you with your own gun.
It's very sharp.<eos> Your King Edward VII was smitten by this beauty.<eos> I see.<eos> But Your Majesty, just for my curiosity, how much is this sword worth?<eos> Let's just say that if I send this to the Indian National Army, then Boss's army can get whatever they need to free India from you.
I can have you arrested for this.<eos> C'mon, David please"<eos> Excuse me, that's Major General Harding to you.<eos> And what are you smiling at, you moron?<eos> If you had any sense, you wouldn't have shot him and we could've caught the mole.
Well, you can ride a motorcycle.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> Yes, ma'am, like a motherfucker.<eos> Okay. I'mma level with you, Jon.<eos> - I like you.
Unless they were part of your crew.<eos> I can't imagine anyone trusting you with their life. Oh...<eos> Wait, your partner.<eos> He did just before he got gunned down in front of you.<eos> Oh, so, you know something about me. I know something about you.
And lately, it doesn't always seem that she's happy.<eos> And that... that terrifies me.<eos> From the very beginning, like when we first met, I've always... worried that she would just go through me. You know, like that...<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> By "go through you"?
What did he say, his words exactly?<eos> That he was afraid of me, um... going through him.<eos> Yeah, so I'm...<eos> I suppose I'm just worried that he's gonna take it as a rejection.<eos> You were working when he first met you and when he fell in love with you, right?
It's as if we turn each other on by rage.<eos> And that's a problem, I think.<eos> Do you think that's a problem?<eos> Well, I'm encouraged that you at least think of it as lovemaking. Because sex isn't always that.<eos> Does the sex you have with Perry ever strike you as violent?
He hurts you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I... no, I didn't... I mean, I didn't... I didn't say that.<eos> He's...<eos> I mean... I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.
Heads.<eos> Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.
I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.<eos> You're a little creepy, and you're forward and familiar, and I don't like it.<eos> I don't like you.
Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.
You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well,<eos> I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone for fun or profit.<eos> I'll work for you up to which point you start to piss me off, and then I'm gone.
- Have you got a guy in New Zealand?<eos> - Why?<eos> What did you hear?<eos> Nothing, just that you're a loner and you don't date.<eos> Good for you.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> You know all TSA issues should be brought up with your authorizing officer.<eos> Yes, ma'am, but this is not TSA business.<eos> Okay, don't call me "ma'am." Otherwise we're not gonna get along.<eos> How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?
The transplantation.<eos> Well, partial, actually.<eos> The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone, not completely.<eos> A sliver of you will still be in there, somewhere, limited consciousness.
Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart.<eos> They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.
The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you...
I've told you.<eos> He was... He was just...<eos> He's all right.<eos> He was struggling a little bit in the water.<eos> I wanted to make sure he got back to you.
Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming.<eos> I just want you to have an ally.<eos> Two allies.<eos> Count me in as well.<eos> So, just to be clear, we should smile at you in the hallway too?
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.<eos> It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?<eos> Yes, Clay.<eos> How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker?
Not what happens... but what you decide to do about it.<eos> Please, my wife.<eos> I was on the phone with my wife.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Sir, stay calm. We're gonna take care of you.
He misses her very much.<eos> That's nice.<eos> He seems like a good kid.<eos> He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?
He's a very good kid, yeah.<eos> Tell me, how much is his life worth to you?<eos> Mrs. Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having?<eos> My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.<eos> Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you... so you get to decide.
We brought you into our confidence.<eos> Why did you break it?<eos> Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.<eos> And what plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?<eos> We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you, to join us in fighting the Saviors, fighting for freedom for all of us.
Let me give you some advice.<eos> It's gonna be dark soon.<eos> Don't wander around out here on your own.<eos> You'll get yourself killed.<eos> Same goes for you, too, right?
I like waiting to hear bad news less.<eos> We got a little problem that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.<eos> Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.<eos> We have to cut and burn everything before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.<eos> I know the royal garden is important to you.
Um... thank you for this.<eos> I'm still thinking about it.<eos> "To injure an opponent is to injure oneself."<eos> Get injured no matter what.<eos> I got something for you -- for the new place.
If they need anything else, please... Just um, send me the bill?<eos> Emma Gardner.<eos> My condolences.<eos> I was your father's doctor.<eos> He talked about you all the time, very proud.
Ron Skinner, you are under arrest... Ron?<eos> This is absurd.<eos> For violation of the Rico act, for the crimes of bribery...<eos> Vandalism, and extortion.<eos> Anything you say, can and will be used against you... In a court of law.
He was gonna die anyway.<eos> What, so you got drunk together. Yeah, yeah, we did, a last hurrah.<eos> A way to really bury the hatchet.<eos> You'll see, if you live long enough. There comes a time when you have no choice... But to forgive and let go.<eos> Why should I believe you?
So, what do you wanna know?<eos> Look, no offense, all right, but, uh, my wife made me come here.<eos> And I don't really believe in any of this shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you already paid, so you might as well hear what I got, man.
I'll see you later, Kev. - Yeah.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, now listen.<eos> I know there's a part of you that's hoping that he didn't even know it was your birthday.
He was... he was sad.<eos> He was always sad.<eos> Didn't want anyone to know, especially his kids.<eos> He hid it from...<eos> He hid it from Anne Marie and Billy and you.
I'm Lieutenant Sales.<eos> - Forgive me, lieutenant.<eos> - At ease.<eos> I'm to report to Captain Picó.<eos> He's been expecting you.
Handsome.<eos> Joined up at 16.<eos> I don't know which regiment, he's on the other side.<eos> This way, Master Lluís.<eos> You'll have the boy's room.
Don't be shy.<eos> You like helping people, don't you?<eos> Yes, when I can.<eos> Could you help me?<eos> You?
Now go back to the village and forget this ever happened.<eos> And marry that woman. For the sake of your son.<eos> I didn't marry, on principle. But I recognised my son.<eos> Look at me! Not like that sod who turned his back on you.<eos> And thanks to you, that sod is now my husband.
To our wives!<eos> I don't know how we've survived without them.<eos> But don't think the women here have forgotten us.<eos> Cigars from the Lady of the Manor. For the officers.<eos> And this is especially for you.
A sack of spuds.<eos> What nice boots.<eos> First the horse, and now the boots.<eos> She must think our lieutenant has delicate feet.<eos> And I have a gift for you.
Who are the players?<eos> Undersecretary errinwright.<eos> Christ.<eos> I assume others.<eos> Do they suspect you?
Now is not the time for factions or debate.<eos> There's opa. And there is opa.<eos> You?<eos> You're just an earther playing belter.<eos> We don't need you giving us orders, And we don't need you picking our target.
All this just bonus time for me, sasa ke?<eos> Stick next to me, okay?<eos> I'll look out for you when we land.<eos> Oy, pampa.<eos> I keep an eye on you, old man.
And I'm good with faces.<eos> You look so familiar.<eos> You didn't volunteer for the Hudson Valley Committee back in 2000?<eos> I can tell you for sure that I didn't.<eos> I've never voted for you.
I'd at least like to know why you couldn't support me.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Well, it matters to me.<eos> How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.
Army?<eos> Marines?<eos> I served.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Good for you.
Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Mr. Alibadi.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Kasem.<eos> That's for you.
You said you had some names for me.<eos> Oh, that's him, isn't it?<eos> Your son, Andrew.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't help but think how proud he'd be of you right now.
Do I give up, roll over?<eos> Do you see me resigning?<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Sixty million people voted for me.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
- I see.<eos> My supervisor took the call early this morning.<eos> It was an honest mistake.<eos> I see.<eos> Anyway, the good news is we can keep our appointmet as scheduled if that's still good for you.
_ What's this?<eos> A work in progress.<eos> It's not ready yet.<eos> I am the next president of the United States.<eos> Who the hell voted for you?
He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?
Each one of them crazy as he is.<eos> So, we just let them keep screaming at us without a response?<eos> Here's a response-- the man is insane.<eos> Saul.<eos> We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.
And I'll tell you something else, for free-- your son runs like a fucking girl.<eos> Uh, like I said, people... people are angry.<eos> A random caller, huh?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I've noticed this about you.
Yes.<eos> That and because I know how protective you are of the Agency.<eos> Whatever is going on here, it's not the Agency.<eos> Not mine, anyway.<eos> Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.
- Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> I'm, uh, calling on behalf of a third party and they-- well, they've asked me to ask you would you like to see your children again?<eos> What?<eos> Your children, Erin and Jeremy, would you like to see them again?<eos> I've got news for you, you shit.
You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.
Um, let's go downstairs, shall we?<eos> Okay.<eos> This is Bernard.<eos> If you would not mind removing your clothes, Bernard will conduct a brief medical examination.<eos> We have a gown for you.
Uh, Daniah or Daneeah.<eos> - "Danyah"?<eos> - "Danyah," yes.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, sir?
- I have to go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.
I won't get cold feet.<eos> Good.<eos> So, do you want my money now?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We have a question for you first.
No.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Go home, Miss Durst.<eos> This isn't for you.
Holy of holies.<eos> Voice of the Olympics.<eos> Red hat and a beard.<eos> Likes the top deck.<eos> But I'd steer clear if I were you.
To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.<eos> I sacrificed my happiness.<eos> - I let my family abandon me.<eos> - Why?<eos> For you!
- Mr. President, it appears Ukrainian separatists have taken control of an armed nuclear submarine, and they'll have launch capability within two hours.<eos> You're being brought to a bunker, which you will access with your unique biometrics once inside.<eos> - Sorry, my unique biometrics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The door can only be unlocked by you and you alone unless you have an identical twin brother, which would be ridiculous.
Well, if you knew that, why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?<eos> Because I'm covering my asset.<eos> - What asset?<eos> - I have someone on the inside.<eos> Leave your weapon, enter the door, and they'll take care of you once you're inside.
- Where's the comms room?<eos> - What?<eos> The comms room.<eos> I need to make a call.<eos> Do you know what's inside of you?
Yes.<eos> Then you know that the president will not hesitate to cut you open and pull it out.<eos> I mean, I know this man.<eos> He is cold and he is merciless.<eos> You think he gives a shit about you if he's willing to end the world?
- It's fine.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She wants you to do it again.<eos> Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.
Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.<eos> Once inside the event chamber, you will be able to hear us and we will be able to hear you.
Get really low.<eos> Hey, it's me, man, Lonny Dufrene.<eos> I had, like, a far out idea for the new Gordon--<eos> Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!
Listen... everything that's happening, it's on me.<eos> Eric, that's not true.<eos> I should have benched Grimes on the Bin-Khalid raid.<eos> Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?<eos> He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy... I just... I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just...
- Sit down.<eos> Make transcripts available to the press and if anyone asks about Rebecca Ingram's absence just refer them to me.<eos> Nilaa.<eos> Can you excuse us for a moment?<eos> Gage's campaign is releasing an attack ad tomorrow... about you.
He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay? He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.
Rebecca.<eos> Good to see you, Eric.<eos> Got to say, this is a little different from that bunker in Yemen.<eos> This is national CTU headquarters, the nerve center.<eos> I remember you from Taiz.
Andy, you saved my life today. A couple of times.<eos> Well, probably more like three, but who's counting, right?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I never had the chance to say how sorry I am, about the men.<eos> I know they were like brothers to you.
No, fight! Fight the unbeliever! Fight them!<eos> Do not accept them as your friend and your ally! The Prophet Muhammad had Christians and Jews as his allies.<eos> Ben and I would go in together.<eos> If we make contact with Gabriel, we'll see if he knows how to find Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> Why limit the operation to you and Grimes?
Carter's operating on his own.<eos> I want your team ready to intercept once we locate Carter and Grimes. It's him.<eos> Put him on speaker.<eos> Eric, I'm here with Keith Mullins.<eos> Turn around now before this gets any worse for you.
I don't think Jadalla can set off any more attacks. - Not yet.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> He contacted me.<eos> He said the flash drive containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged, and he needs somebody to repair it.<eos> Why would he call you?
Yeah, we need to go through it again.<eos> We don't know what details might be helpful.<eos> There's an agent waiting for you in the conference room.<eos> Please, John.<eos> I don't want to release you, Mr. Donovan, but your biometrics are clean and with no hard evidence against you...
And then, we die.<eos> Which seems... I don't know... Like a waste of a perfectly good virus.<eos> Andy, you talk a lot when you're stressed.<eos> Look, you'll figure it out.<eos> I have faith in you, man.
Jennifer is safe.<eos> We got the vest off.<eos> Just stay where you are!<eos> Jennifer's okay. I promise, Steven.<eos> I don't believe you.
Dispatch says the deputies aren't responding.<eos> We've only got a few minutes.<eos> We're not far.<eos> You drive ahead, I'll follow on foot.<eos> I'll only be a few minutes behind you.
Yeah, same one.<eos> Still locked out.<eos> Director of National Intelligence?<eos> I'm at the location.<eos> Right behind you.
Look at your husband.<eos> Now, do what I say. Or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself, my husband means nothing to you.
Yeah, come on.<eos> Look, I don't know if you found anything, but just... Have CTU check, anyway.<eos> Roger that, sir.<eos> Senator.<eos> Rebecca talked about you. Talked about you a lot, about your missions together.
Was she really taken?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> I got every agency looking for her.<eos> It's our highest priority.<eos> But I'm calling you about something else. I have a job for you.
Rebecca's ambulance is exiting 29.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - Signal lights.<eos> I want that ambulance to hit green all the way through.<eos> What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her?
- Trade was done. - More pressure please.<eos> Bin-Khalid got his hands on a gun and he was aiming for me, but she... she, uh... she took the bullet for me.<eos> I don't know why, but she did.<eos> She, uh... first thing she said when I got to her was your name.<eos> You're the only thing she was thinking about.
- Is there a supermarket nearby?<eos> Oh... no.<eos> But there is a local open-air market and gin distillery.<eos> Thanks again for taking us.<eos> I don't know what we would have done without you.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> I've been here every morning before my shift.<eos> I guessed if you did come, it would be early.<eos> I knew it'd be important for you to visit them.
May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?<eos> A quick spar.<eos> If you win, you leave as you wish.<eos> But if I win... you come with me and tell your story on the record.<eos> If you're not going to stop me, I have no need to fight you.
We have to get to London.<eos> I'll explain everything.<eos> - We have to get to London.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> This is for you.
But right now, I do.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Covering.<eos> We all get complaints, right?<eos> Struggle for you is you remember the complaints, don't you?
Mrs. Miller.<eos> - I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
- I'm so very sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And I promise you, I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.<eos> And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.<eos> The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.<eos> Please stop it.<eos> I thought this news would bring you some relief.<eos> The president called Mrs. Miller.<eos> I promised you and your daughter that I would...
♪ let it shine ♪<eos> ♪ let it shine ♪<eos> You got it right. You been to that bar before.<eos> Evening, stranger.<eos> What can we do for you?
- Okay.<eos> Yes.. Good.<eos> You should learn how I do it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I have done it so many times for you.
It would be better if Rohan joins Supriya here while we both sit at another table.<eos> The 'Pav Bhaji' here is very famous.<eos> Rohan, should I order you one?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> Ma'am, I'm ordering one for you.
Zafar is too much!<eos> He always talks nonsense.<eos> I hope you don't mind him.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> So.. Mrs. Mukherjee.. Whenever she talks about you all she does is sing praises of you.
Is Supriya here?<eos> - Yes, she's there.<eos> Can you please..<eos> - Yes, I will take you there.<eos> Carry on, I'll join you.
- Yes?<eos> - Thanks. - Stop it.<eos> Listen..<eos> What?<eos> - I have a special gift for you.
Listen..<eos> What?<eos> - I have a special gift for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> You will need these.. This is protection for you.
This is what my wife Jaya complains about too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Amit.<eos> May God bless you with a happy married life.<eos> This is my blessing to you.
Pay more attention on your duty than my calls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Take her to the hospital for the medical.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Listen, Mr. Chaube has sent a car for you.
Rohan, if you don't want to eat let us go to bed.<eos> I just want to sit alone for some time.<eos> You may go to bed.<eos> Rohan..<eos> I can understand that I am not the same for you, as I was.
I will consider that..<eos> whatever we had before yesterday was simply a dream.<eos> Dinner is on the table, Rohan.<eos> Have a little before going to bed.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you..'
Since you had dubbed these voices, I had no other choice.<eos> Ready.<eos> - Great!<eos> Let's go again.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you' 'but she can never keep her mouth shut.'
'No problem. You can hear it now.'<eos> 'And get used to it' 'because we'll be visiting often now.'<eos> 'We will come whenever we want.'<eos> 'Come on, let's try something new today.'<eos> 'I know how hard this is for you' 'and I love you so much'
I need to meet Mr. Chaube.<eos> Sir is out.<eos> He must have a cell phone.<eos> Give me his number.<eos> Do you think he's free for you?
- What!<eos> What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides.. I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.
"People fight over girls, everywhere."<eos> "Spend some time with me, it won't be a crime."<eos> "Sometimes, I find you bitter. Are you a girl or wine?"<eos> "The people want to know when you will fall for someone."<eos> "Everyone is spellbound by you, and I am one of them."
Waiting for you to wake up.<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Bhatnagar.<eos> Good morning..<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."

Understand?<eos> And both of us had fun with that woman!<eos> Twice!<eos> You're talking about that blind woman today.<eos> Who was she to you?
Anna!<eos> You're next.<eos> - What now?<eos> You've made this move already.<eos> - I have a plan B for you.
I'll ask.<eos> I have a reservation for one that I made for my birthday.<eos> If you want to join me, you're welcome to.<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Maybe she doesn't like you.
Thank you for eating.<eos> I was about to have this sad birthday lunch by myself. I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> It was great.<eos> It was really nice to meet you.<eos> And you.
Well... a little up and down, to tell you the truth.<eos> You know, new city and everything.<eos> They have a lot of questions.<eos> And frankly I still don't fully understand what I'm doing here myself.<eos> Before we go any further this is for you.
Just wait for me.<eos> Norman, do you still like me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mother, yes.<eos> I still like you.
He's still driving when it goes down.<eos> He's got a 500-gallon tank right here.<eos> I will destroy everyone in this montage.<eos> He's got more machinery in his body than most guys have in their cars.<eos> Smoking cigarettes may be bad for you, but doubting Frankenstein?
Cheerleaders don't come to practice.<eos> See, we should be recording this.<eos> Vintage macho-bullshit is ratings gold.<eos> I don't care about your broadcast, Miss Sullivan.<eos> I don't care about the money or the fans, and I definitely don't care about you.
Why do you care about this goddamn race so much?<eos> Because it's my job.<eos> And this might seem kind of strange nowadays, but I dedicated my life to this race.<eos> Nice line.<eos> Did The Chairman write it for you?
Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um...<eos> I... I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.
- Tell him what I just told you.<eos> Tell him to keep it to himself and make something up.<eos> I need a couple of days, at least.<eos> Where you going?<eos> This is for you and Mom.
- Let him go! - Aah!<eos> I got you, Mike.<eos> I got you.<eos> Daddy, you're sweating like a pig.<eos> Oh. Someone's calling you.
Right.<eos> And the box here. I'm assuming that this is Zack Addy's personal effects?<eos> Yes, I... thought you might want to see these.<eos> The photographs, some press clippings...<eos> As you can see, he was very fond of you, Dr. Brennan.
Miss Delfs was just one of many who came to see me.<eos> It is odd, but being perceived as a murderous cannibal does have some advantages.<eos> Okay, Dr. Lecter, why don't you take a seat?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Dr. Hodgins here has got some questions for you.
I.. I.. I..<eos> Death is inevitable. For everyone.<eos> And I can be free only when you die.<eos> It's not like I can do any more dying.<eos> So, for me to get rid of you, I.. I'll have to kill myself?
I know.<eos> You still don't get it, do you, Phillauri?<eos> I'm the other Phillauri of this Phillaur village.<eos> I wrote these poems.<eos> "A prayer is flying in every breath of mine." "I am praying for you, my beloved."

I will make sure she gets her due.<eos> On Baisakhi I'll ask you for her hand in marriage.<eos> Please take care of Shashi till I return.<eos> After that, I'll take better care of her than you ever could.<eos> "I got entangled with you in a way" "that every thread in it was pulled back."

You had asked him to do this, hadn't you?<eos> You would've remained in the shadows and he could've become famous<eos> and made a lot of money.<eos> But he didn't do that.<eos> He is worthy of you.
Anu's grandfather was just like you.<eos> He had given this to me on our wedding day.<eos> Here.<eos> This might break, you might lose it but his love will be there forever.<eos> Just like Kanan's love for you.
I was living in a half-remembered dream.<eos> And you brought me to my senses.<eos> You are my truth. And I bow down to you.<eos> You are my truth. And I bow down to you.<eos> Don't abandon me, dear heart. I am nothing without you.

You have got a lovely silhouette.<eos> Don't you start talking to me in French, Fred Buckle.<eos> You don't know where it might end.<eos> Good afternoon, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> What can I do for you?
Good afternoon, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Do you stock plastic pants, aged five to six?<eos> Could you attend to that light bulb for me, please, Frederick?<eos> Strictly speaking, they're an incontinence garment, not baby linen, but I can telephone one of my wholesalers for you.
Dr Turner's on his way, but we'd all feel better if you had the usual twice-daily visits.<eos> And I think you would, too.<eos> I'm a good mother, Sister.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I do trust you.
I'll just go by myself.<eos> I didn't think you'd want to drive one of those cars, anyway.<eos> Why? Because I'm a woman?<eos> I didn't say that. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, no. On second thought, I order you both to participate.<eos> On the one hand, you'll get a better handle on who Dustin's accomplice was if you're on the inside, and on the other hand, I think the aggression of the derby will be rather therapeutic for you, Dr. Brennan.
I got to get Bones here back to the lab.<eos> You're wearing your Jeffersonian lanyard.<eos> Are you coming in to help I.D. the jumper?<eos> Actually, I've hung up my lab coat.<eos> I never thought of you as one to retire.
Ron was coming back to work?<eos> This was supposed to be your time to shine, Linda.<eos> This was your chance to finally prove what you could do-- to finally, after all these years, crawl out from under your boss's big, looming shadow.<eos> And all you wanted was an opportunity to show yourself, your friends, your family that you had what it took.<eos> And here he was waltzing back in and throwing that big shadow right over you.
Do not give her a phone.<eos> His wife wants to tell her children.<eos> I understand that.<eos> She can't.<eos> Sir, imagine if we were talking about your children, about you...
Correct.<eos> And with the revelation of the additional blood evidence found in his office at the university, it neatly supports your theory, doesn't it?<eos> That he was there.<eos> That he was the gunman.<eos> I guess I would have one question for you.
That he was the gunman.<eos> I guess I would have one question for you.<eos> I'm director of the CIA.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> That's why I sent you the e-mail with the evidence directly.
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
- I can't reassure you.<eos> This idea you have that there's a way to be safe... it's childish and cowardly.<eos> It stops you from experiencing anything, including anything good.<eos> You don't think I feel bad enough already?<eos> I know I'm messed up... but you're supposed to teach me how not to be.
Big Tobacco has paid $400 billion to state Medicaid programs.<eos> Cheeseburger laws proponents say,<eos> "We don't want to see the same kind of thing happen<eos> "to the meat and dairy industries."<eos> The fact that these laws are based on a model template called a Commonsense Consumption Act is actually ironic because what they're saying is you, the consumer, should have the common sense to know that our food is bad for you.
I should never have taken your bloody money.<eos> Why don't you look at me when I talk to you?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> I won't be silenced.<eos> Not even by you.
- Your clearance up to date?<eos> - Yeah, of course. About the benefit package...<eos> I hear you have, uh, a tuition assistance plan?<eos> Correct... for approved educational institutions.<eos> Now, if you don't have any other questions for me, I have one for you.
They're on their own, and you know it.<eos> Is this true? No.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I need you to be more positive.<eos> I don't work for you anymore, so what you need isn't my problem.
I'm counting the guards.<eos> There are five guards.<eos> Maybe 15 shooters.<eos> I heard them talking.<eos> They're afraid of you.
I need you to make him think that you like him.<eos> - No!<eos> - Think of the girls.<eos> Esther could be next, trust me.<eos> Why trust you?
Remember, Michael, the words of the prophet,<eos> "alayhi as-salam"...<eos> "the world is just a moment, so make it a moment of obedience."<eos> Of course.<eos> I owe everything to you.
Uh, thank you for waiting so patiently. Who do we have next?<eos> That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.
The B-52 is, I presume, still... - B-29.<eos> - Huh?<eos> B-29.<eos> FIFI's a B-29.<eos> Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?
I think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what?<eos> If it turns out that Fudge wasn't actually in the war...<eos> Fudge is not a person.<eos> He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.
Do you know?<eos> No.<eos> Mr. Rip. Look.<eos> It is all of us.<eos> There's you, teacher Na'omi.
I had to be strong for the girls.<eos> And so I was.<eos> Now you have to be strong for them.<eos> I don't care what that man says.<eos> I know one thing for sure about you.
Such fire in you would be great to join with this intelligence...<eos> That you would be the lion the cause needed.<eos> But I also saw this rage inside of you.<eos> Because of Omar, that rage has endangered our cause.<eos> Everything I've done, I've done for you.
All right, this guy... he wants to be the next osama bin laden.<eos> Meet your new cellmate.<eos> You were right...<eos> Boko haram does want him.<eos> My brother died for you.
It was honest bargaining, friend.<eos> I took nothing.<eos> Besides, your passport is long gone, somewhere far overseas by now, I bet.<eos> If you want, um, I can have the forgers make you another.<eos> My own fake passport coming from you?
You pull my brother up first.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> _<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Body is fine. My head is trying to figure out how to get those passports we couldn't get last night. For you, those kids.
How are you feeling?<eos> Body is fine. My head is trying to figure out how to get those passports we couldn't get last night. For you, those kids.<eos> Well, that's something you shouldn't be worrying about right now.<eos> You should rest up.<eos> We're gonna need you.
He just pursues his own ideology.<eos> Okay, for instance, listen.<eos> Let's say you think Russia and Iran are having too much influence in the Middle East, and you don't think Washington is getting the job done.<eos> You free Ramal.<eos> Sure, he's an Islamic radical nut job, but he will fight Iran and Russia for you.
From now on... there will be only one route over the border for our product.<eos> The chicken trucks.<eos> And that is final.<eos> But you must understand this is for efficiency only.<eos> There's no disrespect to you or your family.
You took advantage of Mrs. Landry.<eos> Does she know how much money you're gonna make?<eos> Nope.<eos> And again, I ask, so what?<eos> These people trusted you, Jimmy.
She barely answers her phone.<eos> So this weekend, when she canceled, I blew up!<eos> Why do you think she's avoiding me?<eos> It's impossible for me to speculate on Rebecca's life.<eos> I only have access to you.
Kaniel Outis. He's been working with ISIL.<eos> You know that's not Michael.<eos> We're gonna need you.
Never thought I'd see this face again.<eos> You weren't supposed to.<eos> Lincoln Burrows.<eos> How about you step out and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.<eos> - There is nobility in you, Lincoln.
Lincoln Burrows.<eos> How about you step out and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.<eos> - There is nobility in you, Lincoln.<eos> - You should rest up.<eos> - We're gonna need you.
- Hello, Claudia.<eos> Yeah, the secret to real power is to never betray your intentions, to wear nothing on your sleeve.<eos> And to never let anyone see your face.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Next time I'm sitting in solitary, I'll think of you in here, running the world in air-conditioned comfort.
It's the only thing I'm good at.<eos> Well, that's absurd.<eos> He's not dangerous, he's just hurt.<eos> I'm already helping him.<eos> Well, what is it doing to you?
No, it's fine.<eos> Is, um, is this... is this about me?<eos> About what I did?<eos> Please.<eos> This isn't about you.
Thank you.<eos> Offices of Jimmy McGill.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What can I do for you?
Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> Tell your friends, even if they already have a will... it's important to get it updated, just like you did.<eos> - I'll tell them.<eos> - Now, you remember Francesca.<eos> She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
Tell him you need assurance of my safety.<eos> I take the Martian and you let us walk out.<eos> Look, we both know how this goes.<eos> Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you.
- My son...<eos> - Yes, your son.<eos> I failed at my job, and Charanpal died.<eos> I owe him.<eos> Not you.
But you've heard me say before that relationships aren't singular, right?<eos> Did you contribute at all to Rebecca pushing you away?<eos> No, I stayed the same.<eos> I've been the same. She changed.<eos> You know, I really like you, Jean, but... honestly, I've been thinking lately that maybe therapy isn't helping me that much.
I mean, I've always controlled what I told my family, but it's just spiraled from there.<eos> It's my mother, really.<eos> After my dad passed, she just tightened the reins. It's...<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - We're ready for you. - Perfect.
I'm... I'm more on the ground floor.<eos> Which is exactly why I'm asking you, my friend.<eos> Right.<eos> After the recent unrest amongst the local vamps, I can't trust my intel.<eos> And how do you expect me to figure that out for you?
No.<eos> I want to find Clary.<eos> She was kidnapped by Dot.<eos> Valentine must be behind this.<eos> Why should we trust you?
It has nothing to do with my clan.<eos> Unfortunately, we've reached the limit on kicking the can down the road.<eos> If you want to prove your innocence, deliver Miss Belcourt to the Clave.<eos> You think I haven't been trying?<eos> I want to believe you, Mr. Santiago, but sadly... I'm not sure I do.
Look, I've been best friends with Clary forever.<eos> And the one thing she's always wished is to be able to know her real dad.<eos> And she's had that chance.<eos> And she found a homicidal maniac.<eos> She wants nothing to do with you.
He said something about setting me straight.<eos> Why do you think he'd say that? I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's...<eos> Captain, hello.<eos> How... What can we do for you?
It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.<eos> I'm here to take care of you.
Hey, what's up?<eos> Sara asked us to find any physical descriptions of the spear that might help us find it.<eos> She thinks Rip had it with him when he traveled to 1967.<eos> And she, um, also wants you to work on figuring out, um, a way to reverse the effects, uh, on Rip since he came in contact with the, um... Time drive.<eos> I've brought up the time drive's schematics for you, Dr. Palmer.
But the movie was done.<eos> I tossed all the props down the garbage chute.<eos> They were just trash.<eos> But, but, but...<eos> Shh. I have one question for you, Mr. Lucas, and your life depends on answering me honestly.
The sick thing is that after that dream,<eos> I got off, and when I finished, I thought of Sidney with everyone but me.<eos> These douchey guys just fucking her all at the same time.<eos> It's like some weird form of punishment.<eos> You can't allow Sidney to have that kind of power over you.
No, no, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, I mean your voice matches your... - head. - No, I...<eos> I take it as a compliment. Truly.<eos> - Hey, man, I like you.
- Really? That's what you think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there was definitely a tone change.<eos> - That's very perceptive, Gus. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And that's one of the things I like about you.
That's enough.<eos> The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.<eos> Mickey used me to keep her job.<eos> She is using you.<eos> She doesn't like you.
I actually went and bought her cookbooks.<eos> I eat quinoa now.<eos> If we could pull someone like that in, I think the Subzero guys would really, really love that.<eos> Stella, hi!<eos> We were just talking about you.
Tommy, come on.<eos> What?<eos> I can't help but think you maybe set me up here.<eos> No, man.<eos> I like you, man.
- I just need, like, five minutes.<eos> - Gus, dude...<eos> - I think I can convince him, you know?<eos> - Look, you need to move on, okay?<eos> He doesn't need you anymore.
Excuse us, please.<eos> Thea is looking into a few joint initiatives that I proposed while in Hub City last week.<eos> Oh, that's really too bad.<eos> I've come to look forward to her many looks of death.<eos> Thea likes you.
What do we know?<eos> We don't know much.<eos> It was a single shooter, AR-15 assault rifle.<eos> And it-- it doesn't appear that I was his primary target because he just... Blasted his way through city hall.<eos> If he wasn't going after you, then there's a larger agenda here.
You sure?<eos> I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death to have been for nothing.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Do you have a minute for me?<eos> Of course. What can I do for you?
Move on the targets!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Happy to help.<eos> It didn't hurt that the mayor vouched for you.
Confess, Oliver.<eos> When you see Taiana in afterlife--heh heh-- give her a kiss for me.<eos> - I'm going to finish this.<eos> - No!<eos> Are you going to let your Pakhan finish this for you, Mr. Queen, eh?
and he's not going to leave the city without it.<eos> I would like the Downworld's help in locating him.<eos> In order to capture him so that he might escape once again?<eos> In order to execute him so this threat may finally end.<eos> Why should we believe you?
So you gave him passage to Idris?<eos> I wanted to protect my people, even those outside the safety of my realm.<eos> We Seelies understand the power of negotiation.<eos> Your idea of negotiation is putting the rest of the Downworld at risk.<eos> Which is just fine by you, isn't it? That way, you can rule it all by yourself.
Okay.<eos> - We shoot the fucker in the face.<eos> - I know.<eos> - _ - You can't trust anyone here.<eos> Can I trust you, Dan?
Why would I want to do that?<eos> I understand you grew up in londrina, on basic.<eos> That must've been hard.<eos> Only if you can't find a way out.<eos> It's especially admirable for you, after the loss of your mother.
System must be down or something.<eos> I'm sure they'll get it all back and running in the next couple of hours.<eos> You know, maybe sooner.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't believe you.
No, I have no idea where he is.<eos> We need to know what he knows.<eos> You should convince him to come in from the cold.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> He trusts you.
But trust me, now is not the time for factions or debate.<eos> There's opa and there is opa.<eos> You?<eos> You're just an earther playing belter.<eos> We don't need you giving us orders, and we don't need you picking our target.
All this just bonus time for me, sasa ke?<eos> Stick next to me, okay?<eos> I'll look out for you when we land.<eos> Oy, pampa.<eos> I keep an eye on you, old man.
So... I have been telling her about my work in here and my work in meditation.<eos> You know, the whole "letting go" thing.<eos> And she has agreed to see me!<eos> That's great news.<eos> I'm really happy for you.
She's out of town, so sometimes I check in on it.<eos> Diane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Expensive looking.<eos> You know, I'm trusting you here.
Right, but I'm over her.<eos> I don't want to talk about her with you.<eos> You seem a little angry.<eos> Was there any aggression?<eos> Did things ever get physical with you and Sidney?
I figured it out.<eos> - Sam...<eos> - No.<eos> You want me to be hooked on Sidney.<eos> Keeps me sick and needing you.
You know, I wanted to believe Sidney was a curse.<eos> This... virus, this terrible thing.<eos> But I've started to see things differently.<eos> She was a gift.<eos> In fact, without her, I never would have gotten to you.
But as long as you're in my life, she is, too.<eos> I don't think you should quit therapy, Sam.<eos> We still have a lot of work to do.<eos> I'll always have work to do. But I want to enjoy my life, not just talk about all the issues.<eos> Honestly, it'll probably be good for you, too.
- Allison.<eos> See, she slept over the other night, and now she's gone, right?<eos> She disappeared like that.<eos> I thought maybe you'd know something about it since you're all buddy-buddy with her now.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you?
- rational advice, but I just don't care. - You're an adult.<eos> - It's your decision.<eos> - But I know what you're thinking.<eos> Maybe that's not what I'm thinking.<eos> You know, my husband's a lawyer, and we're actually not that different from you and Sidney.
But if you... if you really feel that connection, that excitement with Emily, then who am I to tell you how much time you need?<eos> And the fact that you actually are over Sidney?<eos> Well, that means something.<eos> But you know, for what it's worth, maybe Sidney's not as bad as we thought.<eos> I mean, she clearly cares about you a great deal.
I sure tried.<eos> Did you?<eos> All right, Jack.<eos> Professor.<eos> Gary in HR will set you up. Enjoy your new offices.
Master Richardson.<eos> I never realized... that you took me for...<eos> Essie told him how shocked and hurt she was, a poor widow woman to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had so much respect for.<eos> An indentured servant could not marry, so how could he think to torment an ill-starred transportee girl, she could not fathom.<eos> A poor transportee girl who's got feelings for you.
I mean...<eos> We're talking about, um, emotional intimacy.<eos> Like, um...<eos> Did Lucifer, uh, bring you dinner?<eos> Or did he do anything special for you?
My God.<eos> - Is this her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's so pretty.<eos> Well, I-I mean I was working and maybe, sort of, you know, asking about you.
Okay.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.
I was vilified for doing what anyone in my position would do.<eos> You went back for your computer.<eos> That's not about survival, that's about stuff.<eos> It was about instinct, but thank you for reminding me why I'm doing this and for helping me to improve upon my experiment.<eos> Truth is, Dr. Scott only mutilated her hand because she was being observed by you.
What, you trying to scratch your way back into the damn race?<eos> See, you had to scratch your way to power.<eos> See, I was born with mine.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Oh, and Mr. Lyon... if I do decide to come for you, you're going to experience a kind of pain that you've never experienced.
Doc, relax.<eos> I'm an officer of the court.<eos> I'll make sure you're protected and well-compensated. Just get it done.<eos> Okay, let's get it done.<eos> We're gonna have to put a tube down your throat so the machine can breathe for you, and we're gonna give you your shot to keep you as comfortable as possible.
All right, let them have it.<eos> Welcome to Laviticus, Las Vegas.<eos> I would love to make a toast to you guys.<eos> To Charlotte.<eos> Without you, none of this would've been possible.
My father is a man of his word, Ms. Frost.<eos> I can assure you.<eos> It's Mrs. Frost.<eos> I'm Andre Lyon.<eos> We haven't properly met, but I've heard wonderful things about you.
Listen to your mama.<eos> She's very wise.<eos> But you need to take care of you right now.<eos> Oh, don't feel the need to hide your joy.<eos> I'm just as happy as you to be leaving this... hellhole and you.
I prefer "Calhoun."<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of Tariq Cousins.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you.
About Marcus.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You can have a seat.<eos> Right.<eos> Gwen, we're here today because we, we know what you told the police, that you feel like something... supernatural is after you.
This is Oliver in Dr. Turner's office.<eos> He'd like to see you in the office today. I, I was just in there.<eos> He said everything was fine.<eos> All right, well, he looked back through your test results and there are some things he'd like to discuss.<eos> Does 5:00 P.M. work for you?
The old iron works off the interstate.<eos> Tomorrow night at 9:00.<eos> He says park off the road by the warehouse.<eos> The timing of your escape is crucial, my lord.<eos> If the device isn't sufficiently impaired, the king's hold on you will only increase.
It's powering up...<eos> I asked you not to tell me that.<eos> But in the opposite direction.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> As it's powering down in you, the polarity is somehow reversing.
But in the opposite direction.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> As it's powering down in you, the polarity is somehow reversing.<eos> English, Drexel.<eos> The ability to control is transferring from Crowley to you.
Trust me.<eos> The cream always rises to the top.<eos> Oh, I agree.<eos> Mr. ketch?<eos> The prisoner is asking for you.
You're coming to work here.<eos> I don't think so, petal.<eos> The lease on your building's up.<eos> We're not renewing.<eos> There's hot-desking capacity for you here.
Am I right thinking you haven't given your full interview yet?<eos> How are you feeling about doing it?<eos> I do wanna talk to them, I...<eos> I just don't know if I'm ready.<eos> You do what's right for you.
Plenty of days I haven't.<eos> I promised myself, I promised Danny, that I wouldn't give in.<eos> Nothing makes it better.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, Trish.<eos> This is gonna be hard for you.
So I got dropped off back there.<eos> Walked in this way.<eos> - Can I...<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> We'll be led by you.
I think.<eos> And I walked towards the voice.<eos> But you didn't recognise who it was?<eos> Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian.<eos> You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?
You'd have to ask him.<eos> Beth!<eos> Ed Burnett.<eos> Farm shop bloke.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.
- ...following a fight.<eos> - I know nothing about it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because if you do, now is the time to mention it.<eos> There's a lot stacking up against you, Ed.
Along with this receipt from a shop called Wessex Fuel.<eos> Showing that you bought those at 5:03pm on the Saturday of your wife's party. Directly on the route between your house and Axehampton House.<eos> Who were you hoping to use these on, Jim?<eos> Cos it certainly wasn't your wife, was it?<eos> See, the problem for you is these condoms match the brand of condom used by the man who raped Trish Winterman.
Look.<eos> I work for Chaz at the cafe on the High street.<eos> He asked me if I wanted to help them out with this do.<eos> I spoke to one of your people about this.<eos> And did you tell them about you and Jim Atwood?
What about the twine - did you touch that?<eos> Yeah, I pulled it out to see. -Why?<eos> -I didn't know what it was, did I?<eos> It wasn't till I saw the twine that I called you.<eos> And then I called you.
And eventually, he will tell us everything.<eos> So I'd suggest you should get in there first and tell us the truth.<eos> What happened at Axehampton?<eos> I've told you what happened.<eos> We don't believe you.
Did you hold a torch or a phone to shine a light?<eos> -That what he asked you to do?<eos> -I don't know anything about it.<eos> Lucas, you're gonna have to stop lying, 'cause you are not very good at it.<eos> And look at you - you're exhausted.
He's an aberration.<eos> (SIGHS) Hope so!<eos> PAUL: How did you know I'd be here this early?<eos> Last service in a few hours.<eos> I thought, "If I was you, I'd be wallowing."
I'm still hoping you'll reconsider.<eos> (SCOFFS) No.<eos> No, it's time.<eos> "To every thing a season."<eos> Now, what about you?
How does this sound?<eos> NetJets Air Mistress, 2000 to 2005.<eos> And then there's a 12-year gap.<eos> I mean, you could say being a mom is a job, but not the way I do it!<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.
Yeah Right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Count Olaf, Eleanora Poe, from the Daily Punctilio.<eos> Taking the role of a handsome man is certainly a brave choice.<eos> Is it a stretch for you?
- Dr. Montgomery?<eos> - I've never heard of him.<eos> Well, you are hereby refired as my secretary with an 8% increase in salary.<eos> The Baudelaires will be sent to a suitable guardian and this series of unfortunate events has come to a close.<eos> As for you, Count Olaf...
Actually, Dr. Montgomery...<eos> - Monty.<eos> - Monty...<eos> Uncle Monty, I hope, once you get used to me.<eos> Monty, our parents never mentioned you.
Reptiles aren't contagious.<eos> Are you sure you're a qualified nurse?<eos> Maybe the children should wait outside.<eos> Being in a room with a dead body could be very traumatic.<eos> We've already been in a room with a dead body thanks to you.
I'm asking you to get some rest.<eos> Take maybe a week.<eos> Come back recharged.<eos> Look, sir, I appreciate you looking after me like that, but with everything that's going on right now, I really don't think a break is called for.<eos> Aaron, it's because of everything that's going on that I need you at your best.
I have to take him, now.<eos> - Step aside.<eos> Please. - He can't be moved, he'll die.<eos> It'll take a lot more than that now.<eos> His value to science is unquantifiable. - His value to you, you mean.
Please, Dan.<eos> Please stop!<eos> I'll shoot you.<eos> This is my choice.<eos> I choose to save Fortitude. From you.
Tissue regeneration, Michael.<eos> Everything I do, everything that motivates me, my work and knowledge is about hope.<eos> This might be Freya's hope.<eos> You need to bring him to me.<eos> Yeah, you want me to bring him to you?
You expect favors in return for giving it to me.<eos> That's a bit like telling the cow not to involve itself in the steak dinner.<eos> Without it, no steak.<eos> I am quite capable of convicting Axelrod with the tools at my disposal.<eos> I no longer need you.
Some people would call that a cover up.<eos> Well, unimaginative types, with no pizzazz.<eos> I'm taking Axelrod at the closing bell. He'll be sure to be at his desk.<eos> You can read about the rest in the news.<eos> I won't do what you've asked. And this is the end of the matter for you.
Simple as asking him.<eos> Don't you worry, George.<eos> We'll all be cheesing and grinning in Albany soon enough.<eos> No Ice Juice nonsense is gonna change that.<eos> I signed off on you.
The police will help us.<eos> Dad'll get here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> We're safe.<eos> I trust you.
Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Where have you been all my life?<eos> -I really wish you could hear me!<eos> -Nightingale.<eos> I have a new broadcast for you.
- Sergeant Thom Doyle, retired, IUPA local.<eos> And you, sir, are a worthless goddamn punk.<eos> I think I'm gonna skip this one.<eos> Do you think you might wanna get together again?<eos> Like I said, everyone's gone now, and... I like you.
I'll call you tonight!<eos> What?<eos> Taurus is the car you've been waiting for.<eos> Sleek, strong, safe.<eos> See the new look Taurus at a dealership near you.
Hasta luego.<eos> May we talk?<eos> You can park it over there.<eos> You sent back the payment we agreed upon.<eos> What I did, I didn't do for you.
- Chuck.<eos> Kim.<eos> Good afternoon. Oh!<eos> Good.<eos> Mr. McGill, does this work for you?
Let's get down to it.<eos> We are here to finalize the Pre-Prosecution Diversion for James Morgan McGill.<eos> Representing the divertee, Ms. Kimberly Wexler.<eos> Mr. James McGill has signed a contract waiving his rights to a speedy trial and presentment of his case within the statute of limitations.<eos> The terms of the deal are for you, James, to report to your Pre-Prosecution Service Officer at the Albuquerque District Attorney's Office on the second Monday of every month for the next 12 months.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Ladies, dinner's on me.<eos> Kim, I knew you were good, but i didn't know you were this good.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you're happy.<eos> We couldn't have done it without you. And I hope you realize this means a whole lot a work comin' your way.
That's...<eos> I'm so glad to hear that.<eos> We appreciate the heads-up, but you can call this baby put to bed.<eos> Now the most important thing -- dinner.<eos> 7:00 good for you?
No. It affects me physically.<eos> It causes me great pain.<eos> However, I'm perfectly lucid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. mcgill, I have only one more question for you.
I promise, as soon as you see the first one, you're gonna want the whole package.<eos> Um, take about an hour.<eos> Um, so, I'll bring the whole team down there.<eos> We'll be there 12:30 sharp.<eos> I'm gonna turn you into a star.
What's that I see?<eos> Albuquerque's next TV star?<eos> It's you, small-business owner!<eos> Struggling to make it in today's fast-paced economy?<eos> Thought television advertising was too expensive for you?
Struggling to make it in today's fast-paced economy?<eos> Thought television advertising was too expensive for you?<eos> Well, you better think again!<eos> You can't afford not to be on TV!<eos> Look at you... you're a triple threat!
Better watch out for autograph hounds and paparazzi!<eos> And it gets better! I can have you on the air tomorrow.<eos> You heard me right... tomorrow!<eos> Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!<eos> I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!
You heard me right... tomorrow!<eos> Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!<eos> I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!<eos> Call me, Saul Goodman!<eos> The world needs to know about you and your business!
I say we strike while the iron is hot.<eos> Remember that other offer we discussed?<eos> More commercials at the discounted rate?<eos> Got my whole crew here.<eos> We could bang out seven more and give you a run that'll make you a household name.
What do ya say?<eos> Sure, s-sure.<eos> B-but -- but like I said, I only have enough to pay for the one.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I like you, and I wanna help.
Walk me through it.<eos> You'll receive a paycheck from Madrigal in the amount of $10,000 per week.<eos> I believe at that rate, your "employment" should be paid out in about 20 weeks.<eos> Mr. Fring has arranged to cover FICA, Social Security... the entirety of the tax burden.<eos> I assume that's all right with you?
Get yourself some new cards. New cards.<eos> The helpers have them.<eos> You can have one, two.<eos> You can have up to four, as you know.<eos> Here's a lucky blue one for you.
Yes, absolutely.<eos> Let's talk about the night you first called me. - Mm.<eos> - You sounded very distressed.<eos> I was.<eos> Using a telephone must have been difficult for you.
A very public incident.<eos> Perhaps the worst experience of my life.<eos> It was proven to me, in public, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there was a battery... a fully charged battery... almost next to my skin for the better part of two hours.<eos> And I felt nothing.<eos> What does that mean to you?
I insist.<eos> - Kevin...<eos> - Howard.<eos> ...Paige... always wonderful to see you.<eos> You, too, Howard. How've you been?
You got a house? A pension?<eos> Kiss it all goodbye.<eos> Look, out here, you might be King Douche-nozzle, but in court, you are little people.<eos> Look, the judge and I... we'll gladly spend the next five years in the courtroom.<eos> But for you, it's expensive.
I've got cash I can't spend.<eos> About $200,000.<eos> If anything happens to me, my family'll never see it.<eos> Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.<eos> And you think that solution could be applied to you.
Forgive my surprise, but a visit in person on such short notice? And on the Eve of my Prime Minister's arrival to the United States?<eos> - I need your help with something.<eos> - Ah, well... He says with a sigh of relief.<eos> Of course. Please.<eos> For you, anything.
For you, anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that tension that I sense?<eos> - In the air?<eos> - In you.
LR-010, copy.<eos> Narrow departure frequency. Local, channel five, log 4674.<eos> Runway one-zero.<eos> - That was quick.<eos> - For you, anything.
- Keep your voice down.<eos> Thanks for meeting me.<eos> You found the problem? Yeah.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have vital information for you.
Marie, what's happening? Help me!<eos> You got to help... mills, you find anything?<eos> I lost a suspect.<eos> They killed him before we could...<eos> I should never have trusted you.
I lost a suspect.<eos> They killed him before we could...<eos> I should never have trusted you.<eos> Salt? What?<eos> About you.
- because he gave them all up.<eos> - You saying he's a rat?<eos> - Then he's a dead man.<eos> - Not if he gets across the border.<eos> He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you.
You people are finished with Mejia.<eos> This is an FBI operation now.<eos> That's not your decision to make.<eos> It's a direct order. From the White House.<eos> He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you.
He's trying to get across to Mexico, but his network's broken.<eos> He can no longer trust his own people.<eos> And you think I still want to help him?<eos> What can he do to me?<eos> Without you, these children have no hope.
Hmm, I see.<eos> You are the lesser of two evil.<eos> Is that it? If you can smuggle children across the border, then you can send him back the same way.<eos> Does he know how you do it?<eos> You want me to help you?
You son of a...<eos> What do you think he will do now? Your Bryan Mills? Hmm?<eos> I'll tell you what he's going to do.<eos> He's going to play directly into my hands in Mexico where I have the advantage because I control everybody from the army to the police.<eos> He will come for you.
And you can take that straight to the bank, because he's been there, done that.<eos> Where'd they take him?<eos> _<eos> We already met, numbnuts.<eos> We know all about you, Tomas, from Carlos Mejia.
We all just having a good time here, right?<eos> Right. Please say your name and job title.<eos> Uh, Gretchen Lareau, Deputy Chief Moscow Station.<eos> Do you understand, Miss Lareau, that the proceedings of this chamber are classified secret?<eos> I do. Miss Lareau, did the two CIA case officers killed in Russia earlier this morning report to you?
- Langley says you set them up.<eos> - No, I didn't do that.<eos> I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you? - I don't know.
Do you want a ride?<eos> Ms. Grundy.<eos> Ms. Grundy.<eos> Geraldine.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?
Every corpse has as tale to tell.<eos> Step closer to the body.<eos> There are several morbid details you should find relevant to your article.<eos> What details, Dr. Curdle?<eos> What sticks out to you?
I'd love to stay, but I got to shake down an evil Adventure Scout. See you.<eos> ♪ 'Cause it ain't for you, no, it's all for me ♪<eos> ♪ Had a lot of people say they'd try to help ♪<eos> ♪ But they don't know the story, they just try to... ♪<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
I want the truth. Whatever it is.<eos> Whether you believe in order or chaos, in the end, it's the same...<eos> We are either in control of our lives, or merely think we are.<eos> Miss Veronica.<eos> Package arrived for you.
Oh, never mind, I see them.<eos> What the hell?<eos> There you are, Ms. Cooper.<eos> Mayor McCoy would like to review the evening's itinerary with you.<eos> What can I do for you, Mayor McCoy?
- Swagger still lives.<eos> - It's being handled.<eos> I don't like the unknown.<eos> Then get out of the espionage business.<eos> Perhaps we'll dig a hole for you, Mr. Meachum.
No.<eos> I almost got killed.<eos> You volunteered.<eos> You knew the risks.<eos> I betrayed everything I believed in for you.
Very well.<eos> What district were you from?<eos> Giessen. - You got here fast.<eos> - I was in the area.<eos> Does the name Golden Crescent mean anything to you?
I swear to you, I did not do anything.<eos> Please...<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I believe you.
This is a mission-oriented group, but Elijah is their leader.<eos> And it took years for him to plan this.<eos> Everything he does, he does for a reason.<eos> He chose all of these villages.<eos> Do they have any meaning to you?
I'm with the FBI.<eos> - You don't belong here, Jack.<eos> - Neither do these people.<eos> We are on our own path.<eos> It's not for you to judge.
And it's my fate to help others.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Sometimes, I... take a leap of faith.<eos> Other times, I deal with hard facts, like in this case.<eos> You tricked the women to join you here.
You will have sinned.<eos> All you ever wanted was power and control. You have that now.<eos> Now go ahead.<eos> Be a martyr.<eos> Killing yourself makes you a sinner in the eyes of your followers, and you don't want to do that.
- 'Cause you're acting weird.<eos> And you lie to people for a living.<eos> I don't.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Does "Pecados" mean anything to you?
Bobo Winthrop, you're under arrest for the murder of Aubrey Hamilton-Lowry.<eos> I didn't kill her!<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - I did not kill her!<eos> - Anything you say... can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Look, we have identified the murder weapon.<eos> It belonged to him.<eos> You've already decided he's guilty.<eos> I don't trust you with our friend.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't trust you either.
Let me see.<eos> So, you've got two kids?<eos> Yup.<eos> Nate is two, and Samantha is three and a half.<eos> That must be a lot for you and your wife.
Shouldn't come as a surprise.<eos> He's Billy Craig's boy.<eos> I'm his son.<eos> I'm nobody's boy.<eos> Good for you, Detective.
Valeria.<eos> My dad was a big fan of "Conan the Barbarian."<eos> He was also 16 at the time. "Val" works, too.<eos> Val Chavez from South Bureau.<eos> I've heard of you, too, Frank.
I'm not worried about my career, Detective.<eos> I'm worried about the kid.<eos> They gave you this case because they knew you'd do what you do...<eos> Break all the rules to get Haley back.<eos> They take you off your leash, and then they come after you for it.
You were asked to be a lion, Kyle.<eos> Are you trying to convince me or yourself?<eos> Why do you think I still wear the badge?<eos> I know some people who think you wear that badge because it's a license to steal.<eos> Of course, the few I met who still believe in you think you're out here trying to do right.
Mr. Javeed.<eos> You have me at a disadvantage.<eos> Police.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> More like what we can do for you.
Ma'am.<eos> Thanks for meeting me, Ken.<eos> You said it was important.<eos> Lina Farzan's out of the picture, just like I promised.<eos> And thanks to you, the girl's home, safe and sound.
You find the right lab, and you might be able to raise those numbers from the grave.<eos> This is Frank.<eos> I assume you know who this is.<eos> Figures you'd escape.<eos> Yeah, well... no thanks to you.
You're gonna be all right.<eos> I promise. How can you say that?<eos> You're setting me up with this, waitress job because you want them to find me.<eos> And we're gonna be with you the whole time, okay?<eos> As soon as Koslov sends his enforcers after you, Frank takes them out, then we move on to Koslov.
I think there is somebody out there preying on gangbangers.<eos> He's disciplined, professional, and he's smart.<eos> He hits rival gangs and makes the second hit look like a retaliation.<eos> Detectives clear the homicides from the first hit on the bodies of the second, whole department writes it off as gang violence, and El Cucuy just keeps on killing.<eos> But why did Los Muertos come after you?
We'll find a way to get them out.<eos> Ghost story.<eos> Urban legend.<eos> Somebody's shipment gets jacked, and they all say El Cucuy did it, like saying, "The dog ate my homework."<eos> But why did Los Muertos come after you?
Never misses it...<eos> not once, not in 20 years.<eos> He's the only father she's ever known.<eos> So, what'd you learn, trainee?<eos> You still haven't told me why Los Muertos sent Artemis after you.
All this time... you had me believe Frost was the enemy.<eos> That what we were doing was right.<eos> Now...<eos> I don't know what to believe.<eos> I've made sacrifices for you.
I think you need some help.<eos> I need your help.<eos> All right?<eos> You want to know more, Tom, and I can see it.<eos> I need you on board.
Previously on "Colony"...<eos> I'll believe you if you tell me that this was your wife's mistake and not yours.
Thank you.<eos> In troubled times, you can always turn to family.<eos> That's what the Greatest Day is all about.<eos> Family.<eos> Good luck to you.
Yeah. I think I will.<eos> I just have to call the office.<eos> Ms. Kenner.<eos> I am from the Global Authority's Intelligence Directorate.<eos> We have some questions for you.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's Toby, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?
It's where we are going.<eos> Are you prepared to accept that truth?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Will you safeguard the secrets of our movement, even from friends and family?<eos> And do you accept that the punishment for violating your oaths will fall not just upon you, but upon everyone you love?
lam going to the US to give Zuckerburg a run for his money.<eos> Not bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All the best.<eos> - Same to you.
Let me say hi to mom.<eos> Hi, dear.<eos> - Hi, mom.<eos> Let's go inside and talk.<eos> Tara, this is for you.
- Hmmmm...<eos> But I can't say the same for this hostel room.<eos> Do you like me or this?<eos> Of course this.<eos> This is how much I like you.
We're dead...it's the end.<eos> - Who's dead?<eos> We are, who else?<eos> I am not dead<eos> Would you like me to make some arrangements for you?
Feels like I am leaving something behind.<eos> Does Adi know?<eos> No!<eos> Tell me something.<eos> What's more important for you?
Where are you?<eos> - Just keep walking straight.<eos> Where?<eos> - You sound so sexy in that angry tone!<eos> Just let me get my hands on you... I will shoot you.
No, sir...<eos> Tara's mom is here.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Tell me...<eos> You fool, you should be thankful that they came to you.
I can look after myself.<eos> I see...did you grow up on your own?<eos> That's the most I could've done for you as your mother.<eos> I proposed marriage on your behalf to the guy you like.<eos> Asked for his hand in marriage...for you.
So how many days is that worth?<eos> Tara!<eos> You want me to keep it with me and always miss you.<eos> No.<eos> I want to keep that with me always so I can smile when I think of you.
Gopi uncle!<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Do you have a death wish?<eos> Hey...<eos> Wait there... I'll handle you.
- She was saying...<eos> - The white one.<eos> - This is exactly how she wants it done.<eos> - I see.<eos> I told her that our local tailor will sitch it for you.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Uncle doesn't know much about designs.<eos> I do.<eos> I'll stitch it for you.
"I've been trying to spin a web around you with my words." "My eyes always look for you."<eos> "Call it my insanity or my obsession."<eos> "Like an angel, that's you."<eos> "Like an angel, that's you."<eos> "If you hear my silence..." "They only talk about you."
Get me that traditional wear.<eos> Now this - heavy veil, traditional.<eos> One look from the groom's parents and their hearts will melt.<eos> This one with backless blouse - very modern.<eos> Once the groom lays eyes on you, he won't be able to look away.
- Myself Raj Batra.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Owner of Batra Fashion Studio.<eos> Here you go...<eos> This is for you.
- Do you drink whiskey?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How about a large?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Come on, I'll make one for you.
Why?<eos> What was that awful dance you were doing in there?<eos> Its Pia's favorite song.<eos> She's having so much fun... everyone's having fun.<eos> No one's having fun, Raj... they are making fun of you.
She's having so much fun... everyone's having fun.<eos> No one's having fun, Raj... they are making fun of you.<eos> I don't know why you don't understand this.<eos> You're out of Chandni Chowk, Raj, but...<eos> Chandni Chowk isn't out of you.
And then at 2 English class.<eos> - So madam, what now?<eos> - What?<eos> I would like to have a word with you.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Batra?
That's my promise.<eos> We hope that Principle Singhania will stay true to her promise.<eos> Now let's watch...<eos> How can you be so foolish, Raj?<eos> I did it for you... I couldn't see you tense anymore.
I love you.<eos> Now I got to teach him English.<eos> You didn't have to show off your talent.<eos> I am trying to give you a hint...<eos> Would it be insulting for you to just take a hint?
- Empty?<eos> You don't need to do Yoga in there.<eos> There was no place to get in... you say it's empty.<eos> We'll catch the next one.<eos> As if someone's already holding a seat for you in the next one.
She's not from here.<eos> I told you to weigh rice, just do that...<eos> She's new here, please forgive her.<eos> Close the shutter.<eos> No rations for you.
- Where is your boss?<eos> - Boss... he isn't here.<eos> He's out.<eos> I want to thank him.<eos> I'll thank him for you.
- I hope I get to see that generous man.<eos> - Shyam was very happy.<eos> The school got a complete make over.<eos> He was very happy.<eos> He brought bananas for you.
Here...<eos> Let's make this place shine together.<eos> Shyam, listen to me.<eos> He's a busy man, you'll need an appointment first.<eos> I'll get an appointment for you...
You did what you thought was right for your child.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now I'll do what's right, for my child.<eos> Watch what I will do.<eos> Raj... if he complains at Delhi Grammar School... - then the police will come for you. - No, they won't.

He's a degenerate.<eos> You tried to have him prosecuted for blasphemy, is that right?<eos> Someone had to stand up for Our Lord.<eos> - You were meant to keep us safe!<eos> - The threat was made against you.
- It is! He told me!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> "Go back to the old school.<eos> Look under the toadstool."<eos> The lyrics don't apply to you.
Ow!<eos> Here, that was crafty.<eos> It's called distraction.<eos> Off you go.<eos> And good luck to you and Jessie.
No-one ever thought I'd be able to fall, never mind carry.<eos> They were wrong, Nurse.<eos> Why can't they be wrong now?<eos> I so very, very much hope that they are.<eos> But I have a duty to care for you as much as for baby, and part of that's trying to prepare you.
We only fail when we do not try.<eos> Now, are you sure you don't want me to wait with you?<eos> Derek, I'll be fine.<eos> Go! Finish adapting the pram.<eos> Sorry, after you.
Now, are you sure you don't want me to wait with you?<eos> Derek, I'll be fine.<eos> Go! Finish adapting the pram.<eos> Sorry, after you.<eos> Here we are, Mr Marsh -- what a lovely welcome party for you.
I'm not letting her go through this alone.<eos> Sister Ursula has been perfectly clear -- there will be consequences.<eos> Consequences be damned.<eos> Mrs Reed is my patient.<eos> If I've learned one thing from Nonnatus, from you, it's that we do what's right for our patient.
I'll be with you in the operating theatre.<eos> Mrs Reed?<eos> You only have a moment.<eos> I don't want to lose my baby.<eos> Everyone will do all they can for you and baby.
Tell them that men like you should be protected.<eos> Stand up like this?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> Tell them what this accident has done to you, to Arthur.
♪ Keep us so near while apart... ♪<eos> 'However great the scale of injury or loss, 'our frailties and pains are made bearable by others, 'their thoughts, their deeds, their reaching out.<eos> 'Their love and our endurance make us human and complete.'<eos> Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.<eos> I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.
She shouldn't be "returned" or "sent" anywhere.<eos> She should be acting of her own free will.<eos> She was in no fit state to do so.<eos> If you had seen her, you would believe me when I say that.<eos> I don't disbelieve you.
- And not many of them would if society gave them much choice in the matter.<eos> I've mopped up more tears and dried up more milk supplies than you can shake a stick at.<eos> Adoption is always a very delicate and complicated issue.<eos> I was adopted myself, when I was two months old.<eos> Well, I'm sure that will make you much more sensitive
It must've been quite hard.<eos> It wasn't hard at all.<eos> Have you been in this situation before?<eos> I've been in this situation once.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you before I go?
P'raps things will be easier for you all when Trixie gets back.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Right you are, Nurse Busby.<eos> Chop chop.<eos> Back to cephalopelvic disproportion for you.
We'll get going, shall we?<eos> Quite a lot to do.<eos> Excellent idea.<eos> Please.<eos> After you.
She's one of my best customers.<eos> She keeps the wolf from the door, all right.<eos> Now, where d'you want it?<eos> - Um... - 'Bout there?<eos> That's a good length on you.
Ladies, may I introduce Nurse Valerie Dyer, our latest recruit.<eos> - Welcome!<eos> - Hello.<eos> Shall we do our level best to convince her that we operate like a well-oiled machine?<eos> We've heard a lot about you.
I'm not qualified to pull teeth out with pliers.<eos> Toothache is absolutely vile, I know.<eos> Why don't you let me take a little look?<eos> If you don't let me, I won't be able to help.<eos> Oh, gosh, poor you.
What treatment?<eos> It's called electroconvulsive therapy.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I'll be knocked out and when I open my eyes again, things will have been done to me without me knowing!<eos> We believe it would be the most suitable treatment for you.
He's got the future of the Free World in his hands!<eos> If he was truly concerned about the future of the Free World, he wouldn't be making such inflammatory remarks.<eos> If we're all heading for oblivion, we need to be prepared.<eos> There you are, Nurse Franklin.<eos> There's a gentleman on the telephone asking for you, a Mr Christopher Dockerill?
No!<eos> I have more to do.<eos> And you can do it tomorrow when you're rested.<eos> Remember, taking your vows isn't about what's in those books, it's about what's in your heart.<eos> Your love for God and his for you.
There was a ticket.<eos> And... And it was time.<eos> She's gone to be cut.<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you let her go when you could've died from what they did to you?
Wait.<eos> October 4th, October 4th... was the day Cyrus won the vice presidential debates.<eos> Admiral Ballard didn't have a problem with free college when it was his college.<eos> He just doesn't want other Americans to have the same opportunities he had.<eos> Admiral Ballard, given your roots, I expected a little more from you.
I...<eos> I just came for my camera.<eos> That's it.<eos> Jennifer... would you excuse us for a second?<eos> She was a threat to you, sir.
Mellie, you are the next President of the United States.<eos> Come on, Els.<eos> Let Daddy go.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
The people don't know that you're sick.<eos> They think that you are some immortal ball of light.<eos> You have to tell them the truth!<eos> That is not the truth!<eos> Look at you!
Before today I'd never seen that face in my life.<eos> This is the man that saved your life, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But what does that matter, he's dead now.<eos> I know it's been a hell of a day for you, Suzanne.
Prioritise, people.<eos> Victims with vitals first.<eos> No heartbeat?<eos> No treatment.<eos> Dr Todd, we need you.
Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Here's the file you requested.<eos> Agent Sanders, they want you upstairs.
Shut up, son.<eos> - We run a clean shop.<eos> - Clean?<eos> Other than the $100 million in drug money that you and your father collect and transport to these two gentlemen to launder?<eos> Clean to you.
Occasionally.<eos> It's cool.<eos> - I've been having a really good time. - Oh.<eos> Wanted to meet you for awhile.<eos> I mean, Joel, he loves you, you know?
Different.<eos> But, um, at home, not bad, like Alexei say.<eos> It's not easy being in a new place.<eos> I was really worried about Tuan-- uprooting him in the middle of a school year and bringing him someplace new, with us working so much.<eos> At least you're home if Pasha needs you.
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.<eos> I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him whether or not you're here.<eos> And you trust their loyalty?<eos> You trust he hasn't been speaking to them all behind your back?<eos> Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.
Animality Virus, professor.<eos> A-Virus, for short.<eos> Your B.O.W.s can tell who they're supposed to attack.<eos> That's a good selling point for a weapon.<eos> Engineering them with that trait must have been difficult for you.
I'm impressed.<eos> How did you figure it out?<eos> I noticed a huge concentration of outbreaks around the Great Lakes.<eos> Which just so happens to be a major source of drinking water.<eos> But they weren't planned by you.
Because I'm still here.<eos> He's got plans for me.<eos> Long as I'm around, he's not going anywhere.<eos> Why did you come to me?<eos> 'Cause I trust you. What you did for my sister.
He just knew.<eos> Had a bunch of names and sent me out to get them.<eos> And you did.<eos> You... Heh, you think he's just some sick old man?<eos> That he's afraid of you?
"I've been wandering from one shore to another" "that I've lost my own abode."<eos> "What has happened?"<eos> "I fell so deeply..."<eos> "Watching you from shadows is painful."<eos> "Don't wish to die in shadows, away from you."
That night, when they... - Betel leaf.<eos> Do you still chew betel leaf?<eos> I stopped that long ago.<eos> And you... do you still eat beef?<eos> We would specially prepare it for you.
Why?<eos> Not in the mood today, Mr. Shyam?<eos> Have you found another scapegoat?<eos> Have some shame, Begum Jaan.<eos> These are top officials from India and Pakistan and they have legal orders for you.
Dear me!<eos> Listen, Sujeet.<eos> Don't cry like a woman.<eos> Get away, you whore!<eos> I can't bear the fact that any scumbag can touch you!
I am not hungry.<eos> Don't you have a stomachache tonight?<eos> Standing there with a sad face.<eos> Go, get my hookah.<eos> I'll speak to the teacher about you.
And in return, I expect only a little something.<eos> I hope you remember.<eos> Sure, Your Highness.<eos> Whenever you get a new girl, the first right to break her in<eos> Belongs to you.
"Let me hug them tightly" "and bless them from the bottom of my heart."<eos> "Your 'bindi' shimmers, bangles clinker" "and you're glowing in the veil." "May the kohl, the flowers are lovely"<eos> "and your body and heart are thrilled." "May you be unharmed, untainted" "and every inch of your body glows."<eos> "O bearer, slow the palanquin"<eos> "I've laid the stars on your pillow" "while the moon sings for you." "The beautiful night queen"
Let me make one thing clear, teacher.<eos> Begum is beyond your grasp.<eos> But I really...<eos> - What nonsense, teacher!<eos> Do you know there's someone who can give her life for you?
- What nonsense, teacher!<eos> Do you know there's someone who can give her life for you?<eos> I thought you wanted to talk about her.<eos> I don't understand what you really want.<eos> I want you.
And then Begum Jaan tried to seduce me.<eos> When I said, I love Gulabo she had me thrown out of the house.<eos> But Begum Jaan was saying that...<eos> - You don't trust me.<eos> I left my home and town and fighting for you.
But Begum Jaan was saying that...<eos> - You don't trust me.<eos> I left my home and town and fighting for you.<eos> I even went against the party's decision.<eos> I keep thinking about you every moment.
But no one ever listens to me.<eos> Listen, brother, I have nothing to do with them.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Why did you send me away forever?<eos> What will Ruby do without you?
Where do you think you're going?<eos> Rascals!<eos> Uncle Salim!<eos> Uncle Salim!<eos> We evicted them for you.
I... I should be somewhere I can reflect and work on myself.<eos> Someplace safe.<eos> - The staff of the institute is finely trained in the latest advancements in medicine.<eos> And my dear friend Dr. Cairn is at the forefront of psychiatric treatment.<eos> - If it's what you recommend. We trust you.
Please!<eos> - Gunther.<eos> Where's Margaret?<eos> - Don't worry, ma'am.<eos> I'll take care of you.
Twenty-three.<eos> "Huh," what?<eos> Hard to believe you're the future.<eos> Thank God I'll be dead.<eos> I like you, old lady.
Thank God.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Warm welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Late night for you, Pastor.
I was up waiting for you and I was upset about how we parted ways.<eos> Pastor Ian's been counseling us since the accident and last night, he offered to keep me company.<eos> He was worried about you, Holden.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad he was there for you, Mom.
What you did... that was the opposite of discreet.<eos> Frost instructed me to find something out...<eos> And yet that moronic show and tell wasn't the worst of it.<eos> Your blunt-force tactics have likely spooked Holden, not that I blame him.<eos> He'll involve law enforcement... If he hasn't already... And photos of you in that hideous...
Because I always know what my guys are going to do.<eos> You're safe with them.<eos> I get that.<eos> But you...<eos> Your friend needed you to dig a bullet out of his shoulder, so you dug a bullet out of his shoulder.
I'm nowhere near as good-looking as that guy.<eos> - Take that off.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna be here for the next two weeks. Make sure things run smooth at our new Silver Lake store.<eos> But I'm thinking maybe I can steal some secrets from you, teach them how to run a good business. What do you say?
- So, you have no idea who this is?<eos> - I don't know who it is.<eos> - We know Jay's your coke dealer.<eos> And I'm confident if we looked at the surveillance drives we could verify he was here this morning.<eos> We don't care about you.
Will you actually pay for the tickets this time?<eos> How else am I gonna get 'em, nerd?<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Don't forget to call me.<eos> You can reject God, but he will not reject you.
- We all really enjoyed that, Danny.<eos> - Just because I'm running a business here you think I got some kind of white-collar crime going on here.<eos> It's fucking racist, man.<eos> - Good day, Mr. Bryant.<eos> - Good day to you.
That's considered felony theft.<eos> I don't know what footage you're referring to.<eos> Would you do me a favor?<eos> Go down to my office, and ask Mr. Winters if he knows where I am.<eos> Danny's hiding from you in the back room.
I've seen what's out there. But the Realm is violent.<eos> It's unrelenting and it doesn't want us there.<eos> I spent all those years surviving.<eos> I'm not going through that again.<eos> Certainly not for you.
Move it. Stop there.<eos> You collaborate, you die.<eos> This doesn't...<eos> This doesn't look good.<eos> Gonna hang this on you.
That's what you came here to tell me?<eos> My source was Simon Eckhart, the English guy from Apis.<eos> He'd been calling me from public pay phones, but he stopped.<eos> I don't know if Broussard got to him or if he just got cold feet.<eos> Why was he calling you?
I don't think so.<eos> I have a day job.<eos> I have actual, meaningful work to do.<eos> She is your problem now.<eos> Admiral Ballard, given your roots, I expected a little more from you.
She's a child.<eos> I think I'm more attractive to women now than when I was 25.<eos> What?<eos> You are the most powerful man in the world.<eos> These women are not hot for you.
Unfortunately... My business is quite legitimate, Ms. Whelan... as am I.<eos> Yet you're here with $300 million to be a part of a... a team?<eos> My team? My team doesn't exist.<eos> Not yet, at least, but the funding does...<eos> All set up in a PAC account, controlled by you and you alone.
Yeah, I'm not worried.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about me?<eos> Yes, sir. You are the president.<eos> It is always about you!
I have to call them!<eos> Please!<eos> Miss Whelan?<eos> Not now.<eos> I have a package for you from our friends.
You don't want Cyrus to die in prison, now, do you?<eos> Where's Huck's body?<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> I don't like you.
It's just... It's not good for a guy like me.<eos> Yep, this is it.<eos> Gonna start fresh tomorrow.<eos> I think that's great.<eos> You can be your best self.
Yeah, as, uh, an actor, your body is your instrument.<eos> That's so true.<eos> You know, when I'm performing, I'm never just delivering a line.<eos> I'm... vibrating.<eos> No wonder the ladies love you so much.
Me, just, like, so grateful.<eos> You, a goddamn angel.<eos> I don't know that I would go calling me an angel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And like an angel, it's better for you to just stay at a distance.
You went through something pretty horrible down there, whatever you're feeling is okay.<eos> I'm a marine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You know, I served with your father.<eos> He would have been very proud of you.
- You think I am making it up.<eos> - No. No.<eos> I believe you saw something.<eos> Now you say it was a drone, okay.<eos> What I wanna know is why is that so important to you?
Right, with Sarah stranded and Kira missing, and no word from Cosima?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Well, get packing, mister.<eos> Bell.<eos> I got a present for you.
Yeah. Thank you, Winn.<eos> You know, I'm pretty good in a crisis.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> We can see that.<eos> I don't like you.
I'm even suspicious that maybe you don't really need those glasses to see.<eos> I do.<eos> I think you see pretty clearly.<eos> But those are all the suspicions that I'm prepared to share with you today in your professional capacity.<eos> Were you aware that the U. S. Attorney was pursuing charges against you in connection with a firearms disturbance by one of your employees?
We tried to help you to rid yourself of it so you could be free.<eos> - All right, this is it.<eos> - We're recording. - There's so many like you that come to us, frozen by their actions.<eos> And that is why the exemption is so very important to us, Lisa.<eos> You understand? We want to be able to help others like we helped you, because what you did will never, ever go away.
The dudes. It's over.<eos> - The riot's over?<eos> - Holy shit. They're coming to rescue us?<eos> "Us"?<eos> They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.
Look, hey, no judgments.<eos> Whatever you're into.<eos> But it doesn't really feel like the right time for kinky stuff.<eos> You gonna be my human shield, papi.<eos> They wanna kill me... they gotta get through you first.
You!<eos> You're the reason Poussey is gone.<eos> T, don't do this.<eos> They ain't never gonna give us Bayley.<eos> But now I got you.
They're nervous as cats, but they don't know anything.<eos> Maybe we could get, uh, a message to her, if you want to come back.<eos> We're ready, sir.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> It's for you.
And... Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.<eos> I've actually been expecting you.<eos> It's natural to feel resistance to the truth of The Greatest Day.<eos> After all, faith is about struggle, and I see how hard you've been struggling to accept your new reality, but I want to assure you, Mrs. Bowman, that I'm not just there to help Gracie and Charlie.<eos> I'm there for you, too.
Like I said, they're sisters.<eos> How often does your wife go visit Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone?<eos> What's with all the questions?<eos> I just want to get to know the Bowman family a little bit better.<eos> Let's talk about you, Bob.
Things are trending upward in the bloc.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll have to remember to remain optimistic as we're all being renditioned.<eos> Find the pilot.<eos> It'll be good for you and your bloc.
Growth of the Greatest Day, expansion of our security apparatus... our youth.<eos> None of that matters.<eos> You came to me with a plan to fix the bloc, and you have failed.<eos> I'm not the one who went to the IGA and made promises I couldn't keep.<eos> I made those promises because I misplaced my trust in you.
Whole town blew up.<eos> What town?<eos> Come on. She's in back.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They're asking for you.
"Questions." The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> - He might.<eos> - No, He won't.<eos> He'll turn His head and stare through you like glass.
Peng Hong.<eos> Well<eos> I'll get him caught.<eos> If it's really Peng Hong.<eos> He'll will come for you anyway.
And I have nothing to comment regarding those issues.<eos> Once again I state. The government will not yield to any vicious power.<eos> Looking at the trades yesterday and this morning. Man Chung's market value has hit 20 30 billion.<eos> If one had invested in its derivatives the returns would be incredible!<eos> Here is a new job for you.
Are you ready?<eos> Yes, the choppers are coming.<eos> Copy.<eos> General, we are setting off in an hour.<eos> When you enter the uncontrolled airspace, my men will take care of you.
Aw, he eats the same way I do, without swallowing.<eos> You've flown south for the winter with my heart. Ow!<eos> I hope this bite never heals.<eos> When I wrote an advice book, I never dreamed it would help anyone.<eos> Everything I am I owe to you.
Interesting.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> Either you're doing an incredibly shitty job or you're no longer in control of the people who work for you.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Sir. We've received priority message for you.
Tortoise shell.<eos> 17 shillings and ninepence ha'penny.<eos> There you go, then, Mr Greely.<eos> You just rest up there a bit.<eos> Bit of company for you there, look.
No, he's not going to retire. Not as far as I know.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm just trying to build up a picture.<eos> - And have you spoken to Susan?<eos> I haven't mentioned you.
11-year-old girl at Long Hampton Hospital, died in your care.<eos> - I was cleared of any involvement.<eos> - From the testimony of Sister MacMahon.<eos> Insulin overdose, wasn't it?<eos> Administered by you.
- Yes, of course.<eos> Edgar was always very decent to me.<eos> Well, he always had a weakness for failures.<eos> The Assistant Chief Constable was a golfing friend of Edgar's.<eos> I asked him about you.
The Assistant Chief Constable was a golfing friend of Edgar's.<eos> I asked him about you.<eos> And he said that you'd never amount to much.<eos> You didn't even pass your sergeant's exam.<eos> You see, I was right about you, even then.
You probably don't remember Molly Keenan's cousin at all, do you?<eos> The young girl who rang for help, but nobody came.<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Well, she remembers you, both of you.
- With whom?<eos> - The appropriate ministry.<eos> Turn the car around, sir.<eos> Look, in the last two hours, I have spoken to the Atomic Energy Authority, who referred me to the MoD.<eos> The MoD have referred me to the Permanent Undersecretary's office, who referred me to you.
Maybe he spoiled the pack because he thought he could change his future.<eos> Why?<eos> What did they predict?<eos> That a woman would bring him to ruin.<eos> I could do a reading for you, if you like.
What can you tell me about Bramford mere?<eos> There are things in the world older than you know.<eos> We come and go.<eos> But the land endures.<eos> Behind you...
I'm sorry.<eos> - Levin, can you stop...<eos> - Get away from there, Doctor.<eos> Judas!<eos> I believed in you!
No, no, no, no, no, you can't take him!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Ahh! You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - No, don't take him!<eos> - Anything you say or eat will be used against you in the court of law.
I should've nailed the door shut.<eos> - Hey, sir.<eos> - I should... what...<eos> Do you need help?<eos> Is there someone I could call for you?
Like I told you, he's being protected by something very powerful.<eos> And that's the part I'm having a hard time understanding.<eos> Well, maybe you could understand this.<eos> I'm done taking orders,<eos> I'm done with Black Claw, and I'm done with you.
Nurse Barton will be in to help you get in bed, okay?<eos> Anything else you need?<eos> Maybe some water?<eos> Who... who are you?<eos> I'm your friend, Mason, who helps take care of you.
Look, I know it sounds insane, but I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I-I've taken care of Mrs. Cutler for three years.<eos> She was my friend.<eos> Why would I hurt her?<eos> I believe you, Mason.
Wu, I need you to write down a number. We need a location quick.<eos> I'm going with ya.<eos> - They'll find him.<eos> - I was just trying to keep him from wandering away at night.<eos> I know the melatonin wasn't for you.
- Excuse me?<eos> - You said you were up on a wire, so you would've heard all the chatter.<eos> Yakuza feeding their people bogus intel trying to root out the snitch.<eos> It wasn't Carlos they were after, was it?<eos> They were onto you.
"Homey."<eos> Get me Lockhart.<eos> Capture that call.<eos> The FBI set my informant up to die.<eos> Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- Yeah.<eos> You sailed in here on your dead daddy's rep.<eos> Frank told me.<eos> What?<eos> He promised Billy he'd look after you, and that's why you're here.
But not anymore.<eos> I know Frank will do whatever it takes to solve my dad's murder.<eos> And so will I.<eos> So, where do me and Tommy fit into all of this?<eos> 'Cause, like it or not, our fates are tied to you and Frank.
Well, even if I could make that happen, why would I?<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> There has to be something you need done.<eos> Someone.<eos> You know, I just might have something for you.
You really think now is the right time?<eos> Look, I'm ready to pull the goalie... if you are.<eos> Detective Rourke, I see you have no attorney present.<eos> Don't need one.<eos> You are aware, a verdict against you will result in your immediate termination and surrender of your department-issued firearm and badge?
Come to think of it, County is really only good for one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> Busting out.<eos> All right.<eos> Best of luck to you, Butler.
A woman who was forced out of hiding by the fire.<eos> Kullen didn't bury that money somewhere out there.<eos> He gave it to her... someone he knew he could trust.<eos> It means, whoever she is, Wade's hunting her, too.<eos> We'll take care of you. Step right up.
He was a south-end gunfighter who died in a gunfight.<eos> Hell, I'll take a Blaze of glory over bed sores in a nursing home any day.<eos> I'd say Gus went out the way he wanted to.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Ranger's asking for you.
for the last time, Sliger, where's Henry and Bobby Hollister?<eos> Cram it, moon doggy.<eos> Pull the blinds, Tommy.<eos> We'll get him to talk the old-fashioned way.<eos> Hands off my client, detective, or I'll have you up on charges!
You're about to be sent into a den of hyenas, where most men come out feral beasts stripped of their humanity, but not you.<eos> Do your time with your head down and your mouth shut.<eos> Don't join a gang.<eos> Don't hustle on the side.<eos> Swear to that, and I'll Shepherd you through.
Don't hustle on the side.<eos> Swear to that, and I'll Shepherd you through.<eos> Why would you do that for me?<eos> 'Cause we're both our father's sons.<eos> But that doesn't have to define us -- not you and not me.
Frank never fully recovered after losing Billy.<eos> I know this is a lot to ask, Kyle.<eos> I know who Frank is, how he can be.<eos> Please just watch out for him the way your dad did.<eos> He needs you.
We can't tell you that.<eos> Detective, I thought Chief Lockhart and I made ourselves perfectly clear about Gary Millstone.<eos> You're in a courtroom trying to out-lawyer him while he's out here being an outlaw.<eos> So Millstone's the outlaw?<eos> I hope that irony isn't lost on you, Detective.
Not with me, not with the D.A.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Crying shame about the criminal element in this city.<eos> If only lawyers like you weren't so good at getting them off.<eos> This is low even for you, Rourke.
Hard to believe a couple of L.A. street cops got the drop on two armed feds.<eos> Remember that crack you made earlier about the ATF incinerating all those nut bags down in Waco?<eos> Well, that was done live on national TV.<eos> So, you can just imagine what I can do when there are no cameras rollin'.<eos> The name Jennifer Mitchell mean anything to you?
I-I really don't appreciate you showing up here.<eos> I got a dead escort and another one missing.<eos> Guess what these gals have in common?<eos> Councilman Ken Patterson.<eos> Both of them were on their way to see you, which makes you what we call a person of interest.
We need to lure them to us somehow.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> I'm sorry you got pulled into this.<eos> Frank and I, we were always destined to end in killing.<eos> But I got nothing against you.
It was just a mix-up. - Thank you, Louis.<eos> Do you think I'm still gonna have to defend myself about my relationship with Mike?<eos> - I don't know, Rachel, but I do know we're gonna do whatever it takes to make sure you become a lawyer.<eos> - I'm seeing someone.<eos> - These aren't for you.
- I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't.<eos> - Yeah, I'll tell ya why you can't.<eos> Because a squeaky clean guy like you doesn't come to a guy like me unless he's got no choice, and you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you, so why don't you give me a call
- Yes.<eos> A man standing on the surface of ganymede without a vac suit.<eos> Are you absolutely sure about that?<eos> So you think I'm crazy.<eos> I think we asked too much of you too soon.
So what happens now?<eos> Now you go home back to Mars.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then we do what's best for you and for the corps.
It didn't feel like a conversation to me.<eos> The thing you saw on ganymede?<eos> It was real.<eos> Here.<eos> This is what attacked you and your team, isn't it?
By your own government.<eos> Fuck you, ma'am.<eos> Sergeant, I wish to god it was my government.<eos> Then I would have some control over the situation.<eos> But right now, all I have is you.
I know I shouldn't say anything, but are you sure you wanna sell this?<eos> I know.<eos> It's, um...<eos> It's bittersweet.<eos> You know, our doors will always be open to you, Sally.
When do you wanna do the handoff?<eos> Tomorrow, nine o'clock, his place.<eos> And I've talked to him.<eos> He promises me he'll be ready.<eos> I know this is hard for you.
Probably wondering what my deal is.<eos> I'm kind of between relationships at the moment.<eos> Doing it pretty tough, to be honest.<eos> Yep, I know what that's like.<eos> So what can I do for you?
I'm kind of between relationships at the moment.<eos> Doing it pretty tough, to be honest.<eos> Yep, I know what that's like.<eos> So what can I do for you?<eos> I mean, you could be asking yourself what could I do for you?
So what can I do for you?<eos> I mean, you could be asking yourself what could I do for you?<eos> Like what?<eos> Seven or eight of the best nights of your life, complete discretion, total respect.<eos> Look, I'm attracted to you, all right?
- Yeah.<eos> I was thinking we should get back in the studio, Courtney.<eos> Maybe noodle around with some new tunes.<eos> With all due respect, Sandy, I understand that, but, uh, her existing record's gonna be on the charts for months.<eos> You don't want her competing against herself now, do you?
- Thanks.<eos> How is traffic out there?<eos> Traffic's not a problem.<eos> You sit back, relax.<eos> Let Firuz take good care of you.
Burrito is perfectly rated.<eos> It's cheap, portable, passably nutritious.<eos> What's a total racket is the fajita.<eos> You know, here's all the ingredients of a meal.<eos> We'll heat it up for you, but you're gonna put it together.
Oh, dear, you're not funny.<eos> - I know why you're here.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> Mm-hmm. Yes.<eos> I'm getting a very strong feeling from you.
End of the day Friday.<eos> Anywhere else would take longer.<eos> My shit brother's place?<eos> Two weeks.<eos> Jesus, what the hell happened between you and your brother?
You're welcome.<eos> Dax.<eos> Okay, no lie, you are the least helpful human being on the planet.<eos> Where did he say I should just look?<eos> This is perfect space for you.
Top floor.<eos> It's more money, but you like.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> No, hey. No, hey.<eos> For you, I kill dogs!
Now!<eos> It's actually very funny in this country.<eos> You want office space?<eos> Yeah. But it's gotta be better than this dump.<eos> I have nothing for you.
Yeah. But it's gotta be better than this dump.<eos> I have nothing for you.<eos> Really?<eos> What about the bigger space on the top floor?<eos> No. That one's not for you.
Well, he called me.<eos> And I wanted to come have a little chat with you before you got it into your head that you could go behind my back and cut a deal without an admission of guilt.<eos> - Look, I don't give a shit how much you offered, you're not gonna buy your way out of this thing without telling the world what you did.<eos> I don't think you understand what the word settlement means.<eos> I understand what it means to you,
Which means this thing is gonna drag on forever.<eos> And we're gonna drop the hammer on him as soon as he gets to Harvey's.<eos> Now I don't wanna see you again until I meet you for the first time at that hearing.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> I hired Harvey to do a job, he farmed it out to you against my will and you're gonna God damn listen to me.
Hello.<eos> I'm friends with your grandson... Principal Novak, and I have something in Serbian I need translated.<eos> - He said you might be able to help me.<eos> - I knows nothing about you.
Maybe we'll hold onto them.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - You got him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The problem is, Vincent, is that we know she danced for you right before this happened.
He didn't do anything!<eos> We know about the threats you made, in case you're wondering, "What am I doing here?"<eos> You want to tell us about Vincent Avinell?<eos> Nothing to say about him.<eos> He's scared of you.
Ms. Lewis, I didn't say...<eos> I did not say that.<eos> Look, all we can do is we work a case, we go where it takes us.<eos> Please let us do that.<eos> I'm trusting you.
I did not say that.<eos> Look, all we can do is we work a case, we go where it takes us.<eos> Please let us do that.<eos> I'm trusting you.<eos> All of us... we're trusting you.
He was big.<eos> The kind of guy... you just walk right by him.<eos> Said he killed 100 girls.<eos> Must be some kind of record.<eos> I'm not gonna lay a hand on you, 'cause I don't want to...
We caught a case.<eos> That... That means we gotta roll.<eos> No, no.<eos> That's...<eos> That's for you.
I do...<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> This is Zoey's desk.<eos> Was.<eos> How long did Zoey work for you?
I had nothing to do with that girl.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you've had these urges for a long, long time.<eos> And you've resisted them.<eos> But when this thing with your roommate went down, something shifted for you.
You turned it into a publicity stunt.<eos> You already had plenty of publicity ... destruction of public property, assault, armed robbery ...<eos> I never carry a weapon.<eos> You are the weapon.<eos> The public was turning against you. Now?
- He's an Inhuman.<eos> Then why hasn't he changed?<eos> Vijay still looks the same.<eos> He's shown no new abilities.<eos> 'Cause he was hiding them from you.
- I can assemble a team.<eos> - That won't be necessary.<eos> I think it's time The Superior sends some men of his own.<eos> I trust they'll be able to get the job done.<eos> But there is one thing I still need from you ... get rid of the body.
Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.<eos> You'll have to stay here for now until your substitute has served her purpose.<eos> I said the new Director should be a powered person the public could trust.<eos> And they came up with you.
I said the new Director should be a powered person the public could trust.<eos> And they came up with you.<eos> Look, we're both Inhuman.<eos> Why not make the most of it?<eos> The public was turning against you.
What do we know about this guy Daisy grabbed?<eos> Who's he working for?<eos> Would you stop hounding me with questions?<eos> Get in there and ask him yourself.<eos> I need you in the interrogation room.
Apparently, I am unwelcome at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, so she's all on her own.<eos> This is unprecedented technology at play here.<eos> I need to keep an eye on her.<eos> The slightest miscalculation could reveal her true nature.<eos> I have confidence in you, Doctor.
Zaikin had partners.<eos> I'm the highest-ranking agent here, and contingency protocols grant me greater access if the Director is missing in action.<eos> I know that.<eos> I wrote the damn protocols.<eos> Besides, I have an assignment for you.
Explains why you were so eager to find Burrows.<eos> God, I shouldn't have dragged him into this.<eos> And you two...<eos> I hate that you're out here without protection.<eos> What, you think we need you to protect us?
It was the other way around, too.<eos> I learned a lot undercover.<eos> I can't deny Hydra had some very persuasive interrogation methods.<eos> You like statistics.<eos> Here's one for you...
General?<eos> Could we have the room, please?<eos> What?<eos> You're taking his side?<eos> After everything we've done for you?
I'll call a press conference... resign... reinstate you as Director.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.<eos> Sure, you lied, but you were good at it, even with a gun pointed at you, and that's not nothing.
Mack or no Mack, I'm urging you to reconsider the second part of this mission.<eos> Which part is the second part again? The stupid part.<eos> Ah.<eos> Nadeer's office.<eos> If she discovers you've launched an unauthorized investigation into her, it's gonna trigger an investigation into you.
And the other half, you're not giving me the full story.<eos> We're like the odd couple here.<eos> Gentlemen, we have a mission.<eos> At the very least, we need a contingency plan.<eos> If she comes after you, she's gonna want S.H.I.E.L.D. records, S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.
We need to get ahead of her.<eos> Yeah, but you have to say that, don't you?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Perhaps you are going to be a problem after all.<eos> I like you, agent May.
I'm good at that.<eos> You?<eos> You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?<eos> The foster homes, bouncing around.<eos> I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.
This move just exposed the fact that we have a leak.<eos> Someone tipped Nadeer off we were coming.<eos> You opposed the op.<eos> Did you warn her?<eos> I believed in you when no one else did, Phil.
"Your own people"!<eos> That's delightful.<eos> Please, believe me, everyone is gonna come out of this all right.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Once I tell Coulson, it might be rough for you.
We've been surveilling her, but she seems uncompromised.<eos> Well, let's hope she can lead us to Agent May.<eos> So how can I help?<eos> You're doing it.<eos> Mm, I want to be here for you, Phil.
I'm ...<eos> No.<eos> Nooo!<eos> You thought it was me?<eos> Look at you.
- No, I'm not.<eos> I'm living out the rest of my life on my terms, and that means having nothing to do with Holden Radcliffe.<eos> I understand your situation, and I don't want to make you cooperate, - but if I have to ...<eos> - I wake up and face death every day.<eos> You think I'm scared of you?
- How did you get out?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> Give me a chance to prove myself.<eos> - I know that I can ...<eos> - How am I supposed to trust you?
Superior.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear.<eos> I leave the city now.<eos> You've made it far too great a risk to even be in this country.<eos> We both know S.H.I.E.L.D. will come for you and try to take you down.
Even though she would've stormed off 20 minutes ago.<eos> I like this woman.<eos> - I'll wait a little longer.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> For you.
I can still be that soldier.<eos> You still have my attention.<eos> The plan hasn't changed.<eos> I will deliver S.H.I.E.L.D. to you.<eos> - Anything else I can do for you? - Yeah.
Aida, what have I told you about pulling me out of ...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You interrupted a rousing discourse - on pre-"Weekend" Godard .versus ...<eos> - You spend too much time as of late in your fantasyland, Doctor.<eos> I need you here.
You see the mining facility in this picture?<eos> He owns it.<eos> Purchased by Anton Ivanov this year.<eos> It's the only thing here that ties back to him.<eos> Does it tie back to you, too?
- Car.<eos> Earth to Coulson.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> It means we're going to Russia.<eos> It's good to see there's still some fight left in you.
Do you know what this means?<eos> It means we're going to Russia.<eos> It's good to see there's still some fight left in you.<eos> But I should expect as much from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Inhuman director.<eos> You're the one they take orders from.
Do my methods disturb you?<eos> Do you feel sympathy for the thing you attempt to emulate?<eos> I was programmed to observe human behavior.<eos> Yours is... different than most I have experienced.<eos> I have no opinion on you or your methods.
You see?<eos> Yours is not the only life Agent Coulson has so easily tossed aside or hidden behind.<eos> This is what he does.<eos> Everything is his S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> The Government, behind you, Director, behind Nick Fury, Stark, all of it, stands Agent Coulson, quietly pursuing his alien agenda.
You were one of the SVR agents at the mining facility.<eos> - That was your unit. - Da.<eos> And they were killed for not retrieving the object stolen from our soil.<eos> When I looked for who did, I found S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And after years of looking behind S.H.I.E.L.D., I found you.
I didn't bring you here to die.<eos> - I'm going to save you.<eos> - I'm not afraid to go.<eos> One of my prime directives is to protect the Framework.<eos> - And I need you alive to do that.
Untouched.<eos> - This body is mechanical, yes.<eos> You're controlling it remotely.<eos> Some reading, if you're interested.<eos> I need you walking around, able to continue protecting the Framework.
You are Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and your subconscious knows that!<eos> You need to go.<eos> You need to remember me!<eos> And Fitz and Agent May and all the good that we have done!<eos> Your friends depend on you, and this world is a lie!
I don't know you.<eos> Now leave.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> But I am not giving up on you, sir.
Hipster, even.<eos> That's not how my ex-wife saw it.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> I'm not remotely qualified to be here.<eos> I know the real Coulson, and I believe in you, even if you don't just now.
- It's over.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> This isn't the world I'd intended.<eos> Things have gone dreadfully wrong.<eos> Maybe not so much for you.
- That's absurd.<eos> - It's the truth, my boy.<eos> - You even helped me build Aida. - Enough!<eos> We're done here.<eos> Then why don't I remember you?
Has one of your playthings rebelled?<eos> Agent may has begun to question the narrative she was programmed with.<eos> How very human of her.<eos> It is no more than a slight complication.<eos> Then I will un-complicate it for you.
She'd have been quite the terrible teenage daughter.<eos> I think you're missing the bigger picture.<eos> This machine can build you a body in the other world.<eos> You can have a second life or a third or however many you want.<eos> That's up to you.
Dad!<eos> Dad...<eos> Something's not right here.<eos> People are staring at us.<eos> No, they're staring at you.
Do you know where Simmons went? - No, sorry.<eos> - She went to find Alistair Fitz.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you come and tell me?<eos> Because I don't answer to you, not here or any other fantasy world you two might have cooked up.
Have you been eating enough?<eos> Keeping your, um, stress levels under control?<eos> Yeah, making it my priority.<eos> I know this is hard, but... you need to take care of yourself.<eos> All right? Especially with... everything that you're going through.
Wine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, I usually order the, um...<eos> Maybe...<eos> Why don't I choose one for you?
I'm applying for a big job today.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Well, you don't seem like you need much luck, but... good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No work for you today?
I heard.<eos> So, now I've got my work to do and your shopping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning to you.
And then she descends, with a stupid smile, to her bloody end.<eos> That girl is a fucking moron.<eos> Come in.<eos> Please, God, don't let me be a fucking moron.<eos> Close the door behind you.
You will stay here, and you will not leave this room.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Things can get much worse for you.
Do you understand me?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Waterford.<eos> Things can get much worse for you.<eos> The stitches will come out in a few days.<eos> I know this is a shock for you, Emily.
Things can get much worse for you.<eos> The stitches will come out in a few days.<eos> I know this is a shock for you, Emily.<eos> You can still have children, of course.<eos> But things will be so much easier for you now.
What is wrong with you?<eos> Do not let them grind you down.<eos> You keep your fucking shit together.<eos> You fight!<eos> Saved it for you.
If your daughter misses school again, she's going to be suspended.<eos> Suspended?<eos> If Abby is going through some typical teenage problem that happens to any typical family like ours, instead of punishing her you should show her some compassion.<eos> And you shouldn't tell me how to do my job.<eos> Well, maybe if you did it right, then all the parents wouldn't talk about you - like you are a steaming pile of...
- 100 million. - With an admission of guilt.<eos> - Sure, where do I sign?<eos> - I'm willing to cut your clients a check that'll change their lives and you're too stupid to see it.<eos> - Are you ready to take responsibility or not?<eos> - You think I won't go after you for stealing from Seidel's company?
Why is Harvey specter negotiating this?<eos> - I told you when we took him on, he's the best negotiator in the city.<eos> - I don't care who he is.<eos> You're the one that came to me.<eos> You're the one I trusted.
- Oh, you told them you'd get them a hundred, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I can see it in your face. Well, I suggest you tell them you accidentally added a zero.<eos> Because you're not getting a nickel more.<eos> - Let me remind you, Mr. Palmer. We filed 150 suits against you. And we are gonna fight them all.
What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I know that you're officially a headhunter, but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients at places like this.<eos> I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...
but it must be nice living in a world where everyone has a weak spot I took a leave of absence and I replaced myself with a worthy attorney.<eos> So you can look for a pressure point all you want. you're not gonna find one.<eos> My name is Harvey specter. but I know you heard of me.<eos> So maybe she didn't blackmail you.<eos> Maybe she promised to do something for you.
And I like it when he lets me win.<eos> We're a match made in heaven.<eos> It reminds me of a poem I read once.<eos> "You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye"<eos> I have a present for you.
I read them when I got my hair highlighted.<eos> Now the models all look insane.<eos> Like zoo animals.<eos> Unaware they're about to go extinct.<eos> "Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
Blessed day.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to be?<eos> No.<eos> Must be nice.<eos> Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
Yes.<eos> Love isn't real.<eos> It was...<eos> Never anything more than lust with a good marketing campaign.<eos> Maybe for you but not for me.
Pardon the interruption.<eos> Ambassador, gentlemen, please join us for some hors d'oeuvres.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> Shall we make our way, then?<eos> Please, after you.
Do you know a woman named June Osborn?<eos> She's 31, blonde hair, blue eyes, from Boston?<eos> Yes, my wife.<eos> That's what we thought.<eos> This is for you.
My name. It's June.<eos> Luke.<eos> Do you know a woman named June Osborn?<eos> Yes, my wife.<eos> This is for you.
Lot of bad fits.<eos> Two months at Walmart, three weeks' construction.<eos> You know how this looks?<eos> Like I can't hold a job.<eos> Honestly, I don't know what else I could do for you.
I head up one of them.<eos> We're called the Sons of Jacob.<eos> Come with me to a meeting.<eos> I think you'll like what you hear.<eos> Who knows, maybe there's a job in it for you.
Blessed day.<eos> I've got a fine cut of meat for Commander Waterford.<eos> Praised be His bounty.<eos> Blessed day.<eos> Saved it for you.
But this summer fling you had, it wasn't with some travel rep whose name you can't recall.<eos> No.<eos> It was Nadine Hunter.<eos> But for Nadine, it wasn't just a fling.<eos> She was head over heels in love with you.
- My vote?<eos> Oh, well, of course.<eos> I mean, who else would I vote for, huh?<eos> - All the best for today.<eos> - The same to you, Peter.
- No.<eos> Now, what was it we needed to ask?<eos> Just a tiny thing if I remember.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> You had a dispute with the victim, about him cutting funding to the orphanage, turfing you out and building a holiday resort on the land.
Not yet...<eos> So, are you any closer to finding out who killed Victor Pearce?<eos> Well, we're not quite there yet, Catherine.<eos> But we're making good progress.<eos> I can only imagine how hard this is for you with everything that's been said in the papers and all.
And all of you had one other person who could vouch for where you were at the time of the murder.<eos> Whereas Catherine, here, not only had no alibi, she also had the means of committing the murder, being in the booth right next to the victim.<eos> But it wasn't Catherine who killed Victor Pearce.<eos> Then who was it?<eos> Ah, straight to the point, Miss Bousquet, you know I like that about you.
He left because you were pregnant.<eos> And I assume you being in love with him, and a Christian woman, wanted to marry and keep the baby.<eos> But that's not how Victor saw it, is it?<eos> He had a career to build.<eos> Edwina, I can only imagine how difficult it was for you.
I'm... I'm so sorry.<eos> Judith,<eos> I think you turned to Edwina for help.<eos> To your mother.<eos> She saw how much those children meant to you.
Step aside, Jenkins.<eos> Colonel, I don't know what it is you think you're doing, but in the history of bad ideas... this?<eos> Right at the top.<eos> You're the caretaker.<eos> Jenkins. I heard about you.
You're the caretaker.<eos> Jenkins. I heard about you.<eos> "Ornery" is the word they used.<eos> That's just from my friends.<eos> I mean, for you and your backup singers, I'd be willing to get downright nasty.
For that little...<eos> For Taylor?<eos> Everything I measure myself by has been called into question.<eos> Todd.<eos> This is for you by way of an apology for putting you in an awkward position.
I put somebody on it early this morning.<eos> I had a feeling, pulled your résumé... saw some game-theory strengths... looked into it a little bit more.<eos> How'd you clock that I knew?<eos> The way you listened to my answers, the cant of your head.<eos> You weren't receiving new information.
It's over, then?<eos> Your part's done, but the case isn't.<eos> You're not calling me.<eos> I can't have anything brought up in court that might look...<eos> You know, I checked, and my trade wasn't illegal, but I went ahead and did it for you, anyway.
The money's gone. And Eddie... he knew you'd beaten her? That's why he blackmailed you?<eos> How long was Mary at her sister's?<eos> I telephoned her, she came back home.<eos> So er... two, three hours.<eos> Only, your wife's sister told us that on Wednesday 1st May, she didn't see you or Mary.
Do you know a man named Dwayne Clarke?<eos> No.<eos> - Dwayne Clarke is a well-connected lowlife who supplied drugs to someone identified by the initials T-O-D on the day Julie-Ann Collins was killed.<eos> Julie-Ann had that flyer in her bag.<eos> It was you she was ringing.
- I'm sorry about that, Silas.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> You got yourself a boyfriend?<eos> I'm not short of offers.<eos> One of them could put you up for a couple of days until we're finished.
It's a bloody wild-goose chase.<eos> Where next?<eos> Next one's on Fairview Avenue.<eos> None of my business, but I know you and Bradfield were...<eos> He really liked you.
The orphans tried to engulf your entire house in flames, but it's fine now.<eos> Oh, thank you, Captain Sham.<eos> Please... call me... Julio.<eos> Julio.<eos> - Now, let's get a fried egg in you, madam.
She was as aloof as Steve Martin.<eos> Ahoy-hoy.<eos> This is Sector 7G, where... where, uh...<eos> What does go on here?<eos> Mostly we decide which of us should be on the lookout for you.
'According to Bank of Italy's senior economist...' '...more than 181 billion dollar of India's wealth is hidden in banks overseas.' 'lf all of this money can be brought back, then...'<eos> 'Or all the essential infrastructure projects...' '... like roads, electricity, bridges, rail and dams can be completed before time.'<eos> 'Every year more than 4000 Indian farmers commit suicide...' '...due to drought, loan or crop damage.' 'lf the black-money hidden overseas can be brought back...' '...then no farmer will ever have to commit suicide.'<eos> 'But is such a thing really possible in our country? '<eos> Reza... there's bad news for you.
second bullet here, on the side of the liver.<eos> Exactly here.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> No, lt's not me, it's the system.<eos> I came all the way to Taiwan for you... yet, I will have to prove that the encounter was genuine.
I came all the way to Taiwan for you... yet, I will have to prove that the encounter was genuine.<eos> - But why do you want to encounter me?<eos> - Bala ready?<eos> You're not a cardboard cutout Karan.<eos> - There are no dots on you.
Well, we've got some interesting footage.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Sir Home Minister's son Dishank is meeting them.<eos> But Karan... these are all very powerful people.<eos> And it's really a big risk for you.
I kept blaming myself, but Vicky said... I got what I deserved, but now... I am going to return this money to our people, not them.<eos> We've to take revenge from those who killed our daughter.<eos> Please, Karan.<eos> Help us get our revenge.<eos> Why should I believe you?
And secondly, our safety...<eos> Get us to Thailand border... We've relatives in Bangkok.<eos> And we don't have any criminal record there.<eos> We can start a new life out there.<eos> - And I should believe you?
- This is the right thing, Bhavna.<eos> - Bhavna.<eos> Only time will tell whether your this decision is right or not.<eos> One more thing.<eos> In the morning when I saw you jogging... I felt for you.
Key...<eos> What will you do with the key?<eos> It only opens the locker in a bank which contains a bag... which has a laptop.<eos> And for which you'll need my retina scan and fingerprints..<eos> And even if you get that, it's of no use to you.
I was taken at gun-point.<eos> What's my fault?<eos> The inquiry commission back in India will decide... whether it was your fault or not.<eos> I see... and what about me?<eos> Delhi has already decided about you.
Can you zoom into his hand?<eos> - Can you clean this reflection?<eos> - Okay.<eos> This is the only church on the banks of a river... which has a bird-sanctuary nearby and a McDonalds opposite to it.<eos> Next time if you do anything like this... I am telling you I'll fall madly in love with you, and I'll kiss you on the lips...
This face is going to change again, KP.<eos> Monday afternoon 1 o'clock.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> What if Karan fails to complete the task tomorrow?<eos> Then I will do it for you.
How many times are you going to lose again?<eos> When we're trained to be a Commando... there's one thing which they teach us.<eos> Never give up trying... until you're alive.<eos> All the best.<eos> All the best to you too... Commando!
We were forced to kill Erica.<eos> Collateral damage.<eos> Home Minister's offer was planned.<eos> University, Terminal 21 mall, in fact... your escape during the Jimmy stint was planned as well.<eos> If the plan had flopped... then Bakhtawar would've taken the money from you.
"Sweetheart, your guy's not scared..." "just try saying it once politely."<eos> "There's no point... in useless chatter." "Let's talk about love instead..."<eos> "My heart's dormant..." "make it beat with your touch again."<eos> "Give me some peace... and some torment as well."<eos> "My arms are lonely." "You know I need you."
Maybe he's too cute. Maybe he won't think I'm cute.<eos> Maybe I'm not even a snowman anymore. Maybe I've melted. Michelle!<eos> Am I just a puddle, a carrot, and a magic hat?<eos> -Oh, no, I can't.<eos> -It's not for you.
Your waiter will be with you in a minute.<eos> Thanks, Kristen.<eos> We didn't get a chance to talk much, but... you seem cool.<eos> Hi, I'm Tyler.<eos> I'll be taking care of you tonight.
I'm not.<eos> Don't make me prove it.<eos> My name is Lieutenant Myers.<eos> Of the International Animal Defense Group.<eos> We know what a traumatic experience this has been for you, and we know that you're eager to get back to your family and friends.
He wants proof.<eos> No, he's not ready.<eos> He's ready.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Dr. Morgan, I'm afraid this is gonna come as a shock to you, but there's somebody here who's been waiting to talk to you.
We could call in sick...<eos> Maybe.<eos> I've got the black lung.<eos> The black lung.<eos> Hey, Chief, have I got a story for you.
Are you really so anxious to die?<eos> I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.<eos> That's why I'm taking you with me.<eos> I'd rather die a gentleman than return to Mount Vernon a scoundrel.<eos> I trust that I may depend on you to deliver this to my wife, Martha?
I'd rather die than surrender.<eos> Then you are an idiot.<eos> You're not going to run me through.<eos> No.<eos> We have something else in mind for you, Your Majesty.
- And yet I watched him strike down Sir Galahad with my own eyes.<eos> You have to believe that your husband can be saved, or else he will be truly lost.<eos> Unless we stop the Black Knight's army, we may never find out.<eos> My Queen, you must be strong.<eos> With King Arthur missing, the Knights of the Round Table will look to you to lead them.
Well, you know, she's holding up pretty well.<eos> I liked you better when you were killing people.<eos> Ah, I see that not everything has changed in my absence.<eos> Ms. Jiwe, I had the honor of serving alongside your compatriots, including Dr. Heywood's grandfather.<eos> They all spoke very highly of you.
- The name is Livewire.<eos> Do you know what power is, Freud?<eos> About time they hired more people.<eos> It's the feeling of someone's life in your hands.<eos> Every atom in you, it just burns electric.
Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.<eos> We will never fight for you.
Drinks up!<eos> Hey!<eos> Here we go, bubbly club soda for the lady.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And for you, sir.
Hold on, Maggie, slow down, just let her explain.<eos> Stay out of it, Kara.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Oh, my beautiful boy.<eos> I had no idea...<eos> You finished it.<eos> Supergirl, I can't believe you're here.<eos> Kara Danvers believes in you.
Even they can't stand your singing.<eos> Sorry to pull you over, but I saw you have a broken taillight.<eos> I do?<eos> Sorry, Officer.<eos> Lucky for you, I have some tape for that.
What matters is the story.<eos> Not unless I can verify your story's origin.<eos> You expect people to just trust you?<eos> - I never lie.<eos> - Mmm, bully for you.
To make sure you get the story right.<eos> That's not luck.<eos> That's being a good reporter.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> I was rooting for you.
For our people to rise again, they need a future.<eos> Mon-El is young.<eos> He can be the face of that future.<eos> You want to take Mon-El back to Daxam?<eos> Would you rather he stay here and learn by degrees that he's not good enough for you?
I have an idea.<eos> Ion thrusters are ready and the navigation system is set for Daxam.<eos> Take us out.<eos> You just don't know when to let go, do you?<eos> I was gonna say the same thing about you.
Actually, yeah, I... I have to tell the readers about the next medical breakthrough.<eos> Kara Danvers, right?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> I know Jack Spheer.<eos> I have some information for you.
I heard about your colleague, Mr. Spheer.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Rhea.<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
You've betrayed me, my love.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> - Lena Luthor?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
You could move food and water to famine-stricken areas in an instant...<eos> And solve climate change.<eos> That is, if it works.<eos> The proposal you lay out is sound, but it is all theoretical.<eos> Which is why I need you.
So where did you study?<eos> Undergrad at Oxford, Masters of Engineering from MIT.<eos> I went to MIT.<eos> Did you have Martinez?<eos> I think I was there quite a few years before you, but I will take the compliment.
I guess since I'm sharing, I should share everything.<eos> These are the key concepts I withheld from the proposal.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> And I give you my word, I will not steal it.<eos> I trust you.
What are you talking about?<eos> My father would never be playing these games.<eos> He'd be wanting to get the hell away from here and making sure that he never went back to prison.<eos> I've been planning this for a year.<eos> Did you really think I didn't prepare for you, Martian?
Maggie.<eos> Winn found Alex. What?<eos> How?<eos> I guess you underestimated my sister. Let's go.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You're making advancements in science that most people on Earth could not even dream of.<eos> No one said it would be easy.<eos> What if I can't make it work?<eos> What if I can't get you home?<eos> I have confidence in you, Lena.
We have here...<eos> We have here... My... My nephew.<eos> Marcus.<eos> Marcus.<eos> Is there anything I could get for you or your nephew?
Because I'm black?<eos> You look the same as he does too.<eos> - Why don't you talk to him?<eos> - It's more than that.<eos> He sees something in you.
Okay, go.<eos> Why won't it shut down?<eos> - What did you do? - What I had to do.<eos> For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.
You'll see.<eos> Lena!<eos> Hello, Lena.<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> I've been taking care of you ever since Supergirl nearly killed you when she attacked our portal.
Supergirl tried to stop you.<eos> I should have stopped you.<eos> You lied to me and used me.<eos> I did what I had to do for my people.<eos> But I did it for you, too.
I meant what I said on the ground.<eos> You are a marvel.<eos> And I know that you are meant for bigger things, better things.<eos> This is a planet of wasted potential, and you represent the best of your race.<eos> I'm going to make a society worthy of you.
Air Force One?<eos> Wait, don't tell me the President is heading towards the conflict and not away.<eos> Every time I think I can't get happier I voted for that woman...<eos> National City is mine, and you should be thankful that that is all I am currently taking from you.<eos> The militaries of Earth will unite against you.
My son knows me well.<eos> I hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.<eos> So the wedding will legitimize your union in the eyes of the Daxamite people.<eos> We'll have a formal ceremony.<eos> You're insane if you think I'm going through this pageant for you.
But there are people you do care for.<eos> Wait...<eos> Wait, what is that?<eos> The Luthor Family Children's Hospital, of course.<eos> It's one of the things I've always liked about you, Lena, that you do more with your money and power than just live lavishly.
- I can re-purpose it to beam us onboard the Daxamite spacecraft.<eos> That's why we need your help.<eos> Give us access to the projector and we bring you aboard.<eos> That sounds like a great plan.<eos> One that we can carry out without you.
Sadly, wasted on the wrong audience.<eos> When my own husband opposed me, I killed him.<eos> You really think you can tug at my heartstrings?<eos> You were right about one thing though.<eos> It is over. For you.
The big ICEJ allocation to the New Beginnings fund.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - Wendy Rhoades wanted in.<eos> She called in the request right before the thing went south. She took down a huge chunk of change for herself.<eos> I assumed it came from you, Axe.
And the night I turned him down, when I got home and looked around my place, for about ten minutes, I felt like an idiot.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Then I fell straight asleep 'cause I had a clean conscience.<eos> I was where I was supposed to be, doing the right thing.<eos> I am happy for you.
We never use the words we really mean.<eos> - Like "swanky"?<eos> - No. Like "soul."<eos> Your soul.<eos> Axelrod will demand things of you incrementally that will change the fundamental nature of who you are, and I am here because I can give it back to you.
I did find some revenge porn on the chairman's chief of staff, but I don't think it's worth much.<eos> Is it enough to scare her?<eos> Embarrass her, probably.<eos> More than that, probably not.<eos> I gotta say, they look a lot better on you, Mrs. Underwood, than they would on Governor Conway.
Republicans.<eos> Understood.<eos> But my boss doesn't happen to be up for reelection.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I have two words for you. "Slag heap."
I hope that means that I can count on you.<eos> Of course that's what it means.<eos> We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.<eos> When, and if, Garrett Walker appears before this committee, do you think he'll... -betray the party?<eos> -You mean you?
Or as some would have it, his love-nest.<eos> I had to force the entry codes from him.<eos> He took you there?<eos> No.<eos> So he kept secrets, even from you.
In jean shorts.<eos> - Grandma Mary!<eos> - Well, hello, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, my girl.<eos> I picked you some flowers.
the father that you loathed, the terror that this is how your daughter may one day perceive you.<eos> A depraved demon sputtering psychoanalysis?<eos> Perhaps you speak from personal experience.<eos> Do you come from a broken home?<eos> Daddy drank? Mommy never loved you?
Best bet, you'll have to send this thing back to sleep.<eos> See, spirits are just another form of power. They can be channeled, deflected, blocked.<eos> These beads keep me safe.<eos> They prevent any and all spirits from infecting my head.<eos> I could purify some for you, adjust them to your condition, of course.
That's what I been trying to say, pendeja.<eos> My daughter's still in there.<eos> To confirm, you were in prison with Judy King?<eos> Judy King was in prison with me.<eos> Miss Diaz, can we send a town car for you?
That's not a problem, is it?<eos> No.<eos> No problem.<eos> Well, been very nice meeting you.<eos> If this isn't for you, let's say our goodbyes, shall we?
I look for people that are passionate about what they do, and for some reason, they haven't found success.<eos> And I know money.<eos> I know how to make it work.<eos> I know how to get it.<eos> I have it... and I'm willing to invest it in you.
And then July rolls around, a little more money, but it's advertising for the Fourth.<eos> And then a few more units are rented... and it's better than nothing, but it's still not enough to service the debt on the loan I already owe the bank.<eos> A loan secured by the mortgage on this property.<eos> That old chestnut.<eos> And then, before you know it, it's Labor Day and I'm in hock to you and the bank and you force a sale, recoup your investment with interest.

I ain't so good with months and years, ma'am.<eos> What I do is, I have one day and when that is finished, I have another day.<eos> But you've been here long enough to know previous attacks by Indians?<eos> They've been known to kill folk, ma'am.<eos> That's why, when I see them, I clutched onto you with the mightiest clutch I could clutch.
We have women amongst us now.<eos> Consider what this will do to our relations with the Pamunkey.<eos> Tell him a thief forfeits both hands.<eos> Why behave as fools?<eos> What value am I to you with no hands?
Your father wants you to stay.<eos> My father doesn't understand me.<eos> Chin up.<eos> It's only two more years.<eos> Maybe to you two years feels like the blink of an eye, but to me, it's an eternity.
- You do?<eos> - Part of one. It's not mine.<eos> I overheard it from Mafee... last night.<eos> But he can't know it's from me. It's sensitive.<eos> He's hiding from you.
I got a lot of work to do. See ya.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, this has all been a lot for you.
You said you were surprised that they missed him?<eos> Well, they talk about him like they hate his fucking guts most of the time.<eos> That way they don't hate me.<eos> He's willing to put himself in that spot.<eos> So it's his loyalty that matters to you.
He's willing to put himself in that spot.<eos> So it's his loyalty that matters to you.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo.<eos> You could've just called. You came in here because you want it to be about you.

Done.<eos> Larry.<eos> I know.<eos> Lawrence Boyd? You're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
If a curved surface is developed on any other surface whatever, the degree of curvature in each point remains unchanged.<eos> This "Theorema Egregium" from Gauss has had a significant impact on cartography...<eos> Miss Maric.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Is there anything that I can do for you?
That one is terribly wrinkled.<eos> Don't you have a pressed one?<eos> It will suffice.<eos> Good day to you Frau Einstein.<eos> And to you Frau Einstein!
It's hypnotic...<eos> A single pollen particle is bombarded by water molecules ten-to-the-twenty-four times per second.<eos> How am I going to predict that many movements per second in a three dimensional space?<eos> Here, what if you tried using...<eos> Your child needs you, Mileva.
Mileva.<eos> Yes one moment, we're just in the middle of...<eos> The baby isn't crying in a moment. He's crying now.<eos> Frau Einstein, I do appreciate all you're doing for us. But right now Albert needs my help.<eos> Your boy needs you.
You need a wife to make you a home, not a...<eos> I'm sorry I'm not Marie Winteler.<eos> So am I.<eos> Mother, apologize.<eos> I knew from the moment my son wrote to me about you, you would never make him a suitable wife.
Poincaire thinks she should be asked to leave the conference.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Madame Curie.<eos> I'm Albert Einstein.<eos> I've heard some gossip about you.
Yeah.<eos> From the ocean floor below to the mountain peaks above.<eos> From the food you eat to the mess you make.<eos> We're behind it.<eos> Making a today great for you and a tomorrow great for us.
- You.<eos> - It's not me.<eos> Why would I bring it in here if it was me?<eos> To cover your ass.<eos> I thought you were worried about someone tracing this back to you.
Come here.<eos> First, you've got to answer some quest...<eos> Wait!<eos> This is nice.<eos> And they opened it just for you.
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?<eos> We work for him now.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I work for you now.
You can put the blankets... put 'em over there.<eos> You must be Sidney.<eos> I thought you were gonna bring the cots in?<eos> Well, I wanted to make sure this is where you wanted them before I started hauling them all in.<eos> Sidney, Evelyn has told me about you.
Crane asked about Molly, you two have a little phone conversation.<eos> And then you just show up here? !<eos> Just let me explain.<eos> You two come into my life...<eos> I hardly know him and I sure as hell do not know you.
And the others?<eos> Marshall Redwick.<eos> And the finelydressed man is Secretary Farlow, my employer.<eos> Samuel, I dined with Sir George several times on the journey.<eos> He spoke so fondly of you, it gave me the most harmonious notion.
My predecessor, Argyll, was determined that Marshall Redwick should follow him as governor.<eos> I managed to persuade the company to appoint me.<eos> So there will be resentment, which will stir up resistance.<eos> I want you to report to me everything that Redwick and Secretary Farlow say.<eos> You wish me to spy for you, Governor?
Look at how she speaks to her husband.<eos> She delights in humiliating any man she sets her eyes upon.<eos> Master Castell!<eos> Marshall. I wish to address your wife.<eos> Then why ask him, when I am right in front of you with ears of my own?
- Such as Belladonna.<eos> - Mercy, did I not just tell you?<eos> Ma'am, I promise to hold my tongue.<eos> Only my tongue has a terrible habit of following my thoughts and my thoughts have a terrible habit of dwelling and if you are dabbling with dangerous medicines, ma'am, that's where they dwell.<eos> I have a token for you, Mistress Kett.
Ma'am, I promise to hold my tongue.<eos> Only my tongue has a terrible habit of following my thoughts and my thoughts have a terrible habit of dwelling and if you are dabbling with dangerous medicines, ma'am, that's where they dwell.<eos> I have a token for you, Mistress Kett.<eos> If you'll accept it.<eos> I made it for you.
What are you saying?<eos> Henry's death was an accident. Was it?<eos> And who was there to see it was a misfortune?<eos> And who was there to see that it was not? He as much as told me.<eos> He killed his own brother cos he'd fallen for you.
Henry's death was an accident. Was it?<eos> And who was there to see it was a misfortune?<eos> And who was there to see that it was not? He as much as told me.<eos> He killed his own brother cos he'd fallen for you.<eos> - I don't believe you. - Um.
He killed his own brother cos he'd fallen for you.<eos> - I don't believe you. - Um.<eos> But others will. If I speak out.<eos> You quiet down your defiance and you marry me I'll have no cause to speak out, will I?<eos> I don't believe you.
Our dear Lord would not allow an innocent woman to stand accused.<eos> I am pleased to see you improving, Marshall Redwick.<eos> These outhouses were built when the town was under siege.<eos> You must pass a ruling that they be torn down and built again beyond the palisades. It is just as important, sir, that every person here believes this well is the true cause of the malady.<eos> Governor, the women who travelled here on the ship looked to you as a father to them, to protect them, to warrant them justice.
Lady Yeardley's biscuits.<eos> That is a reason to hurry home from church for.<eos> Mistress Sharrow?<eos> I wish to say how sorry I am.<eos> If you'll be willing to hear my regrets for all the harm that I've caused you and Silas?
Come here.<eos> Bailey, what has brought you to this?<eos> That man is a traitor.<eos> He's the ring leader here.<eos> He tried to get close to you, Governor, so that he might kill you.
Oh, I sleep fine.<eos> It weren't me who left my brother out there for dead.<eos> If you believe that anyone sees you as a man of justice, you are mistaken.<eos> Your jealousy's cut across your face like a scar for all the world to see.<eos> Do you not know true devotion when it's stood looking at you?
If you believe that anyone sees you as a man of justice, you are mistaken.<eos> Your jealousy's cut across your face like a scar for all the world to see.<eos> Do you not know true devotion when it's stood looking at you?<eos> Why can't you see it?<eos> All I want is for you to admit one time that I stand before you as a respectable man.
Your jealousy's cut across your face like a scar for all the world to see.<eos> Do you not know true devotion when it's stood looking at you?<eos> Why can't you see it?<eos> All I want is for you to admit one time that I stand before you as a respectable man.<eos> Hasn't Silas chosen his brother over you?
It was me who brought this burden on you.<eos> But even if they don't hang you, to kill a man, to plunge a blade into him, that is a horror that will haunt your mind.<eos> Speak to the Marshall about Henry.<eos> Speak to the governor, tell him what happened.<eos> Please, I am doing this for you.
My husband knows that the box is missing.<eos> He will realise you have taken it.<eos> Verity, you will not even make it to the gallows.<eos> He'll put a sword through you before you can even speak.<eos> I plead with you, I will return it.
Take a mistress.<eos> There's been no talk of divorce under my roof.<eos> Elsa won't see me as things stand.<eos> She certainly won't resume our relations as long as I'm still married.<eos> Elsa means that much to you?
Item d.<eos> You will stop talking to me when I request it, and you will leave my study immediately without protest.<eos> Be sure to send a telegram the moment you arrive in Crimea. Not to worry.<eos> By the end of the month, the world will be cheering Albert Einstein.<eos> No one will ever doubt you again.
Go to the chapel.<eos> Tell Maria the Jolly Gay Giant is back.<eos> When I get in there, I'm going to personally take you apart, Piscatella style.<eos> If you can find me.<eos> I know we all look alike to you.
In the future, you should ask instead of demand.<eos> The CERT team cannot guarantee ingress into the prison without casualties.<eos> Governor Hutchinson cares about the lives in there, unlike other people involved.<eos> That's you.<eos> I'm talking about you.
Well, you tell the governor it ain't good enough.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know what happened in here.<eos> You got to tell him. He'll believe you.
You know, I ain't never put my baby girl to sleep before?<eos> Not even once.<eos> I risked everything to get these people out.<eos> Your people.<eos> I will see what I can do for you.
Move.<eos> There's no escape.<eos> I called for backup already.<eos> You have to know that.<eos> The only way I can save myself is if I surrender to you unconditional.
Come on.<eos> I got you. Ok. All right.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's already here.<eos> It's not safe for you here. What do you want?
It's not enough, unfortunately.<eos> Sir... when it comes to Matthews, I don't believe he'll deliver.<eos> Let's take this from his hands.<eos> We need to protect the polls.<eos> The request won't come from you.
-Woman?<eos> -Work.<eos> Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.<eos> Those two down there, and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.<eos> That's for you.
Why?<eos> Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?<eos> -Because I'm not sure you do.<eos> -Oh, I do.<eos> Because they knew they could take advantage of you.
The truth is, I went to school with guys like you.<eos> Good looking guys with good intentions... just like you.<eos> And I mean that sincerely.<eos> And I want you to know that whatever happens tomorrow, I never doubted your intentions.<eos> Must be late for you, Mr. President.
At least you were before you put the jacket on.<eos> What does your gut tell you?<eos> Let's see what he has to say.<eos> You know this man?<eos> He actually just tried to kill me to get to you.
My guess is you're Special Ops.<eos> You've been tortured, from the looks of it, more than once.<eos> You could have easily escaped our compound, but you chose not to.<eos> Why?<eos> You need our protection because everyone and their mother's coming after you because what you know could cause blowback.
Where's the backup, Elson?<eos> What the fuck happened?<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I assure you, inspector, what's out there is far more dangerous to you than me.
What about Daniel Chu?<eos> David Jefferson?<eos> Luis and Maria Gutierrez?<eos> Carley and Rebecca?<eos> Is Scorpion's life worth more to you than their lives?
You do not know me, commander.<eos> You should not take this risk.<eos> Even holiday double-time ain't enough to deal with this shit today.<eos> You know, the job is risk.<eos> It's not about or for you.
Yeah, I could tell.<eos> The two of you....<eos> Hall here.<eos> Commander, we got a shitshow brewing at the capitol building in Olympia.<eos> We need you and your team on-scene ASAP.
How did you end up here?<eos> I wanted to be of service.<eos> You are your mother's son.<eos> She would've preferred I become a minister.<eos> I suspect she was proud of you nonetheless.
I wanted to be of service.<eos> You are your mother's son.<eos> She would've preferred I become a minister.<eos> I suspect she was proud of you nonetheless.<eos> Call for you, Mr. Geist.
I am conducting this inquiry at the request - of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.<eos> - Hoover?<eos> What does he want with me?<eos> Dr. Lenard, it's an honor.<eos> He's expecting you, sir.
Is there anything I can help you with?<eos> No, thank you, Helen.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I just wanted to say again... how very sorry I am about Ilse.<eos> She was very fond of you.
Ever pay attention to a disheveled old fool like me?<eos> Albert, II didn't mean to...<eos> It's all right, Leo.<eos> I just let my imagination run away from me.<eos> I'm sure she cares for you very much.
Is this true?<eos> A weapon is only theoretical.<eos> Yes, but, theoretically, if you had the materials, could it be done?<eos> It would be an extremely difficult process.<eos> But I have a question about atomic fission for you, Herr Ritter.
Hey, you told your uncles to kill me.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> - You're here, aren't you?<eos> - That's right, I am.<eos> Isn't it better having someone working under you who knows all your dirty little deeds?
Yeah.<eos> Trevor Evans, FBI.<eos> Oh. - Have a second? - How's it going?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Sure. Absolutely. What can I do for you?
He told me so... ten days before he supposedly threw himself out of an 80th-story window?<eos> I had just told him... that it was over.<eos> That I was leaving Chicago with my family to give my marriage a second chance.<eos> I... I talked to my father almost every day.<eos> How... how come I never even heard of you? I don't know.
Across from the couch, there's a window you keep open mostly at night, not 15 feet from your boy's bedroom, up the hall on the right.<eos> And your girl's just after that.<eos> And yours, Byrde, is at the very end.<eos> Your toothbrush is blue.<eos> We know all about you, Martin.
Your toothbrush is blue.<eos> We know all about you, Martin.<eos> We know you work for someone dangerous... and perhaps we can't touch you... or else we risk retaliation.<eos> We also know... that you left Chicago quicker than a heartbeat.<eos> So, personally, I'm inclined to believe that you're on the outs with your employer... and us taking care of you might be doing him a favor.
Not that I'd ever vote for a Muslim.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Hey, how's that heart?<eos> Oh, it's fucking great.<eos> There's a package for you.
We're practically finished.<eos> Deposits have slowed.<eos> Marty hasn't been to the Blue Cat in a while.<eos> Something's off.<eos> You should just accept that our eyes are on you and yours, Ms. Byrde.
What kind of flowers?<eos> - Poppies, mainly.<eos> What kind of poppies?<eos> Now, why do I get the feeling that, right in the middle of my employee soirée, I'm being interrogated?<eos> I can't preach on the water for you anymore.
A fact which, quite frankly, makes us question your intelligence.<eos> You gave us distribution, but you stole our anonymity.<eos> So you wanna know what we did?<eos> We stole yours.<eos> Told Mason all about you.
- It's my fault.<eos> I picked a fight.<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> It is, 'cause I was telling her about you and Marty, and how you two are married, and... just to mess with her and... she was being mean.
You never signed anything. You never even handed me a goddamn pen.<eos> Which means there will be nothing to implicate you in whatever it is that I do, okay?<eos> - Jesus, Marty.<eos> - Even so, I know that if the authorities caught me, if they busted me, they would try everything to link you to me, right?<eos> And it would be difficult for you to prove that you didn't conspire.
- Your iPhone?<eos> Give me my phone.<eos> Hold on.<eos> One second.<eos> Rachel... you let me back into the Blue Cat to finish my business, or I'm gonna come for you.
- It's a great idea.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So... So, you'll pay for it?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> This is an awful time for you.
I don't know.<eos> How... How long are funerals, usually?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I need you to get down here.<eos> There is a delivery for you.
- It's been rigged.<eos> - Rigged? - Yeah, right there.<eos> It's rigged.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> You knew that they were coming after you.
Certain people believe it's a sign.<eos> A call to worship.<eos> Others think it's a sign that someone's gonna die.<eos> Today, it was both.<eos> Next time, it's up to you.
Witnesses?<eos> No, Ma'am.<eos> Don't understand it.<eos> Ain't no logic to it.<eos> Pastor Young says it's on account of him refusing to run heroin for you.
I really don't know where he is.<eos> All right.<eos> Maybe if you think of anything, you can give me a call.<eos> You first came here looking for your older brother, wondering where he was.<eos> Danny always talked about you the most, more than anyone else from back home, bragging about his cop brother from the Keys, so I helped you, but you never let me know that he was killed.
That's okay. My way is best way.<eos> But you can abort it, right?<eos> This is exorcism.<eos> That thing is not human.<eos> The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?
No, I called your office. There was no answer.<eos> There are moments when I get absorbed in what I'm doing, Hans. You know that.<eos> Yes, I certainly do.<eos> But I have always hoped that once, just once in my life, you'd be absorbed with your family instead of your work.<eos> But we're just a burden to you.
I think you're relieved she's dead.<eos> How could you say such a thing?<eos> You'll never again have to worry about her money problems or feel guilt for what became of her.<eos> I thought we put aside this bitterness years ago.<eos> That is because you are *completely oblivious to the feelings of those closest to you, papa.
Didn't say nothing. Just left.<eos> She's not at the shelter.<eos> I understand, but I can't spare anyone.<eos> I did for you. I g...<eos> I-I tried to get her to testify against her pimp for you.
You know no-one else will team up with you two.<eos> You're the leftovers, so, you know, just get on with it.<eos> Constable.<eos> Detective Senior Constable Griffin.<eos> Don't let her go anywhere without you.
Criminal networks coach girls with good English to pass their interviews and get the student visas.<eos> But the photos would be different?<eos> I know one girl who did 26 interviews.<eos> We all look the same to you.<eos> Do we look the same to you?
- Did anything happen? - Um...<eos> Well, a while back, when she was 12, she got very excited about contacting you.<eos> She asked us if we'd mind, and...<eos> Particularly me.<eos> We wondered that it might not turn out how she'd hoped, that the letter might not find you, but she insisted that she wanted to try.
- Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> When you were arrested for drug possession, didn't your sister, Meg, represent you?<eos> Yes.<eos> And she got you a plea?
I'd like to continue.<eos> Your witness, counsel.<eos> Thank you for your candor, Mrs. Rayburn.<eos> Hard truths are painful.<eos> This can't be easy for you.
And you know what?<eos> It's okay, because he's done plenty of shit that he never got busted for.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eric has been walking around life weighted down by all the shit he's done, it's finally caught up with him, and it's about time.<eos> But it's gonna catch up with you too, Sally.
And why would I wanna do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Like, to clear the past.<eos> Make way for the future. You know.<eos> Hey, look, I don't have anything against you, sir, okay?
- Where are my clothes?<eos> Your memory will come back when you're ready.<eos> Go right.<eos> Good.<eos> Best thing for you right now is to get some rest.
- Father!<eos> - I can't feed stray dogs.<eos> Sir, my very first play...<eos> Was part Baxter's, and Baxter is no more.<eos> I have a queer feeling about you, Master Shakespeare.
Seni Baglamak.<eos> I bind you!<eos> Silly boy.<eos> I can't be boxed.<eos> - I read about you.
What happened to Tad?<eos> Would you like me to transfer you to Tad?<eos> One moment.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No! I want you, Jolene.
I'm relieved. Your mother was worried sick.<eos> Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> May I speak to her?<eos> She's busy right now.<eos> I just wanted you to know that... she's been thinking about you.
Yeah, that's what she said.<eos> May I speak to her?<eos> She's busy right now.<eos> I just wanted you to know that... she's been thinking about you.<eos> I've been thinking about you, too.
You're sick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what makes me the motivated leader I am today.<eos> Now, why don't you run along and help facilitate a smooth transition?<eos> - Is that okay? I was just thinking about you.
Pretty much exactly that.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> No, I don't think we want the same thing at all.<eos> Keep your pants on.<eos> You had one inside of you?
Power... is meaningless if you can't apply it judiciously... when it has a purpose.<eos> You think... being a sadistic little coward, you think that impresses me?<eos> That doesn't make you powerful.<eos> You cut that guy's throat right in front of me.<eos> I did it for you.
Why are you out here?<eos> All the people here... are they like you?<eos> Recovering, yes.<eos> And who freed them?<eos> The same one that freed you? Left that mark on your back?
Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Bro, that was a microbrew.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> - Ah! - I didn't mean to rub that on you.
You always treated me like garbage.<eos> Worse than garbage.<eos> It wasn't until Megan and I broke up that you could even remember my name.<eos> I have been waiting for this moment for years.<eos> I'm sorry I can't take everything that's important to you.
Quentin Coldwater!<eos> Shit.<eos> Why don't you and Alice come join me?<eos> You're weaker.<eos> And you're down six fingers.
I love you.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Hasn't Silas chosen his brother over you?
I'll be back.<eos> Hasn't Silas chosen his brother over you?<eos> Silver!<eos> - Woo! - I knew it!<eos> So Sharrow got nothing from you?
No, you have that drink for me, Meredith.<eos> I surely will!<eos> Please...<eos> What do you want, Secretary?<eos> The maid Alice has made a complaint against you, Henry.
I know just the words will shut up any man's questioning.<eos> I know, ma'am, that you're written to your cousin.<eos> What business is this of yours, dear Alice?<eos> And that she sent you a letter in reply.<eos> Mistress Castell confided in you, then?
How do you know he didn't have a legitimate reason to be in your office?<eos> Well, it was the middle of the night.<eos> He didn't come with a SWAT team, not even a subpoena.<eos> It was just him, trying to intimidate me.<eos> But his wife works for you.
You better head over to the ballroom.<eos> One of us should make an appearance.<eos> Sir, the day has finally arrived.<eos> Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.<eos> Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me about Muhammed Kalabi just... moments before you did.
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.<eos> She can reach me if you feel I need to be there sooner rather than later.<eos> Uh, in case it's later... I want you to think four years down the road.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - They trust you.
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?<eos> Do I really have to explain to you what will happen if you don't do this?<eos> I don't care if he loses.<eos> I'm not talking about the election.<eos> I'm talking about you. What will happen to you?
What did you do to get Axelrod to drop his civil suits?<eos> I went back to work at Axe Capital.<eos> I'm happy that it works for you.<eos> But for us, I'm afraid it's a deal breaker.<eos> If you ever decide to grapple with why you feel happiness for you can only exist in the company of hairless 21-year-old girls, come see me.
My bad. I overshot you.<eos> Looks like you finally have some family time.<eos> Thanks for coming down here.<eos> No, the Boyd business kept me living at the office, so I promised Kevin I'd spend the day with him when it was done.<eos> But I'm always happy to find time for you.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Everything has to be a pissing contest with you, doesn't it?
 I'm a colleague of your son's and a lifelong friend.<eos>  What's your name?<eos>  Sarah Lane.<eos>  I know you.<eos> You're the one he's so in love with.
What?<eos> No. I don't do that.<eos> I'm significantly older than you.<eos> Well, you're significantly older than everyone, so...<eos> If I were a thousand years younger, I would still be too old for you.
It's not because we're different species.<eos> It's because I'm gonna die.<eos> - No.<eos> - Some day.<eos> You're afraid to start something because you're afraid to get hurt, and that just makes you a coward.
Yes.<eos> A man standing on the surface of Ganymede without a vac suit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're under restrictions now.<eos> This is what attacked you and your team, isn't it?
It took me a very long time to understand that it wasn't my fault.<eos> Would you have listened to anyone who was telling you what you're telling me now?<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> This is not my time to stop.<eos> Your father was always so proud of you.
His whole family's reeling under the financial pressure we've put on them, and I think his eldest daughter, Clarissa, is ready to crack.<eos> He adores her, and if we make an amnesty offer through her, she may be able to sell him on it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I got a tip from a friend in the Security Council.<eos> When the Eros incident hearings are convened, they are going to make you the star of the show.
He's going to be very disappointed in you.<eos> You should prepare for that.<eos> He told you that story?<eos> About the climbing accident?<eos> He was proud of you.
Earth and Mars are the children here, screaming for their trinkets. Blind to a miracle...<eos> What is it?<eos> Sir, an urgent tight-beam from Secretary Errinwright.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's for you, sir.
Making khorovats is an art too.<eos> You have to be eager, put your soul into it, to make the khorovats tasty.<eos> The interesting thing is, you make it with your own hands, and then you enjoy it.<eos> That's the best thing, that you make it with your own hands and put your soul into it. And then enjoy it with your friends and family.<eos> People that are close to you.
You came up here to try to get me to deal.<eos> Look, I respect you wanting to hold firm.<eos> I admire the fortitude.<eos> But your problem is, my friend's not going any higher.<eos> He's just gonna bleed you out.
I'm saying I already have a buyer.<eos> You didn't take this meeting to tell me no.<eos> Actually, I did.<eos> But to tell you no nicely.<eos> I don't know what's going on between you and Foley, but I know it's enough that you're taking aim on him, and I don't want to do you disrespect because I don't want you taking aim on me.
But you would have taken it.<eos> I do something that's valuable.<eos> I strip people naked to the elements, and then I help rebuild them out of solid fucking rock.<eos> - Now, can you appreciate that?<eos> Don't believe you.
- Now, can you appreciate that?<eos> Don't believe you.<eos> Because if you did, you wouldn't be asking me to snitch.<eos> Axelrod banished you.<eos> He made you a Ronin.
Well, that's something I can understand.<eos> Understand this, too, then.<eos> I know you're not satisfied with what you've learned.<eos> Your search will continue, and it may take you down a great number of paths.<eos> But don't come back down this one. There's nothing for you here.
It's only damaging if it gets out.<eos> I'll invest silently. Your role will be hidden.<eos> We'll replace the funds as soon as we sell some of the stock.<eos> No one's the wiser.<eos> Well, if this is what it takes... to help you and Ira...
Okay.<eos> Thanks for the call.<eos> I appreciate you coming in.<eos> Thanks for seeing me on short notice. Yeah.<eos> I got you a latte.
There's nothing on earth that makes you feel so big and so inadequate all at the same time.<eos> I know that Alex had nothing to do with the mist. I just couldn't take seeing her alive, happy even.<eos> It was you who set the fire.<eos> Jesus, Shelley, you gotta stop this craziness.<eos> They're starting to believe you.
I know that Alex had nothing to do with the mist. I just couldn't take seeing her alive, happy even.<eos> It was you who set the fire.<eos> Jesus, Shelley, you gotta stop this craziness.<eos> They're starting to believe you.<eos> You have to confess, or I'll do it for you.
Guess we're both crazy.<eos> Will you confess?<eos> I...<eos> No.<eos> N... Shelley. Or you want me to do it for you?
I think...<eos> You want to stay behind.<eos> And the others?<eos> They were afraid to tell you. They didn't want to disappoint you.<eos> It's not that we don't believe you. We just... It's safer here.
The company?<eos> What about family?<eos> I spend my whole life thinking about the Cifuentes name.<eos> Don't tell me what I do or don't have to do.<eos> [man] Sir, there's a woman asking for you at the entrance.
- I'm not hungry.<eos> Maybe I am.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I want to thank you for reaching out.<eos> I am not saying I don't believe you.
You still haven't been elected president, sir.<eos> Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once the party turns its back on you, will it?<eos> When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line, you'll be begging to come in from the cold.<eos> And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind and realizing it was the beginning of the end.<eos> Patricia Whittaker and the Democratic Party will wipe their hands of you.
Just three from your ever-growing bloc would assure me the win in key delegations.<eos> Specifically?<eos> Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire are still in play.<eos> All three?<eos> I believe in you, Congressman.
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.
No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.<eos> Let's hope the House does the right thing.<eos> But as far as the Senate, I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this, but no matter what you're offering here, I can't support the president.<eos> And, by extension, I can't support you.
I want a woman in the White House.<eos> And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.<eos> But it's time.<eos> It's time.<eos> I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it... a vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.
I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it... a vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.<eos> Listen, I understand your concerns about Francis' record.<eos> If Conway wins, wouldn't you want a Democrat to keep him in check?<eos> And what if a vote for me isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?<eos> Twenty-one promised for you, sir. Twenty-three for Conway.
No.<eos> Is he on a kill list?<eos> The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.<eos> I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.<eos> And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.
There'll be another election in four years.<eos> But look... I saw you when Francis was in the coma.<eos> What you're capable of when given the opportunity.<eos> You still have a shot down the road.<eos> I'd vote for you.
A man old enough to be her much older brother.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're laughing at me.<eos> No, Father, I swear, I am not laughing at you.
- your husband or any forged painting.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Georgina Clios...<eos> Of the Clios Foundation.<eos> - I've heard of you, yes.
- Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Georgina Clios...<eos> Of the Clios Foundation.<eos> - I've heard of you, yes.<eos> - But I haven't heard of you.
Well, that makes us business partners now and as such, I'm going to offer you some partnerly advice...<eos> Quit while you're ahead.<eos> Yeah, um, I'm not done yet.<eos> In fact, since you're so keen to hand out favors, I want to increase the house maximum bet.<eos> Ah, favors are for your mother, not for you.
Well, most of Constantine Clios is in pieces at the bottom of the sea. But I take your point.<eos> His wife, his entire family... are still living on the proceeds of his corruption.<eos> I thought you're only after the Bank.<eos> I'm after all of them.<eos> Everyone who steals money from me, from Bela, even from you.
Of course. Love's dream.<eos> So, no skeletons in your closet?<eos> No.<eos> It must be nice to be the innocent one.<eos> I understand that it must be difficult for you to have another woman living in your home with your children
that's a remedy!<eos> Thank you, no.<eos> Maybe in a second?<eos> Alright.<eos> I could never pity you, Georgina.
How so?<eos> It buys us time.<eos> The other barons are going to be focused on hunting him down. So... You present yourself as an ally in the fight against the greatest threat in the badlands.<eos> You want me to crawl back to them after they tried to kill me?<eos> They're gonna come after you in any case...
All right, with what I know about her and what you guys know about her, we might just find a clue to who she really is.<eos> Now let's find this bitch.<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> Sorry to disturb, Doctor.<eos> There's an urgent call for you.
I'm getting close, Doctor.<eos> It's a complicated case, and I'm not entirely sure yet if the patient is truly infected.<eos> We need a prognosis as soon as possible.<eos> If his disease turns out to be fatal, I would hate for it to spread.<eos> I understand, Doctor, and I'll have it for you very soon.
I heard they did a nice wedge salad.<eos> Ooh. We don't.<eos> Aww. And now that we've settled that, if you two will please excuse us?<eos> Okay, Mother, but remember what I told you.<eos> Remember what I told you.
I've had quite a busy day myself trying to shut down rumors I had anything to do with that bloodbath down in Long Beach.<eos> I wouldn't say "bloodbath."<eos> Although, now that I come to think of it, the easiest thing would be to just tell Len Trexler it was you.<eos> That would be pretty easy.<eos> But I have another job for you.
I understand this is difficult to take in...<eos> Stop.<eos> This ends here and now.<eos> No more supernatural creatures. No more Vault.<eos> No more you.
What did you just say to me?<eos> I said... whoever broke your heart must've really done a number on you.<eos> You don't know a damn thing about me.<eos> I know what hurt looks like.<eos> I see it all over you, and I know how it can harden a person.
I think it's mistrusting.<eos> - Don't you laugh at me.<eos> - I'm not. I'm not.<eos> I swear, Ms. Keyes, I'm not.<eos> I suppose I just... "mistrustabled" you.
Enjoy that purse.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Thank you very much, ladies.<eos> That is such a beautiful dress.<eos> I think it would look great on you.
Good luck.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I don't know how the hell this happened.<eos> Mr. Heller, I picked these up at lunch for you.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello. - Hey.<eos> - These are for you.
I don't see how I can agree to this.<eos> Change doesn't come easy.<eos> You lose this vote, this revolution falls flat on its face.<eos> And they'll either banish you or kill you. Either way, all your plans come to nothing.<eos> You think that compromise is weakness. It's not.
I want to be right here with you when we find the monster that tried to kill him.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Agent Wells... I've got an update for you.
Peter MacLeish is president?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hannah... tell me what evidence you have against Peter MacLeish.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.<eos> What can I do for you, Kimble?
your drive, your ambition.<eos> There's nothing ordinary about you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> I appreciate you saying that.<eos> Just know I'll be watching you.
Agent Wells, this is my wife, Alex.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Respectfully, sir, this information is only for you and your security team.
How are you feeling, Mr. President?<eos> Much better. Thank you.<eos> All right. Where would you like to start?<eos> Let me begin.<eos> I understand there's some tension between you and Emily.
It's what I want you to.<eos> I need you to convince the Russians that it's in their best interest to authorize the peacekeeping force to move in.<eos> As a private citizen?<eos> Preferably as Secretary of State.<eos> I know that you've retired from public service, but your country needs you.
I need you to convince the Russians that it's in their best interest to authorize the peacekeeping force to move in.<eos> As a private citizen?<eos> Preferably as Secretary of State.<eos> I know that you've retired from public service, but your country needs you.<eos> I need you.
No, you're not.<eos> I need a partner, not a loose cannon.<eos> With everything that's going on, I just thought...<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - I want to believe you.
It only hurts when I breathe.<eos> Seriously...<eos> I feel lucky, grateful.<eos> Hello, Mr. President, my name is Amy.<eos> And my question to you, sir, is, after all that's happened these past few months, what do I tell my children?
And I won't do that.<eos> Now, the reason why jobs like yours have disappeared isn't just because of cheaper labor in some other country.<eos> Primarily, it's technology.<eos> Technology allows one person to do what used to take 10.<eos> Now, that might be great for the economy, but it's not for you... for your family.
Besides, the money wouldn't hurt.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Once you get used to that expense account, it's hard to go back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Washington needs you on the inside.
Oh, forget this.<eos> I thought we said 11:00.<eos> It's almost 2:00.<eos> Just testing your resolve.<eos> Three whole hours... is that all the truth is worth to you?
Damn it.<eos> Today marks a milestone for the Kirkman Administration as he signs his gun-control bill into law, igniting hopes that this unelected, independent president can actually break the partisan gridlock that's paralyzed Congress for years.<eos> There's another big winner today... Speaker of the House Hookstraten, the moderate Republican who went out on a limb supporting the White House on this.<eos> These two have got to be feeling good this morning.<eos> Madam Speaker, this could not have been accomplished without you. Thank you.
Well, opposites attract.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I have to be honest...<eos> When I first took office, I had my doubts.<eos> I didn't know if I could trust you, and I knew you didn't trust me.
Yes, sir.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wanted to assure you that the trip I took and the bill I co-sponsored were completely unrelated.<eos> Kimble, I believe you.
And you almost threw up in the hallway.<eos> I think I did... a little.<eos> You saw me and you told me to calm down.<eos> You said everything was gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna trust you.
We'll see.<eos> I should've gone public with you 12 years ago, Liam, fed you to the wolves.<eos> Too late now.<eos> Not really.<eos> I still have the evidence against you, Liam.
Meantime, you got today to get back to me with a response because this is going out tomorrow.<eos> Tell the Secretary of Commerce we need more diversity for the young entrepreneurs presser next month. Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> So, major flag for you.
Just can't believe one man would exploit Constitutional crisis for political advancement.<eos> He knows the list was balanced and that I wasn't trying to push a political agenda.<eos> He's trying to put himself at the center of his own damn party.<eos> How did Bowman get so powerful?<eos> Didn't he lose the Senate vote to you? Yeah.
Just back off.<eos> In what is being called a master political stroke... a shortcut around the expected party battles and culture wars.<eos> The Court's most urgent cases can now be dealt with.<eos> The country will likely have to wait until the next election for a Chief Justice, but in the meantime, President Kirkman has fulfilled his promise to restore the nation's highest court.<eos> To you.
How familiar are you with the federal art grants that make these kind of programs possible?<eos> I remember that bill.<eos> The sunset clause was added to get it past some of my more conservative colleagues.<eos> How fast do you think we can get Congress to reauthorize the grant?<eos> I wish I could help you and Tyler with this, sir, but it has to go through the Ways and Means Committee, which is chaired by Owen Saldua, who just happens to be leading the charge against me - in the Ethics Committee.
I'm sorry?<eos> I want what's best for the country.<eos> So, I'll step aside, resign the Speakership, and my seat.<eos> I'll admit. I'm surprised.<eos> But I want something from you, Owen.
I'll admit. I'm surprised.<eos> But I want something from you, Owen.<eos> I want the public arts education funding reauthorized before I go.<eos> The operation is still viable.<eos> Right now, I'm brooming any connection between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.
There's enough explosives in here to blow up three Capitols.<eos> She's been kidnapped.<eos> She was looking into Browning Reed.<eos> Agent Wells is convinced that the ex-C.E.O. Patrick Lloyd's involved with the conspiracy.<eos> I'm brooming any connection between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.
You know, we may have different styles, Tom, but I think that's what makes us a good team.<eos> The professor and the politician.<eos> You give them the facts, and I'll twist their arms.<eos> That works for me.<eos> I know how important this is to you.
I mean, I-I'm in the line of succession.<eos> You didn't think you could trust me?<eos> This isn't a matter of trust.<eos> The hell it's not!<eos> Now, I came out of retirement for you.
Why should I?<eos> Because they can subpoena you if you don't.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let 'em.<eos> What Alyssa's saying is if you go in voluntarily, it buys good will, for you and the paper...
I did not agree with it, but, yes, I understand.<eos> I need to earn your trust. Oh, not just me.<eos> All of NATO.<eos> Fine. But I would like to start with France.<eos> We began this dream of weapons reduction together. And I will need you there to finish it.
I'm being serious.<eos> Well, I am, too.<eos> You know, you drive me nuts, Tom.<eos> You're just so damn... academic at times, I want to slap you upside the head.<eos> But damn if I don't see something special in you, something that might...
I'm talking about tomorrow's edition.<eos> A "No comment" is not gonna cut it this time.<eos> It's a good movie, though.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Major flag for you, sir.
There's one from Jason Atwood.<eos> I thought you'd like to know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The operation is still viable.<eos> Right now, I'm brooming any connection between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.
You ready for tonight?<eos> Happy with your speech?<eos> I better be.<eos> I wrote it myself this time.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you, son.
Now, please, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.<eos> He's my boss.<eos> Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.<eos> What about my team?<eos> I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.
Seriously?<eos> This again?<eos> All right.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.
Mitchell, I am so sorry.<eos> I need to know who did this and if it was premeditated.<eos> Maybe someone killed Nathan to get to me.<eos> I need to know who.<eos> Mitchell, I don't think that this is good for you.
Blair!<eos> Tell me, or I will shoot her.<eos> Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.<eos> Blair, take it easy.<eos> I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.
There are several vans waiting outside.<eos> You'll all be held for reassignment.<eos> All except you, Miss Clark.<eos> What makes you think I'll keep working here after you take everyone away from me?<eos> I haven't taken everyone away from you.
I'm sorry.<eos> - No, no, no. I... it's an exciting thing.<eos> - For who?<eos> Look. Anyhow, I, uh... I need a raise.<eos> I'm a hard worker. I've done good work for you. I've always...
Uh, but we'll figure everything out. - It's just, it's... - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Uh, Caesar salad, no dressing, no anchovies.<eos> Uh, Chardonnay, your driest one, and an ashtray.<eos> And for you, miss?
- You're kidding.<eos> - I am.<eos> We met at our meeting.<eos> Yes. You're very funny.<eos> I can see why my father likes you.
You're back.<eos> I am.<eos> Do you think we've bonded? Since you moved in. I kind of thought we had.<eos> Sure.<eos> Then why is it so easy for you to push me to the side?
Okay? You are a sick old man and sick old men need nurses, william, to make sure they take their meds on time, and eat their meals on time, and don't die when nobody's looking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I need you to let the nurse take care of you, william.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I need you to let the nurse take care of you, william.<eos> All right? I got to get back to the office. I got a big, important phone call that I cannot miss, so, please...<eos> William, will you let the nurse take care of you?
Okay, then.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take good care of you, too.

I'm just so... just...<eos> David, I need you to stay calm.<eos> You're afraid of me.<eos> David, please.<eos> I'm afraid for you.
No, you took her at the hospital.<eos> You were there.<eos> No, David.<eos> It's clear now what happened.<eos> They came for you but got her by accident, and we've got you, but we want her too.
Nice of you to finally show.<eos> Apologies for rescheduling, something came up.<eos> Well. Something came up.<eos> You're getting pretty comfortable with this arrangement of ours.<eos> I don't take any comfort in the things I've done for you.
But they're not.<eos> They're just men, and occasionally women.<eos> And not to respect the people I hunt would be like a soldier not respecting his enemy.<eos> And that mistake costs lives.<eos> But how do you know he felt the same way about you?
I was wondering when you might call. Hiya, Dave.<eos> We, uh, found Jody's SUV, you know.<eos> We're gonna find you soon, too.<eos> Promises, promises.<eos> I, um, got a question for you, Tommy.
Now, I've got a few minutes before I have to go in and debrief.<eos> Are there any questions?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Agent Rossi, do you have a second?<eos> Agent Clark, what can I do for you?
Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> You know, things don't always happen the way they do in movies.<eos> I know that.<eos> Ms. Joseph?<eos> We have a call for you.
And I've been asked to drive in yours today.<eos> And you're used to driving a luxury vehicle with cruise control.<eos> A little trickier when you're at the wheel of an '86 Datsun with the engine on fire.<eos> You know what?<eos> If I were you, I'd take a look at how I allocate my resources, is all.
Well, she's 31 weeks, which isn't completely to term, but it's... it's far enough along for survival.<eos> I don't even have a crib yet.<eos> Kristen's allowed to have you in the room with her... for the labor.<eos> Did you tell her that I'm here? No.<eos> But she's been asking for you.
I tried the sheriff.<eos> There has to be someone else.<eos> Me.<eos> I'm someone else.<eos> So it's up to you?
Was there something else?<eos> If this one makes a mistake, will you leave her, too?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> If you're ever looking for a new job, please... come see me first.<eos> Yeah, well, same goes for you.
"Good job"?<eos> No, I... that's great.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm happy for you.
Are you friends of his?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> No, we...<eos> We're looking for him, actually.<eos> But I just wanted you to know he said such nice things about you.
Nobody wants you here.<eos> What?<eos> I said you're unwanted.<eos> I have friends.<eos> They only pretend to like you.
But it is a locked ward.<eos> So she shouldn't be too hard to find...<eos> - I've looked everywhere.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm starting to wonder if she's really the right girl for you.
She's trying to take the baby!<eos> I'm trying to make you right!<eos> Make yourself right!<eos> You're not clean.<eos> That thing is still inside of you.
But he's out there.<eos> Yes... that's certain.<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> I don't know, but, uh...<eos> I trust you a whole hell of a lot more than I trust her.
Okay, baby.<eos> No, I had to.<eos> I got ya, I got ya.<eos> What do you want from us?<eos> Oh, we don't want anything from you, Mrs. Barnes.
It's good to see you.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> I have to apologize for what happened at the hospital, but the truth is I did save Kyle's life.<eos> I also heard about that unfortunate incident with the midwife.<eos> Now, I want you to know that if anything ever happened to you, or the baby, that would be a tragic loss for all of us.

Such brave and noble people.<eos> - Oh, how I miss them.<eos> - We miss them, too.<eos> But we have questions about them.<eos> They never told us about you. They never told us about Uncle Monty.
Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?<eos> Who joined you for years on a sequence of heists and schemes until the two of you were forced apart by circumstance, and also because you ran off in the middle of the night with a bunch of her valuables?<eos> Uh, no, I've been in the lumber industry all my life. Hmm.<eos> You can let me off here, in the middle of town.<eos> For you.
_<eos> [Speaks Mandarin]<eos> _<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do speak English if it would be easier for you.
_<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do speak English if it would be easier for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I know that this isn't easy for you, Mrs. Lin, but the more information that I can gather, the better chance we have of finding the person who did this to your daughter.
Dating, which led to more serious topics... marriage, my kids, my job.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> I was telling him about my hectic work schedule, my long days, then... he spilled my drink.<eos> He apologized profusely, then I went to the restroom and cleaned up, and when I returned...<eos> Tom had gotten you a fresh drink.
Michael, I know that you're hurting.<eos> Everything will be all right, ma'am.<eos> Stay calm. You don't know what she did to me, what she did to us.<eos> To who?<eos> You and your sister?
You're pissed at me?<eos> I'm pissed at your assumption.<eos> I just... I thought you were different.<eos> No, you couldn't have thought I was that different, 'cause... you're here, trying to make this story end the way it did for you last time.<eos> You think I want something from you, and the only way I can get it - is to sleep with you.
Alex Parrish escaped, General.<eos> And so did Miranda Shaw.<eos> Drive.<eos> Now.<eos> Give me one reason why I should trust you.
I pity the sisters.<eos> Their grief, it just... it twisted a faith that offers real hope and guidance to many.<eos> You also offer hope.<eos> The way you fight for your people against monumental odds.<eos> The world can use more men like you, Calderon.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> No, you're just in time.<eos> Hi, darling.<eos> Be your last night livin' under this roof.<eos> I've got something for you.
Goodbye, Mr. Cuthbert.<eos> I, uh... didn't say I'd hire a boy to be rid of you.<eos> It was in hopes that you could stay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll never forget you.
But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must.<eos> And you'll stay up in your room until you can tell me that you're willing to do it.<eos> I'll have to stay up there forever, then, because I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her.<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I vexed you, but I'm glad I told her just what I did.
Well, you know...<eos> I like to think that that one fine day, it won't matter a whit to you what anybody says sideways.<eos> You have a good imagination.<eos> I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.
I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.<eos> So go and smooth things over, can't you?<eos> I'll attempt it.<eos> For you.
It was awful of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth.<eos> And it was the truth.<eos> Every word you said was true.<eos> My hair is red and I am freckled and skinny and ugly!<eos> Now, what I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it!
What are you both up to so early in the morning?<eos> Sister, I have brought you sweets.<eos> You eat and celebrate your good fortune.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> I should have run away without you!
- Priya.<eos> Yes, Puru.<eos> Tell me?<eos> Listen, I'm coming home!<eos> I have a month's break, and I have an admission form for you!

Jaha has a plan to save us, but we have to stick together.<eos> When those doors open, follow my lead.<eos> It's our best chance. That's enough.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> I don't know about you, but I am not about to be led to the slaughter.
Our facility was attacked. I know that.<eos> How?<eos> That's what I'm here to find out.<eos> Our people know the penalty for disloyalty.<eos> So I thought perhaps I would ask you.
Don't run from the FBI. It was stupid, okay?<eos> I thought they were process servers.<eos> Sent by my wife. We're in the middle of a nasty divorce.<eos> I was trying to avoid going back to court.<eos> It's been a tough few months for you, James.
That has nothing to do with it.<eos> But I can see how you would make that connection.<eos> So, Lisa is a friend of yours from college, as well?<eos> Jesus Christ, you're as bad as my husband.<eos> Does he forget things that are important to you?
At the table.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She is gonna do great.<eos> Dr. Kepner and I will be sure to update you as soon as we can.<eos> I am giving you as much love as humanly possible because you're her doctor... And I believe in you.
It was scheduled for right now, the next surgery.<eos> Oh. Maybe you misread the board.<eos> I wrote it on the board.<eos> Well, maybe you miswrote it.<eos> Look, I would open him up again for you, but, you know, that kind of thing could get me arrested, so...
You are welcome.<eos> It's just y... That was my last yogurt.<eos> I will go to a hotel.<eos> Just go to a store.<eos> He looks miserable and he's scared to death for you, and I don't want to lie to your husband anymore, so can I just tell him something, please?
Bleeding slowed down.<eos> Only 400 cc in the pleurovac.<eos> Yeah, we'll need to stabilize his ribs.<eos> In the O.R. I'll join you.<eos> And before you tell me no, I spent all day rearranging my schedule, thanks to you.
I'm glad I... Glad I checked the board.<eos> You would have figured it out if you had walked into OR 2 and found a bowel obstruction. Hmm.<eos> You do this everywhere you go?<eos> - Do what?<eos> Turn the place against you.
You'd like?<eos> And you can assist and help...<eos> only when requested... but it will be Dr. Warren's O.R.<eos> Why don't you let Bailey take this one?<eos> Because I've assigned it to you.
But, no, Bailey decided I didn't need...<eos> - You should stop talking right now.<eos> Dr. Webber.<eos> Oh, need something, Warren?<eos> Well, um... Well, you, sir.
- Okay.<eos> Her vitals look good.<eos> How are you feeling, Lynne?<eos> Any pain?<eos> Lots, thanks to you.
How do you stop feeling like this?<eos> You don't.<eos> You... You just learn how to...<eos> You learn how to feel this way a little faster.<eos> You let it hurt, and then you... you put it behind you so that you can face forward to the... the next kid who needs you.
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...<eos> I'm married to a guy who almost beat me to death.<eos> - You do this everywhere you go?<eos> - Do what?<eos> Turn the place against you.
Today, we just focus on getting your pre-op taking care of, and we get our oncologist up to speed.<eos> Did you want, um... Maggie here before we continue?<eos> Um... Diane, you didn't tell her yet?<eos> It's too much stress.<eos> Which is exactly why she needs to know, because it's gonna be stressful enough for you.
Lewis, let her talk.<eos> I... I've heard all I need, Els.<eos> A successful surgery would definitely buy you more time.<eos> But as you know, the amount of shift, combined with your age and aspirin usage are bad prognostic signs.<eos> Surgery holds higher risk for you, much higher.
What are you doing?<eos> I should do the EGD.<eos> You're too close.<eos> Go take care of Maggie.<eos> Let me do this for you.
What?<eos> I-i just gave you sadiq.<eos> If what you're saying is true, sadiq'll ID you the same way you ID'd him.<eos> And I'm not gonna take a chance to jeopardize this mission.<eos> I don't take my orders from you.
Now, I wish I could tell you more.<eos> But I can't.<eos> What I will say is this.<eos> If you keep digging, it's not gonna end well.<eos> Not for you, not for the kid, not for Holly, not for anyone you care for.
I'd say you're CIA working in the Continental United States.<eos> I don't know, but it cost your dad his life.<eos> Back off Billy Craig's murder.<eos> If you keep digging, it's not gonna end well.<eos> Not for you, not for anyone you care for.
He's with the State Department.<eos> We just killed a Fed, man.<eos> Tell your bosses I don't scare easy.<eos> A deep voice and a Kenny Loggins beard won't quite do the trick.<eos> I actually feel sorry for you, you dumb son of a bitch.
Want to find out, sucker?<eos> You didn't check for a tracker?<eos> I didn't think I had to.<eos> You're relieved of duty, Detective Craig.<eos> It's the best I can do for you.
And they showed me the door.<eos> So, no, I can't say I'm shocked they got into some kind of trouble.<eos> When's the last time you saw them?<eos> Does this mean I'm not going to get back my money?<eos> How long has Jamal Muti worked for you?
Come on.<eos> I think you saw a couple of tourists, thought they'd make easy marks.<eos> Everything went as planned, until your friend flew off the handle, attacked their driver, and brutally killed him.<eos> Where did you see them?<eos> Do you think your buddy's in there, taking the fall for you?
That's my girl.<eos> I can't believe Robbie's gone.<eos> He sacrificed himself for me.<eos> For my family.<eos> Well, he believed in you.
And that's why you chose an idiotic, bedazzled tweener as your partner.<eos> I'm sorry, Candy, there's no name calling in here.<eos> Even if it's to yourself.<eos> Lucifer, would you like to respond?<eos> This is gonna be hard for you to understand, but... I've been through Hell recently.
Well, technically.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Also graduated at the top of my class, designed a bunch of cool buildings, and just made partner at my firm, but, um... thanks, Mom.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> Thanks to you, - the Seaver name lives on. - Oh.
I can't believe you're buying into this conspiracy theory without even a shred of proof.<eos> But we do have proof.<eos> Riley?<eos> The Organization has wired millions into a Cayman Islands bank account, which we traced to a holding company which led to an alias.<eos> And a little birdie at the NSA told me that that alias belongs to you.
Should I know a Martin Dryer?<eos> Regional director of the FBI.<eos> Oh, fancy.<eos> I'll take it in here, thanks.<eos> Director Dryer, Matilda Webber, what can I do for you?
Do you have any agents in the field in Atlanta?<eos> Well, I'm not sure what agency you think I work for, - but I'm...<eos> - Actually, Ms. Webber, I have no idea where you landed.<eos> What I do know is that you transferred out of a high-level position with Homeland Security and you didn't show up anywhere else.<eos> And since the CIA, the NSA and the DEA won't claim the two operatives that just stole an FBI vehicle in Atlanta, I figured maybe they were working for you.
- You can't do it.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Because you know this isn't right.<eos> You think that I care if you live or die?<eos> But you do care about getting the details right.
I thought they were going to tell me to vote against the upcoming referendum.<eos> I...<eos> Okay, so if that's why she went to the cafe, then everything Matty told us, all the CIA intel, was wrong.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've seen the pictures, I want to believe you, but you need to go back and explain everything exactly how it happened.
- Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I guess now it's all up to...<eos> Attention, Director Harlan Wolff.<eos> This next jam's for you.
It's quite the contrary.<eos> See, I know what it's like to be different.<eos> But because what makes me different is all up here, I have learned to hide it from the world.<eos> Mostly.<eos> You haven't been afforded that same luxury.
No.<eos> I'm threatening you.<eos> We can't leave the boy vulnerable.<eos> Phoenix is taking him into protective custody as we speak.<eos> But what happens next is up to you.
Got another one coming.<eos> Please!<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> You got to.<eos> I do believe you.
You have a B.A. in poli-sci and then you joined the Army after graduation.<eos> Rose to cyber command sergeant before a dishonorable discharge in 2009 for selling DARPA computer codes to North Korea's Bureau 121 hacker unit.<eos> After that, you fell off the grid, but we've matched your signature to a dozen cyber attacks all around the world;<eos> most recently, a water treatment plant in Chile on behalf of The Organization.<eos> You see, I know everything there is to know about you, Daniel.
Previously on MacGyver...<eos> No one's ever survived me before.<eos> I still don't know your name.<eos> I've always been partial to Murdoc.<eos> I know everything there is to know about you, Daniel.
In surgery, we call it<eos> - "a complication."<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh. - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Don't open the door!<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> No, but, what can I do for you?
- If Thomas is right, then we'll die out there. But if one of us is right, if one of us survives, then you will know who to follow.<eos> Then that person can save you.<eos> I would like a few moments alone so I can pray.<eos> Then we should begin.<eos> I believe in you.
You try and trick me.<eos> Look me in the eye.<eos> Look me in the eye, Nash!<eos> Look me in the eye, and tell me you don't see evil.<eos> I don't believe you.
Let him go.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> What else is there to do than to fight the evil?<eos> What else is there in life?<eos> It's in you.
We don't have to do this.<eos> What else is there to do than to fight the evil?<eos> What else is there in life?<eos> It's in you.<eos> It's really in you.
Jake..<eos> Why would you do that? We could've found anyone who was infected and put a GPS on their ankle.<eos> Every second that we waste, Alex moves one step closer to those flames, and this was the fastest way to track her down.<eos> Besides... she would've done the same thing for me.<eos> Samuel Wilson and the agency of yore would be most proud of you, master Wells.
That name... Just tickles me to no end.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, if I were to say I have any idea.<eos> What in the world you're talking about, why would I discuss any of this with you?<eos> Because there is no victory for you without a gallery.
And you do realize this stone will suck the life out of every man, woman, and child in Sleepy Hollow?<eos> Tell me, what sort of an eternal life would that be with that stain on your conscience?<eos> So, innocent people lose their lives because you're too thick to read the small print in your deal with the devil.<eos> I... I had faith I would find a loophole. And I did.<eos> And I am more than grateful to acknowledge that I owe all of it to you.
I'm satisfied with my work in the Vault.<eos> The team is doing particularly well.<eos> And now I have a place to lay my head.<eos> Perhaps D.C. is shaping up to be home.<eos> And what about you?
It has continually proved to be far greater than the sum of its parts.<eos> It has been a unique experience.<eos> Indeed it has.<eos> Miss Jenny... pointed out that D.C. is becoming more of a home to me.<eos> It is largely thanks to you and Miss Molly.
You're vegetarians?<eos> Yes, but we'rewe're happy with anything else.<eos> Gosh, I feel terrible.<eos> You do the homeschool too.<eos> What does that make you?
While you were honing your confectionary skills, I've been working on new algorithms to redirect power from the idle quadrants of the ship.<eos> You need to focus on boosting your distress signal once power is fully back online.<eos> Now, chin up, Captain.<eos> I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.<eos> I believe in you.
They brought an army for this?<eos> Look, Bumpy, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> We didn't know they were coming, all right?<eos> McGarrett!<eos> We trusted you, and this is what happens?
And right now our lab's running ballistics on the gun we found inside to confirm it is the murder weapon!<eos> So you can stand there and tell me you're innocent all day long, but we both know you're lying!<eos> All right, all right!<eos> I stole all that stuff, including that gun, but I didn't kill Akemoto.<eos> Why should I believe you?
I want you to post two men on every sniper.<eos> I want 'em to feel HPD breathing down their necks.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> Commander McGarrett on the line for you.
He's there now?<eos> Yeah, he showed up two minutes ago.<eos> What have you told them?<eos> I barely told them anything.<eos> And nothing about you.
Felicia traveled here by herself to pursue her dreams.<eos> This really doesn't sound like somebody who would run away.<eos> Aren't you her understudy?<eos> Mother Russia wants to show the world it can play nice, so the role I train my whole life for goes to an American.<eos> Ooh, so Felicia's sudden absence brings quite an opportunity for you.
This where things go to disappear.<eos> Da.<eos> Old friends come to visit... It warms the heart.<eos> You two must be in real trouble, you come down here.<eos> We have some questions for you.
There was no trial, no jury.<eos> I thought America stood for justice.<eos> Where is mine?<eos> Well, Oleg, you're in Russia.<eos> That's between you and your country. Ha ha!
But here you are, disobedient, a man without a country, without a team.<eos> Who are you now?<eos> You are nothing.<eos> I'm more than you'll ever be, because I know what it is to love and be loved, unlike a narcissistic sadist like you who gets off on other people's pain because he can't feel anything for himself.<eos> Boris was wrong about you.
I projected a loss.<eos> All right, Dr. Bull.<eos> You have arrived at Ginny Bretton's house.<eos> Front door's open.<eos> I'll wait here for you.
Look, if you win, you can find new investors, but if you lose, there's no company left to invest in.<eos> Right, but if I can just patch up that back door, then the problem disappears.<eos> I'm never giving up on E.J.<eos> It's just a machine.<eos> To you.
The algorithm's designed to save as many lives as possible.<eos> So it would swerve into the car with only two passengers?<eos> No.<eos> The car would stay its course.<eos> In order to kill the fewest number of people, your car would run straight into the tree and kill you, and there's nothing you could do about it?
Well, timing was just a bit too convenient.<eos> I guess you needed to do it, or I wouldn't have testified.<eos> I don't know if I can let him go.<eos> You don't have to let Evan go.<eos> He'll always be a part of you.
I had to break a window to get in.<eos> Come clean now, and I will help you to get a great attorney.<eos> It shouldn't be hard to get the right jury on your side.<eos> You stood up for these women.<eos> You did for them what no one did for you.
Here she comes.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I knew my mother had secrets.<eos> But I just didn't know what they were, not until I was older.<eos> Went looking and found out she spied for you.
But why?<eos> It wasn't for money.<eos> We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel. No!<eos> She believed in you.
It wasn't for money.<eos> We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel. No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.
She believed in what we were doing, Daniel. No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.<eos> She died because of you.<eos> And nothing ever happened to you, did it?
I have been doing so much better this past year.<eos> Finally feeling less afraid, like I can take care of myself.<eos> This news really threw me.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> May, I know this is difficult for you, but can you tell us about the attack?
I'm not a normal person.<eos> I've never really fit in.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> If you get out, we'll get you into a program to help you adjust.<eos> We'll find a new routine for you.
Wow. Are you the coffee fairy?<eos> That depends.<eos> Have you been a good little bureaucrat?<eos> This is an unexpected treat.<eos> What can I do for you, Madam Secretary?
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I'm Carter Wilson.<eos> I spoke with your associate on the phone.<eos> I'm not entirely certain what I can do for you, mr Lockhart.
So Maureen had a choice between remaining silent or doing the right thing.<eos> She chose to testify.<eos> And while she helped bring alexei lagunov to justice, she also forfeited the rest of her life in doing so.<eos> She's on that list.<eos> Who is she to you?
They play through the tournament, reach natalya, And pass along the... Code words.<eos> Then I'll take her safely across the border.<eos> When are we heading out?<eos> Scorpion's booked on a flight. To sardovia leaving in two hours.<eos> But, agent gallo, we need you to sit this one out.
Chilly.<eos> Hey, you guys hungry?<eos> I know a good burger joint on the way back.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to see me, sir.<eos> I'm always happy to make time for you, Agent Beeman.
I have no authority over the CIA.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Sir, the CIA listens to your boss.<eos> And if they don't, his boss is the President.<eos> Why is it so important for you to protect Burov, a KGB officer?
I like my work.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Logistics...<eos> Storage, materials handling, identifying and fixing inefficiencies.<eos> Sounds like they can't do anything without you.
What happens next, that's up to you.<eos> But if the CIA uses the tape I made to blackmail Burov, I will go public and confess.<eos> The U.S. government killing innocent people, splashed across the world's newspapers.<eos> I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, Agent Beeman.<eos> Unlike you, I haven't forgotten what that means.
Well, here's a sample of a skin-care product I've been using for almost 15 years.<eos> "Day Radiance."<eos> If you take care of your skin, dear, your skin will take care of you.<eos> - Thank you, but like I said-- - I understand.<eos> I could come back another time and host an in-home beauty demonstration for you and some of your friends.
Well, he can make something of his life here.<eos> But a boy needs his mother to become man.<eos> And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.
And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.
My teeth... problems.<eos> You know, the dentist is too expensive here.<eos> So maybe can you help me with dentist?<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll take care of that for you.
Bring dinner.<eos> Maybe even stay the night.<eos> I just think, from now on, we have to ke--<eos> Yes?<eos> Dr. Tippens' office for you.
Well, he always said it was very important for him that we talk them through.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't meet with you on a regular basis.<eos> I understand.<eos> I will pray for you.
The pain is almost gone.<eos> There is a man...<eos> We're getting closer, and-- is getting better.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> Good for you.
When we start to know each other, it was hard to wait.<eos> Well, we're very happy for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One minute.<eos> I have something for you.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know a lot about you, Emma.
I put a car on your house for your protection, you're welcome.<eos> This is about Wyatt's wife, isn't it?<eos> I knew he was fixated on her murder, but this is just so reckless.<eos> Can you blame him?<eos> I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life?
No technology.<eos> I'll know if you're wired.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Besides Rufus, you're the only one that'll understand. Understand what?<eos> Give me one good reason why I should trust you.
Okay... ow! Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Stop!<eos> Rufus is gone.<eos> So I guess I got to trust you.
And you... you're smart, you're beautiful, you're incredib... I could care less what you think about me.<eos> What you are a part of is inhuman.<eos> - Rittenhouse?<eos> - Rittenhouse.<eos> Well, I've got news for you, my dear, you're a part of it, too.
I know... I bought this already, because it's my own merch, but wouldn't I be interested in having a little more?<eos> 'Cause what if I gave this one away?<eos> The signature, I'm hiding hat.<eos> And then I would need another.<eos> These are perfect for the athletic in you.
- Good to know. - Oh.<eos> Let him have it. Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood, and now he's about to lose a fortune.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready for test.<eos> After you, milady.
Whoa, congrats!<eos> Wait, that's stealing. No.<eos> It's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did to the Winkle guy in that Facebook movie Professor Bighetti had us watch.<eos> And he was the hero of that film.<eos> And with all of us working together, we'll easily beat you to market.
Sit down.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Richard Hendricks.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> No... but I know all about you.
You... you've sat around and drank.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - No, fuck you.<eos> Do you know why Alice went to Brakebills? To find out what happened to her brother.<eos> What happened was his friend Emily had the bad sense to fall in love with you, and it destroyed her.
I know. I've seen what he can do when he's angry.<eos> John, tell her what you told me about Our Lady Underground.<eos> Reynard's obsessed with her.<eos> I think they were lovers, but she left him.<eos> Everything that he's done to her followers, to you...
You are not gonna weasel me this time.<eos> - I want my 35 grand.<eos> - Oh, just hold on.<eos> Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?<eos> Just consider the possibility that Kellerman saw you for the rookie you were and took advantage.
The last horse is entering the starting gate.<eos> $2 million?<eos> That's a lot of change.<eos> How do we know it's legit?<eos> I can wire it to you directly.
All right.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> If you'd like to go ahead and just park next to that cone over there.<eos> It's a special spot<eos> I have waiting just for you.
Oh, hi.<eos> You know, of all my nieces and nephews, - Saffron was always my favorite. - Aww.<eos> Honey, this is my uncle, Albert.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Heard a lot about you.
Hi there.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Got it.<eos> Let's meet on... Tuesday.<eos> This came for you.
Especially since you're engaged to Eliza.<eos> Dwayne.<eos> I was surprised to find out you knew each other, but New Orleans is such a small city.<eos> It's the biggest small town in America.<eos> Oh, it's one of my personal favorites for you.
Oh, no, no.<eos> That's very sweet.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.
Now, I've heard that you would like to speak to the accused as soon as possible?<eos> Yes, if you don't mind.<eos> Please.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Superintendent McDaniels, if it's all right with you, we'd like to speak with Winston alone.
- Yeah, died, and left you, what, $20 million?<eos> So what are you saying exactly?<eos> Are you saying I used some kind of magic spell<eos> Look, what you have, it is bigger than... than... than what any Magician can do.<eos> You know, you used your powers even without knowing it to create you.
I just don't get it.<eos> I mean, I did head off a famine-- personally staved off a war.<eos> Not to mention, The Wellspring is back online.<eos> And yet the people don't like me any more than they did.<eos> How can you possibly know what they actually think of you?
I figured you might know why they hate me so much, seeing as you tried to murder me.<eos> Okay, that was before I got to know you.<eos> And before you introduced me to this Earth delicacy-- na-chos.<eos> Wait till you try your first margarita.<eos> Listen... If you're really worried about what the people think of you, let's talk about your wedding. Ugh.
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.<eos> _<eos> He'd never know.<eos> Whatever you need, ask me about it.<eos> He tells me, I tell you.
Must've went to my spam.<eos> Well, nice to meet you, Rich.<eos> You know Dale Rivers? He's our vet.<eos> Nice to meet you, Dale.<eos> I heard a lot of great things about you.
- Ah.<eos> I bet when that happened, she was really ecstatic.<eos> We'll see. It hasn't happened yet.<eos> Oh...<eos> Does me getting Kendra a ring make things slightly awkward for you?
And I always wanted a big brother.<eos> And when I started working with the Five-0, I finally got one.<eos> Mahalo, Max.<eos> Detective Williams.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.
And Detective Williams is my role model as an individual, but your loving relationship with Adam is something that Sabrina and I hope to emulate.<eos> Love you, Max.<eos> Sergeant Grover. I'll miss your smile.<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> I know a part of you will always belong to Chicago, but Hawaii has claimed you as one of its sons, and I truly believe that the islands are a better place because you are here.
I founded this temple.<eos> The Greatest Day teaches us that humility is one of the key pillars in a life of service to our Hosts.<eos> Perhaps beginning your journey anew could set an example for others who have found themselves lost.<eos> Sir, a call just came in from Homeland's anti-terrorism tip line.<eos> They're asking for you specifically.
Perhaps beginning your journey anew could set an example for others who have found themselves lost.<eos> Sir, a call just came in from Homeland's anti-terrorism tip line.<eos> They're asking for you specifically.<eos> - For me?<eos> - Want me to patch you through?
As I'm sure your officer mentioned, I'm with the Governor-General's office.<eos> You know we're under evacuation protocol?<eos> That's exactly what I'm trying to do here.<eos> My orders are to escort these children out of the Colony.<eos> I'm no different than you, Sergeant.
I don't know who you're working for, but you're about to be placed under arrest for war crimes, per the NATO charter, by Counter Terror Chief General Cynthia Rockwell.<eos> Take it away, General.<eos> Release her.<eos> Uh, what's... going on?<eos> These guys work for you?
No secrets?<eos> These artifacts, they have never used any of them?<eos> No, no.<eos> Okay, maybe sometimes, but always for good.<eos> And are you sure they've never used any magic on you?
But you used me.<eos> I had to get someone into that Library.<eos> The best officer I've ever had.<eos> You're free to go at the next stop.<eos> I just needed to get you here one-on-one to find out if they've used any magic on you.
If you don't mind... - I do.<eos> - Um, and this... is the asteroid.<eos> Let's call it "Rocky."<eos> It's about 300 million miles out.<eos> Now, my software, which I'm happy to sell to you, by the way, predicts a trajectory for this asteroid to collide with Earth, like I said, in 186 days.
People drinking, celebrating, dancing.<eos> No idea that the world is coming to an end.<eos> You heard what Harris said. They have a plan.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you believed all that crap in there.<eos> But I don't want to cause waves between you and your boyfriend.
But I don't want to cause waves between you and your boyfriend.<eos> - I'm good at reading people.<eos> It's a gift and a curse.<eos> Well, your skills are remedial, at best.<eos> I like you, Grace. The way you handle yourself.
Or woman, as they say.<eos> You're asking me to divert resources, spy on my government, commit treason for some insane narcissistic suicide mission?<eos> The only suicide mission is wearing blinders, Grace.<eos> Harris assured me that they...<eos> Harris will trot you out to deliver his lies, the masses will believe you, and no one will be prepared for what's coming except for me and the people on this list.
Screw you and your ark.<eos> Nice to see you, too.<eos> You're right, Darius.<eos> The government's plan won't work.<eos> They need you.
I've been wondering when the next meeting is.<eos> Well, actually, Miss Cuthbert...<eos> Oh, please call me Marilla.<eos> Everyone does.<eos> Miss Cuthbert... we feel that our group isn't the right fit for you.
You're an entitled brat.<eos> I rose from nothing while you had everything handed to you.<eos> You cost me my rightful place.<eos> And the family you betrayed.<eos> They turned on me by choosing you.
How was the District of Saskatchewan?<eos> Oh, fascinating. I had another excellent day.<eos> I learned so much and I imagine Mr. Phillips was quite impressed and...<eos> And she lied and then lied some more.<eos> I've been doing my best to teach her right from wrong, but, well, this matter is so grave that we knew we had to bring it to you.
I will make him a helper fit for him."<eos> There's no need for her to bother with an education.<eos> Every young woman should learn how to be a good wife.<eos> I don't know quite what I expected the minister to say, but I assure you it wasn't that.<eos> And I fear preparing myself to be a wife will be a powerful challenge for you, Marilla.
It's going to take a very long time to heal.<eos> He's gonna need months of rest, with no stress or work of any kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You should be asleep.<eos> So should you.
And I'd sure give my last bit of strength, or my last dollar, to help a friend.<eos> And I know that friend would feel grateful and loved above all else.<eos> And I do.<eos> I feel very grateful to have such a dear friend as Miss Barry.<eos> Sometimes... you just have to let people love you, Marilla.
Real smooth.<eos> What?<eos> I wasn't expecting that.<eos> You coming?<eos> Yep, yep! Right behind you, buddy.
He's yelling at me to take him to the hospital.<eos> Look, the whole world wanted that guy dead anyway.<eos> Trust me, no one's crying for him.<eos> Yeah, I'd agree with you.<eos> But trust us, no one's crying for you either.
And since Cleveland already owns a green suit and a top hat...<eos> This is my Easter clothes.<eos> Whoa, a leprechaun!<eos> Say the thing.<eos> Top of the morning to you, Mr. Gronkowski.
Fear isn't real.<eos> Escape.<eos> Escape.<eos> If I'm going to burn in hell, you're going to burn with me.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you, Herman Mudgett.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Herman Mudgett.<eos> I'm not like the other women.<eos> And there have been so many women, haven't there?<eos> - How do you know my real name?<eos> - I know a lot of things about you.
I'll confess... to everything.<eos> Every life I've taken, every body I've buried.<eos> I heard what you said in that chamber, Wyatt.<eos> Your worst fear is not knowing what happened to the people you love.<eos> Someone very important to you, right?
A record, like mine.<eos> That's really you in the picture?<eos> Please, sit.<eos> Through Neolution science and my own genetics, I have lived a very long life.<eos> Now, perhaps, we can work the same magic on you.
How long till those bumps go down?<eos> - They'll go quick.<eos> Within a half hour. - Okay. Whoa.<eos> And so we begin.<eos> The ability to go day after day will be brand new for you, I think.
Grigory, what's the typical wash-out for urine to go to negative from a full treatment of testosterone?<eos> How many days does that take usually?<eos> Seven?<eos> For Bryan, two weeks will be nice.<eos> Is there any way that we could test that here in the States, or it's gotta go back to you to test those frozen urines?
What do we wanna show?<eos> How do we put together<eos> - the bigger story arc? - Bryan, be optimistic.<eos> Smile.<eos> I have vodka for you.
From Mordovia.<eos> - Oh, awesome!<eos> - You do drink vodka?<eos> - Yeah, I like vodka. - You like...<eos> I have vodka for you.
Empty.<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> I just know what I'm reading in the newspaper and in the press and... You know.<eos> Oh, really? Really?<eos> I mean, will they come after you?
To redeem.<eos> Okay, let's back up one sec here.<eos> My concern is that it's something they would use to discredit you.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> So, the first criminal investigation against you, when was it and what happened?
I'm doing it because when it comes to fleet sales around this place, I hear that you are the man.<eos> That and the fact that you're gonna give me 50% of the commission. Ha.<eos> Finder's fee is more like 20%.<eos> Then I'll take 40.<eos> I like you. I like you.
How's it going?<eos> He's not gonna be taking the truck.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Paul, we know your nightclub is tanking.<eos> We know that you got creditors coming after you.
Okay, so maybe Mitch confronts this other salesman, things get heated, Mitch winds up dead.<eos> We know who stole the sale?<eos> Hey, Bob-o. You got a sec?<eos> I-I sure do.<eos> Yeah, I just got a quick question for you.
And also you should know that, from personal experience, it doesn't matter how far you travel or where you go, you can always come back home, okay?<eos> And if you ever do decide to do that, you got a job and got your Five-O ohana waiting for you.<eos> Mahalo.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I believe that's you.
100% in principle, but I think we need to be practical here.<eos> This ain't the only town they can drive cattle to.<eos> - My mind's made up, okay?<eos> There's no changin' it.<eos> And that goes for you, too.
I never shoot a man in the back.<eos> How 'bout a compromise?<eos> What do you say to a drink?<eos> - I say all right.<eos> You know, there's a rumor going around about you, says that you were a yankee spy during the war.
That's not the truth... not for Alice.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> This is just Alice up to her usual tricks.<eos> She was always so hard on me.<eos> This is not about you.
We're fortunate.<eos> KTS is highly profitable.<eos> We could be in Century City or Beverly Hills, but it's important we stay in the community.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why's it important to you?
And it's going to destroy him... and maybe even the whole bloc, unless he's stopped.<eos> And you're different?<eos> - I'm here to help you.<eos> - No.<eos> You're here to help yourself.
You're bad.<eos> Whoever eliminated the Red Hand did us a huge favor.<eos> Now we just need to rein in the Greatest Day and let the people in the middle, the normal people, take control of their bloc.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> There's a call for you, ma'am, from Davos.
It's been resolved.<eos> By planting sarin in his taxi?<eos> You're suggesting that I was somehow involved with what happened with his son?<eos> Hawaladars are known for having black-market connections.<eos> It would be easy for you to get liquid sarin.
The hawaladar's enforcers?<eos> No.<eos> No, they were government agents.<eos> I'm pretty sure they were the same ones who picked up Omar.<eos> What did they want from you?
Which can't make them happy.<eos> We need to find this college kid before they do.<eos> Or they'll make him disappear before we get to talk to him, and Omar will stay locked up.<eos> You kept files on the protestors?<eos> It must've been a headache for you and your team.
Well, someone did get hurt...<eos> Omar Abbas.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> You don't want to leave, Paul.<eos> We have every reason to believe the feds are onto you by now.
It's in a duffel bag.<eos> You're running out of time.<eos> I think that's more than enough for a voice match, don't you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> In fact, Homeland Security is tracing the sarin right back to you now, finding the chemical components you bought to make it.
I think that's more than enough for a voice match, don't you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> In fact, Homeland Security is tracing the sarin right back to you now, finding the chemical components you bought to make it.<eos> Talk to us while you can.<eos> The more people that know your story, the better for you.
- We're gonna try...<eos> - Do you believe I'm innocent?<eos> The whole trial, I never knew whether you believed me.<eos> Defense attorneys aren't supposed to focus on that.<eos> But I have been thinking about you and Claire, how much she meant to you, how much you loved her.
- Do you believe I'm innocent?<eos> The whole trial, I never knew whether you believed me.<eos> Defense attorneys aren't supposed to focus on that.<eos> But I have been thinking about you and Claire, how much she meant to you, how much you loved her.<eos> I believe you.
I wanted her to know who I was.<eos> - Were you serious about any of them?<eos> - No. A lot of them I only saw once.<eos> None of them ever came to my home.<eos> The jury really doesn't like you right now, Gerald.
Good.<eos> Now let's get you two armed up.<eos> What about me?<eos> I'm not in the business of escorting women into danger, ma'am.<eos> Well, you're not escorting me. I'm helping you.
Might I have the pleasure of knowing who's inside that there cabin?<eos> U.S. Federal Marshal Bass Reeves!<eos> I'm Jesse James!<eos> It is a pleasure!<eos> - Man, have I heard about you.
Good ain't one of them.<eos> And you'll live with it.<eos> Uh, Marshal Reeves?<eos> I'm with the "Missouri Star."<eos> Got word of a posse led by you just brought Jesse James to justice.
I could've killed so many people.<eos> The chemicals used to make liquid sarin are arguably more dangerous than the final product.<eos> Not to mention the considerable cost of manufacture.<eos> In 1995, in Japan, a cult spent millions on a facility.<eos> You mind if I join you, Dr. Ducky?
What are you talking about, Agent Gibbs?<eos> Chen.<eos> He came to my house.<eos> He told me that he's working with the CIA now.<eos> Even has you and SecDef on his direct dial.
Look, I appreciate the company, but if you're here to ask me questions, just ask them.<eos> Were you in a relationship with Petty Officer Collins?<eos> You talked to Holden Baxter.<eos> Real prize, isn't he?<eos> Well, he didn't have many good things to say about you, either, so...
Keep doing what you're doing.<eos> International investigations.<eos> Your desk stays the same.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer something high-risk.
Just take me back to the hotel, will you?<eos> My back is screaming, and I want room service.<eos> Fine.<eos> Alone. Not happening.<eos> I've been required to have eyes on you at all times.
For what?<eos> Show-and-tell.<eos> You and Maya lived in the same neighborhood, you worked at the same company, you were friends.<eos> Is that against the law?<eos> She confided in you, she told you she was gonna blow the whistle.
And you think I'm running it from in here.<eos> Well, that's been done before.<eos> To be honest, by the time I got locked up, I didn't have many friends left.<eos> A bunch of 'em got killed.<eos> Yeah, mostly by you.
I-I special order them.<eos> Only this time, when Jones brought 'em out, I had already lost my appetite, so...<eos> So you offered them to Jones.<eos> I didn't... I didn't know.<eos> Those drugs were meant for you.
Heh. I mean... I mean, that good news, that's... enough good news, right?<eos> - Yes. - Yeah.<eos> That's very good news indeed,<eos> Miss Sciuto, but I have a question.<eos> Actually, question's for you, Agent Gibbs.
A fellow SEAL.<eos> Unfortunately, I wouldn't have been back in time to go.<eos> Boss, Dean told his wife he was going on that fishing trip alone.<eos> Did Dean say anything else about the trip?<eos> That's all I got for you.
I'm fine.<eos> Docs aren't gonna grow me a new hand.<eos> Damn.<eos> And I thought I was tough.<eos> The R.A.C.'s not gonna stop looking for you, Dean.
I don't know what he's doing, Alex.<eos> I just know I'm done, and I'm done talking to you about it.<eos> Jeremy and I barely talked.<eos> We had a couple of conversations, but I didn't really know him.<eos> He knew a lot about you.
Erasing your recruits' personal information.<eos> But you lied.<eos> You didn't tell them what you were really doing.<eos> We have the evidence.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we connect this to you.
Previously on "Shooter"...<eos> What can I do for you, Captain?
When you go to the store tomorrow, don't forget to pick up some blueberries.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> - I want out.<eos> - No.<eos> I betrayed everything I've believed in for you.
Funny, I never heard that one before.<eos> How's the private sector?<eos> I heard you gave a speech at Putin's birthday party.<eos> If I only attended the birthday parties of my friends, I'd never leave the house.<eos> - I have a job for you.
There's Evans.<eos> Good place to start. Detective Evans.<eos> Before you even ask, the answer's no.<eos> We understand your position.<eos> We don't want to make this any more difficult for you.
Owen Granger has been in police custody since this morning.<eos> We just got word that he was stabbed.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> For now. Meanwhile, three of my agents are being held by different agencies across the city.<eos> Now, if none of this is news to you, then, bravo, you win.
-Pidge, we're gonna need that shield!<eos> -On it!<eos> -And, Keith, the sword!<eos> -Yes, sir!<eos> [Shiro] Legs, I need everything you got!
It worked!<eos> It won't hold forever.<eos> Keep going!<eos> [Shiro] Come on!<eos> Give it all you got.
"Poverty does not destroy virtue nor wealth bestow it."<eos> Only cinco pesos.<eos> No. No.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - Good for you.
Mae, can you check out the alley while Simmons takes a look at the roof?<eos> You got it, boss.<eos> This way, por favor.<eos> Let's go have a chat, with Drew's girlfriend, Paola.<eos> I know this is a difficult time for you, so I apologize in advance for what I'm about to ask, but every piece of information is vital.
Why don't you stop deflecting and answer my question?<eos> Mira.<eos> Tough guy with his gun and his badge.<eos> Now I'm just a tough guy.<eos> But a little piece of tin doesn't seem like it would be a problem for you.
A hotel manager's a perfect cover if you want to rip off some tourists.<eos> Yeah, and being surrounded by them must have triggered her resentment towards all the foreigners.<eos> And suddenly, it wasn't enough to just steal from them...<eos> She needed to kill them, too.<eos> I owe you and your team an apology.
I'm not trying to pick you up.<eos> I've never noticed fashion in my life.<eos> Well, I have one more question."<eos> "Here comes a creepy question." I go, "What?"<eos> He goes, "Are they comfortable?" "Yeah." "That's a win-win for you, ain't it?"
Sorry.<eos> I've got to take this.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Dr. McCord, it's Marguerite Sanchez from the FBI.<eos> Deputy Director Sanchez, what can I do for you?
- In coach.<eos> - Not great at all, but we'll deal.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Four seats.<eos> That's you, and a minimum detail of two Diplomatic Security agents, and Blake.
Jenny Bach?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm Special Agent Maloof from the FBI,<eos> - And this is...<eos> - I remember you... from Bolivia.
That's why I push so hard to try to make a difference, both at home and abroad.<eos> It is the least that I could do.<eos> And I do admit, sometimes, I push a little too hard.<eos> Well, I can be a little pushy myself.<eos> That's why I like you.
Somebody you trust?<eos> I'll be discreet.<eos> Okay, do that.<eos> I'm gonna get the manifests for the cargo being shipped on those flights.<eos> It's the White House. They need you A.S.A.P.
You are a man of many surprises.<eos> That is how I keep my enemies off-balance.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your friends, too.<eos> In fact, just today President Dalton learned something about you that he found surprising in the extreme.
You don't have to give me a speech.<eos> Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe the Filipino people will be fine with you selling them out to China to enrich yourself.<eos> Hell, maybe the courts will be, too.<eos> I will not be humiliated by you.
Great speech.<eos> The press at home is already talking about how brilliantly I played China and the U.S. off one another to our advantage.<eos> Which was my plan all along.<eos> Sure.<eos> Good for you.
I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> - Spencer, hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Fiona Duncan.<eos> Emily speaks very highly of you.
The other person in the room stabbed her.<eos> I did not kill her. I think I was trying to stop whoever did.<eos> And I'm trying, believe me, I'm trying to remember, but I don't.<eos> And I keep pressing this cut trying to trigger something, but I don't remember anything, and I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I believe you.
I'll get it calendared as soon as possible.<eos> And I'll plead not guilty.<eos> And I'll move to have you released on bail pending trial.<eos> After that, we start an uphill battle.<eos> The bad news is they have a lot of circumstantial evidence against you.
What's so special about Tuesday nights?<eos> My buddies and I, we have night classes, and we meet up afterwards.<eos> You take the same spin class every Tuesday night?<eos> Mm-hmm. I like the instructor.<eos> Does the name Colton Davis mean anything to you?
They don't deserve it.<eos> It's gotta be the worst feeling in the world not to be able to love a woman and be loved back.<eos> Not to be seen for who you really are.<eos> Isn't that right, Alan?<eos> Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Not to be seen for who you really are.<eos> Isn't that right, Alan?<eos> Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I'm with the FBI.<eos> And right now, several guns are trained on you.
America elected a half-as-qualified man with next to no experience. A man who's never stood for anything, who never served this country, and who rolled over out of fear when a terrorist demanded it.<eos> He's gone now, and I'm here, and we both want the same things.<eos> Let's start with that.<eos> The Joint Chiefs want an update.<eos> They work for you.
Gar Saxon was guilty of treason against the throne, collaboration with our enemy, and the execution of my fellow Protectors.<eos> But when the rest of Mandalore finds out about his death, there will be chaos.<eos> Perhaps Mandalore needs chaos if it's to become strong once again, and so that we may find a leader worthy of our people.<eos> (GRUNTING) Sure, now you show up when all the fighting is over.<eos> (GRUNTING) The Empire will come for you once they find out what's happened here.
Get him to open the door with it.<eos> I am Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Admiral Thrawn told you to expect us.<eos> Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Thrawn told me to expect you.
But the abstraction, for me, is this idea of getting rid of everything that's not essential to making a point.<eos> This thing here, it's called The Good Shape or The Good Form.<eos> So I take this flatiron shape and I start doing things out of it.<eos> Men, women, bathroom, strongman, nuclear power plant, cowboys and Indians, all sorts of sports.<eos> [director] So what did your teachers make of you?
So you groomed them.<eos> Dated one, befriended the other.<eos> It's a real long con, wasn't it?<eos> But a charismatic guy like you isn't really used to women telling him no.<eos> It's why it surprised you when they turned you down.
You told me that you had never met Will.<eos> But you had.<eos> And I have proof.<eos> See, you knew that he was important to both of them.<eos> So you threatened to hurt him to get them to smuggle drugs for you.
And that is when I realized... you're not Tom Sawyer.<eos> He never had to kidnap anybody to get what he wanted.<eos> You already got Han and Jane killed.<eos> Whoever you pissed off has taken Kathy.<eos> Does that not mean anything to you?
And I just disagreed with them, completely.<eos> How is it possibly legal that a company makes millions of dollars every year helping pimps sell human sex trafficking victims, including children.<eos> Why would Congress ever grant immunity to a company that engages in conduct like this?<eos> And he said, "Let's do this.<eos> Let's stop Backpage for what they've done to you."
I don't want anyone to have to go through what my daughter has had to go through.<eos> Given the opportunity to speak to Backpage, I would tell them that on April the 7th, 2010, they changed our family's life forever.<eos> We will never be the family we were before my daughter went missing, and before she was sold on that website.<eos> The CDA has given them the ultimate say in this, and I'm here to tell them, as a parent, I am not okay with that.<eos> I would just ask the same question my daughter asked you.
Yes.<eos> Well, you should be.<eos> It's like a tsunami in a bottle.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, Mr. B., this came for you.
"Yeah, I got that at a gift shop."<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> There's Ed.<eos> I got to show him this.<eos> Oh, he's gonna be really happy for you.
Over 68 million Americans leave the safety of our borders every year.<eos> If danger strikes, the FBI's International Response Team is called into action.<eos> We got you.<eos> Unit Chief Jack Garrett, you have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions today.<eos> If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- Shore things up by Monday's vote.<eos> Mr. President, it's possible we may need to consider the other option.<eos> A rescheduled election.<eos> No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line, and turn some others along the way.<eos> We've arranged sit-downs for you and Madam President with all of the small states.
Maybe the president is right. Maybe he does have a better chance in the House.<eos> Don't defer, LeAnn.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.<eos> While it's what's best for Frank, it may not be what's best for you.
Sir. You should probably go back to the main cabin.<eos> You know I'm gonna be the president, right?<eos> - I hope so, sir.<eos> - You hope so?<eos> - I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
I leave tomorrow.<eos> News of the sanctions will hit Monday.<eos> Let's meet before you go.<eos> You're a career diplomat, a professional.<eos> Maybe that's why I trust you.
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.<eos> You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood, - even if you win in the House?<eos> - I'm working on that.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.
You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood, - even if you win in the House?<eos> - I'm working on that.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.<eos> I need you.
What matters is that Will becomes president.<eos> Underwood in office can cause damage.<eos> Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.<eos> I want this election to be between me and Francis Underwood.<eos> Well, it isn't up to you.
Well, it isn't up to you.<eos> Speaker McCarthy isn't letting this particular bill to the floor, unless we have an amendment attached that removes Claire Underwood.<eos> Will...<eos> Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House, you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.<eos> If you get to the Oval, Will, you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.
You would have done the same.<eos> Yeah, but better.<eos> President Underwood?<eos> President Underwood?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.
You have to promise me Will Conway never finds out this came from me.<eos> You know I'm gonna be the president, right?<eos> - I hope so, sir.<eos> - You hope so?<eos> I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.
We've all been responding in real time to a potential terrorist attack.<eos> But you chose to stay here.<eos> Why weren't you in the bunker with us?<eos> I chose to remain in my office to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.<eos> Mmm. And yet there was great tension this morning between you and General Braegher.
If you don't ask, you get asked.<eos> That's what I'm starting to realize.<eos> I'll put a word in.<eos> Yeah? Well, what does that mean?<eos> It means that when the moment is right, I'll mention you.
We've got Special Forces on the ground, tracking.<eos> Russia's presence in Syria is making this more difficult than I once thought.<eos> I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.<eos> It never ceases to astonish me how talented men are at making a mess.<eos> Uh, it's not gonna serve you to go after your own party.
Ways and Means, then.<eos> The keynote at the next convention.<eos> What I want is for Francis Underwood to go to jail.<eos> How is that gonna help you?<eos> Really? How's it gonna help you?
Members of the administration, you bring 'em in one at a time.<eos> You could ride this for a couple of years and secure your place.<eos> While you keep the president in check.<eos> Don't end it before it's begun by calling Jackie Sharp.<eos> You know I see good things for you.
They all have pasts, most of them have witnesses.<eos> One way or another, Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.<eos> So why are you having so much trouble with this one young congressman?<eos> He's tenacious.<eos> He reminds me of you.
See ya.<eos> This is not how we do things in this administration.<eos> You wanted her not to testify. And there's no way Romero can force her to now.<eos> You've put my press secretary and his staff in a very difficult situation.<eos> It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.
It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.<eos> I really felt this was the way to get ahead of it.<eos> This is getting ahead of it?<eos> I guarantee you her lawyers tell her to plead the Fifth now, across the board.<eos> Most importantly, where it concerns you.
- Madam Vice President.<eos> I'm sorry my schedule is so full.<eos> No, I completely understand, with everything that you're dealing with.<eos> I'm sorry for being so insistent, but I thought you should know that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.<eos> Came after you?
Well, it's all there in the briefing.<eos> But if we know this is going to happen, well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?<eos> Francis held on to your resignation letter.<eos> And he wants to tear it up.<eos> I know how difficult these past few months have been for you.
It's not like the old days, when you used to meet surprising people.<eos> Uh... did people get less surprising or are we less easily surprised?<eos> Well, exactly.<eos> - This is me.<eos> - She asked me about you.
- This is me.<eos> - She asked me about you.<eos> - That you're... formidable, etcetera.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Yeah, I told him the same about you, etcetera.
I have already reached out to members of my own party.<eos> I've used my political capital to help you.<eos> But you're still not answering my question.<eos> I think I have.<eos> And I don't need to convince you or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.
You have no idea, none, about what you're doing.<eos> - I'd like you to leave my office.<eos> - Now you listen carefully to me.<eos> - I said...<eos> Here's a headline for you.
"Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.<eos> You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington, but it was actually Jefferson who said it.<eos> Anyway, I wanted to catch you before, uh, Mark and your lawyer got here.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I know this hasn't been easy for you.
Live streaming.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President, we'll bring you anything of substance.<eos> Do it.<eos> And needless to say...<eos> I report only to you, sir.
I wanna meet now.<eos> Right now.<eos> After a tumultuous election, the likes of which have never been seen, America faces more questions...<eos> Shit is insane right now.<eos> I don't have any more time for you.
I really wish I could have changed your mind, Cathy.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Because, you know... you know, this is just not good for you.
Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss.<eos> I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next.<eos> Isn't that it? Isn't that what really bothers you?<eos> Don't think I haven't been watching you from the moment you stepped on board.
No, I don't.<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.<eos> - If you can help her, good.<eos> - What's it worth to you?
- You tell me what you can do for me.<eos> - I've been around your kind.<eos> Not usually at this level. But you can't help yourself.<eos> Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.<eos> What is she worth to you?
Then thank you, and well done.<eos> Now let's get back to what's in front of us.<eos> Does he even want you to be here, Claire?<eos> Mark, please. What I need right now is your political calculus.<eos> He has put you, he has put all of us, in an impossible position.
You know, if you ignore all the pomp and circumstance, the most perverse thing is I actually believe in the presidency. Its importance. What it means around the world, even symbolically.<eos> Gore Vidal once wrote that power is an end to itself, and the instinctive urge to prevail... the most important single human trait.<eos> I've always told myself that everything I did was for her. But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.

But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
- Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.<eos> I don't threaten.<eos> I just try to remain as clear as possible.<eos> You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.<eos> You know... I was here before you and I'll be here after you.
I don't think there's anything I could say that would convince you if you don't already feel it.<eos> Ms. Davis, you are asking me to start a war.<eos> And you seem to deliver on promises when it suits you.<eos> So forgive me if I question your intentions.<eos> I like you.
Ms. Davis, you are asking me to start a war.<eos> And you seem to deliver on promises when it suits you.<eos> So forgive me if I question your intentions.<eos> I like you.<eos> I like being around you.
Well... that leader needs to be stopped.<eos> If she doesn't pardon me... I'll kill her.<eos> Thank you and God bless this great country.<eos> Well, the calls are coming in already.<eos> Well done. This'll be a good night for you.
Why didn't you just help him fix the sink in his house?<eos> I'm not great at plumbing, and thanks to Ryan,<eos> I don't feel bad about that anymore.<eos> Guys, guys, fixing stuff is a manly art, you know, you take great pride in fixing stuff around your house.<eos> Well, does it count if I proudly ask you to come over and take a look at it
Yeah?<eos> Any chance you could lend me a quarter?<eos> Lend you?<eos> Are you a good credit risk?<eos> Terrible... but I think you probably have 30 cents of good karma coming at you.
Just working and traveling and the hundred-hour weeks and the missing of children's birthdays and holidays.<eos> My kids were getting older and I desperately wanted to spend more time with them, and my wife too, and they were really patient.<eos> Right around about the 15th Air Jordan, I was feeling the effects of that.<eos> [director] The 15 was really the first Jordan that had negative reviews.<eos> Was this shoe somehow a turning point for you?
Dr. Palmer.<eos> Agent Gibbs, you wanted to see me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, first of all, I-I didn't know that you were listening last night, and...<eos> I might have said some things, some-some highly, deeply personal things about you and your personal life, but I-I just, I just shouldn't have.
No.<eos> Approximately how many people did you interact with in 1927?<eos> I would say about 15... To 17.<eos> - Right?<eos> - I'm asking you.
Which is why she gave me the code word... Diomedes.<eos> You know what we used to call her? Hmm?<eos> Hetty of Troy.<eos> 'Cause she could launch a thousand ships.<eos> Well, Hetty's got one more mission for you, Captain, and I've only got one more question.
I guess he pulled out his I.V. and walked out.<eos> But he was gone before my shift started.<eos> Are you Henrietta?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I believe this is for you.
And why was it so important that someone confess to my murder?<eos> And whoever wrote this, what could they possibly want?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Harold, it troubles me that you're dissatisfied with the results of our efforts.<eos> Doing good for selfish reasons doesn't make you good.
And whoever wrote this, what could they possibly want?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Harold, it troubles me that you're dissatisfied with the results of our efforts.<eos> Doing good for selfish reasons doesn't make you good.<eos> It just makes you good at being selfish.
The police have already cleared her.<eos> What did Helen tell you about the case against panetti? Nothing.<eos> The attorneys instructed her not to.<eos> She knew how dangerous this was, but she agreed to testify anyway.<eos> I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you.
What is she talking about?<eos> You can play dumb, Mr. panetti.<eos> From what I hear, you've made quite a profession out of skirting responsibility for your actions.<eos> Now, hang on. We can find him on our own.<eos> And when we do, you'll realize that this trial you're facing is a small matter when compared to what happens when the full force of the FBI comes down on you and your organization.
Look around, agent.<eos> You really want to start shooting here?<eos> We have your files.<eos> Your wife.<eos> She's eager to testify against you.
We're gonna try.<eos> Trey Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of 8 people.<eos> 8?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
Stay out of the woods!<eos> There's a bear in the woods!<eos> She's relentless, always has been.<eos> And she knows exactly how to make me mad.<eos> How much of yourself do you see in your daughter? Oh!
That thing is in the house.<eos> Be quiet, Ira, close the drapes.<eos> - Chickens coming to roost.<eos> - These are not my chickens.<eos> That man that's coming after you, there's a direct line from him to Kira.
You've all benefited from your seats at this table.<eos> We owe a great debt to Mr Westmorland.<eos> I don't carry debts, Ms Duncan.<eos> Mr Al-Khatib, we freed your daughter from a genetic heart defect.<eos> What is that worth to you?
How can I help you?<eos> Rachel, I'm just checking in to make sure that you're all right.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Well, I have asked you to do something that you don't want to do.<eos> I would do anything for you.
Hey, Sarah, we still got nothing.<eos> I'm with Kira and she said Helena is in trouble.<eos> I can feel her.<eos> Her babies are coming.<eos> Well, I see only two options for you.
I need to speak with her the moment she's detained.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> I wasn't asking permission.<eos> Hey, I stood by you.<eos> Signed off on cases that are increasingly personal to you.
See, you want to hurt Reddington. We want to capture him.<eos> Seems like we both want the same things.<eos> I can assure you we do not.<eos> Well, you're looking at life in prison.<eos> So, maybe you help us, and we'll help you.
Not so fast.<eos> What the...<eos> Come on.<eos> Really?<eos> We'll crack a window for you.
Oh, my God.<eos> Ed, I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't you want to say goodbye to Bogey?<eos> No, that's why I need you to do it.<eos> Look at you, acting all brave when we all know you're in a lot of pain.
Wait.<eos> You do know "Harry Potter" is fiction?<eos> So is "The Last of the Mohicans."<eos> You're not telling me there's no such thing as a Mohican, are you?<eos> All right, well, I don't know if I believe you, but this will make a great story for my Gryffindor group chat.
So just don't do that anymore.<eos> Please.<eos> Please just get out of here.<eos> I need to see my family.<eos> I won't tell anyone about you or this place.
- Hi.<eos> - Stuck in, uh, traffic for over an hour. Ew.<eos> Well, we have been waiting for almost two hours.<eos> Well, I'm in the middle of a very busy afternoon.<eos> What can I do for you?
Two people were killed in that blast, and one of them was a teenager from Reynolds, so what happened?<eos> Did he kiss another kid in front of you?<eos> You decided to teach him a lesson?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm warning you: Lose the grin, or I will lose it for you.
We'd talk.<eos> When's the last time you were at the house, Dan?<eos> A week and a half ago.<eos> I took everything but the heavy stuff I was gonna sell online.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might've had it out for you?
He offered me a thousand bucks cash to hold the place.<eos> Well, you should at least have a phone number, right?<eos> No.<eos> He said he was gonna call me today.<eos> Does anybody else besides you and Dan have a key to the place?
- Yeah.<eos> - Who was he?<eos> Half a con artist living a double life.<eos> Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.<eos> Marvin, is this the man who approached you last night?
- Who was he?<eos> Half a con artist living a double life.<eos> Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.<eos> Marvin, is this the man who approached you last night?<eos> You and your friend Jupiter?
He's jumped.<eos> Where?<eos> Frankie says you have something of vital interest to me.<eos> These tax ledgers were seized during the raid on one of your establishments a few years ago.<eos> Key evidence for the tax evasion case they're building against you.
Is he not afraid to be out in the open like this?<eos> The people of Chicago loved him.<eos> They would chant his name at Cubs games.<eos> So, it's true, then?<eos> All charges against you have been dropped?
Your boyfriend covered every base.<eos> Where are they, Jiya?<eos> - Where the hell is my machine?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> And you expect us to believe you?
And if you tell anyone who I am, you're gonna have more than one Capone to worry about.<eos> Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?<eos> All over the country, for years.<eos> He misses you.<eos> I understand how hard it must be for you to face him.
Would you like one?<eos> Yes, please!<eos> It's lovely.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the whole world.
I... There's no time to pick you up.<eos> I'll meet you there, okay?<eos> Bless you.<eos> Okay. My wife finally coughed up your name, Mr. Jackson.<eos> I envy you, my friend.
What are you talking about?<eos> ...city in terror as the killer claims a fourth victim in a grim replay of city in terror and the killer claims an all-too familiar scenario.<eos> He's killing them.<eos> I-It's all happening the same.<eos> You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the world.
I fear the opposite.<eos> I am informed that retired police officers have an extremely high suicide rate.<eos> In most cases, the officers have no family members who might see the warning signs.<eos> Many, like you, are divorced, their grown children living away from home.<eos> I think of you, all alone in your house on Harper Road, Detective Hodges, and I grow concerned.
- No, I'm fine.<eos> Come sit.<eos> As I mentioned before, - I worked on the case.<eos> - You worked on the case, yeah.<eos> My sister spoke of you... not highly.
Rittenhouse thinks we were playing checkers while I was playing 3D chess.<eos> Why are you telling me all this?<eos> Because... you're dull, but honest.<eos> So you can take this to the dull, honest authorities.<eos> Why should I believe you after everything you've done?
Excuse me, gentlemen. You've been reassigned.<eos> But thank you for your service.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[scoffs] I don't have time for this.<eos> It's time to go, girl.<eos> Party over.<eos> It's time to go, girl.<eos> [woman] Is an overactive bladder the boss of you?
But, Titus, there is!<eos> Your liar guy!<eos> Is there any chance I can come--<eos> Fifty-third and Sixth, across from the Sbarro's.<eos> Sbarro's: let the airport come to you.
Answer me!<eos> Collaborates with Hanka Robotics will be destroyed.<eos> You okay?<eos> You're injured.<eos> You're not the same.
Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
You know, the scan... Also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
Major..<eos> Major!<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> 98 unsuccessful attempts before you.
No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You would not exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?
I'll take that under advice.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the puppy.<eos> Oh, you surprised me.<eos> She likes you.
Watch the watchers.<eos> Fight the enemy within.<eos> Damn, that's so complicated.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me simplify it for you.
Zeke.<eos> He parked outside the house for hours.<eos> I had to wait.<eos> That's my girl. Always thinking.<eos> Hey, I don't know about you, but I'm starvin'.
You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.
Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career.<eos> In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.<eos> What does Ed have on you?
Get on your knees.<eos> Please, I won't say anything, I swear!<eos> - That's what everybody says.<eos> - Jesus, you've done this before?<eos> No. No, I. I just don't believe you.
Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.<eos> Ed doesn't trust that Andy won't do something stupid.<eos> But he can trust you, right?
- What's happened? - I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I love you, that's all.<eos> I wish. I could be a better husband to you.
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.
- That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
Okay, impeached.<eos> Too late.<eos> I resign.<eos> I was first.<eos> This could be a great thing for you, sweetie.
Hello.<eos> Did you or did you not dump this girl after getting her pregnant?<eos> I'm sorry, what's going on now?<eos> I'm just...<eos> I never did like you, not even as a child.
That's your first question.<eos> What was I supposed to say, El?<eos> I constantly disappoint you.<eos> Then you tell me that you think our kid will grow up thinking that I'm just a joke.<eos> That I was never good enough for you.
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.
Truly wonderful day.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> He's such a great guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about being so far away from you today.
Hey-<eos> I know I'm probably the last person in the world you ever want to see again.<eos> And I get that.<eos> Totally understand.<eos> And it will probably suck for you to have to see me again under any circumstances which is why I wanted to say that whatever happened between us and however it ended I think, you know, I could be a really good dad, probably, if you'll just...
Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!<eos> Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.
It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to be disappointed by anybody but you!<eos> And I don't want to disappoint anybody but you.
Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.<eos> The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.
Shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.
Okay.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.<eos> They are looking to find me.<eos> And when they do... I am gonna be right behind you.
Okay, cool.<eos> - Maybe, like...<eos> - Ostriches.<eos> - Guys, still stuck.<eos> - Mitch, hey, need you.
Don't you touch my dick!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Ronnie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> I'm proud of you, Ronnie.
You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.<eos> - We all do.<eos> - Look.<eos> Mitch, right?<eos> - Lieutenant to you.
Look, you're on the team, and I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Brody, let's go, I don't want to wait for you.
We're starting bright and early tomorrow.<eos> How was your first riptide?<eos> It stings!<eos> That's just the lactic acid.<eos> Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.
I don't know.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know what I'm doing here.<eos> Mitch sees something in you.
Failed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, we're gonna be - in swimsuits a lot, so...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If it's gonna be a problem for you...
...eight, nine, ten.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, other than him, we did good, right?<eos> Like, we saved everyone.<eos> Yes, including you.
You look really nice.<eos> Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.<eos> That shirt come in big-boy size?<eos> Well, at least I'm undercover.<eos> Look at you.
Thank you. Thank you.<eos> So many people.<eos> So as a welcome to the bay, I...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Mitch, this is for you.
The big whale gets away?<eos> Do you hear yourself when you talk?<eos> I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> We were depending on you tonight.
They're behind this.<eos> Mitch, it's Thorpe, your boss.<eos> Look, stop with the Huntley crap, okay?<eos> And don't even come down here.<eos> We don't need you.
Your new post.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready for this, man.<eos> They need you.
- Yes, Mitch.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.<eos> You are the bay.<eos> Mitch, the bay needs you.
- Evidence.<eos> Well, why didn't you say so, man?<eos> - Heck, yeah!<eos> - Thank God you're pretty.<eos> I'm really proud of you, man.
Come on.<eos> Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> Why'd you have to go snooping?<eos> Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.
You are the motherfucking tech guy.<eos> I'm the motherfucking tech guy.<eos> Come on, Ronnie.<eos> - All right, let's go.<eos> - I'm behind you, dude.
Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.<eos> Let the words you speak be the words that call me back to you.
Jakob.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.
This is how it must be.<eos> We must help her.<eos> Jakob.<eos> Jakob, listen to me closely.<eos> Your mother is watching over you.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.
Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.
Well, I'll let you know by noon.<eos> Well, I can't organize a playdate before...<eos> You want something to eat? No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
Okay.<eos> I love the sky on mornings like this.<eos> Hey. Greasy forehead, window, off.<eos> I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on Cupid Day.<eos> That's Valentine's Day to you!
I'd never let my best friend die a virgin.<eos> Ooh! You didn't think we'd forget, did you?<eos> It's the big day, opening night.<eos> Rob texted me.<eos> He said, "I made my bed for you."
All right. I'm sorry. We're fine.<eos> We're fine. You're crazy!<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you
We're freakin' fine.<eos> Go ahead and say we're through<eos> I don't care, I'll just get another you<eos> I'll get another dude that look like you<eos> I don't need you and you don't need me
- Yeah.<eos> She freaked me out.<eos> Sam, you're 20 minutes late!<eos> Let's shake it, sister!<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
How did you...<eos> It wasn't a dream.<eos> It really happened.<eos> Again.<eos> Sammy, you like the bird I made you?
So, we're going over to your house, right?<eos> Obviously.<eos> Can I borrow something?<eos> Always. I got you.<eos> Hey. Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.
Always. I got you.<eos> Hey. Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.<eos> Also, uh, this rose came for you.
I'm good, thanks.<eos> Lindsay's got it covered.<eos> Mom? Oh.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
I love you, too, old man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sammy, you forgot your gloves!<eos> What would I do without you?
Just don't.<eos> But it's Juliet.<eos> Exactly, it's Juliet.<eos> She has a name and she is a person.<eos> Yesterday, you said you were afraid she would bite you if she got too close.
Leave me alone!<eos> I can't.<eos> Sam! Sam!<eos> Why did you run away from me?<eos> I can't talk to you right now. You've been ignoring me for years, and then you... You kiss me and then go back to acting like I'm invisible?
It's too late.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.
No, it's not.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10.
Well, Hitler wants Poland.<eos> It's what everyone's saying.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about it, I assure you.<eos> I'm a zoologist, not a politician.<eos> Mama, Jerzyk needs you!
You paved the way with pigs.<eos> What a crack-brained idea, and what splendid luck for us!<eos> I'll work with him.<eos> We can keep our eye on him with the bison here.<eos> Well, he trusts you, that's clear.
It exploded in his stomach.<eos> He couldn't be saved.<eos> It's such a tragedy for me.<eos> I respected him very much indeed.<eos> Szymon told me about you.
But Papa's in Zalesie.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Your papa's in Zalesie.<eos> Good boy for reminding me.<eos> Your parents must be proud of you.
I forgot.<eos> Your papa's in Zalesie.<eos> Good boy for reminding me.<eos> Your parents must be proud of you.<eos> Tell them they should be proud of you.
The whole point?<eos> No, it couldn't be that simple.<eos> Here's one.<eos> And then it was over.<eos> That's it for you.
Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.<eos> You know, I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we... we really need you on the road.
- Maybe you saw smokey.<eos> - Definitely not smokey.<eos> - No, it wasn't smokey.<eos> I really don't like rats.<eos> I don't like rats. It's more scared of you than you are of him.
Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?<eos> Very funny.<eos> - Relax, man.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> - The dog's laughing at you.
Okay, well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.<eos> I've been trying.<eos> He's, uh... he's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. Did you hear what he said about you?
- Come on, boy.<eos> - Does it sound good to you?<eos> - Well, I don't know.<eos> You tell me. - Will that be good for you?<eos> Will you be happy then if I just...?
- We got you. We got you. - Okay.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> I'll check around back!<eos> I'm here... right behind you.
I'm... I'm being careful.<eos> I'm being careful. - Hi.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - Good to see you. - Oh!<eos> Oh, look at you.
What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to...<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> You can't do this for me, Hannah.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
I named him waffles.<eos> Not inside.<eos> Come on.<eos> I kept telling her you were going to get bigger.<eos> Not so into you now, is she?
You like that?<eos> It's been so long since I've had fun.<eos> Where is she going?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> There's something about you.
But I guess he's not home.<eos> Hi, Ethan.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> I brought your dog home.<eos> Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.
Yes, I do, yeah.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing but love for my fellow human beings.<eos> I'm a people person all the way, one hundred percent.<eos> Look at you.
The real Pippi.<eos> And I think that maybe... maybe I still know her.<eos> It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.
Enjoy, guys.<eos> When are you done?<eos> Wilson. I can't.<eos> We're short tonight.<eos> No, I got a great surprise for you.
Thank God.<eos> So... what do you want to do about this?<eos> Wilson, I've seen it.<eos> Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you.
Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.<eos> And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.
I mean... Do they know about your... troubles?<eos> They're really cool with me.<eos> Do Claire's parents even know where she is, Pippi?<eos> Oh, my God, Polly!<eos> Look at you!
I...<eos> I tried to get my lawyer to find you.<eos> I even tried to go through Polly.<eos> Oh, she was on the warpath.<eos> I have thought of you every day. A thousand times.
Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial...<eos> I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.
I'm all done with that life.<eos> Are you headed to school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, good for you.
Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.<eos> Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.
We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> So whatever happened with you and Francisco?
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
Peace?<eos> For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.
I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.
- If you're the king...<eos> - No! ...declare yourself.<eos> The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.
Now!<eos> Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.<eos> Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.
You have no more home.<eos> It was razed days ago.<eos> You've no more life to go back to.<eos> Like it or not, this is your lot.<eos> And even we don't like you.
Run, son!<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.
It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.<eos> Jack's Eye turned.<eos> Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.
You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
I'm a target, aren't I?<eos> God help us.<eos> They've sent me a buffoon.<eos> You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.
But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?<eos> Who's this young man?<eos> I'm the cleaner, sir.<eos> Who's he to you?
George?<eos> Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium.<eos> Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.
Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.
People aren't proud enough.<eos> Selfish!<eos> Arrogant!<eos> Conceited!<eos> If you know what's good for you, you will stay as far away from this man as you possibly can!
All his life, he's tried to get free.<eos> He doesn't know how.<eos> You aren't who you think you are.<eos> He doesn't love you.<eos> I like you this way.
Don't leave.<eos> - Help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> - Let me put these down.<eos> What can I get for you?
I don't know.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> ♪ Leave it there, leave it there ♪<eos> ♪ Leave it there.. ♪<eos> Does Dad even look at you?
Wow.<eos> I didn't know what to tell him.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, this is... that's a good...<eos> That's a good opportunity for you.
He's after you.<eos> I dreamed of having him help me the same way he helped you.<eos> You don't have to, uh... you know, hide anything.<eos> We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?
- Yeah, of course.<eos> - Hi there.<eos> - Say hello.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Look at you.
It's a chicken.<eos> Hold on, you gotta...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> ♪ Rather die in your arms than die lonesome... ♪<eos> I hope I don't fall in love with you.
♪ Human ♪<eos> Touch me.<eos> ♪ We are not human... ♪<eos> Fallen so low.<eos> I had to find my way out... of you.
Thought! Could do better than others.<eos> Didn't need what made life sweet for them.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm sor...<eos> I'm sorry that you're not as proud of me... as you are... with my sisters.
♪ You can't make me go away ♪<eos> ♪ I'm inside your DNA ♪<eos> ♪ You can't make me go away ♪<eos> ♪ AH you do is fuck and eat, That's what we do too ♪<eos> ♪ Tough for you 'cause you're our meat But we don't make the rules ♪
You're unhappy-<eos> I can see it.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> She's the wrong person for you.
What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with.<eos> You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!<eos> You see now...<eos> I love your mom, I love you.
I'm on my way.<eos> I took it out of the bathroom.<eos> You moved evidence without properly conducting an investigation?<eos> I moved evidence because it needed to be moved.<eos> I'm waiting out front for you.
I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
Where are you?<eos> I'm still at the Luxus casino.<eos> What the fuck is going on, Vin?<eos> Listen.<eos> Everything I do is about you and him.
Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.<eos> Listen.<eos> Got a folder on my desk.<eos> It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.
- I'm done. - No, listen to me!<eos> You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.<eos> My decision, my idea, it was always my story.<eos> Was it real enough for you?
The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla...<eos> A little anemic without the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, Father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me... who created you?
Hey! Where are you?<eos> I miss you.<eos> Would you take a look at this?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I said I wouldn't go without you... - You all right?
Welcome back, Danny.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, that's me done, Tee.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm following you in.
- Over here.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oram, behind you.
- Faris!<eos> He already puked all over me!<eos> Faris, what's going on?<eos> Just stay here. I'm gonna get Oram.<eos> Oram, I need you back here right now.
What the fuck was that?<eos> We are okay.<eos> There's another one!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Behind you!
Entirely unworthy of his creation.<eos> I pitied him at the end.<eos> Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.<eos> Bravo!<eos> You have symphonies in you, brother.
What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I'm going to do to you.
Like, "bye." Another one will come.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not gonna talk about that anymore.<eos> I wanna focus on you and me on the beach.
Okay, I'm gonna go.<eos> Bye.<eos> I want you to leave!<eos> You get out of here.<eos> Okay, one more for you.
Bye.<eos> I want you to leave!<eos> You get out of here.<eos> Okay, one more for you.<eos> Yeah, not for you, Andrew.
I didn't heat it up.<eos> It's bread temperature.<eos> Maybe three to four minutes and get it nice and toasty?<eos> We could toasty-toasty!<eos> Don't ask mom to toast your bread for you!
Mmm-hmm.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Oh!<eos> That was a long time ago, honey.<eos> Ma this would be so great for you.
All the single ladies!<eos> 'Cause it's upon their shoulders that I'm standing.<eos> No, I won't back down!<eos> No!<eos> So I stand before you right now, Linda and I ask you will you
Non-refundable!<eos> Mom!<eos> I can't.<eos> Help me put the "fun" in non-refundable.<eos> I actually kinda caught a piece of you, mom.
Are you afraid these dogs are gonna rape me?<eos> Is that the main concern?<eos> Can I just see that?<eos> I didn't look at the dogs.<eos> Do they look like rapists to you?
Is that finished?<eos> I mean, people have certainly finished on it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know why I just said that.<eos> I'm trying to, like, be funny for you.
You will come tomorrow.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I've got 'em right here in my chi-chas.<eos> Chi-cha?<eos> I'll see you and James tomorrow.
I'm trying!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Watch out, mom!<eos> He's right behind you!
Hi.<eos> When does the next bus leave?<eos> Bus doesn't leave for about 36 hours.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> But I know a man who can take care of you.
I gave you everything I had.<eos> Everything!<eos> And I did it alone!<eos> What the hell have you ever done for anybody?<eos> For 18 years your mother is the most important person to you in your entire life.
- Thanks, macho.<eos> - You ready?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna head out of here.<eos> Oh, you can't go just yet.<eos> Um, you have a parasite in you.
I think it's probably...<eos> It's pretty significant.<eos> Oh!<eos> Listen.<eos> We're out of praziquantel so we're going to have to substract it from you manually.
- Yeah.<eos> You did good.<eos> Hi, maco.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Emily, this is a traditional gift that the village made for you.
Thank you.<eos> Emily, this is a traditional gift that the village made for you.<eos> It's for protection while you're here.<eos> For me?<eos> Yes, for you.
'Cause I'm kinda helping...<eos> Helping out the ladies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come here, you know i got you, girl.<eos> Look at you helping.
Who's the guy?<eos> Not me!<eos> It isn't.<eos> It's never been.<eos> I'd love to be the guy who sweeps you off your feet and is your hero and can save your mother and take care of you and maybe we hook up.
Esmeraldas!<eos> She's in esmeraldas.<eos> It's, like, an hour's drive from here.<eos> We got a real chatty Cathy here.<eos> Give me a map. I can mark it on the map for you.
Hey, Emily, can I just say, as well, you...<eos> Fuck, you look great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I got a tapeworm.<eos> Well, it's working for you.
A fresh pea, right? A normal pea.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I really don't think about peas, Alex.<eos> It's not really you, it's your subconscious.<eos> Do you really think the part of you that dreams is gonna put a rotten pea in a can?
I saw the world darken.<eos> I felt the weight of that mud pressing down on me.<eos> And my heart beat so fast until it just collapsed.<eos> And I left myself.<eos> Don't you know that you're the one that I've been waiting for all of this time?
What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.<eos> She's got plans for you, Nick.
Just give in.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> They will kill you... just as they killed my chosen before you.
What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me... I took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.
I promise.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We are just never gonna happen.<eos> And it's not me.<eos> It's you.
That is a Smurf.<eos> We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.
- Hey.<eos> That thing's safe, right?<eos> Is it safe?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'd get back here if I were you.
Thank you, Azrael.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> A different design?<eos> Yes, of course, I noticed that right away.<eos> Slightly before you did, in fact.
- Hasta la bunny.<eos> - See you on the way back!<eos> Hey.<eos> What is this thing?<eos> I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
We don't have a Smurfette.<eos> But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover, Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone can just introduce themselves later.<eos> Look at you.
Yeah. From a lump of clay.<eos> Really cool story, actually.<eos> I knew I didn't trust her.<eos> You'd like her if you get to know her.<eos> She's just like you, but nice.
I've come to repledge my loyalty to you, my true Papa.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - She can't be serious.<eos> No, no, no, she would never.<eos> Even if I did believe you, which I don't, what could you possibly offer me that I don't already have?
It's a lot more power.<eos> Now, why are you doing this?<eos> I'm so tired of being good.<eos> Use your power to transform me back to my evil self.<eos> Your loyalty has returned to you.
But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.<eos> Copperfield's coming.<eos> Presto changeo!<eos> Woman in a box. In a box.<eos> Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.
Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.<eos> The House always did like you better.
Rama says we have to work together. Come on!<eos> It's a dream team.<eos> You, me, Zatanna, Batman, maybe even the Justice League.<eos> The capes and tights crew, useless against dark magic.<eos> That's why we need you.
Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house?<eos> - Who's he talking to now?<eos> - Shrouds.<eos> They deliver souls to hell.<eos> They're drawn to you.
I swear it.<eos> Release me, Merlin, from your care.<eos> My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible, friend Demon.<eos> I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.
- If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you? Shocking.
Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.
Rise the demon Etrigan!<eos> So Constantine calls once more. Just like a greedy, wanton...<eos> Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!<eos> Killjoy.<eos> I've had many years to think about you, Etrigan.
And every two months you're getting a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?<eos> You don't want that.<eos> I don't even like this thing.<eos> No!<eos> And it doesn't like you, either.
Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,<eos> "You get straight A's, you get a puppy."<eos> I like your confidence.<eos> Must have got that from you, young man.
Of course.<eos> Oh, this stupid bitch.<eos> I wish I could tase his old ass.<eos> Here comes an eggplant. Eggplant.<eos> Hey, you.
Got to the park around 2:00 p.m.<eos> Talked to my friend Paul for a few minutes, then ran one of the ticket booths.<eos> Hi, Tony.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I've got you a souvenir.
Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.<eos> And I must say, the beard does give you a certain...<eos> Can't have that.<eos> I should shave it off at the first opportunity.<eos> I like you with a little scruff.
He's an international thief.<eos> He's wanted for money laundering, computer fraud, smuggling...<eos> - This the guy from Russia?<eos> - Yeah. Coop, look...<eos> You're the kid genius and all, but the director feels we went way out of our comfort zone for you last time.
While I've got all the time in the world, but, unfortunately, your daughter doesn't have that luxury.<eos> Please...<eos> Don't hurt her.<eos> We... her wellbeing is entirely in your hands.<eos> I tell you what.
Now!<eos> After years of chasing you around the globe, I finally got the Saint.<eos> Simon!<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - You too.
That's crazy.<eos> A helicopter attack in broad daylight.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna sleep with my shoes on.<eos> There's never a dull moment when Simon templar comes to la.<eos> How's all that gear working out for you?
You're under arrest.<eos> Really, fernack?<eos> Three guns?<eos> You only have two hands.<eos> Enjoy this moment. 'Cause I'll be coming after you again.
My father asked you for mercy, not for himself, for his family. And you gave him none.<eos> I'm glad it's you, Simon.<eos> It ought to be you.<eos> But there's more than just me out there.<eos> The brotherhood will be coming after you.
- Smells like pussy.<eos> - Why would it smell like pussy?<eos> Oh, hey, ocre.<eos> What's up?<eos> We were just talking about you.
Burton's tough as nails, and chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm...<eos> Look, chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it.<eos> I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture.<eos> And if I don't go?<eos> If you don't go, then I was wrong about you.
Oh, yeah, that's good.<eos> Let's get some sleep.<eos> Rodriguez, I got you a movie!<eos> - Keep your hands off of me.<eos> - I'll be thinking of you!
Medevac is two Mikes out.<eos> Get a stretcher over here!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Let's go. Get him up.<eos> - We got you. We got you.
You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.<eos> Fucking shit!<eos> I did what I could for you!
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
- What? I'll need an office if I am to be Madame Veronika.<eos> All right.<eos> Your office... Is there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get rather than what you always hoped for.<eos> Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.
Choose disappointment.<eos> And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.<eos> Until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece, they will all be gone.<eos> And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.
And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.<eos> Choose your future, Veronika.<eos> Choose life.<eos> Anyway, it amused us at the time.<eos> I like you, Mark.
What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me?<eos> - No, not about you.
- Frank, come on.<eos> - You knew.<eos> Stringing me along, so you were.<eos> Honestly, mate...<eos> Fucking deal with you later.
Rent Boy.<eos> You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.
You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
- There's another one.<eos> - Oh, my God, he's huge.<eos> Oh, my God, look at those teeth. I can't believe how close they are. - I dare you to touch him.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Well, he definitely likes to look at you.
I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you.<eos> I thought that you were never coming back.<eos> I'm so sorry I got us into this.<eos> The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?<eos> You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate. Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you. I could never compete with that.
Kate?<eos> Kate, I can hear you! Can you hear me?<eos> You're breaking up!<eos> Kate?<eos> I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go.
Kate, are you okay?<eos> Yeah. Okay. They sent down some flares.<eos> I've got the spare tank. Kate, get down.<eos> Stay down. Where is it, Lisa?<eos> It's right above you, don't move.
- Yeah? - Are we gonna go on jet skis?<eos> Because Colin said he went on a lake and his dad let him drive a jet ski.<eos> Six year old Colin rode a jet ski by himself?<eos> He went 100 miles per hour.<eos> And he also said that his dad can kick your ass because you're a doctor.
Lucas, yeah.<eos> Uh, Jules found a really good deal in the Caribbean.<eos> We're gonna spend some quality time with the family.<eos> Oh, that's what vacations are for.<eos> And only because of you Margie and I were able to spend our last vacation together.
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
- I'll fold.<eos> - What was that?<eos> I'll fold.<eos> Fold what, cards?<eos> We have machines behind you that fold cards, Ray.
Listen.<eos> You're still divorced, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still.<eos> Good for you.
'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Styvesan, how's tricks?<eos> The same.<eos> Look, I got a business proposition for you.
There's good money here for you.<eos> Here's an advance.<eos> I'll pay you triple freelance rate.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I know I said a lot of nasty things about you.
Please stick around.<eos> So, Ray, uh, what'd you think?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of the poem.<eos> Well, your motorcycle tipped over on you.
Yeah. The real one's right here.<eos> You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
Stop!<eos> Hey, what are we waiting for?<eos> Use your brain, Sonnyboy.<eos> You know, I got a card when I got out of prison one time, from my momma.<eos> "Young man," with brains, muscles, looks, and girls chasing you... you'll go far.
Tell 'em what the card said. Just tell them.<eos> Why does it even matter?<eos> 'Cause.<eos> You got paid to be with me.<eos> You know what that makes you?
- All right.<eos> Ray! - I'm your man.<eos> Eddie, it's Ron.<eos> I do not know if you remember me.<eos> I left your mother's vagina before you. We grew up together.
Do not get mad.<eos> - No but...<eos> - Look.<eos> Do not let it affect you.<eos> He loves you.
You expect me to accept them so as not to feel guilty.<eos> My godfather.<eos> Did you learn that in the program?<eos> What I said...<eos> So you think he's a godfather?
It is there, and it will never come.<eos> We have no contact.<eos> That is a relief for someone.<eos> For me, I suppose.<eos> But maybe not for you, and I'm sorry.
All right.<eos> And now I want you to say:<eos> "My name was Edward Garrett and my friend gene was right."<eos> - I'm addicted to losing.<eos> - Why do I have to say this about you?
- Why do I have to say this about you?<eos> Agree.<eos> My name is Edward Garrett and my friend gene was right.<eos> I'm addicted to losing.<eos> - That was easy for you.
I'm not begging you.<eos> That ended. Yes?<eos> What did you come for?<eos> I'm going to go to meetings and I'm going to change.<eos> I want employment. I want to work for you.
- What is this?<eos> - What?<eos> It's sweat.<eos> I've never seen it before.<eos> You've learned something.
As if someone else had to take care of the situation.<eos> "I can not do anything.<eos> What I do?".<eos> You could go to work and make money.<eos> But people expect things from you. They want you to do other things.
- What happened, Victor?<eos> Are you going to pay today?<eos> I'm going to pay now!<eos> - Friend!<eos> - That's for you, my friend.
- My favorite part.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You earned it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Watch out.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> You look great.<eos> - They're for you.
We'll go to the gate.<eos> He will make fun of how I parked.<eos> Then he will make fun of my clothes.<eos> The joke will not be funny.<eos> Then he will look at you, he will have a revelation and say,
That's why I smiled.<eos> Very good.<eos> I'm going to take a break. Brian will replace me.<eos> Luck.<eos> This is for you.
Uh... - Triangles? - What?<eos> Okay, Eileen, what about you?<eos> Yeah, it was all right.<eos> One thing I didn't under...<eos> Man, it's painful watching you sometimes.
- Yeah.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Maybe you'll be able to come back to school soon.<eos> - Yeah, maybe.<eos> - Boring without you there.
- Like you'd ever dare throw chips at me.<eos> - Yeah, what would you do about it?<eos> Give you a slap, obviously.<eos> You'd have to find a chair to stand on first.<eos> You're gonna regret all this talk when I'm owning you in front of everyone.
Lucy!<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Heard about what happened to you and Ben.
- Leave it to me, boss.<eos> Got ya.<eos> You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.<eos> I'm not a kid anymore. I don't have to tell you everything.<eos> You know, I see your mom in you when I look at you.
- She was a junkie.<eos> - She was your mother.<eos> And she was my daughter.<eos> She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.
She made mistakes, but she was kind. And she was good.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.<eos> So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.<eos> I love you.
- Till he's dead!<eos> - Step him out!<eos> Knock this shit out!<eos> "At first, everything was perfect until I fell pregnant."<eos> Tell me more, sweetheart, because you're the one I feel sorry for.
- Lucky, I guess.<eos> That's yet to be established.<eos> - So go on.<eos> Show me what you can do.<eos> - I won't steal for you.
There are forces trying to kill them. - Forces?<eos> - They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.
You're less affected.<eos> You know he needs a higher dose.<eos> And I know you got more money squirreled away.<eos> That money's to get us out of here.<eos> No, not us. You and him.
Come.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can stay here, Laura.<eos> It's safe.<eos> We can look after you here.
Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.
I did what I had to do to save Laura.<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic.<eos> So much easier for you.<eos> Easier?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?<eos> There is a young mutant sitting in our car.<eos> Yeah, I see that.<eos> And where we're taking her, there are others.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
No?<eos> Wow.<eos> More for us.<eos> You're acting like a child!<eos> They're coming for you.
Please, tell me.<eos> What did he say?<eos> Danny.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.
What did he say?<eos> Danny.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.<eos> Piece for you.
Like she needs to be laying in front of the TV any more than she already does.<eos> Poor thing, bless her heart, she's gonna have a rough go of it come junior high.<eos> You know, I told Tilly she needs to get her into that new pilates for preteens class...<eos> - ...over on Fairmont.<eos> - What can I do for you, Madeleine?
Paul?<eos> Where the fuck did he go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Paul, come on, dude.<eos> I'm not coming to get you.
I can't imagine your ex really understood the agreement he made back when he made it.<eos> The agreement?<eos> He offered you.<eos> Who do you think he offered you to?<eos> Is it all coming back to you Cora?
Of course I wasn't there.<eos> I only heard the story a thousand times and I suppose the story gets distorted over time, but it happened.<eos> And I have made my contribution.<eos> I'd like to believe that I've made a difference in all this.<eos> I have been blessed to watch over you all these years.
And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own I went to the doctor I should've seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day that day I found out they wanted you for their own.<eos> I had to choose my old life or you, and I chose you, Andy.
Yeah, I like it.<eos> Oh!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, my gosh. Sorry.<eos> Yeah, he likes you.
Then he goes...<eos> And then all their friends join in.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> I have a surprise for you.
- No shit.<eos> It's state of the art, though.<eos> All you gotta do is put in your order, and it does the rest.<eos> Coffee.<eos> You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you, and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.
I'll go with medium.<eos> And then you hit "brew."<eos> And it's done.<eos> Thank God.<eos> And one Americano. For you.
She wants to change the song to a Big Sean song.<eos> Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?<eos> Daddy learned the song from Rent.<eos> - We can do the same dance moves.<eos> - All right, look, Ally, I know this dance is a big deal for you, okay?
Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe you just wanna give 'em a free period and call it a day.<eos> A free period?<eos> What good would that do?<eos> Oh, you know, it's the last day of school and I'm sure they'd like you for it, and this isn't working, so...
Thank you, Coach.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Everybody, on the track!<eos> Clifford, stop doggin' it.<eos> I will fuck you up.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I knew that you wouldn't stand up to these people. I just knew it.<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean, you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes, you just let people push you around.
- I don't either.<eos> Because technology's always changing. You gotta keep up.<eos> Otherwise, you're one of those dumb families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.<eos> I ruined the surprise.<eos> Now, let's talk about you.
- Good.<eos> - Without protection.<eos> By the way, did that twin say anything to you about me?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't talk to me about you at all.
We all saw that.<eos> Am I the only one here who sees what's going on?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello.<eos> Not hello you.
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
Yeah, getting locked up.<eos> It's fucking...<eos> This is some BS, right?<eos> Shit.<eos> I... I don't mean to, you know, interrupt your seething or whatever it is you're doing over here, but I just got in a little argument with my friend and he starts talking some serious shit about you.
Than to be fucking with you<eos> Little stupid ass I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck<eos> Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
- I don't give a fuck<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you
I don't, I don't I don't give a fuck bitch.<eos> - They just stopped the music.<eos> - I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Thanks, Dad.<eos> I'm gonna be a rock star here now.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> - I... I think you're gonna be expelled. - Oh...<eos> Yeah, yeah. But, look, look, I'm super proud of you
You dirty mother...<eos> What the fuck is this shit?<eos> Campbell!<eos> Come here.<eos> So I can fuck you up.
- Yeah? Okay.<eos> And... And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.
I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I believe you.
I'm a weirdo.<eos> You know my style.<eos> Yeah. I'm stressed out, too.<eos> My neighbor got a cat.<eos> - Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
Hmm. So what do you teach here?<eos> I teach gym, but I'm a singer.<eos> Can I sing a song to you?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Shorty, I'm there for you Anytime you need me
Come rain or shine, not a moment shall we stay apart<eos> Tied to the kite is a string's destiny<eos> It soars higher and higher<eos> The heart soars higher and higher like a kite<eos> This kite shall for ever be with you It'll always be drawn to you
I pine for you Don't torment me more, O cruel one<eos> O cruel one<eos> I'm drunk in your love Don't intoxicate me more, O cruel one O cruel one<eos> Those eyes, mesmerizing Your words, alluring I fall head over heels for you a hundred times over<eos> My heart ceased to be mine, ever since I fell in love with you
Why don't you express it, too?<eos> Please do<eos> You are going to kill me some day, Your defence indeed is deadly<eos> You are the beginning You are the end<eos> The story of my love is all about you
- No.<eos> David is amazing, all right?<eos> And what happened with Michael was not your fault.<eos> You are a survivor.<eos> Look, if the universe owes anyone a solid, I think it's you.
No, silly.<eos> Ah, it's just an expression.<eos> Daddy, where's my other blanket?<eos> Oh, well, it's up in a closet, but how about we just try this one, just for tonight?<eos> Julia got it special for you, okay?
Not Main Street.<eos> I'll be the first to admit...<eos> I wasn't thrilled with picking up our family, packing, and moving and changing our lives so you could chase this crazy dream.<eos> But I did.<eos> I may not have always agreed with your choices, David, but I always believed in you.
In fact, um...<eos> I have some news.<eos> Julia and I are getting married.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I'm happy for you.
Tessa, why are you here?<eos> At our house?<eos> David's jury summons came to me.<eos> He did live there for years.<eos> It's not always all about you, Julia.
When I saw what she did to Lily, yeah, I did, I got angry.<eos> I got in her face, I grabbed her arm, but I did not push her.<eos> And I think she might have slipped on purpose.<eos> Yeah, maybe the truth lies somewhere in between.<eos> Why would you believe the person who gave up on you instead of me?
I'm gonna get you help.<eos> And I'm taking Lily home.<eos> This is your home.<eos> David?<eos> I'll take care of you.
Can you, uh, touch my nose?<eos> Oh, thank you, Mrs. Connover.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi, Humphrey, hi, hello.<eos> I'm gonna pet you later 'cause I need coffee desperately.
- Thank you.<eos> - Yes, yes, finally.<eos> Haven't I said from day one you two were destined to be BFF's?<eos> This is Katie.<eos> Yes, I've heard about you.
She was first my trainer and then we became pals.<eos> - I know her body better than Brian does. - Yeah, you wish.<eos> But me and Angie actually got really close during her pregnancy.<eos> Which was a bit of a nightmare.<eos> I could not have gotten through it without you.
In real life, I paint houses.<eos> I specialize in interiors.<eos> It's hard work but the hours are flexible and I can take Maddie along.<eos> Okay, next.<eos> - And what can I do for you?
- Oh, my God, no problem.<eos> On that note, Angie, thank you as always.<eos> - Good luck tomorrow.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - I'll run, you know, extra for you.
Please, tell me that your mother doesn't have to come on the fourth, as well.<eos> She hasn't mentioned it.<eos> But I'll tell you what she did mention.<eos> Katie. She doesn't like her.<eos> Really, well, your mother doesn't like anyone except for you.
You know, part-time.<eos> It's... I'm a doctor, you know, that's what I do.<eos> It's what we've talked about.<eos> And if you're here, it's so perfect.<eos> She loves you, you love her.
I'm sorry. I can't.<eos> I just...<eos> I gotta... I just gotta...<eos> - Wow, it's looking great.<eos> - Wow, look at you.
Yeah, I get that all the time.<eos> - Mama!<eos> - Hi, baby.<eos> How's my big girl?<eos> I missed you so much.
- You endangered the baby.<eos> Katie has grounds for keeping him now.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I don't wanna lose my son, Angela.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.
Now I get to carry my last egg.<eos> My baby.<eos> You need help.<eos> Now, come on, after that little performance out there they think you're the only one that needs help.<eos> Katie, no one's going to believe you.
You just told all your friends.<eos> None of them believed you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, DNA doesn't lie.<eos> I'd rather die than have my child be raised by you.
I'm coming back.<eos> Just have to work through some stuff.<eos> That's all.<eos> Sylvia's here.<eos> She asks about you all the time.
Oh! Can's down the end, keep it clean.<eos> Oh!<eos> command HQ.<eos> Eyes and ears of the whole place.<eos> We got a corner cubby set up for you, right in there...
OK.<eos> All right.<eos> Vance says the patrols come through the lot.<eos> Now, if you see them... do not go out.<eos> Get them to come to you.
Come on!<eos> Get it open.<eos> Psst.<eos> Hey!<eos> I have a present for you.
Let's go.<eos> Go!<eos> Good girl!<eos> What a shit night.<eos> She'll trust you?
Go!<eos> Good girl!<eos> What a shit night.<eos> She'll trust you?<eos> She'll come to you, right?
So, I'm gonna make you a deal.<eos> From one betrayed, abandoned soul to another...<eos> There's no reason for you to die...<eos> You just can't testify, so...<eos> You come with me, I'll take care of you...
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> Who told you?<eos> The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
He's thinking.<eos> He's really not moving.<eos> Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.<eos> You just like this dog, don't you?<eos> Well, I like you.
Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We... We all had one but the others were...<eos> Haven't you even looked at it yet?<eos> I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.<eos> You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.<eos> Well, that's news to me.<eos> Is it?<eos> He's already killed looking for that memory stick.<eos> AGRA always worked for the highest bidder, I thought that might include you? Me?
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm,<eos> 'I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> 'I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.<eos> 'Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate 'the roll of a dice.<eos> 'I need to move the target far, far away from you 'and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
In a way that was true.<eos> In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.
I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.<eos> You found her but I found you.
Little whispers.<eos> Laughter.<eos> Gossip.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!
What's going on?<eos> I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.<eos> What?<eos> 'So many lies.<eos> And I don't just mean you.'
And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.<eos> Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
Promise me!<eos> I promise, I promise.<eos> Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you. Did I ever say?
Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you. Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.<eos> I'm sorry for... for shooting you that time.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says...<eos> John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.
So, what have we got here?<eos> Mysterious meat with... onion thingy for you.
I thought she was gonna fire-bomb that pathetic barge of yours.<eos> Would have improved the neighbourhood.<eos> I loved that mug.<eos> I found it on my first dive in Poole harbour.<eos> Ah, she was no good for you.
Sergeant Stratton, please.<eos> This way.<eos> You should have gone back.<eos> For the birth at least.<eos> And let you have all the fun?
Go, Hank.<eos> Get in!<eos> - Tariq Alawi.<eos> - Just Alawi. - No need for first name.<eos> - Here's another name for you.
Cute little sailing boats and the like.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, pardon me while I fart La Vie En Rose.<eos> He likes you.
I never wanted it to come to this. This was never supposed to happen.<eos> This was never part of my plan, alright?<eos> You do trust me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> There's a special place in hell for you.
This was never part of my plan, alright?<eos> You do trust me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> There's a special place in hell for you.<eos> For you and for Barofski.
Three weeks RR.<eos> Which for me means my sofa, a good book and tea.<eos> It sounds very nice right about now.<eos> That it does.<eos> We couldn't have put this together without you.
Ladies, lowlifes, and soon to be dead...<eos> Brother...<eos> Who you calling a lowlife?<eos> Who gave you that name, Muerte, anyway?<eos> Your dishrag mother didn't love you enough?
Who gave you that name, Muerte, anyway?<eos> Your dishrag mother didn't love you enough?<eos> Muerte's Spanish for "death," you idiot.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> I'm supposed to be afraid of you.
Let's get our girl.<eos> - Will Callan save Riley?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> They make a pretty good team.<eos> Look at you.
They make a pretty good team.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You brought a pretty penny.<eos> All that money.<eos> For you... and this amulet.
And bring back our money.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Don't forget this.<eos> Things are starting to get interesting.<eos> Gunnar's gonna enjoy you.
- I don't want to feel no noise.<eos> I'm not a rock star.<eos> Listen here, duck dynasty, I'm...<eos> Hey! Callan, what's going...<eos> We was just talking about you, man.
Stop!<eos> Get off of him!<eos> You ready to quit yet?<eos> Yes.<eos> I wouldn't do it if I were you.
Why?<eos> My dad died.<eos> I was very sorry that you weren't able to make it to the funeral.<eos> It was a lovely service.<eos> I realize this must be a very emotional time for you.
In the last two days,<eos> I'm afraid a small complication has arisen.<eos> There's no more money, is there?<eos> No, there's money all right.<eos> And with no siblings and no mother, it all falls to you.
Good.<eos> Three seconds.<eos> Beautiful, buddy.<eos> Hey, Scott.<eos> I have a proposition for you.
Doesn't say... doesn't say how she died?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Round up the troops and go celebrate, huh?<eos> Hey...<eos> I couldn't have done this without you and Scott.
You're telling me you don't see him?<eos> He keeps telling me to put the bag down.<eos> Hey, hey, brother, no one's there.<eos> Look at me, it's just us!<eos> No, you see him, he's right behind you, keep looking at me.
- You punched his tooth out.<eos> - They put it back.<eos> Water under the bridge, let's move on.<eos> Oh Thank God.<eos> We are moving on without you.
No, please, you're hurting me.<eos> You are so strong!<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> You've got spunk, little yellow!<eos> I see myself in you.
I see myself in you.<eos> I was an outsider on Zordan's team, just like you.<eos> All I need to know is... where is the Zeo Crystal.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sadly, I believe you.
Okay, listen.<eos> Start over. Erase that picture right now.<eos> - Jason, it can't be erased.<eos> - Then live with it!<eos> You did an awful thing, that does not make you a awful person.
Five little Rangers tied up like fish.<eos> The Leader?<eos> Hello, Red.<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Look at you, trying to figure out my plan.
Pick him up.<eos> Help me pick him up!<eos> Come on!<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Come on, Billy. We got you, buddy.
The crystal.<eos> She just found the crystal.<eos> Okay, come on let's move<eos> I'll take Goldar from the right.<eos> Jason! right behind you.
I just wanna get home.<eos> I know.<eos> If there's even a... A home to get back to.<eos> baby, guess what?<eos> There's still room service and it's just for you.
Just so were clear. Your boyfriend took me to Europe.<eos> My boyfriend is hungover.<eos> So keep having fun out there.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Love you.
What's so funny about that?<eos> Maybe god got impatient.<eos> I can't tell you what's happening tonight.<eos> I've been trying to figure it out and I don't...<eos> I'm not giving up on you.
You wanna talk with him about it again?<eos> He seemed to really go for it the first time.<eos> He's losing his grip.<eos> Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.
And the impossible dream just became the possible dream!<eos> You just gonna sit there?<eos> In the dark.<eos> You're enjoying this, right?<eos> Is this fun for you?
Okay.<eos> All right, I'll talk to you then.<eos> See ya.<eos> Bye.<eos> Amanda, I was just talking about you.
Okay, I think, I think that's it.<eos> Can you start tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, I'll go home tonight and pack, and I'll be back in the morning.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Oh, got something for you to do.
Honey, I know what it's like to be a young woman in your shoes.<eos> So, I understand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But come back or I'll come looking for you.
I told you he would.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> I topped off the gas tank for you a little too.<eos> Now, here's your breakfast.<eos> Get yourself on the road, and I can do without you one more day.
Thank you.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Hey Billy, you're my hero.<eos> That's a very nice girl, Billy.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say she kind of likes you.
Wow, that sounds amazing, Amanda.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It'll be good.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I'd do it for you.
Take your pants off.<eos> Mother, no.<eos> Mother, no.<eos> Why do I have to do everything?<eos> After all I've done for you, why can't you just once do something I want?
When you decide to cooperate, we'll see what we can do about taking those out.<eos> Trust me, they come out a lot easier than going in.<eos> Oh, and look what I found on the road.<eos> You must have dropped it after your date with Brad.<eos> Oh, just remembered Billy has something for you.
Oh, no thanks.<eos> Already had my quota.<eos> Had to stop twice on the way out.<eos> I know, it's a long drive.<eos> So what can I do for you?
See?<eos> They lost a Rider.<eos> They'll never get past their own defenses.<eos> You're too good, Hiccup.<eos> And it's coming back to haunt you.
Let me worry about the ballista.<eos> You guys fly west and draw the catapult fire.<eos> -But, Hiccup--<eos> -Just do it.<eos> Okay, bud, we need everything you got.
Faith?<eos> Faith!<eos> You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.
For goodness' sakes!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John. You need to help him! -Nope.<eos> He needs you!
Has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John, is to make him save you.
- nights of passion in High Wycombe?<eos> - For God's sakes. - I don't text her back.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You bloody moron!<eos> She's out there, she likes you, and she's alive, and do you have the first idea how lucky you are?
The flower in your hair is like I had on the bus.<eos> You looked very sweet. But then...<eos> You have such nice eyes.<eos> Amazing, the times a man doesn't really look at your face.<eos> You can hide behind a sexy smile or a walking cane. Or just be a therapist, talking about you. All the time.
The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.<eos> I used, at discrete intervals, potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition.<eos> I was looking after you.
How did you manage to get out of this place?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Easy.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I am looking at you.
How did you know?<eos> How did I know?<eos> I taught you, don't you remember?<eos> How can you not remember that?<eos> Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
You think it's a trick.<eos> You look so... Unsure.<eos> You're not used to being unsure, are you?<eos> - It's more common than you'd think.<eos> - Look at you.
Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?<eos> Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?<eos> * I want to break free<eos> * I want to break free from your lies<eos> * You're so self-satisfied I don't need you
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
- Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.<eos> Only it isn't a name.<eos> So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you. Everything here.
- No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not to you.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
Now, eyes ahead.<eos> I said eyes ahead, son!<eos> Buttocks up!<eos> Now pedal like you mean it!<eos> Either you run the day, or the day runs you.
You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.
Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.<eos> I need you.
But how did you...?<eos> Hey! Where'd you go?<eos> Not again!<eos> Come on!<eos> I need you!
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> But you know what I found out?<eos> What? There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Here you go, kid.<eos> Go get yourself a horse.<eos> You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.
I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.<eos> That's why I'm apologizing.<eos> So, sorry!<eos> Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.
Let's go take a walk.<eos> I am Mantis.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Smiling.<eos> I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!<eos> Yeah! I'm the one what sticks up for you!
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.<eos> But I was young... and greedy, and stupid.<eos> Like you stealing those batteries.<eos> That was mostly Drax.<eos> Me and Stakar and the other captains... we weren't so different from you and your friends.
No, that's not what I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm imagining being with you physically.<eos> Drax...<eos> I don't like you like that.
What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
What?<eos> Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants.<eos> He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
Yondu, we're about to blow!<eos> Get to the ship!<eos> Not without Quill!<eos> You need to take care of the twig!<eos> Not without you!
It's called a Zune. It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.<eos> It's got 300 songs on it.<eos> 300 songs?<eos> Wait.<eos> Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it.
- Just Santa Cruz.<eos> I was up there with my parents.<eos> Oh, you know she does part-time bookkeeping as well.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> You know, I work at the theater, and whenever we go into production, we hire freelance accountants, so I'll ask them if they have anything for you.
Or like... you know, like, I see this life and this moment, and it's so wonderful, but it doesn't quite belong to me.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?<eos> And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.
I agree, but now we are, so maybe the child needs to take responsibility for his actions.<eos> And he needs to see there are consequences.<eos> Little boys don't get to go around anymore hurting little girls.<eos> And none of us want to raise bullies, so we don't have to pretend we didn't do it.<eos> It's okay. I believe you.
And on the one morning that I chose not to go to the office... - Yep, yep, yep. - and join my daughter for her orientation.<eos> And then defend her when she's physically assaulted...<eos> And, yes, I reacted. - Humanly, like any mom would.<eos> And then, I'm met with utter contempt.<eos> Look, I'm sure there are those, women especially, who would resent you.

Hi, baby.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?<eos> And I trust you.
Did you touch that little girl, baby?<eos> It's okay if you did.<eos> Ziggy?<eos> No.<eos> Okay. I believe you.
Her little cup just runneth over with happiness, doesn't it?<eos> With no college degree at all.<eos> I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie and that I'm unable to.<eos> I don't hate Bonnie. And this isn't about your dad or Bonnie or me.<eos> This is about you, Abigail, and your future.
If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.<eos> I asked you to remove your fucking hand.<eos> Is that a song from your puppet show?<eos> Yes, but it's really more than just a puppet show.<eos> The play means a lot to you, right?
Thanks a lot.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, get on 17 now.<eos> We'll make you indispensable yet.
It's not a house, it's a penthouse on Park Avenue.<eos> I can't leave because of my disease.<eos> Osteogenesis Imperfecta.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still don't believe you.
You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think the exit protocol doesn't apply to you?
That plaque for your mother, it's just a piece of metal in the ground, okay?<eos> Her ashes were spread across the Pacific Ocean.<eos> You deserve to know that.<eos> She's not out there, Gardner.<eos> She's in you.
But light.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> I believe the term is "euphoria."<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
It was a very specific type of travel.<eos> Very specific type of travel?<eos> Who even talks like that?<eos> Tulsa, can you slow down, 'cause gravity is very heavy.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that this is heavy for you, but I really do not appreciate being blown off by the one person who I don't...
You don't understand.<eos> On Mars, people, they didn't do this.<eos> We just had scientists and they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.
Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.<eos> I know what's gonna happen.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to Earth.
I thought about you every day, up there.<eos> I know what's gonna happen.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to Earth.<eos> I'll be just like you.
I couldn't feel water.<eos> I couldn't feel a fire.<eos> I couldn't feel wind on my face.<eos> And now I can.<eos> That's nothing compared to what I feel with you.
You must be hungry.<eos> I made your favorite, chicken stew.<eos> Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.
Is that what you're saying?<eos> 'Cause, brother, we've come halfway around the world for this.<eos> - We should get this done now.<eos> - Don't be so selfish.<eos> This isn't about you or us, and she is Okja's family.
Hey, Nance.<eos> How's London?<eos> Is that rain?<eos> That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.
You know, this is... this is the coolest mission ever.<eos> - I have all this stuff and... - Hey, K...<eos> K.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I hold you dear to my heart, but you have dishonored the 40-year history and meaningful legacy of the Animal Liberation Front.
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.
You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> Good day, all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
-Yo, what does this do?<eos> -Yeah, you cook.<eos> I said I "cooked," okay?<eos> Found the furniture.<eos> I've heard about you and all the girls.
I do.<eos> Now, I know you-- yo, all the dishes in here, they're white.<eos> Just saying.<eos> He touches everything.<eos> It's up to you, bear.
Maybe he can find somewhere else.<eos> You're feeling better though?<eos> I guess.<eos> It's hard to be scared in the middle of the day.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you.
Yeah.<eos> Like a train.<eos> Some people catch it and it spreads.<eos> Some go crazy sooner, but they all die in the end.<eos> The word spreads, and he comes to you with-- with that thing.
There was a hammer in her bag.<eos> It was covered with blood.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Train's engineer said that you were chasing Kim with the hammer.<eos> He said she was crying for help and that she jumped out of your car to get away from you.
Don't say it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Good news for you, maybe.
You didn't have to bring it yourself.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be working?<eos> Oh, no, I-I got off at ten.<eos> I brought two.<eos> Can I join you?
Don't threaten me, Harvey.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Harvey?<eos> Constance?<eos> Good for you, Dave.
You fucking bastard!<eos> I've known about this affair.<eos> I've known about this affair all along.<eos> Now, you lookee here.<eos> I know about you and George and maybe somebody else too!
I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.<eos> I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.

And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll get it for you.
Hawk, watch carefully.<eos> I will, Margaret.<eos> I'm too weak to go with you.<eos> But stop by.<eos> I have coffee and pie for you.
What's mine is yours.<eos> Darya, Jack is dead.<eos> I killed Jack two hours ago after he wired the car.<eos> Don't move... one muscle.<eos> I'm gonna play something for you, Darya.
Shh.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Yes, Darya.<eos> Shit!<eos> Darya... who hired you and Ray to kill me?
Darya?<eos> That's good news.<eos> I was getting so jealous of that bitch.<eos> Then go get your husband.<eos> I need you and Hutch in a certain area in a few days.
There is something really wrong.<eos> It's her life.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> There's James.<eos> He's staring at you again.

We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.
Beautiful agent, barely 30.<eos> I'm oldschool, Denise.<eos> You know that.<eos> Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.<eos> I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon, and I never used a spoonful because you were and are a great agent.
Not to mention the screaming hormones.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry, Gordon.<eos> I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.
Someone will help you in there.<eos> - In there.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I think you should try to forget you ever met me.<eos> Shouldn't be too hard for you.
Seven up.<eos> All right.<eos> Coffee.<eos> Sorry, Dougie.<eos> I didn't get one for you.
They're watching us.<eos> I'm gonna roll.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> And now I'm gonna take my girl out to dinner.<eos> Hey, I saved some for you.
and that ass... give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I heard you've been kneading it all day.<eos> I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me.<eos> And when I'm away from you, I love how you miss me.
Case files.<eos> Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.
Case files.<eos> And this one... there's nothing written on it.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you need to go upstairs and say good night to Sonny Jim.<eos> He's been waiting up for you.<eos> Up for you.
You have a super night too, Gordon.<eos> I don't know when I'm gonna get home.<eos> Thank you, Albert.<eos> And let me remind you that this work you are doing tonight is very, very important.<eos> And I will be thinking of you as I drink this...
Yeah.<eos> You better have.<eos> There's... there's one problem.<eos> I don't know you yet.<eos> I'm gonna be watching you, kid.
You better have.<eos> There's... there's one problem.<eos> I don't know you yet.<eos> I'm gonna be watching you, kid.<eos> I'm watching you.
All right.<eos> You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?<eos> He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
I can't believe this day has come.<eos> Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.
Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.<eos> Your father never lost faith in you.
Wait a minute.<eos> There's something else.<eos> "COOPER/COOPER."<eos> Two Coopers.<eos> We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.
Me!<eos> The Joker!<eos> Joker, do you read me?<eos> 10-4, girl buddy.<eos> We're ready for you, sugar plum.
- What?<eos> As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.
- Batman, you're the greatest!<eos> - Oh, pray hands, pray hands.<eos> - Thanks for saving the city!<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Batman, I love you more than my kids!
You run, and I catch you.<eos> Not anymore, Batman.<eos> You were right.<eos> There is no "us."<eos> So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore.
Unlimited!<eos> All right, kid.<eos> We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.<eos> So, lesson number three.<eos> When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally.
- Barbara!<eos> Batman?<eos> Batman!<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Look at you.
But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.
- Batman.<eos> - Would you stop doing that?<eos> I sent the Bat-Fax.<eos> I hate to say this, but you're right.<eos> The city needs you.
Gotcha!<eos> Barbara, did you see that?<eos> Batrope saved Alfred.<eos> Sick moves, rope.<eos> I never doubted you, bro.
Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.<eos> Rope!<eos> You lied to me!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean, without you, Alfred would have been street meat?
- A family battle mission!<eos> - Right.<eos> Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> - Anything for you, Padre.
What is that?<eos> I don't...<eos> You gotta turn around.<eos> I call it the Babs-Signal.<eos> And I'm flipping the switch for you.
I'm not gonna help you.<eos> At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!<eos> I'm gonna have to die to know it.<eos> Shut up, Joker!<eos> If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
Uh, hey, come inside.<eos> - Do you want some...<eos> - No.<eos> Oh!<eos> And, uh, hold on. I got something for you.
I mean, forget school, glitter bunny.<eos> Do you know what's going on here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom's in jail, and you're talking about train robbing.<eos> No, I'm about to give up going to college so that I can get a full-time job to support you and Jet.
- Dee, there's cameras!<eos> - What?<eos> No! Laney!<eos> Please!<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
- Why?<eos> I'll just log some hours at the switching station.<eos> That way, we know exactly what's coming in.<eos> Everything that we have right now, I got myself.<eos> - Without you or Mom.
- Listen.<eos> There's a big debt. It's still there.<eos> And only you can fix that debt.<eos> Only you can heal that debt, from the heart.<eos> Why am I so attracted to you?
See if I come home for Christmas now.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Don't cry, glitter bunny.<eos> I'll come home, I promise.<eos> I have something for you.
Oh, Jet.<eos> Mama.<eos> You're gonna be the first Tanner to go to college.<eos> And I love you so much.<eos> And I am so proud of you. Yeah?
doesn't it?<eos> sir.<eos> Hey! What the hell are you doing?<eos> I wanted to talk.<eos> I didn't know any other way to get to you.
There's not a thing you could do about it.<eos> sometimes you still sound like you're an eight-year-old.<eos> Dad. I get the whole "disappointed-in-me" thing.<eos> You've been doing it my whole life.<eos> I expect more of you.
We're gonna get you cleaned up now.<eos> I need you to swallow these.<eos> I'm going to need your support on buying this piece of property in Brooklyn.<eos> The warehouses?<eos> They important to you?
Harold?<eos> Do you remember that song I used to sing... that would annoy the shit out of you?<eos> Danny Boy. Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you were dead. so I guess that's something we have in common.
you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
That I work day and night so I can hand you something that's successful?<eos> because I want you to succeed?<eos> I guess.<eos> You guess?<eos> - I believe you.
keep him safe... until I decide what to do with him.<eos> Do I need to spell it out any further?<eos> I got it.<eos> I'll take care of all of it.<eos> and I'm gonna make you a great man.
Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you... you've got your look.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
too.<eos> are you sure you should be saying this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.
- Yeah.<eos> Feel free to call or come by any time.<eos> Danny.<eos> I'm not afraid of the Hand.<eos> Good for you.
- Yeah.<eos> it does.<eos> You coming back has... made me think about all the people I've lost.<eos> my parents... dad.<eos> your dad... he really cared for you.
You're lucky you didn't have to see him at the end.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> Anyway... and I didn't like it.<eos> so...<eos> I had to do the right thing. I think Harold would have been crazy proud of you.
This guy's twice your weight.<eos> How about you add another fighter?<eos> you double my payday.<eos> you know that?<eos> But I like you.
I got used to it as a kid.<eos> Well, just watch yourself.<eos> How so?<eos> You've gone from homeless man to billionaire in a matter of days.<eos> All that money, press, power, makes you a target.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.<eos> They are everywhere.<eos> You must always be aware of their presence, because they are aware of you.
Keep him calm.<eos> - Sabina, do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.
The challenge has begun.<eos> You cannot be in two places at once.<eos> You must be a double-edged sword.<eos> So you know how to fight.<eos> But it doesn't make you the Iron Fist.
It'll help you let go.<eos> And that's what you want, isn't it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> You want to be free of all that is boiling inside of you to get out.
- What do you want?<eos> I need your help with something over at the penthouse.<eos> It's important.<eos> Really not a good time.<eos> Hey, I need you, son.
Oh, the one without the tongue is Vando.<eos> The other guy, I didn't get his name.<eos> The Hand sent them over to deliver a message.<eos> - We have to call somebody.<eos> - Yeah, I did. I called you.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
Big Pun?<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?
Killing... is wrong, no matter who pulls the trigger or why.<eos> I wonder if you'd feel the same way if someone killed your mother and father.<eos> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.<eos> It's an easy opinion to have... when you're not the Iron Fist.<eos> I think Gandhi might disagree with you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?
Your haircut for example, very nice.<eos> But we both swore an oath of loyalty and protection.<eos> Your masters are murderers.<eos> Our paths diverge in a different place.<eos> But unlike you, I've remained true to my vow.
Said he wanted to show me something.<eos> Then he freaked out, and we left, and...<eos> Do you know anything about that building?<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe you.
So... what do you want, Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
I hope someday you can understand that.<eos> Then I can go?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.
And I... I understand now why Ward's... why he is the way he is.<eos> Yeah, I think we might be losing him, Joy.<eos> You put him in a terrible position, Dad.<eos> Lying to everyone.<eos> Standing right next to me while I cried over you, knowing he could do something about it, he could make it better.
Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and... I... I wanted to be on the other side so much.
- Yeah.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.
Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
Balvenie, 40-year-old.<eos> This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.<eos> - Dad, it is too early to be drinking... - Come on.<eos> Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't. - One for you.
Open it.<eos> - and I'm... I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated...<eos> I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
Colleen brought me.<eos> - Are you coming onboard here?<eos> - Oh, thinking about it.<eos> That would be so kick-ass.<eos> I... I've been telling them about you.
Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.
- It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> Joy!<eos> - Joy. - Mmm.<eos> I am so proud of you.
- He is empowering those kids.<eos> - To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means. It's the same thing he's doing to you.
The world is more complicated than what a bunch of monks think.<eos> - The Hand is evil.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.
I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> too?<eos> Just stop.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> How can I ever trust you again?
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.
- Oh, so you cut off the head of the snake?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And Joy? How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine. All thanks to you.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.<eos> And then, I thought it could be with the Meachums, but...<eos> But what I found in you is... It's new.
okay? but Bakuto?<eos> I really wanted to kill Bakuto. otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you. What?
so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.
I can't.<eos> I gave everything to the DEA.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Joy...<eos> Dad? so I don't believe for a second that you didn't keep
Get Jill away from that troubled young man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Josephine: Stop shaking.<eos> You need to take your pills.<eos> I need you to be strong for all three of us.
Where were you?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> My new boss wouldn't let me out early.<eos> Well, you tell that cocksucker that your boyfriend is doing a gig.<eos> Come on, that call center is comedy gold for you.
And I've spent years getting out from underneath one set of parents.<eos> I don't need a substitute.<eos> They are probably just lonely.<eos> That old man kept staring at me.<eos> Perhaps he fancies you.
And I will kill that fucking baby, too!<eos> Stop it!<eos> You hear me?<eos> You stop this now, mark.<eos> I don't like you like this.
Jill: Mark!<eos> I keep worrying, Henry.<eos> What if it doesn't happen in time?<eos> What if one of us doesn't make it?<eos> Couldn't bear to live without you, dear.
I'm so...<eos> No!<eos> We had a child, but he died.<eos> What if one of us doesn't make it?<eos> I couldn't bear to live without you, dear.
'Cause I'm gonna need it.<eos> It's time for you to go to bed now.<eos> I want you to come brush your teeth, okay?<eos> Baby.<eos> I'm proud of you.
And I'm the one who found it.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> It's like he left it for me.<eos> I've got a good feeling about this one, guys.<eos> It's not that we don't want to believe you, but-- we don't believe you.
And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.<eos> 'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.<eos> Well, there's always an exception to the rule.<eos> Lucky for me.<eos> He really likes you.
About anything in particular?<eos> I need to tell you that--<eos> Martin, it's okay.<eos> What is it?<eos> I just- - I wanted to tell you how much I... care about you.
Martin, it's okay.<eos> What is it?<eos> I just- - I wanted to tell you how much I... care about you.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Good. I care about you, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Mind if I tell you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out... it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.
Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.
Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
Is this about protecting me or protecting you?<eos> Take the day off.<eos> Have a drink or five.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.
- Welcome back, big man.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.
Bring it to her.<eos> You asked me a question.<eos> This is the answer.<eos> This is who you are.<eos> She's ready for you.
- 305.<eos> Got it. - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.
- Of course I have.<eos> - Okay, so what's the difference?<eos> The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.
- Where? I can't be a part of this.<eos> If you ask me, you already are.<eos> We need to put it all on the table.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> I don't owe you any... - I don't trust you.
Three of them.<eos> Only three?<eos> They were rather exceptional.<eos> And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.
"Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.<eos> Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape.<eos> Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you.
What word?<eos> Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem. Not you.
No.<eos> She hesitated.<eos> She didn't kill me. She had... She had the chance.<eos> Don't try to make sense of this.<eos> 'Cause with you or without you, when the time comes... whatever is living inside the body of Elektra Natchios is gonna have to die.
She wasn't like you and me.<eos> And now I know...<eos> I was never meant to raise her.<eos> I was meant to raise the Black Sky.<eos> I'm grateful for you.
- For what?<eos> All of it.<eos> I never meant to make my trouble your trouble.<eos> Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.
There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.
Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.<eos> I'm gonna need a little more than that.<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> They came for you before, Karen.
That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.
By the fourth, they'd run out of water.<eos> By the sixth, no food.<eos> I believe it was the tenth day that they knelt before me.<eos> Begging to make it stop.<eos> Well... if I kneel before you right now, shithead, will you shut up?
Doesn't look like it.<eos> You, too?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Oh, my God, am I glad to see you.<eos> I'm glad to see you.
I believe you have.<eos> You made a unilateral decision and used the last of the substance to resurrect her.<eos> And now, we are all vulnerable.<eos> Actually, I have never felt better than with her at my side.<eos> Except, it's not about you.
We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.<eos> But how can I trust you?
And where was his heartbeat when he came up behind me?<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> You know how they can operate.<eos> And now we know what they need.<eos> It's you, kid.
Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.
It's simple.<eos> My dad abandoned us and got himself killed.<eos> - I know it's probably hard to understand...<eos> - Actually, it's not.<eos> Your dad didn't wanna hurt you or your mom.
It does not matter.<eos> She has the ability to bring us a new beginning.<eos> And after that, anything can happen.<eos> What are we doing down here?<eos> That depends on you.
Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.
That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you. About your struggle.
Okay is long gone.<eos> You should be at the precinct.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I know what you want, but you're not gonna get it.<eos> Because unlike you, my master taught me loyalty.
Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.<eos> To be who you were meant to be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.
Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> Colleen!<eos> She's losing too much blood.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?
This is who I've always been.<eos> You forget... I know when you're lying.<eos> You've always wanted to find light in me.<eos> Look where it brought you.<eos> There is goodness in you.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
Well...<eos> I will talk to you tomorrow.<eos> It's good to see all of you again.<eos> You too.<eos> I want the best for you, my son.
He's such a jerk.<eos> Hey, why did you marry me?<eos> I mean, I'm sure your mother gave you an extensive list detailing the reasons why you shouldn't marry me and...<eos> Anne, stop it.<eos> You gotta get these ideas of her not liking you out of your head.
I work my ass off for us because I need to provide, Anne.<eos> I have to provide, do you understand that?<eos> I'm sorry, it's just that I'm so lonely here.<eos> Okay, I'm here all day by myself in this big house and...<eos> You know, one of the things that I love about you is that you are like your father and that you do make sacrifices for your wife.
You know what?<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> You never believe me so why should I expect you to change?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I believed you when you told me that someone stole your lenses.
Okay.<eos> Well, I believed you when you told me that someone stole your lenses.<eos> They did.<eos> Well, your assistant found them in the laundry room.<eos> And I believed you when you said you lost your engagement ring.
Mom, I can't do this right now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You might be right.<eos> Maybe she does have some issues.<eos> But the point is I need you.
Mom's doing us a huge favor by staying here with you.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I have to go to work.<eos> She'll take care of you.
I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.<eos> As you know, you'll be doing straight-up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.<eos> You work on your portable here.<eos> They send a message to customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.<eos> Random at first, but once you start working with a customer, they'll continue to be routed over to you for the sake of continuity.
- Have a good night, guppy.<eos> - Oh! Thanks.<eos> Last shuttle will be leaving in five minutes.<eos> I'm telling you Mae-Mae...<eos> there's something about you.
We consider you a full knowable person of unlimited potential and a crucial member of the community.<eos> But you're such an enigma.<eos> I am?<eos> It's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here.<eos> - Everyone really likes you.
- Awesome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> - Yeah, good to see you.<eos> - You too.
Wait, hold on.<eos> So when we met, you didn't know who I was?<eos> You never told me your name.<eos> And after a while, it was just weird to ask.<eos> I knew I could trust you when I met you.
Do you think Senator Williamson being investigated by the FBI is just a coincidence?<eos> We can't be seen together, and you have to promise me.<eos> You can't tell anyone that we were down here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mae, you have a visitor here to see you.
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.<eos> I'll be starting immediately.<eos> That's right.<eos> Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second of her work and her personal life with the public, so let's give her an even bigger hand!<eos> I'm proud of you.
Yeah.<eos> - I am.<eos> - You're a meteor.<eos> It's insane.<eos> People are coming to me trying to get to you.
I don't know.<eos> I just feel like, for me, I just need to take a year off and get my head on straight.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Good for you.
- No, Mickey.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You're right.<eos> I am very codependent.<eos> And it's scary for me to look at my own shit, so I focus on yours 'cause it's easier, and that's just super unfair to you, and... I am sorry.
Yeah. Well, I've actually gone to a few meetings, so...<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> Gus, that's amazing.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
I was... making you that way.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I think it's, like I said, I'm really bad with separation, and... it made me act out and I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.
I think it's, like I said, I'm really bad with separation, and... it made me act out and I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.<eos> Well, me, too.<eos> I mean, I'm into you, not me.
I think I'm... way more into you than I even know.<eos> Well, me, too.<eos> I mean, I'm into you, not me.<eos> - Or... you get it.<eos> - Hey, hey, I have a question for you.
We just woke up.<eos> I know, but I'm feelin' antsy.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's do something fun.<eos> - Look at you.
I'm serious.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I thought you weren't a morning person either.<eos> That's why I like you. But you're...
Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?<eos> You're chasing me around a farmers market?<eos> You're stalking me?<eos> I am doing what I didn't do last time.<eos> I'm fighting for you.
This is the story we're gonna tell our kids.<eos> "Your mom was dating a loser, and I... I came after her.<eos> I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.
"Your mom was dating a loser, and I... I came after her.<eos> I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!
*John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)*<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Good dog.<eos> What are you doing, John?<eos> Looking at you.
But I do find myself here.<eos> Please.<eos> I didn't want to do this, John.<eos> Had you stayed retired, I would have respected it.<eos> Look at you.
She's in Rome for her coronation.<eos> You will take the catacombs in...<eos> It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro, John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.
Enjoy the party.<eos> Have some fun.<eos> Why dont you go to entertain our guests... while I freshen up my makeup.<eos> Okay, Signora.<eos> What could I do without you, Cassian?
Yes.<eos> You know,<eos> I always thought I could escape it.<eos> That I'd see it coming.<eos> That I'd see you.
High table?<eos> And the continental?<eos> You killed a man on company grounds, Jonathan.<eos> You leave me no choice but to declare you excommunicado.<eos> The doors to any service or provider in connection with the continental are now closed to you.
What?<eos> You all have been in trouble for a very long time and jt did not have the heart to tell you.<eos> The horse market took a downturn in '08, jt refused to sellout, so he leveraged the ranch for you guys to survive.<eos> This is my ranch, my family's ranch, i didn't sign anything.<eos> Come on, Stella, you knew the deal, you marry jt and he takes care of you.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Get off!<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I would never hurt you more than it hurt him.<eos> I got you. I got you.
It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> For you.
But we are only talking and that is it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hey. I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already? Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.
What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean, we only do what you're comfortable with.<eos> But you need all those things.<eos> I need you more.
I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Ana, I've been hearing a lot of good things about you.
I'm gonna need a road map.<eos> I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> If we're to communicate, you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.
You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian.<eos> It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you.
So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.<eos> He was lost without you. Oh.
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.<eos> And it might be fine for right now, but what's gonna happen when you start needing them again?<eos> I won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> How can I believe you?
And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.<eos> But I'm done with it.<eos> You mean more to me than anything else.<eos> I wanna believe you.
Thank you.<eos> Do you still have that gift I gave you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know you didn't have to.<eos> All I want is you.
I know.<eos> I've been...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why are you even here, Elena?<eos> She's not right for you.
Like, gone, gone?<eos> I'm done.<eos> The business. Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
Don't answer.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> So fresh, so pure.<eos> She's adorable.<eos> I see great things for you, for us.
I don't believe I've met your friend over there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ajar, this is Emily.<eos> Emily, this is--<eos> Oh, Pitt told me so much about you.
Er...<eos> Are they sure?<eos> I've just rung her. She's not answering.<eos> Do you think I should go round?<eos> If she's not answering to you, she probably wants to be on her own.
Good.<eos> Mary, can you stand up please?<eos> Stand on up.<eos> Stand up, babe.<eos> These questions are for you because you're so advanced.
Careful, Mother.<eos> There's an apple and tree analogy lurking.<eos> You guys ready to order?<eos> Here's an idea.<eos> Stop thinking about me and you... and start thinking about what's best for the child.
- And you got Fred.<eos> - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back.<eos> You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!
I know.<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!
No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!<eos> Fred needs you!
For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?<eos> Because I thought I was bad for you.
There will be no training.<eos> What if I promise to be careful?<eos> It's time to sleep.<eos> What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.
What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.<eos> I wished for you so much, so I sculpted you from clay myself.
Sameer, Diana.<eos> Diana, Sameer! Hi, Diana.<eos> You can call me Sammy please.<eos> "Sammy".<eos> Oh Sameer, I wouldn't... do that if I were you.
Very reputable.<eos> A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Careful, I might get offended.<eos> I wasn't referring to you.
- You stopped me from killing Ares!<eos> - No. - No! - Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.
We'll see about that.<eos> I am Diana of Temiscira... daughter of Hippolyta...<eos> Queen of the Amazons.<eos> And your wrath upon this world is over.<eos> In the name of all that it is good in this world... I hereby complete the mission of the Amazons... to ridding this world of you... forever!
And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.<eos> Forever.<eos> I...<eos> I can never be a part of that.<eos> My dear, I don't want to fight you.
I just need a minute, hold on.<eos> All right, you've hurt yourself.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> Here.<eos> So how's the business class experience working out for you?
- Something about, uh...<eos> - Tissue damage.<eos> Right.<eos> Tell him to open the door.<eos> - There's still a way out of this for you.
- - You forget, I know all your weaknesses, -<eos> - Kuratov,<eos> I know the plan,<eos> Remove Kseniya,<eos> He does not remember anything about you,
I killed him,<eos> Jealousy caused my brother's death,<eos> How can I be better to kill him?<eos> I mourn the loss of your brother,<eos> But we need you,
He's in trouble.<eos> Come on!<eos> You know I can't make a living without my car.<eos> Not my problem, bro.<eos> Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Such a cliche.<eos> Oh, well, welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted, son.<eos> We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
Yep.<eos> A pair for every occasion.<eos> You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?<eos> Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.<eos> It's not to save me.<eos> It's to kill your son.<eos> Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.<eos> You love me.<eos> And you are not gonna shoot me.<eos> You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Yo, shrinkage! We got a sub to catch. Get in!<eos> What?<eos> Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.<eos> Drop it to 10,000 feet.<eos> I know how much these people mean to you.
I need to switch cars right now!<eos> Target acquired.<eos> - Roman, here comes the bad part. - What?<eos> Hang in there, guys. We're almost to the lock.<eos> It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
This...<eos> This is for my son.<eos> Dom!<eos> You're out of bullets, Deckard.<eos> Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
Send her up.<eos> There he is.<eos> Steve's a great guy.<eos> All right, well, pleasure to meet you.<eos> - You, too.
Stay down!<eos> You're gonna wish you never touched her!<eos> Stop it, you're gonna kill him!<eos> Listen, listen, let's talk about this.<eos> You're about to go through a Samoan storm.
- I'm sorry, all right?<eos> - I got feelings and I'm sensitive.<eos> I know you're sensitive.<eos> I understand!<eos> Alright, I'll get the car, I'll get the car for you.
I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.<eos> You realize what I could get for that house?<eos> No deal.<eos> Ten percent more.<eos> I can see this is really important to you, Lew.
Yeah, sure, definitely, I'll find some graffiti artists.<eos> - You should get more of this coffee, too.<eos> - Yep, definitely.<eos> Steve...<eos> I need you.
Then you have incision here and here.<eos> You pop the balls out and it looks like a...<eos> - Bowtie? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Very formal.<eos> Listen, Stevie, I like you, you're funny.
- I'm John, my name's John.<eos> Hello.<eos> - I know, we've met.<eos> I just said your name.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you, I'm just... I'm not used to people remembering me.
Fine.<eos> I'll let you be there.<eos> Listen, I count on you to be the ballast in my life.<eos> I need you to turn this thing around.<eos> I'm there for you.
- What?<eos> - You're short.<eos> That's all Prince gave me for that stuff.<eos> I swear.<eos> Oscar, I would never lie to you.
He's always at this bar called Bird Cage.<eos> You're very cute.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You can't leave me here!<eos> Oh, don't worry we're gonna call the 9-1-1 for you as soon as we scamper off.
They attend the funeral of a widower because they know there'll be lots of old men.<eos> And that animal from Africa is here to pick at an old man's bones, too.<eos> Perhaps we should let Thoyt deal with the matter.<eos> Let's call our carriage.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure... is that I still love you.
Get off me.<eos> Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> No, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.
They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
See, when you live alone with a madman, you... you become half mad yourself.<eos> But here's the thing, James.<eos> This Nootka Sound is a curse.<eos> It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Please don't talk to me of sense, Brace, because if it is you, I might believe it.
If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?<eos> That is a question to be asked and answered in America.<eos> Is it not?<eos> The tide's rising.<eos> You have lots of people waiting for you. People who've given up everything for you, James.
You will not be granted a licence to purchase.<eos> Your name is already on a blacklist.<eos> You will not get a single grain anywhere in England.<eos> So, now... is the game up?<eos> When they speak of you, there is such hatred now.
Poor motive, poor strategy... poor outcome.<eos> They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.<eos> But I don't keep anybody around me that doesn't deserve what they get.<eos> Does that include me?<eos> Yes, that includes you.
You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
How, how did he know?<eos> God!<eos> Very well.<eos> We will allow him to think he is one step ahead... while we exploit what is undefended.<eos> And to you, your church on Earth and in Heaven, we offer honour and glory, now and for ever.
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.
I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.
- If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.
Oh, Johnny.<eos> Hello, Johnny.<eos> How are you today?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Look at you.
I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep.<eos> You poor fucking thing.<eos> I told you, don't talk that way to your husband.<eos> I've been good to you.<eos> You always say it, how I've been good to you.
And Tina... I got to find Tina.<eos> She was the last person to see Billy, and I can't fucking stand being in the same room with her.<eos> You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.
He set the whole prison thing up with Warden Murphy.<eos> Jeffries says you were gonna kill me.<eos> He said I could get out and stay out if I killed you first.<eos> Why?<eos> He said that you got something inside that they want.
Where do I get it?<eos> By paying me top fucking dollar, cowboy.<eos> Why are you so against me?<eos> 'Cause you're a weak fucking coward.<eos> It makes me sick just to look at you.
No reason, pal.<eos> Nothing happening here.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thanks, babe.<eos> Hey, you.
You make them with love.<eos> But this was our agreement.<eos> Norma... you're a real artist.<eos> But love doesn't always turn a profit.<eos> We believe in you 100 percent, but from a business perspective, the board would like you to consider some alternatives without sacrificing any of the high standards that you're so well-known for.
I think you know.<eos> Andy, Bobby, take him downstairs.<eos> You're making a big mistake!<eos> You made the mistake, Chad.<eos> We've been watching you for months.
There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.<eos> That's a reasonable number.<eos> Zero.<eos> I thought you understood that.<eos> Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
Sure.<eos> Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.<eos> But surely a result is the best possible outcome.<eos> Yeah?<eos> The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.
Yeah.<eos> Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.<eos> Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.<eos> Right on.<eos> Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.<eos> A soldier leading soldiers.<eos> Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?<eos> Just move the needle a little bit.<eos> Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.<eos> That's all you gotta do.<eos> That's how this ends best for you anyway.
Yes, you are.<eos> You're calculating days.<eos> You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.<eos> Yes, I know. I know.<eos> But I just did that because... I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
It was glib.<eos> I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.<eos> There's gonna be thousands of parades.<eos> Thousands of 'em all over America.<eos> Only none of them will be for you.
Do you know the story of the frog in boiling water?<eos> If you place a frog in water and heat it slowly enough, the frog will not jump out.<eos> And the frog will be cooked alive.<eos> I'm afraid you're that frog.<eos> How and if you die here is totally up to you but I can assure you that perspiration stains on your $300 shirt are the least of your worries.
She fucking works as a teacher part-time to help pay the mortgage.<eos> This is my son...<eos> Larry is 7.<eos> He broke his leg last year learning how to ice skate.<eos> We know everything about you Mister Hinds.
The joint account savings?<eos> No...<eos> That's already gone.<eos> Then what do you expect me to transfer?<eos> The money you made from selling the properties your old man left you.
What about it?<eos> I need you to transfer all the money that's still in it back to me.<eos> I can't do that...<eos> They expect the next payment in a few days and without that...<eos> I will get it back to you before then
I will get it back to you before then<eos> I need that money, mother.<eos> I just need it for a few days.<eos> Fuck...<eos> I will get it back to you before then.
I just need it for a few days.<eos> Fuck...<eos> I will get it back to you before then.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I will get it back to you before then.
For now.<eos> If I get you this money, how do I know that you'll let us go?<eos> What's the matter, Mister Hinds?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> Trust you?
Yeah, who's this?<eos> It's Poppa Hinds.<eos> Ryan?<eos> The one and only.<eos> I Didn't think I was gonna hear from you until next month buddy.
Ryan?<eos> The one and only.<eos> I Didn't think I was gonna hear from you until next month buddy.<eos> You got good news for me?<eos> I got better than good news for you Bob.
A Fucking magic pill, and it works.<eos> Full head of hair pussy in your lap, sitting on your fucking yacht.<eos> That's why they call it inside fucking information!<eos> Of course it hasn't been approved by the FDA.<eos> That's why I'm bringing it to you.
Alright, I'm gonna need you to transfer the fund today.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Shit man!<eos> You need it today?<eos> Yes, if I'm gonna kill it for you like I'm going to Bob,
Thought what over?<eos> Your offer.<eos> Damn you brokers have a short memory span.<eos> Anyways, I'll do it.<eos> I trust you.
We have plenty to discuss still.<eos> I left you some water, look to your left.<eos> Slow down...<eos> You're only going to mate yourself sick.<eos> I'm starting to pity you.
You took everything from me.<eos> Everything...<eos> Are you sure, Ryan...<eos> Have I really taken everything?<eos> I think it's for you.
I can't do that.<eos> Not yet, not until you tell her Mister Hinds.<eos> Why's he doing this to us?<eos> What did we ever do to him?<eos> This isn't about you, it's about me.
I don't like this...<eos> I want to go home now...<eos> Please take me home.<eos> It's all be over soon Anna, I promise just trust me.<eos> And why should she trust you?
What about Leslie?<eos> What does she have to do with this?<eos> What?<eos> Look around the room.<eos> I left another gift for you.
It looks like you have some explaining to do.<eos> Anna is my wife...<eos> You both are.<eos> I lied to you Leslie.<eos> I didn't really care about you.
Please...<eos> You have to know, you have to know, you have to know that...<eos> Anna, I'm so sorry...<eos> Please answer.<eos> I never lied about how I felt about you.
Ryan.<eos> I want you to pull out the gun from the box in front of you.<eos> Shoot yourself and I'll let them go.<eos> It ends here.<eos> Or, you tell me you'd rather them die, and I'll open that door for you right now.
Now do you remember what that loan was for?<eos> I don't know...<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> You just turned me down flat...<eos> You said times were hard for you and Anna...
EverywhereBartwent, he was given star treatment.<eos> At school at the public pool...<eos> It's really not that dangerous.<eos> ...with local merchants.<eos> Oh, young basketball star, I have something special for you.
What is wrong with me?<eos> Well, let me see, for...<eos> Let's see, for starters, I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?
So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?<eos> Appreciate, like I baked you a coffee cake or something?<eos> I spend 24/7 in this house looking after you, feeding you, bolstering your moods, doing your laundry.
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.<eos> You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you...
No, I'm not looking at your computer.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry... Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.
What do you think you're trying to protect me from?<eos> No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you?
- I'll be right back.<eos> - Right.<eos> Just one second.<eos> I'm waiting for you.<eos> I'm ready for you.
Not at all.<eos> As long as you play a few holes with me later.<eos> You are a naughty girl.<eos> Here we are, a steak and a salad.<eos> Aha, mama likes you slim and trim.
- That's it.<eos> - Hey how are you?<eos> - Meet Maximo.<eos> Hi.<eos> Look at you!
No!<eos> I just help out when something gets jammed in his house, or there's a problem in his house.<eos> It's an old building.<eos> Go get dressed.<eos> Look at you.
You will remember, because I have no other way to get back home.<eos> I said I'll try. Jeez.<eos> 5:00!<eos> Is she always like this?<eos> No, I just think she doesn't like you.
- My face? Yeah.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Thoughtful, very handsome with a hint of mischief.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Hey, I'm there for you, whatever you need.
Thank you.<eos> You know, if these frozen yogurts were half as sweet as you, we're in for quite a treat.<eos> You said fourteen ounces, right?<eos> Gracias, sweet Cindy.<eos> I hope your pussy cats realize what a beautiful scratching post they have in you.
Let's go.<eos> Wait, uncle Maximo. What is a virgin?<eos> It's an airline.<eos> Last lesson of the day... Your walk.<eos> Your walk tells more about you than your mouth ever can.
She's got me dressing like him, talking like him, but, I can't do an accent to save my life.<eos> And I can't sleep on an air mattress one more night.<eos> You find any intel or Celeste Birch?<eos> As as matter of fact, I did.<eos> And before I share this, I don't think she's the right mark for you.
But, what if mom finds out we're training again?<eos> Hugo, you can't live your life afraid that something bad will happen.<eos> Or you'll never really live.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you gotten her to notice you with the sexy walk.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I can't wait to see all his new friends.<eos> Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?<eos> Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.<eos> I mean, look at you.
Plus, we could see the big mansion of the grandmother, right?<eos> Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo would mush rather go with me.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> - Look at you.
It's not what happened, it's what hasn't happened.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - James,<eos> I'm not saying I get it, but she likes you.
- Yeah, she'll just think about it and get back to you.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> But, you know let me know either way.<eos> I told you.<eos> This guy likes you.
I love you too, little sister.<eos> What are you telling your dad tonight?<eos> Just that I'm excited to go to Arden's party.<eos> And that I'm glad you're going with me.<eos> I patched it up for you.
What if I took this?<eos> No, no! No, no, not that!<eos> That's my nephew's.<eos> That's important.<eos> - This is important to you?
- I swear...<eos> Okay... a little bit.<eos> I mean, I sort of used you.<eos> But, it wasn't really about you.<eos> It was more about me and in order to help me I wanted to help you.
Hi, sweetie.<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I forgot the code.<eos> Is Hugo here?<eos> Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
Can I speak with him?<eos> - No.<eos> - Please?<eos> Just let me explain.<eos> How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?
Okay...<eos> You wait here and I will be... right back.<eos> - Mommy...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I am proud of you.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> But they all think I choked that girl.<eos> Yeah, but you know that you didn't and I know that you didn't.<eos> It's good enough for me;<eos> It should be good enough for you.
You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.
- The one.<eos> For every person, there's the one.<eos> Case in point, you're my one.<eos> - Well, you are my...<eos> But for you, he's the one you fell irreparably in love with, who irreparably broke your heart, who you apparently can't get over 15 years later.
Okay, I don't... I don't think this is the right time to be...<eos> let's just... - Thank you.<eos> - And if Chloe's out, then the entire brigade will follow.<eos> - She's basically the pied piper.<eos> I like you, Madeline. And... and I actually admire you for sticking up for your unapologetic friend, but if I can offer something as objectively as I possibly can... do not fuck with my daughter's birthday.
Fucking kidding me?<eos> And what I don't understand is why my own daughter wouldn't come to me first.<eos> I couldn't talk to my mom about birth control.<eos> Really?<eos> If I were you, I would just let it go.
Now, I don't suppose you found a job today?<eos> I had an interview.<eos> But I didn't get a law degree to be a damn receptionist.<eos> You'd be lucky to be someone's receptionist.<eos> If I were you, I'd start praying.
They're treating me for nerve damage.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> I... I understand.<eos> Probably very frightening for you, and we shouldn't have dragged Robin and Susan through all this.
I have a wife and a child now.<eos> I'm not sure this is the life that I want for them.<eos> - Right, that's your decision.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just don't know if I can keep up what I'm doing without you.
Okay?<eos> I'm sick and tired of living your life!<eos> What, you're gonna leave me?<eos> Like all the rest of 'em?<eos> After everything I've fucking done for you?
That's what men do.<eos> Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.
You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.<eos> It's not you.<eos> It's David.<eos> I'd watch your ass around him if I were you.
What are you saying?<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> If you're saying what I think you're saying, you're insane.<eos> I know it's insane.<eos> But I need you with me on this.
Fight who?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> They're called the Ghost Riders.<eos> They took everyone from Canaan.<eos> Why did they leave you?
They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.
Where's my sister?<eos> Your sister's dead.<eos> She died a long time ago.<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I'm gonna kill you, too.
We're still using them.<eos> I want you to help me find a hellhound.<eos> You were tracking him.<eos> You lost his scent.<eos> I found him on you.
Which tells me...<eos> Nothing.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Then I have no use for you.
You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.<eos> I believe in you.
What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But stay behind me.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It's afraid of you.
This is a mistake.<eos> You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.
I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.
Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.<eos> She helps you, you help me.
And your sense of humor.<eos> That is great.<eos> But if we're the only ones left in Beacon Hills, then we need each other.<eos> Which means you need me out of this cell.<eos> We need to trust you.
I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.<eos> Is that right?<eos> When the Ghost Riders find us, I'm not gonna do anything for you.
Okay?<eos> You're someone, you're...<eos> Scott, you're my best friend.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I need you.
Look at him.<eos> We... We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?
There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.
So...<eos> They still need us.<eos> They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I need you.
They'll always need us.<eos> And, you know, I...<eos> I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.
I need you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I need you too.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> No, really, I need you though, uh...
Please help us.<eos> X-ray technician to four south.<eos> - Morning, Ollie.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I wouldn't give Mr. Richards Methotrax, if I were you.
If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?<eos> The rip in the sky?<eos> No.<eos> No magic here.<eos> I found a new line of work, thanks to you.
I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.<eos> Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
Yeah, yeah, Vessel, solace, truth...<eos> I spend half my life waiting to walk in and out of rooms.<eos> Glinda.<eos> It's been some time.<eos> The North is always open to you.
Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Did you get them?<eos> Are her spells inside you?
- Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Heck, who doesn't?<eos> How is your sister?<eos> Alive, no thanks to you.

Swallow, Lucas, swallow.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> Did you get them?<eos> Are her spells inside you?
- Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?<eos> How is your sister?<eos> Alive, no thanks to you.
'Cause we will.<eos> No. Then we go to Ev.<eos> We find more medicine.<eos> Whatever happened, we'll fix it.<eos> We'll turn you back to you.
If you're looking for a career change...<eos> Magic!<eos> That I banned from Oz.<eos> Here in Emerald City!<eos> Should I awake my giants to make an example of you?
Know what?<eos> Your mother worked here.<eos> Before you were born.<eos> And after.<eos> But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away.
And I worked harder.<eos> I-I-I desperately wanted to be noticed.<eos> I just...<eos> I wasn't noticeable.<eos> Not like you.
Tip!<eos> Tip!<eos> Tip.<eos> Why did you run off like that?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.
Is that so?<eos> If you let me join your brigade, I'll kill for you.<eos> What will your family think about that?<eos> I have no family.<eos> Well, then maybe I do have a place for you.
What have you done to me?<eos> Well, saved your life, of course.<eos> It wasn't easy.<eos> And full recovery will take time.<eos> But... I think it's safe to say we've made you a new man.
So... the girl who fell from the sky.<eos> Jane, look at this.<eos> It's working.<eos> I'm working.<eos> I'm proud of you, Jack.
Build me, then sell me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care.<eos> Then why are you leaving?<eos> The princess met you... she liked you, and...
Dorothy, that man, he knew me.<eos> So...<eos> Are you a good witch... or a bad witch?<eos> Oh, I must say, The Wizard has outdone himself.<eos> Because he wants something from you.
Unfortunately, there's no right one, either.<eos> You're wrong about all of this.<eos> I didn't kill your sister.<eos> Liar!<eos> I will suck the lies out of you like marrow from a bone, or you can speak the truth now and save yourself the hurt.
How... how do you know?<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Maybe you need a good stretch?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Glinda will be coming here tomorrow and expects information from you.
Nurture me.<eos> But your mother couldn't care less about one baby girl?<eos> How rotten do you have to be for that?<eos> She must've sniffed it out.<eos> Something in you that's broken and couldn't ever be fixed.
Tip, I... I helped you when I had nothing to gain.<eos> And I helped you because you asked me to.<eos> And now I'm asking you... please. Please help me.<eos> You helping me was the worst thing that ever happened.<eos> So now I'm gonna do for you what I wish you'd done for me.
Oh, Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> It's my fault you're not sure.<eos> I wasn't there for you when you needed me most.
The ones our sister died with.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too.<eos> And what of your own?<eos> I harbor no secrets.<eos> Especially from you.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If you don't believe me, look on your left side. That's where I stabbed you before you went down.<eos> I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.
I can't break it.<eos> But I can work around it.<eos> How?<eos> If I had a conduit.<eos> Someone close to you, someone special...
I heard him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.<eos> I'm sorry, father, I'll... I'll come and help you find him.<eos> You know I'm always here for you.
But Glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by the beast.<eos> What good would new ones be?<eos> Sober up, you fool!<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
You have to stay here.<eos> I'm gonna go get help.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Keep her safe, Toto.<eos> Trust you.
Look at you.<eos> The way you dress, the way you act.<eos> That wig.<eos> You're just lying to everyone.<eos> I could say the same about you.
Which is why I need to ask you, where's the little witch?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> But if you let her go back to the North, she'll be safe, and so will you.<eos> Come!<eos> I have a proposition for you.
Can I count on you to build my arsenal?<eos> The Mother Witch lives and breathes for Glinda!<eos> I saw young Witches.<eos> She's not going to use them against The Beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
It's just the more I see of everything, the more I realize how hard it all is for you.<eos> Why are you talking?<eos> I'm trying to help.<eos> Everything you say is wrong.<eos> Everything about you is wrong.
Everything you say is wrong.<eos> Everything about you is wrong.<eos> I thought that's why you liked me.<eos> What about that girl back at The Wizard's castle?<eos> Does she like you?
But lucky for her, you learned a new trick.<eos> I didn't even think about it.<eos> The gauntlets.<eos> You can control them now.<eos> They're becoming part of you.
She sent them to die against The Beast Forever.<eos> And I helped her.<eos> I killed them too.<eos> I won't help either of you repeat the past.<eos> Glinda hid your mother from you.
He knows how.<eos> You made a deal with him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A deal that saved us both.<eos> How... how could you let Sylvie love you if you knew you were leaving?
Previously on "Emerald City"...<eos> The Mother Witch lives!<eos> And breeds for Glinda.<eos> She's not going to use them against The Beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
Is that why The Wizard animated the Stone Giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong Roan was about you.
I do owe you some gratitude for protecting this girl.<eos> Sylvie?<eos> Even though you knew her heart was magic.<eos> Even when she turned your own kind to stone. Your love for her has never wavered.<eos> But unfortunately for you... Stone crumbles.
Karen Chapman was hurt... because I wanted her dead, because I sent my men to kill her in Kansas.<eos> I thought she was gonna return to Oz.<eos> For Jane.<eos> For me!<eos> But I'm not gonna let her or you bring me back!
Go to the controls.<eos> Quickly!<eos> It's gonna get hot in here. What do I do?<eos> The lever, the handle.<eos> Bring that toward you.
Get inside.<eos> Get in.<eos> We have to go!<eos> Just hold on tight.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
Tell your governor!<eos> You tell him I'm coming!<eos> "And the Lord said unto Rebecca,<eos> "two nations are in thy womb.<eos> "Two peoples within you who shall be divided.
And I don't like having him conscripting me into his cause without me even having a say.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?
Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.
A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.<eos> That'd make a lot more sense if I didn't need him just as badly as he needs me.<eos> I don't believe you do.<eos> Whatever he is to you, whatever you are to him...
- We are two battered fighters at the end of a long fight.<eos> The next blow struck may be a decisive one, and we have to be the one that strikes.<eos> Stop.<eos> I prepared these men to follow Long John Silver upon his return.<eos> Now, if you assume that in his absence, that role now reverts to you... then you assume wrong.
Now, if you assume that in his absence, that role now reverts to you... then you assume wrong.<eos> See, my men know your name, but you weren't the one who recruited them into this.<eos> You weren't the one who led them in those midnight raids in the western plantations.<eos> You weren't the one who has lived with them and drank with them and bled with them.<eos> So in the absence of Long John Silver, the men will look to me, not you, for answers to what happens next, and I will be the one to give them those answers, not you.
Do you have value to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would your skill in a fight aid us in our efforts?<eos> Of course.<eos> But do we need you here?
Somewhere on an island a few days' journey from here is a chest filled with treasure buried in a secret place, and of the three men who know of that place, I may be the last one alive after today.<eos> Are you threatening to withhold the location of the chest that every man here is counting upon to provide for Nassau's treasury once we secure it<eos> solely so you can maintain your own status here?<eos> There is an unthinkable victory within our reach, and I will see this through by whatever means I have at my disposal.<eos> This seems like the act of a small man to you.
It's impossible to grab the chandelier mid-air, Rusi.<eos> What if something happens to me?<eos> I don't want to die before becoming Mrs. Billimoria.<eos> Miss Julia.<eos> Every sight of you is a wonder - Bloody he!
I don't want to die before becoming Mrs. Billimoria.<eos> Miss Julia.<eos> Every sight of you is a wonder - Bloody he!<eos> You float on the edge of a sword<eos> Every sight of you is a wonder
Every sight of you is a wonder<eos> You float on the edge of a sword<eos> You are life, Julia You are the beloved, Julia<eos> Pale-skinned, Julia A leopards tread, Julia<eos> Without you, life's not Worth a cent, Julia One.. two" three" four"
Kiddo!<eos> Kiddo" stop.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can you really give me what I want?<eos> Anything for you.
Can you really give me what I want?<eos> Anything for you.<eos> Will you take this to where it belongs, on the other side?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I can't live without you.
We'll be surfing, drinking Mai Tais.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, there's no point in me doing this without you, you know?
- Thanks for everything.<eos> - Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm watching you.
I didn't do it on purpose!<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I was trying to shoot Ray Kurtz.<eos> Well, you missed, and he's gone.<eos> You fucked up this whole case and when I called your captain to find out where you were, she told me she hadn't heard from you since you initiated a sexual exchange with her at 1:00 a.m.
Listen, I've done back flips with worse injuries than this.<eos> We're gonna need backup.<eos> Clearly, he blames us for Reed.<eos> We don't know who in this department is in on this.<eos> - I trust you, and you trust me.
It's incredible, the technology.<eos> Aren't those things, like, illegal now?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Probably only a matter of time, though.<eos> What happened with you and my father?
Or figure me out or something.<eos> So I've always had this sense that... that, you know, the day would come where she would just... where she would just not love me anymore, and... and I...<eos> Evidence that she doesn't... doesn't love you anymore.<eos> Celeste, how do you feel about what Perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.
Celeste, how do you feel about what Perry just said?<eos> I gave up my career for you.<eos> I left my family.<eos> I left my friends.<eos> I moved here for you.
Now, given the unprecedented success of last year's Trivia Night with the theme "Dead Celebrities,"<eos> we've decided to come back again with yet another costume gala, this year titled.<eos> "Elvis and Audrey Night."<eos> I think it should make for a splendid... - God.<eos> - Evening filled with fun, fashion, frivolity, one which should raise some much-needed funding... and I'm looking at you, Bruce Pedulla... going to the benefit of all our wonderful, wonderful children.
That'd be cool.<eos> Are you ever coming back?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I'm gonna come back all the time.<eos> I made a playlist for you.
And happy...?<eos> I'm happy because the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful.<eos> For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you, look into your eyes, be in love with you, and feel you being in love with me.
I paid $9,000 to ground the house against electromagnetic fields so that we all didn't get brain cancer.<eos> Or the time when we went camping? I said, "Fucking mosquitos bite the shit out of me."<eos> Doesn't matter as long as our skin doesn't come in touch with DEET.<eos> What is your point, Nathan?<eos> My point is I did a lot of fucked-up things in our marriage, a lot of hoops I jumped through for you, and now I'm doing those same things for Bonnie.
He would've never done that when we were together. Never!<eos> But for Bonnie, he's Mr. Fucking Sacrifice.<eos> Why don't you bottle up some of that anger - and put it to good use?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Mm, I think I could use you and Joseph at the meeting with the mayor tomorrow.
- Am I dreaming right now?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Ziggy.<eos> You were sleepwalking, baby.<eos> What happened between you and my dad?
Yeah, I know my history.<eos> I'm not trying to get pregnant.<eos> I'm just trying to help out a friend.<eos> What's the big problem, hmm?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?
I'm just trying to help out a friend.<eos> What's the big problem, hmm?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.
Seems like something's a little wrong, sweetie.<eos> Are you sure you're not upset about something?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I promise I will keep it a secret.<eos> How are things with you and Ziggy?
Fine. He's nice. We're friends.<eos> That's great!<eos> What do you and Ziggy like to do together?<eos> We just like playing and stuff.<eos> And he's nice to you? Yes.
That is a done deal.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> You're so good to me.<eos> I believe in you.
- What?<eos> It was a reflex!<eos> - So you're saying the thing's mutual.<eos> No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me.<eos> I'm in love with you. You hear me?
It was a reflex!<eos> - So you're saying the thing's mutual.<eos> No, he jumped me and then he yelled at me.<eos> I'm in love with you. You hear me?<eos> I'm in love with you, Madeline.
I love you.<eos> There's nothing like the sound of crunching cereal in the morning.<eos> Not too summery?<eos> No, it looks incredible.<eos> It's funny how clothes always seem to do that on you.
Why come back?<eos> Why get so involved with the theater?<eos> Because I thought you and I were over with.<eos> We were buried. It was over, it was done.<eos> I don't believe you.
Um, you're meant to be our doctor.<eos> You're treating us. And you are demonizing him.<eos> Does he know you're here alone?<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just thinking about you.
Come on, Holt!<eos> Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.<eos> Just give us a second, Dad.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> Your mom, she really needs you right now.
I can feel her.<eos> It's all changing.<eos> You don't have much time.<eos> You need to trust me.<eos> How could I ever trust you?
I saw something.<eos> There was a room.<eos> A door.<eos> - Yeah. - It's Gabriel.<eos> Holt, listen. I've got a tail for you.
You got more talent than me.<eos> I got two.<eos> One is I can sleep anywhere, any time.<eos> The other one is that I usually end up getting what I want... on average, over time.<eos> It's all about getting people to believe in you.
Daughter of the South.<eos> Stone queen on a throne of honey.<eos> Secret owner of all gold.<eos> I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.
I am yours, my beloved Bilquis.<eos> Queens and concubines and maidens hide their faces in shame before you because you are the mother of all beauty.<eos> Trees bow, and warriors fall.<eos> Give me your blessing.<eos> I bow my head before you and worship you.
Who he really is?<eos> Well, I never.<eos> Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.
Mad Sweeney as I live and breathe.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Southern Comfort and Coke for you.<eos> Jack Daniel's for me.<eos> And these are for you, Shadow Moon.
They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.
Was it a one-time thing the night before I got back?<eos> That's... that's a "We're in this together" thing.<eos> W-Was it love? Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay?<eos> I could've taken it.<eos> You know, I had a surprise for you.
Fibonacci numbers.<eos> And I know that why?<eos> Because four of them were about math. I like math.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I just wanted to come back better than when I went in... for you.
For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?<eos> Like I said, you wouldn't believe in me if I told you.<eos> Happy Easter, you old fraud.<eos> And a fair Ostara to you.
They killed my friend.<eos> He pledged his allegiance to me, and forged a blade in my honor.<eos> And they killed him for it.<eos> The new gods.<eos> That's why we need you.
They'll pray to Him.<eos> But he's not the goddess of spring.<eos> Shadow, my boy, I need a word with the fair lady here alone.<eos> Help yourself to a drink, two, tops.<eos> Still need you sharp.
Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now... It's my turn to do well by you.<eos> I can take care of you.
They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.
I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.<eos> Make them pray.<eos> Let them remind themselves it was a queen that gave them the harvest.<eos> They'll be hungry but then they'll turn to you, and they will pray to Ostara once again.
A dead girl?<eos> I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?<eos> Hi.<eos> - You have a lovely home. - Don't stoop.<eos> Let me see you.
Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas.<eos> Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for... not for Jesus Christ.<eos> Not for you.
I was killed... by a god?<eos> Which... fucking... god?<eos> Never saw you look quite so pretty before.<eos> Happy Easter, Easter.<eos> And to you.
Ha. It's religious Darwinism.<eos> Adapt and survive.<eos> What we have achieved together, you and I, is no small feat.<eos> Now that we're living in an atheist world.<eos> Look at you.
Oh, I teach dirty English.<eos> Well, they will be impressed to know that you tutored at a university.<eos> Why do you say "tutor"?<eos> You know very well that I was a junior professor at the Leipzig University History Department.<eos> OK, well, unlike you, my parents don't ask awkward questions, and they have manners, and they will love you.
I'm not the same as I used to be.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You know, since going to NA, getting fit, eating properly...<eos> - I'm not the same.<eos> - Some of you's the same.
Are you really going to eat a marshmallow with a dried tomato?<eos> - When can Alexander come to dinner?<eos> - Um... I have to ask, but what about Friday for you two?<eos> Uh, yeah, well...<eos> Friday's... - Dad, what about you?
This is about me and my boyfriend.<eos> So he is your boyfriend?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> How old is he?<eos> Yes, he is older, but unlike you and Dad, we love each other!
Hey, she needs a mentor.<eos> - Adrian, I'm not a teacher.<eos> Give me someone else.<eos> - Take Miranda, OK?<eos> She'd take a bullet for you.
Hold on, hold on.<eos> - Hi, Rod! - Now, look here.<eos> You know you picked the wrong guy, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I know that.<eos> This is all just a ploy to get to you.
What do you mean "his deal"?<eos> I just talked to him. Dude's whole vibe is hostile.<eos> Did he say something?<eos> It's not what he says. It's how he says it, you know?<eos> Maybe he likes you.
No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> Hmm. And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.<eos> Especially you, Chris.
There was time.<eos> There was time, if somebody was looking for her.<eos> There was time, but nobody, nobody was looking.<eos> You're all I got.<eos> I'm not gonna leave here without you.
Your first bed as a free man.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.
Would you like to tell us how long you've been here?<eos> Um... just over a year.<eos> Just over a year. You were one of the first.<eos> How have you been treated? Have you been treated well?<eos> - Have I been good to you?
Please don't lose faith in me.<eos> "Faith."<eos> Oh, God. I have such contempt for that word.<eos> Show me someone who relies on faith and I'll show you someone who's given up control over whatever it is they believe.<eos> Sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
- Sit down.<eos> I need you to come with me right now.<eos> Sit down, Will.<eos> This is just your memory.<eos> I'm a part of you.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.<eos> No, not this time.<eos> You don't have to come back anymore.<eos> You helped me get to where I needed to be and now you'll go someplace else.<eos> When I get there, will I be able to remember you?
Dad, everything is shutting down.<eos> His brain's showing barely any activity.<eos> You're leaving now. This is it.<eos> I'm not leaving this room until we revive my son.<eos> When I get there... I'm going to remember you.
Now, everyone, this is so fucking dope.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> My first two years I was under contract with a company called Metro Home Video.<eos> And being under contract was an ideal situation for me because I wanted to feature dance.<eos> Back then, when you were the contract star, they made these glamorous posters and fliers for you, and they gave you as many as you wanted to go out on the road and use as marketing materials.
Because some girls think, you know,<eos> "I'm gonna work for a year or two and make some money and put it aside and then I'll do something else."<eos> And I'm like, "Yeah, you're not doing something else."<eos> You're gonna have at any other job, someone's gonna know what you've done."<eos> You have to be done with the business before the business is done with you.
It'll break the monotony.<eos> Oh, can I?<eos> Just for a short time.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I'll be watching you.
"Didn't think I'd be hearing from you again," and...<eos> Do you want a piece of me, you little bitch?<eos> What?<eos> "Sex and the City," I want you to play Samantha.<eos> I'm like, "Dude, I like you, man."
There it is.<eos> And a lot of love to a lot of fans out there?<eos> Yeah. Anybody can come, swing on by and we'll have a good time.<eos> There you go. So, are you...<eos> Are you still doing movies or are you done with that?
And so, I don't.<eos> I mean, I've done adult for a long, long time.<eos> I mean, there's other things that can be done that I'm also interested in that I would like to do since the adult business doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Since... Let it go to bed.<eos> - It's for you.
Having my daughter pulled out of my life in such a... harsh manner.<eos> You know, there was no phone calls.<eos> There was... I couldn't tell her I love her.<eos> You know, "I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening."<eos> I'm trying to get to you."
I win!<eos> You owe me five dollars.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You bet on me?<eos> - Against you.
Only if it comes up.<eos> Kat!<eos> - Shit! - Watch it!<eos> Meet the boys.<eos> Justin Foley is mine, and Zach Dempsey for you.
I, uh, should get to class.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> So, I'll see you around, then.<eos> I guess you will.<eos> Being Kat's boyfriend was kind of the only remarkable thing about you, but, Justin, you were my Kryptonite.
Not so wonderful.<eos> We'll continue our discussion of nonverbal signals tomorrow.<eos> So, until then, make note, be aware.<eos> I'm not angry you betrayed me.<eos> I'm angry that I trusted you in the first place.
I've been there.<eos> Now, it won't always be easy.<eos> It might even hurt a bit.<eos> Or a bit more than a bit.<eos> That depends on you.
As is the silence.<eos> See, I can guarantee... that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know... who are the others?<eos> Who else is responsible for my death?<eos> Well, you're going to learn soon enough.<eos> And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.
She ever tell you...<eos> Did she ever say anything about me?<eos> Anything... bad?<eos> God, no!<eos> No, Clay, she liked you so much.
For a while, we were the kind of friends you wish you had.<eos> We did disgusting things like shop together.<eos> Sorry!<eos> And compare what we bought.<eos> That top is perfect for you.
Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.<eos> He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.
He's a logistics expert, mostly.<eos> Look over there.<eos> He's checking you out.<eos> - He's checking you out.<eos> - No, you, and he's cute.
Please, let us know if we can make your visit more pleasant.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was fine, Jess.<eos> It was.<eos> You're the kind of girl that boys like to like, not spread rumors about.
What did I do?<eos> Is it you and Alex now? No!<eos> How could you even...<eos> Of course not!<eos> He likes you, you like him.
This is one of those things.<eos> I can't hear her voice... without thinking of her.<eos> Without seeing her.<eos> Seems like maybe that was the idea.<eos> It's all you, bro.
Morning, Astronomy Boy.<eos> Better than Helmet, I guess.<eos> I feel they work together.<eos> Alex, maybe you think I'm being silly, like I get my titties in a twist over the tiniest things... but you didn't walk that hall.<eos> You didn't feel those eyes on you.
Yeah, I am.<eos> I'll shoot in his spot.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> The butterfly effect.<eos> It started with Justin, then on to you, Alex.
You talking about Clay?<eos> Keep your voice down, dude.<eos> Whatever you're doing, I want in.<eos> We're not doing anything, Tyler.<eos> It's not like we would trust you if we were.
It's not even paid off yet.<eos> Why don't you take the station wagon?<eos> 'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.<eos> Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.
Later.<eos> Okay, seriously, how does he get all the hot girls?<eos> I mean... his dick must be huge.<eos> Only one huge dick in the vicinity at the moment, Bryce.<eos> She's talking about you, big guy.
I had... I had to do something.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't have to do that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want to be your friend, Courtney.<eos> I have been a friend to you, and this thing you're scared for people to know about you doesn't matter to me.
What about you?<eos> Yes, all of us.<eos> So you help the school, and cover the fact it's your fault too.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Clay, look, I know she was special to you.
No. No, it's on every person who talked shit about her, and every guy who fucked her over, and it's on you because she thought you were a friend, and you sent one more asshole in her direction just to cover the fact you're gay.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?
That's not true.<eos> I don't get it, Courtney.<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> How is this so hard for you?<eos> Was it hard for you?
What do you think everyone would say?<eos> "She's got two gay dads, that's why she's..."<eos> And my dads, they've taken so much crap, my whole life, for being gay and then for being dads, and I just can't...<eos> I couldn't do that to them.<eos> What people think of you isn't more important than Hannah's life.
"She's got two gay dads, that's why she's..."<eos> And my dads, they've taken so much crap, my whole life, for being gay and then for being dads, and I just can't...<eos> I couldn't do that to them.<eos> What people think of you isn't more important than Hannah's life.<eos> She needed you as a friend.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.
She's nice.<eos> So you only like nice girls?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> I just thought you were cooler than... a Sheri.<eos> I waited for you, Marcus.
Be quiet.<eos> Mom's going through one of her things.<eos> You didn't answer your phone or my texts.<eos> - I know, 'cause my mom.<eos> - I needed to see you.
God, no. It's...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, it's okay if you don't like me like that.<eos> No...<eos> I like you.
You were thinking of Hannah.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.
I wasn't.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I wasn't... I wasn't thinking of anyone.<eos> But... but you.<eos> I like you.
Okay?<eos> You showed real strength of character.<eos> You always do.<eos> We don't agree on everything, but we can agree on that.<eos> Proud of you, pal.
I heard the stirrings.<eos> Some, uh... thumps and mutterings and such.<eos> We need to get him back to Dr. Ellman.<eos> He won't take the meds, but the talk therapy was always helpful.<eos> Feel like it was more helpful for you to have him doing it.
Yo, dude!<eos> There he is!<eos> For those who aren't Zach, you can relax.<eos> For now, at least.<eos> As for you, Zach... I wonder if you ever felt what it's like to be lonely.
Zach... I don't know if you're doing this on a dare or whatever.<eos> It's not a dare.<eos> It's not.<eos> I just...<eos> I know you think every guy likes you because you've got this great ass.
It's not a dare.<eos> It's not.<eos> I just...<eos> I know you think every guy likes you because you've got this great ass.<eos> But I like you for so much more than that.
I get it.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do.<eos> Believe me.<eos> This is all so easy for you.
No, Clay, please. - Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because.<eos> Well, do your folks know?<eos> About you and Hannah?
What kind of lonely could the great Zach Dempsey possibly feel?<eos> Dempsey, what the fuck?<eos> We gonna take a long lunch or what?<eos> Uh, yeah, I don't know.<eos> Come on, man, we need you.
Well, good for him.<eos> Iwantedapurpose... a reason for being on this planet.<eos> But that poetry group looked like an AA meeting. Or a support group.<eos> I saw no one within decades of my age.<eos> Until I saw you.
I'm gonna go get my coat.<eos> It's in the back, so...<eos> What do you want, Ryan?<eos> We're legitimately closed.<eos> I have something for you.
You're in it, even if you are the pussy Hannah said.<eos> Fuck you. You're calling me a pussy, after what you did, or didn't do?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Whatever happens to us happens to you too.
That's another story.<eos> But for now, Justin, you'd been with the same girl all night.<eos> But I'm not gonna call her out by name. Even though, if you were at that party, you already know.<eos> JUSTIN: You're so hot.<eos> I can't keep my eyes off of you! JESSICA:
And so would all of you.<eos> But this tape isn't about him.<eos> It's about you and me, Justin. You called him a friend.<eos> - (DOOR SLAMS)<eos> - But your girlfriend needed you.
Now, look, if I can do that, I can drive home.<eos> Come on.<eos> You got it?<eos> Now I wonder if we would have both been better off staying at the party.<eos> Sheri, this one's for you.
No.<eos> Clay, you don't understand.<eos> I do understand.<eos> Every drama has to be your drama, or it doesn't count.<eos> Somehow this is all about you. It's incredible.
I remember Miss Cantrell saying,<eos> "Well, don't just stand there, come in."<eos> The next time I stopped by, they invited me for dinner.<eos> The next time after that, I helped hang pictures, and now I just spend time with them, help around the house.<eos> They seem to like you.
Breathe in.<eos> Breathe out.<eos> Then you shoot.<eos> Clay, we're just so glad to finally meet you.<eos> Jeff was so fond of you.
Because how could I have known?<eos> But it was the same night. That same awful night.<eos> Remember that story I was saving for later?<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> And it's all about you... Clay.
Clay, I know you're asking yourself why you're on these tapes.<eos> What could you possibly have done?<eos> What else could have happened the night of Jessica's party?<eos> Well, good luck with your fresh start.<eos> Good luck to you, party animal.
There's no winning or losing.<eos> You shuffle to transfer your energy to the cards.<eos> Now cut the deck.<eos> So, uh... what do the cards say?<eos> This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.
So, uh... what do the cards say?<eos> This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Seems right.<eos> Like accusing people of ratting you out.
They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.<eos> Did Justin finger you?<eos> I bet you went down on him.<eos> - And they all became you.
- I really do.<eos> - You know what people will say?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Because it's easy for you, right?
Maybe she's hoping she'll avoid the whole thing.<eos> Your dad must know something from the other deputies.<eos> My dad's more of a "sweep it under the rug" kind of guy.<eos> Works for me.<eos> I don't think he gives a shit about you.
I didn't mean tell the truth about everything.<eos> Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.
Why not, Tyler?<eos> You got more secrets you're trying to hide?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> No one's going to believe you.<eos> People'll just laugh at you, like they always do.
I'm so sorry, okay?<eos> I just convinced the landlord to work with us to pay the back rent.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I thought you were more responsible than this.<eos> - We trusted you!
Please, the woman next door will call the cops.<eos> We're done.<eos> Mom.<eos> IthoughtmaybeIcouldforget about what had happened.<eos> But thanks to you, Bryce... I'd finally lived up to my reputation.
but he seems to think that, uh, we may be able to get you out of having to go.<eos> And it's not that I don't have sympathy for these parents, kiddo, but you didn't have anything to do with this, and shouldn't have to be put through it.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You're a good kid, Alex.<eos> I'm proud of you.
But if you want to fight... if you want him to pay you for what he did, these tapes can help.<eos> They're proof.<eos> You want me to tell the whole goddamn world what happened to me?<eos> I want you to do what you want to do.<eos> Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.
I don't think I can do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> You think I'm letting Hannah down.<eos> I think we all let Hannah down.<eos> And I think she let you down.
I climbed up this crane, all the way up there, and I could... I could see the whole city.<eos> And I was gonna jump.<eos> Or shoot myself.<eos> But I couldn't.<eos> Because I couldn't stop thinking about you.
- Okay. All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But wouldn't you like to know what happened after Hannah left that day?<eos> Look, something happened, Hannah.<eos> And I believe you.
And from there, my questions only multiply.<eos> Which is probably not a state you want to leave me in.<eos> A state of multiplying questions.<eos> I suppose that makes two of us.<eos> Because there is something in the air between you and your friend up there.
I would not do it again.<eos> Captain Flint didn't retire from this.<eos> It was important that they heard that, but they didn't know him like you do.<eos> I won't insult you by repeating it.<eos> He trusted you.
There is a place near Savannah... where men unjustly imprisoned in England are sent in secret.<eos> An internment far more humane, but no less secure.<eos> Men who enter these gates never leave them.<eos> To the rest of the world, they simply cease to be.<eos> I don't believe you.
Maggie said that her people could take care of the Saviors.<eos> Except all they've done is put our community at risk.<eos> I'm asking you to help convince Ezekiel to attack the Saviors and destroy them.<eos> We'll win, but we need to wait for the right moment.<eos> We need you.
Keeping people... dozens and dozens and dozens of good people... keeping them safe.<eos> They ride this road.<eos> If we see cars, it's the Saviors.<eos> They've been coming in packs of two or three lately.<eos> That's why I need you.
Waited by the boat long time.<eos> Want something for it.<eos> So it's this.<eos> Jars and guns, guns and jars.<eos> You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you?
Guns.<eos> Soon.<eos> Soon.<eos> Or else.<eos> Once we get you stitched up, we'll go right back out and find the guns, right?
Bonus points for covering their head and protecting them from head trauma from hostiles and calamities.<eos> God damn!<eos> If that ain't the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life!<eos> Not only is that practical, it is just bad-ass!<eos> Look at you, Dr. Smarty-pants.
Finally.<eos> No, I mean, I'm gonna light this candle.<eos> No.<eos> Honey?<eos> D...wealwayssaid that if we got separated, I should come back here and wait for you.
I know.<eos> You probably don't.<eos> You always said that when we started dating, you forgot to tell me you had a shitty memory.<eos> You used to get so frustrated by it... knowing you wouldn't remember those good days... those special days.<eos> I felt bad for you.
You used to get so frustrated by it... knowing you wouldn't remember those good days... those special days.<eos> I felt bad for you.<eos> I remember you said there was so much you wanted to hold on to, and then it'd be gone.<eos> But you're lucky you don't remember things, D.<eos> I wish I could wait for you now.
Please...<eos> That's all you had to say.<eos> That is all you had to say.<eos> A good thing we got a spare Dr. Carson.<eos> I trust you, Dwighty boy.
That is a correct assessment.<eos> May I come in?<eos> So, how you liking it here?<eos> Are we doing right by Dr. Smarty-pants?<eos> You know, Frankie and Tanya... nothing but good things to say about you.
This year?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.<eos> I can't just wait.<eos> I don't know about you, but I can't.
Right now.<eos> You don't know shit about shit.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.<eos> I said that you weren't supposed to die and that you shouldn't do the thing that you were planning to do because we needed you... still do.
Is that true?<eos> That they made a deal with them?<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Just tell me if it's true. You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.
Just tell me if it's true. You need to talk to Daryl about that.<eos> He wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.<eos> Told me not to say where you were, and I did what you asked.<eos> Daryl didn't find you because of me.<eos> And what was said between you and him was said between you and him.
Go do your drop.<eos> Okay.<eos> You may approach, Nabila.<eos> I'm fine where I am.<eos> Shiva likes you.
Me, too.<eos> No.<eos> The hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.<eos> Maggie needs you.<eos> She needs you, too.
You can take anything else you need.<eos> But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.<eos> You owe her that much.<eos> Listen...<eos> Enid... Maggie trusts you.
Just stay down there.<eos> I'll keep them away.<eos> They aren't the same ones who came to Alexandria.<eos> Simon! Hello.<eos> Right back at you, Gregory.
If we're out here, we're alive.<eos> We get another go.<eos> Nothing is wrong with me, Sasha.<eos> I'm gonna make sure he's dead.<eos> Look, if this is too much for you, you want to bail, now's your chance.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Go.<eos> It's not your time.<eos> There's got to be a point to it, right?<eos> They need you.
I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Sorry 'bout the rope, too.<eos> Probably overkill, but you did cause one hell of a fracas last night.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I remember you.
Unh-unh. Just the opposite.<eos> See, this...<eos> Well, this could be the beginning.<eos> This knife is yours now.<eos> You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.
I'm a man short.<eos> Hell, you can't really call this piece of shit a man, but still, I'm short, and you got those beach-ball-sized lady nuts, and I wanna harness the heat comin' off of 'em.<eos> You can help me run this place one day, all of us together, following the rules, workin' on the same side of things.<eos> That's all this was ever about.<eos> And it still can be for you.
I was concerned.<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> They went out.<eos> They're looking for something they need.<eos> Without you?
Wake up.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do we need to...<eos> No, no, no. We're okay for now.<eos> Well, good afternoon to you.
You...<eos> You had a dream about me?<eos> You died.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> That's what I need from you.
Okay.<eos> How about this?<eos> One.<eos> Just one.<eos> I mean, I was gonna pull three outta the pool, but just one and just for you.
Accompany my regiment.<eos> The Saviors are a dragon with many heads, their numbers legion.<eos> We must seek allies in this endeavor.<eos> That's Benjamin's armor.<eos> Do you wear it to serve you, or do you wear it in his honor?
I'm Negan.<eos> No.<eos> We win.<eos> You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named Rick who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed?<eos> It's about you.
Please take it with my compliments.<eos> I truly wish I measured up.<eos> You still can, Eugene.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> Not on you.
We'll win!<eos> We live!<eos> We're the ones!<eos> Us!<eos> You just lost somebody important to you right now...
And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble.<eos> You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.<eos> He put himself in danger for you.
Hi, I'm Emma.<eos> You're very young to be doing this.<eos> I studied agriculture at uc Berkeley... And then I invested in this farm.<eos> Perfect timing, right?<eos> Your dad, he talked about you a lot.
It's just a bad case of food poisoning.<eos> You're gonna feel bad for the rest of the day... But tomorrow when you wake up... You'll feel as good as new, I promise.<eos> I'm gonna have to keep him here overnight... Just to make sure he doesn't get dehydrated.<eos> I'll stay with him... keep him away from that Chinese food.<eos> Nothing but tacos for you!
They caught me stealing water.<eos> Threatened to expose me if I didn't sell... Help them convince everyone else to sell, too.<eos> Oh, it'd be a big help if you let that out.<eos> To the farmers?<eos> No, to you.
You helped this whole community, you've saved a lot of people.<eos> Well at the ocean.<eos> I wish you please... don't forget how to get back here, okay?<eos> Take care of this place.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
I love you.<eos> I love you, buckaroo. I'll always love you.<eos> And I will see you on the other side.<eos> I don't want my mom or anybody to see this.<eos> I gave my word to Markus that I would show you... And only you, one day.
I love you, buckaroo. I'll always love you.<eos> And I will see you on the other side.<eos> I don't want my mom or anybody to see this.<eos> I gave my word to Markus that I would show you... And only you, one day.<eos> I had to trust you first.
This is from the little guy.<eos> I think that one's you.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Yeah, he's a creative kid.<eos> A little far reaching at times, but he likes you a lot.
I just saw a flare go up near Matti's husky pen.<eos> We're four months too early for bear.<eos> I know, but it's still gotta be logged, Eric!<eos> Michael, you see Matti, you tell him, frankly I've more important shit to worry about.<eos> I did what I could for you Hildur.
Demons and Cannibals.<eos> But I'm sure you have contingency plans.<eos> Just like last time.<eos> All the time you were gone, Dan. I prayed that Eric would find you and bring you home.<eos> Those terrible events... we, we wouldn't have survived them without you.
Dan.<eos> Hong...<eos> Eric. I bought you some rock salt.<eos> I'm cooking a meal.<eos> You don't have to do that. Oh, it's not for you.
Joseph Stalin wasn't a doctor.<eos> No, but he knew how to liquidate his fellow men.<eos> Every action, equal and opposite.<eos> Peace without turmoil.<eos> I put my hand upon you.
No, but he knew how to liquidate his fellow men.<eos> Every action, equal and opposite.<eos> Peace without turmoil.<eos> I put my hand upon you.<eos> I put my hand upon you.
I said, what's going on here?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Blacksmith pays for these.<eos> Jeweler pays for these.<eos> The law pays for you.
What choice do I have?<eos> I must say, it, uh, caught me by surprise, your assertion that Mr. Silver had revealed the whereabouts of the buried cache.<eos> - Assertion?<eos> - Maybe he told you.<eos> Felt close enough to you to share it, or maybe... you saw an opportunity to counter my leverage with Billy.
500 pieces?<eos> You think you're worth more?<eos> To the right people.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay so much for you?
What are you doing?<eos> I'm through following you down a path only you seem able to see.<eos> Towards a victory only you seem able to define.<eos> We will hold our position here until we can find our way into Nassau and free the rest of the men.<eos> And we will do it without you.
I do not want to be your friend.<eos> What I want is for all of this to end.<eos> For it to end, you must end.<eos> I imagine I have some obligation to surrender you to Captain Berringer, but the spectacle he would make of your trial and execution would only fan the flames of what is burning in Nassau now.<eos> I am tempted to put the sword to you and your man both, and bury this story for good, but what am I... if I spend my days pleading for a return to civility and then do dark things under the cover of night?
- Madeline.<eos> - Hi, Tori. Hello.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And to you, too.
We're fine.<eos> - I hope you feel better.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'm gonna get you some ice.
- I'm running late.<eos> Um, hey, just... just take a second, please?<eos> Listen, I think the idea behind what you're doing, it's extremely noble.<eos> What other 16-year-old even has a social conscience, you know?<eos> So, I'm proud of you. I'm very proud.
Ziggy, point to who it is.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> Well, you have to tell Celeste.<eos> She's going to want to hear it directly from you.
Wait, did I?<eos> Why do you gotta turn everything into a fucking fight?<eos> You know what, Nathan? I'm glad you're taking this parenting thing seriously.<eos> I really am.<eos> You know, despite all of our shit, I root for you.
Yeah, to have and to hold, to respect, to cherish... they were our vows.<eos> Not smashing my head into a wall.<eos> - Not fucking hurting me.<eos> - Well, you've been violent, too.<eos> Yes, I've been violent, but only in reaction to you, only because you initiated it.
Hi.<eos> Sorry, I don't want to interrupt anything. - I just...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I was talking to Celeste and she told me that it wasn't Ziggy.<eos> And I'm, uh... I'm so sorry. I've treated you and your little boy so badly.
But instead, I am stuck here for as long as it takes to fix this.<eos> In order to do that, you are going to have to give me something to fix it with.<eos> But you'd better come up with something of value I can use to get him to walk away from this.<eos> You think you can control him.<eos> And by the time you realize he has been controlling you, it is going to be too late.
Welcome to Miracle.<eos> So, are you moving in? I'm John.<eos> We're right next door.<eos> Something bad is gonna happen...<eos> To you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Dean.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Dean, yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?
We're going forever.<eos> Uh, I don't...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Without Matt?<eos> All of those years that he took care of you?
He loves you.<eos> Did you know that Matt won't let me cross the city limits?<eos> He thinks if I go over that bridge, the magical spell that woke me from my slumber will break and I'll go back into a coma.<eos> Listen, I know Matt can get carried away, but his heart's in the right place.<eos> He's writing a book about you.
This place is dead.<eos> The Fascists could be in Barcelona by now, but they use the ARAGON front to make the war drag on.<eos> The longer it takes, the greater the triumph.<eos> And we get to die of boredom. But smelling of soap!<eos> Not you!
I have something for you too.<eos> Is that a Christmas tree?<eos> I keep them.<eos> They're like treasure.<eos> If it wasn't for you...
Why don't you look for it?<eos> MARRIAGES<eos> Fuck Juli!<eos> You always appear unexpectedly!<eos> - Ditto. - What are you doing here?
- Nothing, except... I imagine you have returned the favour.<eos> Don't get caught in her web, Lluís.<eos> Why should I listen to you?<eos> I'm your best friend, remember?<eos> Trust me, and look after those who really need you.
- On the other side.<eos> Prisoner?<eos> No. In a Fascist uniform and aiming at us, Trini.<eos> That irresponsible liar is now a traitor.<eos> I don't believe you.
No. In a Fascist uniform and aiming at us, Trini.<eos> That irresponsible liar is now a traitor.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> It's the truth about your friend.<eos> Why should I believe you, when you've lied to me?
- Don't talk about Lluís.<eos> - I can't.<eos> He humiliated me.<eos> He stopped respecting me, but I can't stop loving him.<eos> Lluís might be weak, but he'll always take care of you and Ramonet.
Yes, maybe.<eos> Nobody would believe a deserter and a drunk.<eos> I could spread the rumour and sow the doubt.<eos> We both know that to destroy a woman's reputation, it doesn't matter if it's gossip or gospel truth.<eos> - I'll destroy you first.
Roger that, gunny.<eos> Someday.<eos> So, other than being blasted. By 50 times the lethal limit of radiation, You're doing surprisingly well.<eos> Who knows, Maybe you'll develop superpowers that you can use.<eos> That'd be perfect for you.
I just...<eos> I just want them dead.<eos> I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.
My parents had to sacrifice to have a kid on earth, Immigrate here when I was five.<eos> We chose mars.<eos> Mars chose us.<eos> Hey, hey, he has a point, hillman.<eos> The only thing that makes you a martian. Is falling out of your mother's gravity well.
Briefing in five.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Violins.<eos> Schubert in d-minor.<eos> I think the lieutenant has the hots for you, bobbie.
My julie.<eos> Even losing her was worth it.<eos> She's a sacred part of it now.<eos> So don't talk to me about sacrifice. Ever again.<eos> This'll kill any cancer. That dares try to grow inside you.
Decent guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think you would've got off eros without him?<eos> No.<eos> But he wasn't a good enough friend to wait for you.
I was just, um...<eos> Organizing all my stuff here.<eos> Then I realized...<eos> I don't have any stuff.<eos> This thing with you and amos...
I think.<eos> You're...<eos> Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like julie is to you.
You okay there?<eos> I think all that radiation failed to give me superpowers.<eos> Usually, when we're in dangerous situations, You hide your nerves. By asking weird, inappropriate questions.<eos> Do I?<eos> I hope that hasn't been irradiated out of you.
Command, be advised, we are standing down.<eos> The martians were targeting phoebe research station, Which sustained multiple direct hits.<eos> The ice moon fractured under the barrage. And the fragments spiraled into saturn.<eos> It's completely gone.<eos> Wish I had your hat for you, amigo.
You're still talking.<eos> If another belter ship don't see the blast. And come for me, I still be on the float.<eos> All this just bonus time for me, sasa ke?<eos> Stick next to me, okay?<eos> I'll look out for you when we land.
As you wish.<eos> I wish.<eos> - Hey, Carrie.<eos> - Hi. Is Reda in yet?<eos> Haven't seen him. Some flowers came for you, though.
- Please?<eos> - Which one is his?<eos> I can get you what you need, and we can have a good time.<eos> Tommy...<eos> He will fuck you up.
These I'm not even dealing with.<eos> It's just the Primidone.<eos> It's downstairs by his bed.<eos> I left it there.<eos> After he threw the glass at you.
When do I go home?<eos> We'll get to that, but first, we need to talk about something<eos> I thought we went over last time.<eos> Everything we say in here is privileged.<eos> No one can use it against you, but you got to be honest with us.
Pick him up?<eos> Ask him about his travels.<eos> Tell me this, Dar.<eos> Off the record, just you and me.<eos> Does that sound like a solid intelligence-gathering effort to you, or does that sound like a way to provoke a crisis with Iran we inherit on inauguration day?
Over, over, and over again.<eos> Looking for some clue.<eos> There. It was those tiles.<eos> Those are what...<eos> what led me to you.
I was visiting my sister.<eos> Whom you haven't seen in more than a decade, and who gets the pleasure of your company for less than a day.<eos> Because I have to get back to the States.<eos> I'm on the transition team.<eos> I'm afraid the President-elect will have to do without you for a while.
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If you believed in me, you wouldn't keep telling me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> Sekou...<eos> How do you think we got those charges against you dropped?
It took me an hour to get out here on that stinking train.<eos> Why not just meet at the Rezidentura?<eos> Viktor.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.
Viktor.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.<eos> Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.
Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.
- He confirmed it.<eos> That guy in the photo you sent me?<eos> Not an associate of Sekou Bah.<eos> I ran his photo through NGI.<eos> They came up empty, just like you.
Now it's my turn to say "no."<eos> The question is... what do we do now?<eos> - We?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This puts us in a bad situation... you and me.
What's she make of it?<eos> The bombing?<eos> I'd say she's still processing.<eos> You could tell, though, she's... not chastened, exactly, but a little more open.<eos> Open to you.
He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess...<eos> He's working for Mossad.<eos> For the past eight years.<eos> Including the little show they put on for you in Abu Dhabi.
Feeling sorry for yourself?<eos> Go fuck yourself, Dar.<eos> Because if you are, that would be a first.<eos> You grew up in a hard school, no time for self-pity.<eos> It's the first thing about you that impressed.
For the record, though, I...<eos> I never forced myself on anyone.<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Astrid will look after you till you can look after yourself.
What's so important you have to get back to New York?<eos> Astrid mentioned on the phone you were talking about the attack.<eos> The bomb that went off...<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> What's it to you?
It's Carrie Mathison.<eos> Her foundation represented the bomber.<eos> She's what's pulling you back to New York, isn't that it?<eos> No.<eos> The sway she holds over you... and Saul,
She was wrong.<eos> W-What risks?<eos> The main one was massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> Stroke.<eos> You think she's been taking care of you all these months out of love?
It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> I have a lot of people angry at me thanks to you.
I don't disagree.<eos> Then call them off.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> I still have value to you, intelligence.
- No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - Hurry.<eos> I should have never trusted you!
I got you out of lockup.<eos> So you knew where I was.<eos> In a safe place.<eos> That was the point.<eos> My God, I flew Astrid in all the way from Berlin to take care of you.
I mean, if there is ever anything I can--<eos> I said I'm fine.<eos> It was really great seeing you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, yeah, you too.
What would embolden Dar Adal to make such an extreme recommendation, and why now?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Come on, Carrie.<eos> You know exactly why.<eos> He found out you were advising me, and he got to you, just like he got to Majid Javadi before.
- What?<eos> You'll go to prison?<eos> Probably cut a deal.<eos> But I'll be humiliated-- publicly.<eos> When has that ever made the slightest bit of fucking difference to you?
I'll be okay.<eos> I know her Secret Service guys.<eos> Hey, text me when you're inside.<eos> I will.<eos> How about you?
Right.<eos> I also saw a squad leave there this morning, and now, suddenly, there's a brand-new team under McClendon's command charged with protecting the President-elect?<eos> Look, I-I know how this sounds, believe me.<eos> I hate even saying the words.<eos> What about you, Saul?
Well, maybe I don't like the idea of you worrying about me anymore.<eos> You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.
I've said it before.<eos> There's something dogmatic and dangerous, something distinctly un-American.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Another lesson learned... in a long life of lessons.<eos> Tell me, is there anything I can do for you?
I know the solicitor general.<eos> I met him through the president-elect.<eos> He can make things happen, secure the evidence, get that guy in there arrested, the whole bunch of them.<eos> Don't... call anyone.<eos> The van is from me to you.
'I fled to Alfred, the Saxon king of Wessex.<eos> 'I fell in love with a pagan queen, who saw my sister in a vision.'<eos> Uhtred, she lives, and is being held in the North.<eos> 'In the year 878 at Ethandune, 'I fought alongside King Alfred 'to defeat the Danes, and drove them from Wessex, 'but at a great price.'<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson, I have a gift for you.
-And Chicken...<eos> -[clucks] In the mornings, with our special guest Hiccup Haddock.<eos> -Hi, there.<eos> -Oh... Sir Talks-a-lot.<eos> Okay, enough about you.
He had a new family.<eos> So, I wish they wouldn't have told me, because I was already where I belonged.<eos> Well, do you know what I wish?<eos> I wish you'd never left her for me.<eos> I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.
Kevin Garvey Jr. Reporting.<eos> No.<eos> God.<eos> God.<eos> Buddy, I know you're my totem, but I got some bad news for you.
Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book.<eos> It's Matt's.<eos> - But it's about you. - Uh-huh.
I think that you projected Evie onto a stranger.<eos> And I think you chose Evie because... you understood why she did what she did.<eos> Why she left her family.<eos> Why she escaped.<eos> I think a part of you wants to escape, Kevin.
Are you afraid you're gonna give that one away, too?<eos> You can't have a kid, because then you'd have no excuse.<eos> You couldn't be a victim anymore.<eos> You'd have to be okay.<eos> No one would feel sorry for you.
But he fights it.<eos> He survives, and now he has a choice to make.<eos> Does he decide that he was punished, or that he was rewarded?<eos> Matt and your son are writing a gospel about me.<eos> I shot you in the chest, and you got up.
- Yes.<eos> But with all due respect, I'm not sure you entirely grasp what's happening here.<eos> Okay, uh, three years ago, my ex-husband experienced severe delusions and tried to kill himself.<eos> And instead of acknowledging his mental illness, you turned it into fucking scripture.<eos> And when he found out about it, he relapsed and ran halfway around the world, probably to get the fuck away from you.
Y-yeah, she's not picking up the phone either.<eos> But why would you know that?<eos> Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?<eos> Well, it must seem reasonable to you since you're trying to get on it.
Right.<eos> Then let's get on the plane and work this out like civilized adults.<eos> When we find Kevin, you don't speak to him, okay?<eos> I will talk to him.<eos> He didn't call you.
She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.
Which husband?<eos> I heard you were with the good Reverend Jamison.<eos> He coming, too?<eos> No.<eos> He gave me something for you, though.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> Laurie: I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.
I wanna go home.<eos> Do you?<eos> What?<eos> It's just that you've been known to say that before, and yet you keep leaving home and coming here.<eos> I'm sensing a lot of internal contradictions from you, Kevin.
I don't know.<eos> Why would you?<eos> - I wouldn't!<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> Knowing full well what is inside of you, you kept moving forward towards this very room and the one person powerful enough to take it out.
And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.<eos> And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?
Of course I did.<eos> But so much time had passed.<eos> It was too late.<eos> And I knew that if I told you what happened... that you would never believe me.<eos> I believe you.
That's why the first thing she asked for the moment those gates closed behind her was Max.<eos> That's how valuable she could be to us.<eos> And you wanna trade that away for 20 men?<eos> Those 20 men are your brothers.<eos> Those men's lives mean as much to me as they do to you.
You told me once that the people he holds closest are the most at risk of being consumed by him.<eos> And he and I have discussed it at length.<eos> So, I thank you for your concern.<eos> But I'm going to be just fine.<eos> And I'm not talking about you.
Before Blackbeard decided he could do better than me.<eos> Is there a point you're trying to make?<eos> You're counseling Long John Silver to be reasonable.<eos> To do what you want him to do instead of what he wants to do.<eos> Just wondering how long you think he'll suffer it... before he decides he can do better than you.
I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.<eos> And to be honest, I was undecided about whether to go through with this deal at all.<eos> Sure..<eos> I get my men back in exchange for you.
Where are you going?<eos> I have a siege to manage, for which I'm going to need Billy's help.<eos> Wait!<eos> Billy was your friend.<eos> This is not easy for me, but I know it is harder for you.
I haven't.<eos> If this goes away,<eos> Flint's war, if it all ended and we had to walk away from it...<eos> Walk away?<eos> ... would I be enough for you?
A rational man to lead Nassau.<eos> That's the first in recent memory.<eos> And one that they'd allow to lead them into a rational future...<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with reason, and you know it.<eos> You want them following me only to the extent that I, in turn, will follow you.
That you wouldn't use your men to force a scenario by which he ends up dead?<eos> I'm not gonna stand by and watch while all our futures are destroyed.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps it's worth focusing on how hard I'm working to persuade you not to make that decision.<eos> I would far, far rather do this with you than against you.
All those men out there that you and I have fought alongside.<eos> I can't believe I'm the only one who knows this isn't right.<eos> You built all of this.<eos> The resistance.<eos> It wouldn't have worked without you.
What do you see out there?<eos> I watched him defeat Edward Teach in battle... outnumbered... and through sheer force of will.<eos> I saw his bloodlust with my own eyes.<eos> That man will never surrender his position here.<eos> He will never allow himself to be defeated by you or I.
But the sticker says "Sign here." It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.<eos> -He kidnapped me.<eos> -I said, "Or whatever."<eos> But now he wants something from you, right?
It's holding you back.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No, that's not what's happening here.<eos> 'Cause it's different than it used to be.<eos> Not everything's about you, dear.
Rebecca, what the hell's going on?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> - Keith, listen to me.<eos> - No, let me out of here, now!<eos> I can't do that. Not until I know if I can trust you.
What's wrong?<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?<eos> What they said about you with those other students?
I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.<eos> Did Drew believe it?<eos> I knew you were lying to me.<eos> He was the one you were texting? !<eos> I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you.
So, Jerome's staying here to look after Nicole, all right?<eos> Since when you need my permission?<eos> Aisha, look, this business ain't never been easy, all right?<eos> But it's never been this hard neither.<eos> If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.
I think they'd appreciate my loyalty.<eos> Oh, let me take this, it's Rebecca.<eos> Ask her what she thinks.<eos> I will.<eos> Everyone's been asking after you, darling.
But I can't find it.<eos> That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.<eos> But, look, if we go into the system directly and I.D. the cell tower that handled the call...<eos> See?<eos> So, um, what's going on with you and Locke?
Check your inbox.<eos> What, you already went through them?<eos> Yeah. I tweaked some parameters, so you're good to go.<eos> Can thank me later.<eos> I know you think Mullins is looking to get rid of you.
- John, stop it.<eos> - Information from my friend...<eos> Think about what you're doing, now.<eos> - Don't you realize... - at the NSA, to see if CTU...<eos> I did it for you.
You wanted to see me?<eos> I know you helped Carter access the ONIX schematics.<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Only because you're good at what you do. Which means I can't fire you for cause. Yet.<eos> But I don't trust you.
But you're losing them.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> You'll end up making them do something they'd never think of doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> If you keep going like this, they're gonna turn on you. What? Did somebody say something?
So, what, he's waiting for you now?<eos> He's not quite finished yet. Right.<eos> So, look, why don't you stay here, let me make it up to you. At least till your man's done saving the world.<eos> You see how things are.<eos> I need you.
An operation Eric Carter is running has turned up a promising lead.<eos> We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help.<eos> CTU is launching an operation.<eos> Keith's asked if I'll oversee it with him.<eos> I don't know if it's you that can't do without this place, or them who can't do without you.
It's not an option.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of your brother anymore, you've done more than enough for him.<eos> He'll just have to understand.<eos> Harris.<eos> I need you here.
Is that what it would take to get you to stay, hmm?<eos> This is the only thing I know how to do.<eos> You don't know what you can do until you try.<eos> You're smart, Isaac.<eos> You know, I got faith in you.
- Back up, Andy.<eos> I said grab the car. You got three seconds.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You left CTU with your laptop and your development kit in the middle of a terrorist event.<eos> That's not normal behavior. Even for you.
It has the data recovery programs on it.<eos> You're going to walk my friend through every program you have on this laptop.<eos> You understand?<eos> Isaac, we have to go back. Try to help Eric.<eos> Eric told me to take care of you, so that's what I'm doing.
We're close.<eos> We're almost done with his medical screens.<eos> How far away is your husband?<eos> Minutes.<eos> I've been able to learn about you.
You knew the people to call.<eos> 'Cause you've done this before, haven't you?<eos> Another day at the office.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you, and I don't even know who you are anymore.
Okay.<eos> Give him another dose.<eos> I see that you were able to organize this really quick.<eos> It's not like that, John.<eos> I look at you, and I don't even know who you are anymore.

All right, well, we'll break down here.<eos> It'll be like we were never here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> I hope things work out between you and John.
He's just gonna keep asking you a few more questions, okay?<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Hi, Jennifer.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Look, I'm so sorry I couldn't wait for you.
But that was a lie, wasn't it?<eos> Baby, you're not happy.<eos> Nicole...<eos> You need this.<eos> You always will.
Director Mullins.<eos> Okay, go see Mr. Hammad.<eos> Hello, Ara.<eos> I'm Mr. Hammad.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you until your mother arrives.
They're all dead because of me.<eos> One little lie led to a bigger lie and a bigger lie and...<eos> I trapped myself in all these lies.<eos> But there is one thing that's true now as it ever was.<eos> This country needs you.
But I thought it would cheer them up, the little Gloomy Guses.<eos> I had my star reporter write an article for the front page so that everyone will know your home was destroyed and you're orphans now.<eos> The front page!<eos> Some people wait a lifetime for that.<eos> And darling, look... you're mentioned, too!
That he's alive at the end of whatever happens.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Flint.<eos> You've cast your lot with him.<eos> What does it matter to you?
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
"Lied to Anne to her face about it.<eos> "Please, Jack.<eos> Beg of you.<eos> "Is there any way you can forgive me?"<eos> That was the general sense I had of what I might hear come from your mouth were I ever this close to you again. Spain is here.
And we will be your partners... in the fight to free it?<eos> Yes.<eos> For how long?<eos> How long?<eos> I'm told you removed the one who governed the pirates before you.
And I do not wish to lie to you ever again.<eos> Leave.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to stay with you.<eos> I want to take care of you.
We have to assume the Spanish have men all across the island by now.<eos> Every hour we sit here is an hour closer to being sighted by them... if we haven't been sighted already.<eos> She saw Anne?<eos> We'll give them another hour, then we'll set sail.<eos> Seems a fair amount of resentment towards you these days.
And now you would start another... that no man can hope to finish?<eos> Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it, with or without you.
She listened.<eos> She told me she ain't got no apology... for what she'd done.<eos> I know.<eos> Part of me wanted to lash out.<eos> Betrayed you.
I just can't.<eos> It has to mean... something.<eos> When I was drowning over Miranda... you helped me find my way out.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I will do the same for you.
She's alive.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.<eos> My daughter... is everything to me, as I believe she is to you.
And as far as he and I go, it's not as if he wouldn't do the same to me were the roles reversed.<eos> Jack, how are you gonna do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll have to find him, get through the army of maroons he calls allies, get through Long John Silver, and the animal whose leash he now holds.<eos> And somehow escape it all alive... all without you.
And we will find her and we will bring her home.<eos> You're confident in his plan maybe because it's a good plan.<eos> But maybe you'll have to show him that you're prepared for the failure and that a treasure he wanted left in the ground... ain't in the ground no more.<eos> Seemed only fair that I remind you... that our fates are now linked.<eos> If this plan to secure the cache ends badly for me, you can be certain it will end badly for you.
Well outside any established trade route.<eos> It's been used from time to time for transactions neither party... wished would ever be acknowledged.<eos> Of course I love her.<eos> I let you try it your way!<eos> I did trust you.
There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.<eos> I wanted to ask them.<eos> Had the money.<eos> But Max refused.<eos> I couldn't tell then if it was... because she was afraid of you.
Can't you see it?<eos> After I just climbed that fucking hill, are you being serious right now?<eos> In a few weeks time, I will lead a pirate fleet of unprecedented strength over that horizon into a battle of unprecedented importance.<eos> With a little luck, that battle will end with us taking Nassau and beginning a revolution.<eos> I cannot do it without you.

How exactly is one supposed to watch two points in space at the same time?<eos> Practice.<eos> All warfare is the same.<eos> Two questions are of paramount importance... who was my opponent yesterday, and who is he today?<eos> Answer those two questions, and there is very little he can... hide from you.
But she'll keep on calling you.<eos> And when she does, you'll step into that painting and feel the swell beneath your feet.<eos> It'll all come back as if it were like yesterday.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I've watched you and yours handle the account since I and mine left it. Accomplish things that no one I ever sailed with could dream of.
I know you cannot see why this must be.<eos> But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.
I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?<eos> Good.<eos> Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.
I'm sure when he hears you have escaped, he's going to piss himself.<eos> I have met strong women before.<eos> But... none of them were like you.<eos> Soo-Jin said you have a heart as soft as a baby bird.<eos> It was what made me like you the moment we met.
Two of our favorite writers and I'm stuck on a boat.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, the video of our recording has already hit over a million views.<eos> The TV station has never seen anything like it.<eos> So, my boss, Kobi Kihara, was wondering if we could do a follow-up story on you.
- No.<eos> - I will only slow you down.<eos> Besides, what else can they do to me?<eos> I'm serving life.<eos> I need you.
I don't want to waste any more time listening to your excuses.<eos> Fuck.<eos> That's it!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm done with you, I am done with them.
- I have the blockers.<eos> - Yeah. You won't need them.<eos> This isn't a trick, Will.<eos> That game's over for me.<eos> Thanks to you, I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
I've been through it a million times with the lawyers.<eos> Really. I mean, these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances.<eos> - But...<eos> - What matters is that we ship on time, Kala.<eos> Our clients are depending on us, as I am depending on you.
- Holy shit.<eos> - Shh! Be cool.<eos> Hello, Nomi Marks.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> We've had our eyes on you.
I never redacted anyone before.<eos> What was that?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> I alarmed the police reports on you and... Jesus.
And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.<eos> I wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Tonight, I want everyone in this room to know... that I see you.<eos> I believe in you.
I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.<eos> He's a serious and very intelligent man.<eos> Why wouldn't you meet with him?<eos> Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.
Why wouldn't you meet with him?<eos> Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.<eos> I was at the protest. I saw the look on their faces.<eos> They trusted you, Capheus.
Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.<eos> I was at the protest. I saw the look on their faces.<eos> They trusted you, Capheus.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity.
But be careful, Van Damn, people are noticing.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Hello, Mom.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there.
Where did you get those?<eos> Train station.<eos> Thought we could use them to cover the windows.<eos> Confuse anyone dropping in.<eos> Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?
Just the things that matter.<eos> These are the last year reports from the controller general.<eos> Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> About last night... I... needed you and you were there for me.
Fuchs doesn't see what you are. He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.<eos> You are just like me.<eos> You're in luck...<eos> Was he right about you?
Lila, why are you still talking to him?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.<eos> Be smart.<eos> - How long has he been after you?
But the funny thing is, I think I'm looking after her, and she thinks she's looking after me.<eos> But who's to know who's right, eh?<eos> This is where the dads said it should be.<eos> I really love your dads.<eos> Just the fact that they all wanted to take care of you and be a part of your life.
You mean besides your amazing girlfriend?<eos> Who's been beyond amazing.<eos> Like, approaching saint status.<eos> I would look good as a statue. I'm serious.<eos> I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.
Stop it.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Don't be a child, Daniela.<eos> Don't treat me like one.<eos> Everything I built in this world, I built for you.
Like why he just disappeared for over a fucking year without explaining shit to his best fucking friend.<eos> D, I'm sorry.<eos> He's very sorry.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You know what? I don't know why I'm complaining to you.
Listen, D, I'm sorry.<eos> You can't just apologize for something like this, man.<eos> Will you please just let me try to explain, okay?<eos> All I'm asking for is two minutes.<eos> I don't have two minutes for you.
I forbid it!<eos> - Mama, I thought we were discussing it.<eos> - There's nothing to discuss.<eos> Politics turns people into fools and fools into thugs.<eos> Politics killed your father and it's going to kill you.
But I lost and made you sad.<eos> I'm not sad, Sun.<eos> Then why are you crying?<eos> Mothers worry for their daughters.<eos> I'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches.
Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.<eos> This agency no longer represents you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, it has nothing to do with me.<eos> I mean, I even fought for you.
It was almost a year ago you kissed me right here.<eos> I know I've been acting... crazy lately.<eos> I don't mean to be. - I know.<eos> - It's just...<eos> I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.
I know I've been acting... crazy lately.<eos> I don't mean to be. - I know.<eos> - It's just...<eos> I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.<eos> I promise I will come back to you.
No.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> In five minutes, I send in Diego.<eos> I needed to know how far you would go.<eos> I needed to know if I could trust you.
- Mandiba doesn't care.<eos> He's on trial for corruption.<eos> This is small potatoes.<eos> But what it demonstrates is his desperation.<eos> He's afraid of you.
I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you.
Yeah.<eos> You will be fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> So will you.<eos> Ah, look at you.
Why do you think she would be listed as a missing person?<eos> We know she was scared.<eos> We know she went through a lot of trouble to meet with you.<eos> - Which means that...<eos> - Whoever's after you is probably after her.
I need your advice.<eos> I know you know what's going on, how delicate the situation is.<eos> - It's not my business.<eos> - No.<eos> And I appreciate that about you, but... this is about Lila, and the way she talks about you.
Someone is listening to all the noise you make.<eos> - You and your lady should be careful.<eos> - Is this is a warning?<eos> Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.
Bossman don't do no warnings, Van Damn.<eos> He just comes for you.<eos> I could get offed just for talking to you.<eos> Why are you talking to me then?<eos> 'Cause I still like you, Van Damn.
Okay.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> I know you're a little old-fashioned, Wolfgang.<eos> Some part of you thinks it should be the man who proposes to the woman, but... from the first moment our eyes touched, I could feel our fates were connected.
So, Tom... treat my sister well, because if you don't... - I swear I... - ...will find you.<eos> To Teagan.<eos> The best sister anyone could hope for.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I wish you and Tom all the best.
When you say "not good," usually means stuff's going to start blowing up and people will start dying.<eos> Maybe it's time for me to leave this town.<eos> India plan.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is everything all right between you and Rajan?
See you.<eos> If you do become president, will you stop driving the Van Damn?<eos> Never.<eos> Come.<eos> What can I do for you, Van Damn?
Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?<eos> You know I'm deeply indebted.<eos> And you know my daughter cares very much about you.
Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...<eos> No, I'm gonna make you do it, because it's so freaking perfect.<eos> It's you and Hernando. It...<eos> - It's meant for you.
Go ahead.<eos> Take his side.<eos> Even when he destroys your wedding.<eos> Please, don't make it any worse.<eos> Go with these men and we'll see if anything can be done for you later.
Lito, you're crying snot.<eos> Okay, it's brilliant.<eos> It is.<eos> It is. It so is.<eos> It's perfect for you.
Oh, yeah. Javier's amazing.<eos> You see?<eos> Even the love of my life thinks there are better choices.<eos> No.<eos> It is meant for you.
I can hear your voice, I can see you as Jordi Gallo.<eos> All we have to do is get you in the room with these people, and they will see it, too.<eos> Dani, please, stop torturing me.<eos> I'm not torturing you.<eos> I believe in you.
Where are you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - I'm okay, Dad.<eos> - You're not okay!<eos> There are government agents saying all kinds of fucked up shit about you.
Who... who the hell is this?<eos> Who are we?<eos> Justice, motherfucker.<eos> - And we're...<eos> - coming for you.
I will send him a thank-you note.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Kala, just listen.<eos> I need you to do something for me, and I know this will be difficult because I need you to do it without asking a lot of questions, which I'm telling you right now that I cannot answer.<eos> I have not told you about lots of things that are going on because I have been trying to protect you... and maybe, selfishly, our marriage.
Interesting.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is that interesting?<eos> Because both of the men in your life are connected to criminals.<eos> What does that say about you?
Because of Lila?<eos> I was surprised you came to the restaurant.<eos> Surprised?<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe everything would be easier for you if I wasn't...
Terrible news.<eos> How sad to let your father die alone like that.<eos> Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.
How sad to let your father die alone like that.<eos> Just stay the fuck away from me.<eos> Or what?<eos> I know things were difficult between you and your father.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you didn't go to your father because, in the end, he wasn't that important to you.
Come here, I want you to meet our Jordi.<eos> This is Marc Jacobs, he's our designer.<eos> And Charlie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kit told us all about you.
Looks good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're looking very good, too.<eos> It isn't really me, either.<eos> Hey, man, look at you.
Don't do this, please!<eos> We have to get you out of here!<eos> Wait!<eos> What about my family?<eos> Your family is safer without you.
He's got a knife!<eos> Will.<eos> Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.
Will.<eos> Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.<eos> I need you.
Will. that was not good.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you feel lost, but... right now, we need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Capheus needs you.
What happened?<eos> I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> What you said on that stage was good for people to hear.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> I want to grow up so I can vote for you.
When I get back, be gone.<eos> Case is terminated.<eos> Come work for Bach's firm on my account.<eos> I didn't hear "no."<eos> I am so sorry to have doubted you.
First, I apologized.<eos> But if it takes me sending you flowers every day, Joe DiMaggio style, to prove it, I will.<eos> He did that after Marilyn was dead.<eos> Yours would have the same effect on me that his had on her.<eos> But I need you back at Axe Capital.
He did that after Marilyn was dead.<eos> Yours would have the same effect on me that his had on her.<eos> But I need you back at Axe Capital.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Look, there are decisions I have to make over actions that I might take, and I have never had to do it without you.
You've got free protection at $40. The maximum downside is protected.<eos> But now you can be patient, and you don't have to lean on the stock.<eos> You're right.<eos> That'll save us ten million on this trade.<eos> This is why I need to keep you when your internship's over. Yes.
You're right.<eos> That'll save us ten million on this trade.<eos> This is why I need to keep you when your internship's over. Yes.<eos> I'd believe the same thing were I you.<eos> I ordered you lunch.
Different years. Detective.<eos> Long before you became a banker or a trustee or whatever, Raul.<eos> Still more police than banker.<eos> - Good to see you. - Yeah.<eos> I had good come-back about you from the school.
And I'm not gonna let you ruin one of the first free nights I've had in years.<eos> I always knew I'd end up snared by Axelrod's money. It's poison.<eos> And you don't even need to ingest it for it to kill you.<eos> - Proximity is enough.<eos> - Well, good for you.
Likes to run his new prospects out under the lights, get them used to it.<eos> He's a good driver.<eos> But his father... His father was the best there was.<eos> True master. Hall of Fame. Always finished top three.<eos> But to you, top three is never enough.
Do you want to live?<eos> Tell us what we want.<eos> Tell us what we want to hear.<eos> You're no martyr, are you?<eos> Look at you.
Good news.<eos> He's gone.<eos> It's like the second home run.<eos> - I'm filthy dirty.<eos> - That's what I love about you.
Quite as usual?<eos> Kinda what you'd be expecting when you work in a bookstore.<eos> - And how's your job, Paul?<eos> - Fine. Took a couple of days off until we're all settled in.<eos> I'm sure they will survive without you.
Great you could come all the way down here to see us.<eos> Must you be leaving so soon?<eos> Come on, guys, really?<eos> Please...<eos> Look, I've got the guest room almost ready for you.
You seem stressed.<eos> No, no, everything's fine.<eos> - Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.
No, no, everything's fine.<eos> - Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.
- Mostly, I mean.<eos> - Mostly?<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.<eos> We need you, Paul.
- What is this?<eos> - It's a necklace.<eos> It's used to ward off evil.<eos> For protection.<eos> Will it protect me against you?
Yes, I will go change.<eos> Uh, okay, he's acting fucking weird.<eos> He's trying to be on best behavior.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> We're changing our plans for you.
- Our table?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Right this way.<eos> I forgot how good food tastes.<eos> Well, now that we've got a home, I'll be able to cook you genuine, home cooked meals.
Specially in death.<eos> Just think, maybe Maggie black is its slave for all eternity.<eos> You had me going there for a second.<eos> I actually thought you knew Maggie was dead and walled up in our basement or something.<eos> Yeah, it's very "Edgar Allan poe" of you.
I'm sure I'll have very pleasant dreams tonight after that story.<eos> It'll be a nice tale to tell our children.<eos> Right.<eos> "Hey kids, the gateway to hell is in our basement, so go get some sleep."<eos> All right, I got some extra towels for you here, temperature should be okay, but, if you need some blankets or something, they're in the closet.
Can I help you with something, Paul?<eos> Actually you can.<eos> And I think I might be able to help you, as well.<eos> You see, her loss is your gain.<eos> Wow. Now I see what Jenny sees in you.
The door's that way, elephant man.<eos> Maybe I won't mention this incredible lack of judgment to Jenny.<eos> You know, for someone who's so into demons and devils, I'm surprised you never considered how it would feel.<eos> How would what feel?<eos> For him to get into you.
I just came to fix the...<eos> Washing machine.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Wha... hi. Look, it's not that I don't appreciate the offer, but... -mm hmm.<eos> I need you inside of me.
What re you hiding down here?<eos> Is it like a torture dungeon?<eos> - Close. Very close.<eos> - Did you guys get a sex wing?<eos> After you.
You've been on another planet for days now.<eos> It's Devon.<eos> What'd she do?<eos> I'm not sure even I want to know all the details, but it's not good.<eos> Could it blow back on you?
You remember your home inspection being so scary?<eos> I don't.<eos> Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.<eos> "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.<eos> I'm really happy for you, Devon."
I don't.<eos> Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.<eos> "So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.<eos> I'm really happy for you, Devon."<eos> I am happy for you.
Did you do this?<eos> No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> Please.<eos> For you.
Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.<eos> Hey, Daya, we need you again.
- Hey buddy.<eos> Watch his hand.<eos> Get him!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - David, I need you here.
Rory?<eos> Rory, stop, stop!<eos> Rory?<eos> You're out of fuel.<eos> It's behind you!
I dont wanna go back down there living with those motherfuckers.<eos> I need you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.<eos> I trust you.
I know I haven't been in the position all that long, but...<eos> I also know that students at this school have seen and been through things that don't exactly come with easy explanation.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> I take this very seriously, Mason.<eos> Anything we talk about in here stays between you and me.
But that's... well, that's because you're honest about what you love.<eos> And underneath it all, that's... inspiring.<eos> And I'm sorry too.<eos> Not about the sex, I don't even really remember it.<eos> Mostly my part in fucking up something that was good for you.
And I knew it crippled me when I needed to be strong.<eos> As you do now.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't care for people, as a rule.<eos> I like you.
It's a long time to be off the job.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But the doctor cleared me for return, so...<eos> I'm not talking about your arm, John. Put in your twenty. More pension.<eos> If I was you, I'd hang it up.
I'm not gonna fall! Bethie! Now!<eos> Thank you, Casey!<eos> I have this!<eos> Now! Jesus! What am I, five?<eos> Hey. Last piece? Saved it just for you.
Hello? Fritz Haaber?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> It is you.<eos> I don't know if you remember me, Lou Ellen Drought?<eos> I was a few years behind you in High School.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I have some gifts for you.
If you're joining us now, we are less than a minute away from entering a new future.<eos> This is really big for me.<eos> I want it to be good for you guys too, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm proud of you.
Unmute.<eos> The disappearance is the latest in a line of recent reports of vehicles gone missing.<eos> A bizarre pattern which seems to be linked to abnormal weather behaviors surrounding the sites, according to some experts.<eos> Some skeptics believe the events are linked to the Alterplex energy tower launched last week.<eos> - He wanted to wait up for you.
You've been so good to us, and you don't owe us anything... - Mia...<eos> - ...and I think maybe it's time that...<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that's so important to you.
You and Donny deserve way better.<eos> Please, I didn't mean for this to become a big thing.<eos> Mia, it's a huge deal.<eos> You're my sister.<eos> I promised to look after you. And I...
Maybe even change the world.<eos> And I thought maybe I could help you... and your mom, too.<eos> That's a big responsibility.<eos> Maybe the biggest responsibility of my life.<eos> I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way of something that's so important to you.
I've been so selfish.<eos> You've been so good to us, and you don't owe us anything.<eos> And I think maybe it's time...<eos> If he misses home, we'll go back on a trip.<eos> You're my sister and I promised to look after you.
Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone, everything that could distract me from you.
I just came by to check on you.<eos> Is it a bad time?<eos> Mm. Never mind. It's just an expression.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I brought these for you.
- Really.<eos> It's just... that's actually not why I... why I came.<eos> I wanted to show you something.<eos> Go on. Take a look.<eos> I have a business proposition for you.
No. I came to see you.<eos> This double date...<eos> I just came by to see... what kind of a man you are.<eos> I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.
I am you.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel... think what you think.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.
I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.<eos> - Recently...<eos> - There are moments...<eos> - ... I dreamed I was inside you.
- Recently...<eos> - There are moments...<eos> - ... I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - When I want to stop being me...<eos> - I could feel inside you.
Are you backing out?<eos> No, I'll do it.<eos> Undress.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I love you.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Why, what was it?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Hey, I didn't look!<eos> Before you took it, was anyone else looking at it?
I'm the father-in-law.<eos> - I mean, the father.<eos> - Don't listen to him.<eos> - I'll take those.<eos> - No, they're not for you.
Then you can pay for it.<eos> Tomorrow you start looking for a weekend job.<eos> Is that what you care about?<eos> Have you nothing to tell me?<eos> To tell you?
No, I'm not sleepy.<eos> - Is anything wrong?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm going to finish this.<eos> I'll wait for you in bed.
Let's go and live together.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Running away. Far from this fucking city.<eos> Right now, just the way we are.<eos> I don't believe you!
My turn.<eos> There's a room full of paintings with people who seem to look at you as if you'd killed someone.<eos> Behind it is the secret door into the bedrooms.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I really like you.

- There are moments, - when I want to stop being me...<eos> - I dreamed I was inside you.<eos> - ...so I can be you.<eos> - Recently...<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.
- I'd like to...<eos> - Think what you think.<eos> I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.<eos> I want to suck every part of your body.<eos> Nothing about you disgusts me.

It's just us.<eos> Senator Wilkes didn't die of a heart attack.<eos> He was poisoned. And those same people, they are coming after me.<eos> What people?<eos> Five more seconds and I'm leaving with or without you.
She's getting in the car.<eos> Wilkes was assassinated because of some intelligence that I shared with him.<eos> Wait, you went round Langley and straight to the Senate Intelligence Committee?<eos> I didn't know who to trust.<eos> Tell me I can trust you, Christina.
- We're losing, Christina.<eos> Greed and corruption are taking over in this country and we are becoming our own worst ene...<eos> Get the shooter!<eos> My god.<eos> I got you.
Wait...<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> You know how hard I bust my ass, by myself, to send you to that school so that you can have more opportunities than I did.<eos> Then you... you pull this crap?<eos> I can't even look at you right now.
Someone... someone in your bed.<eos> You know, since Victor's gone, I don't sleep.<eos> Because he used to spoon me to sleep.<eos> So, yeah, Mom... I miss the good stuff.<eos> Sometimes you just need somebody to give you a hug and say, "I got you."
Sometimes you just need somebody to give you a hug and say, "I got you."<eos> I meant a man.<eos> I am very strong.<eos> I've been doing my yoga.<eos> I got you.
That is so great!<eos> We'll... we'll do the whole thing.<eos> The ceremony, the stupid waltz.<eos> We're gonna show them what single mothers can pull off.<eos> I will dress like a child bride for you, Mom.
I just...<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, uh...<eos> I know this is very much about you, but can I just say... I'm just, like... vibrating with this news.
- Okay, look.<eos> I am obviously sorry for the...<eos> Holy shit.<eos> That's Michael Landon.<eos> I know that's not significant for you, but for me, that's so fucking crazy that I'm seeing Michael Landon right now.
- Who?<eos> - Michael Landon.<eos> I don't think I'm in the right headspace for this, so I'm gonna get outta here.<eos> Come on. I wanted to have fun tonight.<eos> I know and I love that about you, Chris.
Back, I'm talking, way, way back, when Jim was just a skinny kid and Laura wasn't such a bitch.<eos> Does anybody remember salespeople?<eos> How about waitresses?<eos> You know, little blondes in aprons about this big.<eos> Jim, how many people have you got working for you?
You can't turn me in.<eos> It would have been better to kill me out on the road.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have taken a chance on you.
What's this?<eos> It's called paper.<eos> Look at it later.<eos> Just wanted you to know that I really appreciate having both of you as my competition and I wish you guys both the best.<eos> Thanks, Minerva, wish you the best, too.
No!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Motherfucking cheap ass, terrorist ass...<eos> Killing your own people ass, goddamn.<eos> I don't like you.
This is a very difficult time for my family, as you can see.<eos> A little respect for that right now would be much appreciated.<eos> - Bryan, what tipped you off?<eos> Have you eaten anything, Bry?<eos> I fixed you something.
I don't buy it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What she's saying is, she doesn't believe it's possible for you to say nothing forever.<eos> State police are one thing.<eos> But the type of people we believe are gonna be coming at you next?
Didn't she just tell you it'd be impossible for you to say nothing forever?<eos> Are you cops?<eos> Please.<eos> In case you hadn't figured it out already, your life is in our hands now.<eos> So if I were you, I'd start trying to live in the moment.
DEA agent Mike Hall.<eos> - You there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're coming at me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too, if they're not already.
- You there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're coming at me.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come for you, too, if they're not already.<eos> - Whoa... who's... who's coming at you?
Give me the 22 blade.<eos> Your son died holding a gun to the head of a DEA agent.<eos> My sister died defenseless.<eos> And innocent.<eos> So what kind of a man, I wonder, does that make you?
You confessed.<eos> The evidence...<eos> Should be reexamined.<eos> I did not kill him.<eos> I believe you.
I pray to thee, Mother..<eos> "O Sahibaan.."<eos> "O Sahibaan, I got wounded due to the separation."<eos> "O Sahibaan, my heart has become a rebel."<eos> "Stubbornness has crossed all limits." "My tongue chants your name non-stop. Without you.."
"O Sahibaan.."<eos> "O Sahibaan, I got wounded due to the separation."<eos> "O Sahibaan, my heart has become a rebel."<eos> "Stubbornness has crossed all limits."

Come on, relax. She won't hurt you.<eos> Calm down. Come on. Nothing will happen.<eos> Nothing will happen.<eos> She dresses a little scantily, but the girl is nice.<eos> She likes you.
Nothing will happen.<eos> She dresses a little scantily, but the girl is nice.<eos> She likes you.<eos> - What?<eos> - She likes you.
You have isolated volar distal ulna dislocation, which means all I need to do is...<eos> Aah!<eos> You did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> Okay, I have a red eye for you...
Grab some boxes.<eos> Get to it.<eos> Seeley Booth. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Get your broad shoulders over here.<eos> Hey, look at you.
Get to it.<eos> Seeley Booth. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Get your broad shoulders over here.<eos> Hey, look at you.<eos> Good morning to you, too, Caroline.
Erika's super pissed at you.<eos> You gotta get up and go to work, man.<eos> Who cares?<eos> That job sucks, anyway.<eos> No. Truman, I need you.
Stay away.<eos> You are... you are just toxic, and I'm honestly not surprised that this happened while you were here.<eos> - You think this is my fault?<eos> - I don't know if it's your fault.<eos> I just know that I feel this, like, agita, you know, when I'm around you.
- Me too!<eos> To Barbara's looming career as an inebriate clergy spouse.<eos> Oh!<eos> The lady of the house, if you would be so kind.<eos> Zelda, someone to see you.
- not Zsa Zsa Gabor.<eos> - Not many girls would say that.<eos> Well, you're not engaged to many girls.<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
He has an eye clinic appointment.<eos> He left ten minutes ago with his father.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, that's fine, then.<eos> Who do you reckon loves you most, Mickey?
And who do you reckon loves you next most?<eos> Me.<eos> I do.<eos> Your dad.<eos> And Granny Zelda loves you.
Me.<eos> I do.<eos> Your dad.<eos> And Granny Zelda loves you.<eos> The world's full of people who love you, cos you ain't even six yet.
But you're going to be seven next year, then eight, then nine, all the way up to numbers you ain't even done in school yet.<eos> And you're going to get called names.<eos> And you're going to get thumped.<eos> And you'll have to fight your corner.<eos> You'll have to fight for every bastard thing you've got, cos the only person who's ever really going to love you... .. is you.
He ain't got the brains to get himself in any bother.<eos> Your dad's playing a game, Mickey.<eos> It's like a pirate game.<eos> We're pretending he's gone away to sea, and he's put me in a prison.<eos> Listen, I want you to go and get some toys, and sit and play on the stairs.
She was unable to make her way to either.<eos> We will assess the situation here and see what we should do.<eos> Clinical room, straight away.<eos> You've looked after your mother very well, young man.<eos> Now, I think it's time someone looked after you.
I thought there was no other way.<eos> No other way to get away from Lester.<eos> - There's always another way... .. if you've someone to help you look for it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, you.
'No-one is ever as alone as they imagine.<eos> 'Trudy Watts spent some time in a hostel for women, 'and the help she received changed both her prospects and her fate.<eos> 'She was awarded custody of Mickey, and his baby sister, 'and rehoused in a council flat far from London, 'where there were green fields and skies that held a hint of blue.'<eos> Patrick.<eos> You gave me a note once, from you and someone else.
I don't wanna forget that I said that, so can you write that down, please?<eos> My brain's not friends with my hands right now.<eos> You wanna go outside?<eos> That usually feels good when you're tripping.<eos> I trust you entirely at this point.
- Randy.<eos> Don't run away.<eos> Help me. Pull me in.<eos> Yeah, I got this.<eos> - Bertie, I'm behind you.
Like that one who, like, died in the plane crash.<eos> Who's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I forget.<eos> I'm just saying, like... if I saw, like, an old movie and your face was in it, like, even if you were, like, in a crowd, like, way back in the background, I would, like, notice you and I would go, like...
Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens.<eos> So?<eos> Far as I know, there's no law against communing with nature.<eos> Well, unfortunately for you, there is a law against drugs.
And I wasn't talking about your eyebrow or your legs.<eos> Thank you, Daisy.<eos> I think it just, you know, took me a while to realize that my legs are merely a way for me to carry around what's in here.<eos> And, you know, what's in here.<eos> I'm happy for you.
The judge says that her reason for approving the appeal is to consider new osteological evidence.<eos> I have no evidence of the sort.<eos> I know you don't. But, you know, I have faith you're gonna find it.<eos> Booth, I can't embark on my research with the presumption of Zack's innocence.<eos> I have faith in you.
Oh, Bones, time to blow out the candles.<eos> Grandpa, you dropped this.<eos> Oh... oh, thank you.<eos> Okay, we're lit up and ready to roll.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

Yes, it is.<eos> Do you know how much that thing cost me?<eos> A lot.<eos> They're very expensive.<eos> But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story.
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.<eos> Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us.
Sure, I'll, um...<eos> You look good, son.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> I'll make this easy on you.
Oh, come on, man.<eos> Oh, cartoons upset me as a child.<eos> More of an Addams Family kid?<eos> Twilight Zone reruns, actually.<eos> Everything about you makes more sense now. Mm.
I figured if I waited here long enough, you'd show up.<eos> It's safe for us?<eos> Does this mean you've thought about things?<eos> That, uh, you're gonna help me?<eos> Not you.
I thought about how I grew up, seeing your face on the news, seeing Mom cry.<eos> I wouldn't wish that childhood on anyone.<eos> You know, I never would have left if I didn't think you could handle it... that you'd turn out to be such a good man.<eos> And I was right.<eos> I'm proud of you, James.
I'm proud of you, James.<eos> You're one of the only good things I've ever done in my life.<eos> You know, a friend of mine says that people can change.<eos> Maybe he's right.<eos> But I'm just not ready to believe in you.
I can barely get her away from HSM whenever it's on.<eos> Oh!<eos> No, no, no. Hey.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> No. Come on, Cam. I have so many more questions for you now.
That's the way Mike was.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> That was the killer's best shot.<eos> I'm not taking any chances, Cher.<eos> I'm putting you and your family into the highest level of safe house.
We're sending them to a safe house.<eos> I want you there.<eos> How am I gonna know if you're okay?<eos> You're tying my hands behind my back.<eos> Dad, I have never needed you more than I do now.
I am not waiting for Kovac to make the next move.<eos> What do you propose, then?<eos> I don't know. Bring him in on a parking ticket, a house code violation, a broken tail light if you have to.<eos> Just bring him in.<eos> If he gets a restraining order against you, you're off the case and there's nothing I can do.
Whatever implement was used squished its way into the tissue of the neck and made contact with the front of the vertebra.<eos> There's a substantial amount of muscle in the neck, so whatever implement was used must have been extremely strong.<eos> My guess is a pliable metal.<eos> But why would the murderer cover it in vegetable shortening?<eos> Hey, so, I got something really interesting for you.
I'm kidding.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Not just on the East Coast, I mean... here.<eos> I found out what happened with your dad, and I wanted to check on you.
When... When do you leave?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> But you're the lead on the case.<eos> You're about to bury your dad.<eos> I want to be here for you.
No, Bones, it's gonna be great 'cause it's coming from the heart, all right?<eos> Booth, about Sully...<eos> No, you don't have to explain yourself about Sully.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He's important to you.
Hold on, Zack, okay?<eos> This is a transfer, you understand that, correct?<eos> I never killed the lobbyist.<eos> I confessed because I assumed I would if I'd been instructed, but then last night I learned I'm not capable of killing.<eos> I believe you.
This is just a big misunderstanding, okay?<eos> I mean, maybe I hit Dustin, but if he's saying that I heisted a bank...<eos> No.<eos> Dustin isn't saying anything, Ray.<eos> I don't believe you.
The derby's gonna be starting soon.<eos> Why?<eos> The whole reason we're here is to solve a case, not to... pointlessly smash into cars.<eos> All right, look, my gut is telling me that we can still find this guy, that he's out here, all right?<eos> So Gordon Gordon says it's good for you, too. Booth.
It's obvious he really cared about what he was doing.<eos> I've never seen you get so emotional over a commercial before.<eos> Well, in this age of snark, I'm just thankful for someone with some good old-fashioned sincerity.<eos> Then I'll save the snark and get right to the point.<eos> Angela, I have a job for you.
Yes.<eos> I-I used to get some of my best work done after the lab had shut down for the night.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> There appears to be evidence of buckle fracturing on the angles of the right side ribs seven, eight and nine.<eos> I meant with you.
That sounds like a very violent way to kill someone.<eos> It speaks more to a crime of passion.<eos> I'll inform Aubrey.<eos> I know you're concerned about me, Angela, and I really am okay.<eos> Geez,I thought I was in early. Look at you.
Well, eventually you either give up or you fight back.<eos> I think maybe Ron decided to fight back.<eos> That's what got him killed.<eos> Good work, Aubrey.<eos> Look at you.
No, it doesn't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> But it does mean that you're gonna become a full-fledged Supervisory Special Agent.<eos> Come on, what? They're promoting me?<eos> Look, the L.A. field office has been enquiring about you, so I said to myself, what better way to show them that you're qualified to do this by...
Oh, look at me.<eos> I am. Then I will leave you to it.<eos> Oh, uh, thank you again for taking care of everything for Zack's hearing tomorrow.<eos> Dr. Hodgins and I have it covered.<eos> Besides, we have to get used to solving cases without you.

Whoa! My bad.<eos> My bad.<eos> Nothing like actual smoke to get that smoky flavor.<eos> Wow, that's not bad.<eos> Angela, we need you.
I was going to say sick.<eos> Oh, Brennan...<eos> Oh... are you-- are you pregnant?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
He said one of us is getting back to the White House.<eos> He's right. Me.<eos> I'm just saying marriage is a crazy idea.<eos> I don't know why anyone does it.<eos> Marriage is bad for you.
So, Elaine... get me the California Secretary of State on the phone.<eos> Conference in the head of the FEC and the FBI Director.<eos> And make sure that the entire campaign staff is aware that this race is far from over.<eos> Got that?<eos> Mellie needs you.
If you push Mellie too soon, you look callous.<eos> If you wait too long...<eos> Did you shoot Frankie Vargas? !<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe you.
Let's not pretend I'm a good person.<eos> Oh, Mellie, come on, I'm Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III.<eos> I was born with power.<eos> Me wanting power is like a drowning man wanting a bath.<eos> I'm supposed to choose... between you and Cyrus.
I mean...<eos> I mean...<eos> Wha...<eos> Did you even, like, buy me a ring?<eos> Well, that was the plan, and then this whole 833 tip-line voice-mail thing happened and kind of put a damper on things, so is it okay if I steal one for you once we're there?
Yes, I have.<eos> The game's over, Your Highness.<eos> The welcoming ceremony is about to begin.<eos> Well, I think we showed those guards who's boss.<eos> Now, what do you say we go make you an official princess?
But busy is good.<eos> I'm glad you think so, Raps, 'cause this welcoming ceremony is just the beginning.<eos> Tomorrow's the festival, followed by the royal banquet, and that's all before the actual coronation on Sunday.<eos> Oh, come on, really?<eos> Look, Rapunzel, I know this princess thing is new to you, but you've got to at least try to act the part.
Exactly.<eos> What you do when no one's looking is your business.<eos> The royal banquet is ready to receive the princess now.<eos> Cheer up, Raps.<eos> Hey, maybe your dad got someone to chew your food for you.
When that evil rears its ugly head it is my job to protect Corona from it.<eos> And one day, that will be your responsibility.<eos> And I must teach you how to carry it.<eos> But that is many, many years away.<eos> Until that burden is imposed on you, I'm asking that you trust me that I know how to keep danger as far away from you and this kingdom as is humanly possible.
And since when did she start keeping secrets from me?<eos> Hey, Fitzherbert, I need to get this done before the coronation, so do you mind throwing your pity party someplace else?<eos> Look, Cassandra, I know you don't like me for Rapunzel...<eos> Oh, that's not true.<eos> I don't like you for anyone.
- Honey... find a way to fill those pages.<eos> I only ask that you be safe, be smart, and above all... be true to yourself.<eos> Plus est en vous?<eos> Plus est en vous.<eos> It means, "There is more in you."
I mean, maybe Argent just doesn't wanna be found?<eos> Well, he...<eos> He would have his calendar on his laptop.<eos> If we crack the password...<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.
It's wolfsbane.<eos> Hello.<eos> Evenyoucan freeze solid, Deputy Parrish.<eos> Weshouldbe killingthem.<eos> I have nothing against you personally.
What the hell happened last night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get it,<eos> I freaked out.<eos> - Which freaked you out.
Burrows! How about you step out and pay us the hundred grand you owe us?<eos> Take that as a no.<eos> Lincoln Burrows... says no.<eos> Big tough guy... who made it out of the neighborhood.<eos> And look at you now...
Lincolny-linc.<eos> All huffin' and puffin'.<eos> Don't you look at me like I'm trash.<eos> I'm clear with the government, the D.O.C. and my God.<eos> Doesn't appear to be the same with you.
- I want to know what you been up to. - Sure, man. Yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want you to go wash up, okay?<eos> And then you can catch up with your uncle.<eos> He hasn't just mythologized you. He mythologizes Michael, too.
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.<eos> I'll find someone who does.<eos> See ya, Mikey.<eos> _<eos> I envy you.
He's not any browner than I am.<eos> Ah, but do you speak Arabic?<eos> No?<eos> I managed to pick up a little Arabic while I was serving in Iraq.<eos> Listen, man. There's gonna be a time when I'm gonna need you.
I knew I was being set up.<eos> Michael, he's with our son right now.<eos> Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons, looking for someone who could handle himself.<eos> What are you trying to tell me?<eos> It was ingrained in you, son.
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.<eos> How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
And if it's any solace, our son won't be one of them.<eos> While the cat's away, the mice will play.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I got your map.<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
You.<eos> It's a glorious thing indeed. Even if I don't have a damn clue how to deal with it.<eos> You and me both.<eos> I've got a way to get our son back, Sara.<eos> I've been planning to bring Jacob down ever since he forced me to turn my back on you and Mike.
Worst part is that this particular one dredged up the memory of your father.<eos> The truth is, Mikey, despite what you may want to believe, your father died seven years ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Michael Scofield.<eos> We were just talking about you.
Maybe tossed.<eos> You and your damn zoo, Scofield.<eos> I'm gonna find out once and for all what you were really doing there. What you were really planning.<eos> And then I'm gonna kill you.<eos> I know everything about you. Even your most mundane actions. Like the zoo.
I'm holding your hard drives in my hand. All your secret communications.<eos> Enough to send you away forever.<eos> Bravo, Michael. However you got in there, bravo.<eos> You sent me to the zoo so you could get into my office.<eos> But you and I both know your threat's a hollow one, because you know I've got something that's even more valuable to you: your son.
If I get arrested, those servers will be released, and everything you've done will be exposed.<eos> I'll find them. I'll destroy them.<eos> Like I said, I'm holding the cards.<eos> Didn't expect that.<eos> It's beneath you, Michael.
Up ahead, in the next bay.<eos> I'll take that call.<eos> We got him, Michael.<eos> We got our boy.<eos> Good news for you.
I'll take that call.<eos> We got him, Michael.<eos> We got our boy.<eos> Good news for you.<eos> But now you've got no reason to give me what I want. Which kind of makes it bad news for you.
- Hey, you all right?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Chase seems like a keeper.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> He spoke very highly of you.
Hey.<eos> Look, let me just start by saying...<eos> I get why you acted the way you did at the party.<eos> I'm sorry, but for what it's worth, that guy Chase...<eos> - The way he talked about you... - Yeah, but that's his problem.
Unbelievable.<eos> "Elizabeth... Viola."<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Okay, be safe.<eos> We love you. - Bye.
- He tried to tell me.<eos> Yeah, he did, so why didn't you just listen to him?<eos> I mean, you believed everything I said.<eos> Even the baby.<eos> - What does that say about you?
What did you do to her?<eos> I think it's better, just the two of us. Just like that weekend away.<eos> You, me, in bed together.<eos> Nobody else mattered in the whole world.<eos> You can't look at these photos and tell me that they mean nothing to you.
It's all right.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> She killed her.<eos> Tyler.<eos> I got something for you.
Liar.<eos> Please, don't do anything you're gonna regret.<eos> Now see, I was even gonna let you live.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> 'Cause it was just so obvious that Tyler loves me more than he loves you.
Look, you're going to be okay.<eos> All right?<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I got you.
Oh. Well, just trying to make sure everybody's stocked up so they'll stay in their home and out of the Quarter, at least for the next week, you know.<eos> Yeah, just until the, uh, Eurotrash vampires are done Eurotrashing the city.<eos> Well, it means a lot, you looking out for the covens.<eos> Hey, Casanova, uh, I may be going out on a limb here, but<eos> - she's into you.
_<eos> Do not do that again.<eos> - I'm not going without a fight.<eos> - Would you relax?<eos> I'm not here to fight you.
I need you. You're the last of your pack.<eos> That makes you special for reasons that are too complicated to explain.<eos> - I don't care about your problems.<eos> - You should. Because there are others who know how important you are.<eos> And they will come for you.
You think I don't know.<eos> The day after I bit Elijah he should have died.<eos> But his sire line is still out there.<eos> So I had Vincent cast a spell to figure out how that could be.<eos> It turns out the lines of your siblings are anchored to you.
To defeat him, you need me.<eos> You're offering me a deal?<eos> One you cannot dismiss.<eos> Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.<eos> Now they loathe you.
You have my word.<eos> Appreciate you coming on short notice.<eos> Marcel, just tell me what you need, man, because, um, I-I kind of got someplace I got to be.<eos> Whatever your plans are, I got to ask you to put 'em aside.<eos> - Tonight I need you here.
I should just kill him.<eos> After all, a wise man said,<eos> "One cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live."<eos> And what I've learned is, the best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.<eos> So, for you, a gift, the sword that you gave me, now laced with my venom.
While I remain here, my enemies will flock to New Orleans, causing all manner of mischief.<eos> One day, most likely as a result of some fool's effort to reach me, I will escape, and I will seek my own justice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a friend once, Cami.<eos> She, uh... she believed with all her heart that you had some good left in you.
You let me go.<eos> I gave you people what you wanted.<eos> I barely had enough to make the anti-venom.<eos> If any of my family are ever bitten again, we'll need more.<eos> Which means we'll need you alive.
That's good.<eos> There's something we need you to look into.<eos> First, tell me how my friends are.<eos> Did everyone make it?<eos> I'm here, thanks to you.
Are forbidden.<eos> I have to leave this place, John.<eos> So, what, you're gonna bail on me again?<eos> I didn't bail on you.<eos> I came back, took the damn chip because Jaha said he would take me to you.
It almost broke your mother to send you away.<eos> Killing Lexa in soulou gonplei was to be your triumphant return, but you lost.<eos> Our war chiefs don't respect you.<eos> Then I'll get new war chiefs.<eos> The army is loyal to them, not you.
She says it's not a good time for her to take this on. But she sends hugs.<eos> Now, you know me, I enjoy people, but your mother is selfish.<eos> Do you think we wanted to stay in the Valley?<eos> North Hollywood.<eos> But... with this and school for you and Kelly, only thing we can afford.
She's extremely bright and sensitive.<eos> She was never going to go into Chinese<eos> - or computers or what have you.<eos> - What?<eos> Is that what you think your dad wants for you?
Cigarette for dinner.<eos> - That's not gonna get you points.<eos> - Not in the mood.<eos> Okay.<eos> And who in hell made you house den mother?
- That's why you're so weird.<eos> That's why I'm... assertive.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Eat.<eos> I mean, I see you, and I just...
Come on, get it on you.<eos> Right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, a little bite... for me.<eos> - For you? - Mm-hmm.
Right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, a little bite... for me.<eos> - For you? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I didn't even like you until five minutes ago, so, like...
I just...<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I...<eos> I need to do my research.<eos> And you... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you.
- I...<eos> I need to do my research.<eos> And you... need to be touched by someone who actually cares about you.<eos> Luke...<eos> I'm falling in love with you.
Oh, okay.<eos> This rexie girl, who saw my stuff on Tumblr, liked the way I saw... so much, that when she slit her wrists, she left me the fucking note.<eos> And you know what her parents did?<eos> They sent me pictures... so I'd really know what I'd done.<eos> People say they love you... but what they mean is, they love how loving you makes them feel about themselves.

What, you think I didn't guess my knee was fucked?<eos> And now that I'm done doing the one thing that makes me feel, you're my next thing.<eos> I know that that's not a plan.<eos> It's not a good one, anyway.<eos> But I need you...
And...<eos> I just want you to know that... I accept it if...<eos> If death is what you want, I accept it now.<eos> I accept it, but um... I love you.<eos> I just... I can't keep fighting you.
Did it?<eos> Everybody thinks Quinn died by your hand, and Jacobee, too.<eos> Now you control three territories. You have the respect of your clippers, and all the other barons.<eos> And you made a believer out of me.<eos> I couldn't have done any of this without you.
Everyone here is free and equal.<eos> My dream is that one day, there will be no cog, clipper, doll, or baron.<eos> Only free women and men deciding the course of their own future.<eos> What happens if we don't buy into your big dream?<eos> You'd rather be a slave in a system that doesn't give a damn about you?
Have you been reporting on me this whole time?<eos> All of our conversations?<eos> She wanted to know about your progress.<eos> It's my job. I'm your Abbot.<eos> I trusted you, Ava.
We get in, we get out, we ask for forgiveness later.<eos> We cannot and will not dick this up.<eos> Special soldier!<eos> More of you come?<eos> Come for you?
Thank you.<eos> What do we got?<eos> A little Jose.<eos> Yeah, my middle name.<eos> There you go.
Now let's see what he says.<eos> And the new guy? What's his name?<eos> Chase?<eos> He's getting there.<eos> Well, he's lucky to have you.
They had a sales opening.<eos> If I work nights and weekends, it might be enough.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Nights and weekends?<eos> What about the kids?<eos> They need you here.
He does know I'm white?<eos> "Nazi."<eos> You know, you do atrocities like kill women and children.<eos> Is that what you think of me?<eos> No, I just don't think of you.
On your knees.<eos> Take a knee.<eos> Go down!<eos> On your knees!<eos> You keep this on you at all times.
Could you...?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, now do you believe me?<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> But yes, I believe you.
You got the trifecta working for you.<eos> Punch your ticket here a couple years, sell out, run for Congress?<eos> That's the plan, right? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you gonna vote for me?<eos> I'd vote for you if politics still mattered.
Punch your ticket here a couple years, sell out, run for Congress?<eos> That's the plan, right? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you gonna vote for me?<eos> I'd vote for you if politics still mattered.<eos> Hell, no, I ain't voting for you.
What?<eos> God must be laughing.<eos> I'm a SEAL, and my sperm can't even swim.<eos> Joseph...<eos> Joseph, this is not about you or God.
Put him in.<eos> You will not silence us.<eos> You will never silence us!<eos> Terry McAlwain, your company refuses to pay.<eos> All this money for oil and none for you.
Felix, it's not what you think it is.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It needs another nail.<eos> Mighty American SEAL.<eos> Well, look at you.
We got a man down behind the southwest building.<eos> Take the SAW.<eos> No hostages!<eos> Hang in there, Buck.<eos> We got you, buddy.
Dude, where are the Jell-O shots when you need them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> Did you bring a date to this?<eos> I mean, that is a new low... even for you.
- Thank you, Lena.<eos> Testing.<eos> I love you, Tammi.<eos> I do. I just...<eos> I don't know if I can trust you.
We never really got around to introducing each other.<eos> I'm Michael.<eos> That's Akmal, ex-Spetsnaz, and straight-up OG.<eos> So that's us.<eos> Why don't you tell us something about you?
Why don't you tell us something about you?<eos> No?<eos> You know, I remember you being this giant... helmet, goggles...<eos> this mythical monster.<eos> You get an idea about something in your head, thinking about it over and over, building it up, and then, well... now look at you.
Me, I killed three for, what, Chase, 20 bucks an hour?<eos> Well, given the travel time, we're looking at $18.<eos> See, we don't do it for the money.<eos> Neither did our buddy.<eos> See, he didn't die for money or you or whatever it is you wannabe GI Joes do for a living or the flag or the stock market.
Captain Pearson had a few questions about how things were handled.<eos> He recommended that you take a few weeks off, but I said no.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Can I trust you to keep it together?<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me I can trust you.
How come you and rip never had kids?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He's got teenage boys already.<eos> Boko haram captured Richard Taggart, former troop chief of this command.<eos> He's there because of you.
You are the lucky one.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you have nothing to lose.<eos> Judge Martinez and her husband came to dinner.<eos> They asked after you.
You get the idea.<eos> With all of these new recruits you're bringing us, gonna make a lot more of these teams.<eos> American ones.<eos> To bring on you what you bring on us.<eos> Michael, what you've done with the seal, all of these new recruits... I was wrong to doubt you.
So then why do you go and you kill their leader and his men?<eos> I made a tactical decision.<eos> It wasn't safe to come...<eos> I raised you up like Lazarus out of the gutter!<eos> They all wanted me to kill you, but I saw something in you.
I knew then that you had the will that my son lacked.<eos> I knew then that such...<eos> Such fire in you would be great to join with this intelligence...<eos> That you would be the lion the cause needed.<eos> But I also saw this rage inside of you.
Kill her.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Kill everybody in that room.<eos> 'Cause America's coming for me.<eos> And they're coming for you.
So, you trying again?<eos> You and Joe? Hopefully.<eos> He's so big.<eos> So, why are you really here, Lena?<eos> Um... Let me guess... Joe's torn up inside, shutting you out.
- The government is being targeted.<eos> You are being targeted.<eos> - I'm a no one. - You are government to them.<eos> You don't understand being a Yemeni.<eos> You would run away when she needs you the most?
Nice knowing you, Benjamin.<eos> I hope next time it's under better circumstances.<eos> - Pay up.<eos> - You have to get us past the checkpoint.<eos> Two Americans... we'll never make it without you.
Finally find God?<eos> Not your God.<eos> There is only one God.<eos> We're gonna take the city, you know.<eos> You be nice... maybe I'll make a good woman of you. Forgive the devil in you.
But this may be too late.<eos> Ramadan has begun.<eos> The guards are releasing the prisoners.<eos> Abu Ramal and his men, they'll kill me.<eos> And you.
All of our plans, the passports, the shop, everything is probably under rubble by now.<eos> I got someone on it.<eos> What, the kid you throw planes to?<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about the only person I trust in the world as much as I trust you.
- I don't know.<eos> Christian, Army.<eos> - Seems pretty up front to me.<eos> - Did he happen to tell you about some of the arrests he and his brother made - at their security checkpoint?<eos> - No, focused on you.
That's why they're here.<eos> Wearing a cross is one thing.<eos> - Living by it is another.<eos> - All right, okay, sure.<eos> Just promise me I can trust you, that we're still doing this tonight.
And in two hours when those lights go black, we're gonna disappear from this place like ghosts.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Sheba!<eos> Who are these men you work with?<eos> They're beneath you.
Get out!<eos> What are you doing in this cell?<eos> They're on the roof!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> I trusted you, Kaniel Outis. And you lied to me.
Ja! Ja, are you there?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Whip's right.<eos> The strikes are getting closer.<eos> I pity you.
They were supposed to meet us at the shop last night and we didn't show.<eos> We can't just quit - and let Poseidon beat us.<eos> - Ramal? There's a way out if we work together, but escape has to start from your cell.<eos> I'm no longer interested.<eos> The only thing left for you to do is to beg. Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.
You got to remove it.<eos> It's a spoon, string. - How?<eos> - A string a day from my uniforms for four years.<eos> A spoon a guard overlooked one time in a thousand.<eos> There's a water pipe above you.
You can't pull them.<eos> This side is original. They're open, loose.<eos> You want me to free you?<eos> Yes, and I, in turn, free you with those keys, down there.<eos> Why would I trust you more than the madman out there?
What did he say?<eos> "I don't mind dying.<eos> I just don't want to be around when it happens."<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> We need you, okay?
We'd definitely take a haircut if we broke it.<eos> But we are allowed to sublet.<eos> Might be our best option.<eos> Furniture's mostly rented month to month... so that's not an issue.<eos> For you, I think you need a desk, some file cabinets.
There aren't that many of us McGills left... and I think we should stick together.<eos> No. Why have regrets at all?<eos> What's the point?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Well, look at you.
- Delicious meal.<eos> It's just crazy to think someone can have that kind of power over your life.<eos> You're not getting emotionally involved again, are you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Just reminds me of that time before Dolly, when I was losing my mind, breaking up with you every other day.
- You know, you smell like me.<eos> - What?<eos> Chance, Chanel?<eos> It's just a gift box.<eos> I can't explain it, but... there's something about you that reminds me of me.
How?<eos> At first, I said no. I wouldn't do it.<eos> Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.<eos> And so I gave in.<eos> Everything I did, I did for family, for you, for Sara, for Mike... so none of you would ever have to spend another day inside a prison cell or...
You usually meet with killers?<eos> Sara. Sara. Please, please, please.<eos> I can explain, okay? Just listen to me.<eos> I was sick with worry.<eos> I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family, so I picked up your phone from the shop and I took it to Andrew Nelson, my buddy in the computer sciences department.
So... so I called them, thinking I could-I could maybe - make a-make a deal with them.<eos> - You called them.<eos> Sara?<eos> Sara, please, listen to me.<eos> Sara, this was for you.
And I can't get through to Lincoln.<eos> But I saw that video. It's him.<eos> - Okay, and I...<eos> - That's Michael.<eos> And I believe you. I do.
I don't even know why you dragged me into all this, you know?<eos> You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.<eos> None of that matters now.<eos> What have my actions been all these years?<eos> Who's been taking care of you through everything, huh?
It's... it's not good enough this time, man.<eos> Can you just give it to me straight?<eos> You know, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.<eos> There's a reason you're my whip hand. A reason that's gonna change your life.<eos> There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.
Whip, you stay with him.<eos> Let's move.<eos> He always give you orders like that?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I got an order for you.
And rule number one in my country is when things get bad, go to the desert.<eos> We are desperate, desperate men.<eos> Not as desperate as Omar right now.<eos> If there's one man you don't want to get on the wrong side of, it's Whip.<eos> That might apply to you, too, Michael.
What is this, guns, drugs?<eos> Fireworks?<eos> You don't understand the Phaeacians.<eos> They are beautiful. Generous.<eos> They just want to smile. Unlike you.
No, no, no, no, no, this isn't the kind of thing that you want to do off the books.<eos> Listen, Lincoln, he's gonna need a transfusion.<eos> Michael's B negative, okay?<eos> It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.<eos> You won't find it where you're going, and he won't make it while you look. Unless it comes to you.
Oh, man.<eos> Got to hang in there, buddy, huh?<eos> Still got a lot of things to tell me, you know?<eos> You gonna tell me why I'm your whip hand. Remember?<eos> I got a lot invested in you.
Please?<eos> Linc.<eos> Hi.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I'm gonna fix you up. And then we'll talk, okay?
He's strong.<eos> We'll, uh... we'll give you a minute.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> We need to work out a way to get off this island.<eos> What I said... um, about you... I was wrong.
I have a contact at the NSA and she gave me proof.<eos> You're not calling him Junior, are you?<eos> I promised you I would never do that.<eos> He's an amazing kid.<eos> He's just like you.
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.<eos> He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.
He chose images that showed me moving Gaines' body, eliminated the ones that incriminated himself.<eos> I knew I was being set up.<eos> He was tightening his control over me, but there was nothing I could do.<eos> At least, that's what he thought.<eos> When I knew Poseidon had gone rogue and was operating outside the CIA, that's when I started my plan to get back to you.
Marseille.<eos> - Marseilles.<eos> - Marseilles.<eos> I own you, Scofield.<eos> I know everything about you. Even your most mundane actions, like the zoo.
Your part is over.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing. Poseidon... he knows your face. Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.<eos> You've been a warrior, and I owe you.<eos> But your face is a liability now to you and your family.
Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons, looking for someone who could handle himself.<eos> And with your innate ability to thrive, rising to the top in even the worst of cages, you reminded him of a certain someone.<eos> And so he did a little research.<eos> Wanted to know what we all want to know.<eos> Did you learn it... or was it ingrained in you?

Burrows!<eos> Hi, Mike.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I got your map.<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
Miles.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Jane.<eos> Clara, don't.<eos> I'm proud of you.
- What?<eos> You have stopped progressing.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> We spend most of the time talking about renovating your house.<eos> I had to drag this dream out of you.
Hey, listen.<eos> We've been seeing each other a while now, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think we're at the point... where if something... if you want to talk about something...<eos> I like you, Jane.
Something else?<eos> Well, um, I'm guessing money.<eos> - Tell me I'm right.<eos> - He is gonna be here any minute.<eos> Now, I need you inside.
But her ghost survived!<eos> Her ghost is what failed us.<eos> We can not control her.<eos> She is no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.
What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic.<eos> Upload your data on the raid.<eos> I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are the orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> You built her!
I am.<eos> Mr. Cutter.<eos> I talked with the Prime Minister.<eos> You are accused of murder and crimes against the state.<eos> I thought that it might be you.
Go figure.<eos> The bullets could've been real.<eos> Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!
You smell that?<eos> Smells like the same shit in a different suit.<eos> You think a dog knows how to work a Frisbee?<eos> Master says, "Fetch," and the bitch listens.<eos> You would look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.<eos> We discovered a high-level intelligence officer was trying to manipulate satellites.<eos> And even before we could unmask him, Gibbons was killed.<eos> So, you knew they were Triple-X all along.<eos> I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.
Millions of people have died for nothing--<eos> It's their right. Read between the lines.<eos> Isn't it right?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> What's been bugging me this whole time is you've got something stuck in between your teeth.
Is this what happens when shit gets real?<eos> What do we do?<eos> Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I don't think we've ever been at a reception table with a nanny before.<eos> Have we, Jerry?<eos> Only very good or very bad nannies are remembered so many years later.<eos> Which one are you?
- Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> I heard you were a head-turner.<eos> What an understatement that is.<eos> And I heard you were a charmer.
And I heard you were a charmer.<eos> Guess that's an understatement, too.<eos> I apologize for Frankie.<eos> I know this beach is public and, honestly, I wish the club was, too.<eos> - But you, you're welcome anytime.
So how about you let me do my job, and I'll tell you where to send my checks?<eos> You know, sharks always swim slowly.<eos> Until they need to attack.<eos> Thank you for that cryptic and totally irrelevant piece of information.<eos> What are you, Aquaman?
Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who taught you how to drive, Stevie fucking Wonder?<eos> You're huge, man.
- So?<eos> - So the question is, who the fuck is Angelo?<eos> I saw barrels like that down in the Huntley, and now they're on the back of her yacht.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mitch, you're impossible.
Well, what we're supposed to do is find the fucking flakka.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Angelo's Fish Company.<eos> There it is.<eos> You are so selfish.
That takes balls.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> It's like Breaking Bad in there.<eos> Yeah, dude, Breaking Bad.<eos> - You were right.
You see, I'm not Mitch, right?<eos> I know my place.<eos> I'm just a lifeguard.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I just want to make sure that you and I start out on the right foot.
Your bison was exquisite.<eos> A perfect specimen, and a terrible loss.<eos> I've spoken of it to Hermann Göring, and I'm happy to say that he's agreed with me.<eos> I am to start a breeding program this summer.<eos> You're going to breed bison?
I didn't know that you thought so little of me, Dr. Zabiński.<eos> I devoted my life to the study of genetics, and I'm well practiced in the study of animal breeding.<eos> I'm an expert in that field.<eos> And I think I know more than anyone.<eos> Even more than you.
I'll bring more when I can.<eos> I can get you out.<eos> People know your books.<eos> They will take care of you.<eos> You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.
You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.<eos> But then what of the children?<eos> What of them, Dr. Zabiński?<eos> My heart is no different than yours.<eos> I should not be here, they should not be here, you should not be here.
He is Dr. Kleinhauser.<eos> He is with me.<eos> Do you want me to go to the Labor Bureau?<eos> Do you want me to waste Dr. Ziegler's time, his valuable time, to have him come all the way here, to talk to you, to tell you that he is with me?<eos> What do you want?
I didn't see you come in.<eos> You know, we've had to let most of the zookeepers go.<eos> Times are very hard.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You have always been so good to me, Miss.
You know, we've had to let most of the zookeepers go.<eos> Times are very hard.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You have always been so good to me, Miss.<eos> You and your husband.
Yeah, everything was fine all that time until he just up and says...<eos> "I'm into dudes," you know?<eos> I'm done with her.<eos> I just need to move on, find somebody new.<eos> Not you necessarily, but...
How could this be kidnapping?<eos> Well, the parents are pretty P.O'-ed.<eos> It's hard to blame them.<eos> She is just 17.<eos> Whose side are you on?
I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!
So happy to meet you.<eos> Where do you find it?<eos> When you're young, it's not always easy to know what is the light.<eos> - I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.
- I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - It's different.<eos> - Sweet of you to say.<eos> I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.
I knew you were a dirty cop!<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I'm internal affairs.<eos> I know everyone in IA.<eos> You don't know shit.
I mean, this time of year, there's hardly anybody in town.<eos> - I mean, in the summer is better.<eos> - Summer?<eos> - Well, with the tourists and...<eos> - That was you back there, right?
I'm not in the right frame of mind, and I have to sell this house.<eos> Hard to work when you got to worry about money.<eos> You know you have to do yourself a favor.<eos> What is that?<eos> You know you have to stop drinking.
Move!<eos> - You, go! - Jack, calm down.<eos> Calm down, please.<eos> Take off the hand brake, and start pushing the car into the pond.<eos> You, help him!
I have a baby, please, let me...<eos> Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?<eos> They always tend to imagine the worst.<eos> You too, Paul.
The train is over this hill! Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> - I can't, my ankle.<eos> - Oh, yes, you can.
You've been disloyal, Paul.<eos> You forgot all about our agreement.<eos> Our agreement?<eos> You're completely out of your mind.<eos> You know that, right?
I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.<eos> It's your fault the sheriff's dead.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!
I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!<eos> This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?<eos> They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.
Heads up!<eos> Daniels!<eos> You wanna give a girl a hand?<eos> See you soon.<eos> You're next, Captain.
Hey, do you mind if I join you?<eos> Hey, that dude...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Uh, sorry.<eos> You.
Mind if I join you?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, come over.<eos> Please.<eos> Uh, not you.
Uh, not you.<eos> It was me.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Could you kind of beat it?<eos> 'Cause you're a distraction.
That's Capoeira.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Uh, I'm really sorry.<eos> She's never done that before.<eos> Are you okay?
One two<eos> three four.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I was gonna change it.<eos> Do you have husband?
$100,000.<eos> Wired by noon tomorrow.<eos> Okay,I don'tknow whothisis , but if you keep pranking me,<eos> I will report it to the police.<eos> It will become a police matter, and you will go to jail.
And write down "calle..."<eos> "Cali" what?<eos> Is this a tall building that we need to get to so you can pick us up on the top of it?<eos> That's the address of the nearest us consulate in Bogota.<eos> Okay, but you have to actually come get us because we are Americans in peril. So...

So...<eos> I'msorryto tellyou , butanytimeyou travelinternationally, you take a risk.
Mmm-hmm.<eos> This is how sex slavery starts, honey.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Listen, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Listen, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> Those kinds of people want young, beautiful females.<eos> You're safe.
We're Americans.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Emily and this is Linda.<eos> Hi, I'm Linda.<eos> You don't even understand the ordeal that we have just been through.
- We're new in town.<eos> - We're very new.<eos> He was cute.<eos> He was fast.<eos> You should have seen him in those last moments.
He was cute.<eos> He was fast.<eos> You should have seen him in those last moments.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But listen, you kidnapped us.
No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Yes, you are.
Which I don't know what it means.<eos> "Princess" or "pretty" or...<eos> It means "whore."<eos> That checks out.<eos> You took someone from my family.
Mmm-hmm.<eos> There's not much more i can do, unfortunately, sir.<eos> Okay, I imagine that you have some kind of commando squad.<eos> Maybe,like, fourunderground criminals who were tried for a crime they didn't commit.<eos> Andthey'vebeenliving intheunderground kinda helping people along the way, almost sir, were you born in the '70s?
Andthey'vebeenliving intheunderground kinda helping people along the way, almost sir, were you born in the '70s?<eos> Mmm.<eos> That sounds like the a-team.<eos> It is the a-team.<eos> Do you have an a-team?
Ow!<eos> And, gosh, wasn't it weird how soggy the wood was when I tried to light it?<eos> So weird.<eos> Linda, thanks for stepping up.<eos> You really did a great job.
Yeah.<eos> It's awesome, mom.<eos> Thanks, honey.<eos> Roger, why don't you tell us a story?<eos> You've been an expedition guide for forever, right?
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Russell.<eos> Hello, Morgan.<eos> Sir, you've called 12 times today.
Where are you taking me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Stay.<eos> Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Stay.<eos> Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton... is: Who exactly are you?
In theory, I know all about you.<eos> Army reconnaissance, decorated soldier... and page after page indicating a deep and troubling moral attitude.<eos> But you see, this file contains nothing of any real value to me.<eos> That's why I wanted to see you face to face.<eos> Who are you?
No matter what I do, you are going to die.<eos> Yes, evil is a disease.<eos> A pestilent pustulant infection... borrowing its way into our souls.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure. Stop.
Give it to me... my chosen.<eos> Give it to me... my love.<eos> Somewhere in there... I know you're a good man.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.
It's not my fault.<eos> I've given birth to the devil.<eos> It's the devil!<eos> You're tired.<eos> Give me the baby. You don't want to hurt her.
FBI! Drop your weapon!<eos> Agent Cooper?<eos> Agent Cooper, come in.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Who are you and what are you doing here?
Listen...<eos> You want to give all this money to children?<eos> Th-they are so little.<eos> Maybe they don't eat so much.<eos> Your money. You're the boss.
I'm no assassin.<eos> I'm a templar.<eos> You're weak. Like your father.<eos> He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.
I'm a templar.<eos> You're weak. Like your father.<eos> He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.<eos> But I'd rather be "weak," than whatever it is you are.
- Come again? Whoa!<eos> Is that true?<eos> Yeah. And I saw Cole loading the Abrams.<eos> Sergeant Harper, are we staging?<eos> I know what you know, chutsky. Come on. What do I know?
God damn it. Coming in.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Show me your hands! Show me your hands!<eos> Get out of the car! Get out of the car!<eos> Machmoud, where the fuck are you? Machmoud!
We get detention and Whitney does a hair flip and gets off Scot-free.<eos> - Well if it makes you feel any better, in at least one of the infinite multiverses, she doesn't.<eos> Hey, I know it seems like high school is the center of this universe right now.<eos> - Do not say it gets better.<eos> Next year you'll be in Nerdvana at MIT and I'll still be here serving quadruple bypass burgers at TGI Fridays.

- So single 40-something postal carrier with a PEZ collection<eos> - Hey, this PEZ collection is gonna be valuable one day and single and widow are two completely different things.<eos> - I know.<eos> Dad, I mean it's been five years.<eos> You know, you're not getting any younger.
Dad, I mean it's been five years.<eos> You know, you're not getting any younger.<eos> - Age is just a number.<eos> - That closely correlates with death.<eos> - You want me to start dating?
I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - Took you long enough.<eos> - One center cut rare, three meatball subs, extra sauce, a hard boiled egg and a Kombucha.<eos> - I'm going to die a virgin and you don't even care.
- Soccer mom goes to the Olive Garden.<eos> I guess we should...<eos> - Colin!<eos> - Thank you for hosting us.<eos> You have a lovely home.
- Hey.<eos> MIT and what was it?<eos> How's it going, guys?<eos> - Well we haven't been roofied yet so.<eos> - Wow. Aren't you enchanting?
- Someone's ballin'.<eos> - Who's Jodi?<eos> - Well any requests?<eos> ♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪<eos> Oh you're such a good kisser.
- Who's Jodi?<eos> - Well any requests?<eos> ♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪<eos> Oh you're such a good kisser.<eos> I'd party down with you any time, Adam Scott.
- Well any requests?<eos> ♪ Ooh eczema, I'm gonna vanquish ya ♪<eos> Oh you're such a good kisser.<eos> I'd party down with you any time, Adam Scott.<eos> - You know how there are the birds and there are the bees.
- Jodi, wait!<eos> You're all mean! Jodi!<eos> - You're late.<eos> - How epic was prank eight?<eos> I want to be you when I grow up.
Mackenzie, drive.<eos> - Hey, Jodi.<eos> It's me, your best friend.<eos> Um I'm at school right now and you know, it is really, really not that bad. Oy vey.<eos> - Oh my god, have you seen Jodi's Instagram feed?
- Welcome, Claire.<eos> - I like where your horse head's at.<eos> Going straight Godfather, huh?<eos> - It's a unicorn for my spirit animal badge.<eos> - You do realize that this is a meeting to launch a social revolution.
- What?<eos> We tried to talk to all the different groups, but nobody wanted to join the cause.<eos> You think all the outcasts are the same, but really we're like snowflakes, snowflakes that hate each other.<eos> Let me break it down for you.<eos> You've got your basic overachievers, your underachievers, your emos, your goths, your bandos, your drama dorks, orchestra oddballs and gleeks.
Asiavous, Facebook for Asians.<eos> And besides, I've got to look to the future, not worry about high school.<eos> I still have to get before I can start my first company.<eos> - Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels.<eos> You can quote them or disagree with them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
- We're huge Dr. Who fans.<eos> - Yeah, the Matt Smith years completely turned the series around.<eos> - Completely.<eos> - Tell you what, give me the title of one Neal Stephenson novel, just one, and I'll join your little group.<eos> - You think skinny, anemic fanboys have a monopoly on the one fictional genre where women and people of color get to exist outside of backwards societal norms and traditional confinements?
What if Frodo hadn't left the Shire and fought against the Dark Lord?<eos> - Louis.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> - I'm really glad I'm helping you guys with this whole thing.<eos> I've always admired you.
First I have to figure out how to tell them.<eos> - That you're rude and obnoxious?<eos> - That I'm gay.<eos> - It's so great to talk to somebody who's already out.<eos> You're like my hero.
- It's so great to talk to somebody who's already out.<eos> You're like my hero.<eos> With that sign on your back announcing that you were gay, I could not believe how brave you were.<eos> - Okay first of all, someone put that sign on my back as a prank and secondly, why does everyone think I'm gay?<eos> - You do wear a lot of vests.
- You do wear a lot of vests.<eos> - I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> I'm really glad that you told me.<eos> So... When did you know?
- Things are happening, Herb. Things are happening.<eos> - Yes they are.<eos> New York Performing Arts School.<eos> Deal's a deal.<eos> I have a date with Carol and you have a date with destiny.
Deal's a deal.<eos> I have a date with Carol and you have a date with destiny.<eos> - Find love today.<eos> - Things are happening.<eos> - Raise your hand if you've ever eaten lunch in a bathroom stall. Been made fun of because of your weight, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or knowledge of the periodic table of elements.
- Light sabers are not swords.<eos> - What about the Force?<eos> That's magic.<eos> - Which was scientifically explained by midichlorians.<eos> - Are you actually citing the prequels to me right now?
What's law number five?<eos> Much depends on our reputation.<eos> Guard it with our life, get it?<eos> So right now I'd say it's pretty clear that we are...<eos> - The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.
Much depends on our reputation.<eos> Guard it with our life, get it?<eos> So right now I'd say it's pretty clear that we are...<eos> - The thing about power is when you don't have it, someone else does.<eos> So you say phase and I say insurrection the only response to insurrection is to crush it.
Oh what's that?<eos> - Every scientist needs an arch nemesis.<eos> He's right though.<eos> The school does seem different lately.<eos> You have anything to do with that?
I've got maroon and black and I'm not sure which goes better with my dickey, but my dickey kind of goes with everything and I keep thinking what would Neil deGrasse Tyson do, but then again I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson,<eos> but then again.<eos> - Mindy, Mindy, stop worrying.<eos> They'd be Darwin Award grade morons not to take you.<eos> - I keep imagining how great it would be next year, me at MIT, you coming to live with me in Boston.
Canadian icons.<eos> - You like Carole King?<eos> - It makes me feel like a natural woman.<eos> Who can't relate to that, you know what I mean?<eos> - Let's not forget that the last time I saw you, the most humiliating moment of my life.
Do you have a song about rickets for my grandad? He's got rickets.<eos> - I don't, I don't get it.<eos> - I guess you wouldn't get it, you're a young woman, very healthy.<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul.
The guy is, he's an idiot.<eos> But what am I supposed to do?<eos> Not all of us have the guts to stage a full-scale rebellion.<eos> - Mindy's the brains behind the operation.<eos> - You just write the theme music?
- Yeah.<eos> - It's like let me fly.<eos> - Where the hell is everyone?<eos> - Hey Mackenzie, look at that.<eos> You like that?
- I think everyone's at the lame party.<eos> - Really?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> - What the hell is your problem, hmm?<eos> - You know what my problem is?
- Really?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> - What the hell is your problem, hmm?<eos> - You know what my problem is?<eos> You're uh you're super evil.
That's awesome.<eos> - What the hell is your problem, hmm?<eos> - You know what my problem is?<eos> You're uh you're super evil.<eos> You're like African rebel group dictator evil
- You know what my problem is?<eos> You're uh you're super evil.<eos> You're like African rebel group dictator evil<eos> So I think I'm gonna check out the lame party where I hear the hosts aren't total ass hats.<eos> - You'll fit right in.
- Mackenzie!<eos> - Hey, so what's in this anyway?<eos> - My own personal secret blend of choice chemicals and a dash of genius.<eos> I call it Lipschitz and giggles.<eos> - You're right, I do have the vague urge to laugh.
You know, Gloria Steinem, Hilary Clinton, and Sandra Day O'Connor were all Girl Scouts.<eos> - Hmm maybe you're not as "puppies and unicorns" as you seem.<eos> - I thought I would be just better at jousting,<eos> I don't know, like 'cause of a reach thing<eos> - 'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.
I don't know, like 'cause of a reach thing<eos> - 'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.<eos> - Thank you, spindly ones, sure.<eos> Oh whoa, there's a piano here.<eos> You know what that means.
- 'Cause you got those long, spindly ones.<eos> - Thank you, spindly ones, sure.<eos> Oh whoa, there's a piano here.<eos> You know what that means.<eos> Will you write any new songs?
Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.<eos> - Relax.<eos> Awkward doesn't suit you.<eos> No awkward. Okay.<eos> - You must be David, of course you are.
Awkward doesn't suit you.<eos> No awkward. Okay.<eos> - You must be David, of course you are.<eos> Who else would you be?<eos> You wouldn't bring a date to dinner, right?
- Not quite, but. - Mom's done, Mom's done.<eos> - Sure, thank you.<eos> What if they get married?<eos> - Then we almost committed stepcest.<eos> Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.
- Then we almost committed stepcest.<eos> Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.<eos> - No, no way.<eos> You were practically undressing me with your eyes.<eos> - Undressing you?
- Fine, we'll just chalk it up to equal parts creepy.<eos> I don't know where this goes.<eos> Friends it is?<eos> - Yeah, in the interest of not having our family tree go in a circle friends.<eos> I'm sorry, I realize referencing having children with you makes it more creepy.
- Yeah, it did.<eos> - I got an operation plan to Photoshop the cheerleaders' yearbook picture.<eos> Can I get the green light?<eos> - I don't care, do what you want.<eos> - I have been looking for you all day.
Why don't you have a look-see.<eos> - Okay, well that one is clearly Photoshopped.<eos> - Mindy.<eos> - Well guess what.<eos> You're out of the science club forever.
Get out of my office.<eos> Mr. Samuels.<eos> Why didn't you defend me?<eos> - What do you want me to do, Mindy?<eos> - You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.
Mr. Samuels.<eos> Why didn't you defend me?<eos> - What do you want me to do, Mindy?<eos> - You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.<eos> - Oh my god, you totally broke her.
The only reason Whitney was always so intent on exposing all of your weaknesses was so that you would never discover hers.<eos> Whitney Bennett is a liar.<eos> What was that?<eos> - That was our revenge over Whitney.<eos> - You do realize that you just did the same thing to her that she did to me.
I never thought I'd feel bad for someone who affectionately references Stalin.<eos> - Now we should shove his head into a toilet.<eos> - Look, I never meant for things to go down like that.<eos> - Oh come on, don't tell me you're not having a dorkgasm over this.<eos> - Google alert, you did the same thing to me
No wait, I, I'm, s-s-s...<eos> - Were you trying to apologize?<eos> - It just gets stuck in my throat.<eos> But I know you're right, okay.<eos> You're right.
We had pretended we cared about coming together, but in the end people only cared about themselves.<eos> Even best friends.<eos> So it had all been a lie, which was fitting since when you think about it most of high school is a lie.<eos> Everyone faking it, trying to act cooler or smarter or older or just more sure of themselves than they really are and I couldn't help but think wouldn't it be nice for once if people just told the truth.<eos> - So you're going to drug prom?
Lipschitzium is a very mild form of truth serum in gaseous form.<eos> Think of it like a very smart person's version of spiking the punch, okay?<eos> - Oh I'm fine with you drugging prom.<eos> So what changed your mind about working with me?<eos> - You may be a duplicitous opportunist, but at least you're honest about what you want.

- We are so Breaking Bad right now.<eos> Hey Colin.<eos> - Who came up with this theme anyway?<eos> - The patriarchy.<eos> - You back in?
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.<eos> But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature.<eos> - This punch... Is good.<eos> - I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.<eos> - I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
- I really like.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'll find you later.<eos> - Promise?<eos> - Where have you been?
What do you think this does?<eos> - I don't, I don't...<eos> - Expose the truth.<eos> Nice.<eos> Some best friend you are.
- I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were.<eos> - I told you you couldn't trust her.<eos> - And now all of a sudden you're, you're,<eos> - Yeah because between you and Whitney, Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.<eos> - You are just jealous because I am the one who finally stood up to her, which is something that you've always been too scared to do.
- I told you you couldn't trust her.<eos> - And now all of a sudden you're, you're,<eos> - Yeah because between you and Whitney, Whitney is the one who is acting less like an evil dictator.<eos> - You are just jealous because I am the one who finally stood up to her, which is something that you've always been too scared to do.<eos> - I'm turning you in.
- I'm turning you in.<eos> - If you're not with me, you are my enemy.<eos> - Only a Sith deals in absolutes.<eos> I will do what I must.<eos> - You will try.
- I need to report a crime in progress.<eos> - Okay everybody.<eos> It is that time of the evening that you've all been waiting for.<eos> Your very handsome principal is about to announce your prom king and queen.<eos> - You shall not pass!
- That was exhausting.<eos> - Nerd fight!<eos> - Hey, do you need my help?<eos> - No, I got this.<eos> - Where have you been?
- Oh ew, are you two gonna make out now?<eos> - You know what, Whitney, shut up!<eos> Even after all of the horrible crap that you put me through,<eos> I still tried because I was stupid enough to feel bad for you.<eos> - Do you think I actually care what these people think of me?
I can take away that which you hold most dear and crush it and it barely took any push at all to turn you two into Cain and Abel.<eos> Frankly, I think I did you a favor, otherwise this little horror show likely would have dragged on for another few years before you two cut your losses and moved on.<eos> - Maybe she's right.<eos> It was stupid to think that we would still be friends after high school.<eos> You're gonna do your thing, I'm gonna do mine and, and in 10 years we'll see each other at the reunion and smile.
- If that's how you really feel, then maybe we should just stop avoiding the inevitable and end this right now.<eos> - It is how I feel.<eos> - Well that hurts.<eos> Not as bad as that.<eos> Oh you gotta be kidding me.
What you need to do is figure out what and who is important to you and fight for that.<eos> The rest doesn't matter.<eos> - Mr. Flemming.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
I don't know how things got so messed up.<eos> Okay no, I do know.<eos> I went totally Dr. Strangelove.<eos> But the thing you said about us being high school friends.<eos> You're not my high school friend.
Okay no, I do know.<eos> I went totally Dr. Strangelove.<eos> But the thing you said about us being high school friends.<eos> You're not my high school friend.<eos> You're my best friend.
You will always know about the face plant I got that got me this dental bridge.<eos> You will always know I prefer odd numbers to even.<eos> I don't know where life will take us.<eos> Hopefully, hopefully to the 2020 Grammy's and the first human settlement on Mars.<eos> But it doesn't matter because all I know is that I want you in my life for all of it.
But it doesn't matter because all I know is that I want you in my life for all of it.<eos> I am so sorry and I'm back.<eos> - I'm so sorry I was too busy exploring my sexuality.<eos> - It's okay, sexuality is important.<eos> Oh I am so glad you're here, you have no idea.
I'm totally freaking out.<eos> - Look at me.<eos> Remember science fair finals.<eos> I was so nervous, I could almost puke on my bacteria cultures.<eos> You made me do it.
You made me do it.<eos> Get yourself together, Jodi.<eos> I think I know what we have to do.<eos> ♪ We reach for the stars<eos> ♪ 'Cause you are my friend
Get yourself together, Jodi.<eos> I think I know what we have to do.<eos> ♪ We reach for the stars<eos> ♪ 'Cause you are my friend<eos> ♪ And you're killing it every day ♪
- And we made it through.<eos> We're members of society, we have the diploma.<eos> We can prove it to everyone.<eos> - Yeah, well done.<eos> - Well done to you too.
- Next year is going to be epic.<eos> - Next year?<eos> We still got the summer.<eos> Summer go to my place.<eos> - Oh you know it, whoo!
Do you?<eos> No.<eos> Not for 20 years.<eos> That's really good. Well done.<eos> So, are you the woman in the video?
My future wife.<eos> Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village.<eos> That makes her the best.<eos> But she's so well-read.<eos> And you're so... - athletically inclined.
She really is a funny girl<eos> That Belle<eos> Good morning, Belle!<eos> Wonderful book you have there.<eos> Have you read it?
Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose.<eos> Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!
So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose.<eos> Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!<eos> And every year you bring it.
What on earth are you doing?<eos> Teaching another girl to read?<eos> Isn't one enough?<eos> We have to do something.<eos> You are the wildest... most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.
Philippe!<eos> Good boy.<eos> Go, boy.<eos> Go!<eos> Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.
The one who'll break the spell?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, is that you?
This castle is alive!<eos> Now go, before he finds you!<eos> Who?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?
Now go, before he finds you!<eos> Who?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
Go!<eos> All right, Papa.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> I need a minute alone with him.<eos> Are you so cold-hearted... you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?
What?<eos> You took his place.<eos> He's my father.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> And so are you.
That "Once this door closes it will not open again"?<eos> I know.<eos> He gets so dramatic.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you are very strong.
He gets so dramatic.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?
Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?<eos> I am Lumiere!<eos> And you can talk?
I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.<eos> We must be strong.<eos> How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
When she can stay awake.<eos> Cogsworth!<eos> A diva needs her beauty rest.<eos> Stay with us, Madame.<eos> We have someone for you to dress!
You know, there are other girls.<eos> A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.<eos> Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston<eos> Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you<eos> You're everyone's favorite guy
I believe there's another 'T'<eos> It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate<eos> And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.
You're making her dinner!<eos> Well, we thought you might appreciate the company.<eos> Master, I just want to assure you... that I had no part in this hopeless plan.<eos> Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her... a suite in the east wing!<eos> You gave her a bedroom?
With every passing day... we become less human.<eos> She's the daughter of a common thief.<eos> What kind of person do you think that makes her?<eos> Oh, you can't judge people... by who their father is, now can you?<eos> You'll join me for dinner.
And when she opens the door, give her a dashing, debonair smile.<eos> Come, come. Show me the smile.<eos> - Oh, mon dieu!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?
Come, come. Show me the smile.<eos> - Oh, mon dieu!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?<eos> You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?
- Oh, mon dieu!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?<eos> You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Are you insane?
You can't talk to us like that.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> Am I too late?<eos> Shame, I was really going to tell him off this time.<eos> Oh, Master, you've returned.
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.<eos> - We still have time.<eos> - Mama... am I ever going to be a boy again?<eos> Oh, yes, Chip.<eos> You'll have your days... in the sun again.
You just leave it to me.<eos> I told you to go away.<eos> Don't worry, dear.<eos> It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!
They can sing, they can dance<eos> After all, miss, this is France<eos> And a dinner here is never second best<eos> Go on unfold your menu<eos> Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, oui, our guest
We tell jokes, I do tricks<eos> With my fellow candlesticks<eos> And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet<eos> Come on and lift your glass<eos> You've won your own free pass To be our guest
Too long we've been rusting<eos> Needing so much more than dusting<eos> Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills<eos> Most days we just lay around the castle<eos> Flabby, fat and lazy You walked in and whoops-a-daisy
Let us help you, we'll keep going<eos> Course by<eos> Course!<eos> One by one<eos> 'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"
- Good night.<eos> - Nighty-night.<eos> Straight to bed.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What did you do to it?
Please, forgive me, old bean.<eos> That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law... now is it?<eos> Future father-in-law?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You will never marry my daughter.
I saw that coming.<eos> If Maurice won't give me his blessing... then he is in my way.<eos> Once the wolves are finished with him... Belle will have no one to take care of her but me.<eos> For the sake of exhausting all of our options... do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less... gruesome alternative?<eos> Are you coming?
It's wonderful!<eos> Yes.<eos> I suppose it is.<eos> Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours.<eos> Have you really read every one of these books?
What?<eos> Well, not all of them.<eos> Some of them are in Greek.<eos> Was that a joke?<eos> Are you making jokes now?
What, Mama?<eos> There may be something there That wasn't there before<eos> What is it?<eos> What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.
What's there?<eos> I'll tell you when you're older.<eos> Okay, I'm older!<eos> Chip...<eos> You are a one.
Your village sounds terrible.<eos> Almost as lonely as your castle.<eos> What do you say we run away?<eos> Another little gift from the enchantress.<eos> A book that truly allows you to escape.
It was the one story Papa could never bring himself to tell.<eos> I knew better than to ask.<eos> A doctor's mask.<eos> Plague.<eos> You must leave now.
We could always turn back...<eos> It's just... every time I close my eyes... I picture Maurice stranded alone.<eos> And then when I open them... he's...<eos> Maurice!<eos> Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?
Gaston... did you try to kill Maurice?<eos> Maurice!<eos> Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.<eos> - You tried to kill me.
Well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts...<eos> But no.<eos> No, he did not.<eos> You...<eos> Maurice... it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others.
You need help, sir.<eos> A place to heal your troubled mind.<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> Just fine.<eos> Well, I saw her in the ballroom... and said, "You're making everything look so beautiful.
Never.<eos> Take him away!<eos> Stop!<eos> Papa.<eos> Oh, Belle. I thought I'd lost you.
He's gentle and kind.<eos> The monster has her under his spell.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him!<eos> He's not a monster, Gaston.<eos> You are!
I told you!<eos> Sacré bleu!<eos> Invaders!<eos> Ruffians!<eos> Well, there you go.
How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where did you...
Where did you...<eos> He took me there.<eos> I know what happened to Maman.<eos> Then you know why I had to leave her there.<eos> I had to protect you.
Where are we?<eos> This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.
This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.<eos> And you must be... his grandmother.
Thank you!<eos> Take that!<eos> Nicely handled!<eos> Well, I used to be on Gaston's side... but we are so in a bad place right now.<eos> - You're too good for him, anyway.
Hello, beast.<eos> I'm Gaston.<eos> Belle sent me.<eos> Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?
I'm coming for you, beast.<eos> - No!<eos> - Belle?<eos> Belle!<eos> You came back!
Don't!<eos> It's too far!<eos> Please!<eos> Come on.<eos> You came back.
I'll never leave you again.<eos> I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.<eos> We're together now.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> At least I got to see you.
- Plumette?<eos> Plumette?<eos> Oh, my darling, Plumette.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Maestro, you were so brave.
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!<eos> Plumette!<eos> Plumette!<eos> Chip!<eos> Look at you!
Turn back into a clock.<eos> Lumiere, look!<eos> Oh, my Prince!<eos> Hello, old friend. Oh!<eos> It's so good to see you.
And force us to do the unthinkable.<eos> "STRICNINE"<eos> Thirteen is too early to become an adult.<eos> The secrets we keep They crawl to the surface.<eos> Are you alright.
Something that was difficult for Mack to accept.<eos> But together they managed to create Which most would call a good life.<eos> But all this changed in an instant, When the great sadness came uninvited.<eos> THECABANA<eos> No, you can not drive, it's too dangerous.
I'll warm the rice on that thing.<eos> Just a little tired, I guess.<eos> He was going to clean the entrance before dark.<eos> Call me in the morning.<eos> Yes you too.
Mother, can not you even leave your seminary?<eos> Come on, you guys are gonna have fun!<eos> I have faith in your father's maternal abilities.<eos> Has?<eos> Hey, young lady, what have you got there?
Yes, it certainly does.<eos> She's a special girl.<eos> You two are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you daddy.
She's a special girl.<eos> You two are.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you daddy.<eos> I love you.
Dad!<eos> He's stuck, Daddy!<eos> Josh!<eos> Dad, where's Josh?<eos> Are you alright?
Very well.<eos> Missy!<eos> You can leave, dear.<eos> Everyone is well.<eos> Emil, did you see Missy?
Emil, did you see Missy?<eos> No.<eos> Did you look at the camp?<eos> You must be with my daughters.<eos> Are you alright?
Look at those bathrooms and showers. That I will look at these.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Missy!<eos> Emily!<eos> Excuse me, did you see a little girl?
Sir?<eos> Teams found the truck in the mountains.<eos> It's ok.<eos> The helicopter is waiting, sir.<eos> Mack, are you okay?
Can I finish my duty at Ally's?<eos> You saw the weather, right?<eos> It's only two streets away.<eos> Another time.<eos> Hey, you.
How was she there at Arlene?<eos> As always.<eos> She comes out of the shell for a minute. And then back.<eos> I'll take it to my brother this weekend.<eos> He knows a therapist we could try, and... I thought maybe you could go along.
Good...<eos> Have you talked to Nan about this?<eos> No, I do not want to upset her.<eos> She's barely holding the ends.<eos> Have you prayed for this?
And if it's that guy And he's trying to get you there Who knows what?<eos> We don `t know yet.<eos> Have you considered the other possibility?<eos> What?<eos> Do you think it's God?
We don `t know yet.<eos> Have you considered the other possibility?<eos> What?<eos> Do you think it's God?<eos> It was you who said there was no trail in the snow.
Right.<eos> But I will go with you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I hope everything goes well for her.<eos> I hope everything goes well for you too.
Look that...<eos> I know you're fighting something.<eos> It's okay if you do not know how to talk about it.<eos> But we've lost so much already.<eos> I do not want to lose you too.
We will need to do something, When we find out that I went crazy.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll get my things.<eos> You're not planning on coming back, are you?<eos> I do not want to lose you too.
I'll get my things.<eos> You're not planning on coming back, are you?<eos> I do not want to lose you too.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are you?
God!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You led me here.
I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You led me here.<eos> Now he does not have the courage to appear.<eos> What a great Pope you are.
How about presentations?<eos> I'm Elousia.<eos> I have many names, But this is one of my favorites.<eos> Or you can call me like Nan calls.<eos> Do you know Nan?
I am.<eos> The "I am"?<eos> I am what I am.<eos> Look, I'm already quoting the scripture.<eos> You knew my son.
It means "wind blow".<eos> Right.<eos> So... Which one of you is...<eos> I am.<eos> And you have no idea how much I love you.
It's good to meet them.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Why did I have to wake up?<eos> I think you dropped that.<eos> You wrote this?
This is crazy.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> What should I do?<eos> You must do nothing.<eos> You are free to do what you want.
You can help Sarayu in the garden.<eos> Or you can talk to Papa in the kitchen.<eos> Your choice.<eos> I know it's too much to process, but...<eos> You'll be fine, Mack.
There is no easy answer to end your pain.<eos> No solution that lasts forever.<eos> Life takes a little time And a lot of relationship.<eos> "Relationship"?<eos> You're God Almighty, are not you?
And it has infinite power.<eos> And somehow... Let my daughter die.<eos> When she most needed you... You abandoned her.<eos> I never left her.<eos> If you are who you say you are... Where were you when I needed it?
And the truth has a name.<eos> He is now in the hut, covered with sawdust.<eos> "Truth"?<eos> I know that story.<eos> You left him too.
He is now in the hut, covered with sawdust.<eos> "Truth"?<eos> I know that story.<eos> You left him too.<eos> It seems that you have the terrible habit To turn away from those who say they love.
"Truth"?<eos> I know that story.<eos> You left him too.<eos> It seems that you have the terrible habit To turn away from those who say they love.<eos> I'm not who you think.
I'm a fan of her laughter.<eos> Its cute.<eos> IT IS.<eos> He still does not believe this is real.<eos> You think?
But if you are real... Then you already know everything I will say. Even before I say it, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But we choose to hear everything you have to say, As if it were the first time.<eos> We love to know your children through your eyes.<eos> I wash and you dry?
Amazing.<eos> I understand that you are all connected.<eos> But I feel more relaxed with you.<eos> Probably because I'm human.<eos> But you're God too, right?
The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love was meant to exist in a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we want to have with you.<eos> Even if you can not see.
She is my spirit.<eos> Love was meant to exist in a relationship, Mack.<eos> That's all we want to have with you.<eos> Even if you can not see.<eos> You are at the center of our love and purpose.

Missy!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Good morning, Mack.<eos> Do you like Neil Young?
Is there someone you do not have a special affection for?<eos> Do not.<eos> I have not found anyone yet.<eos> I think it's my way.<eos> Are not you mad at them?
My what?<eos> His wrath.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.
Everyone knows that you punish people who disappoint you.<eos> Do not.<eos> I do not need to punish people.<eos> Sin is punishment itself.<eos> Even if it is difficult for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you consider a mess, Working for your good.
Even if it is difficult for you to accept, I'm in the middle of everything you consider a mess, Working for your good.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> After all the pain and suffering in the world, What kind of good thing Can it come from a little girl being murdered by a monster?<eos> You may not cause these things, But it certainly does not stop them.
That's what I do.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> After all the pain and suffering in the world, What kind of good thing Can it come from a little girl being murdered by a monster?<eos> You may not cause these things, But it certainly does not stop them.<eos> MacKenzie, you're trying to find feeling in your world. Based on a very incomplete image.

MacKenzie, you're trying to find feeling in your world. Based on a very incomplete image.<eos> It's like looking through the heart of your pain.<eos> The real underlying flaw in your life Is that you do not think I'm good.<eos> I am!<eos> And if you knew me and knew how much I love you, So even when you did not understand, You would know that I am working in your life for good.

And then you'd trust me.<eos> Trust in you?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> My daughter is dead.<eos> And there's nothing you can say Which will justify what happened to her.
And there's nothing you can say Which will justify what happened to her.<eos> Looking for output?<eos> If you are looking for your car, go there.<eos> Just after the trees.<eos> You may need this.
Just after the trees.<eos> You may need this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just to clarify, we're not trying to justify anything.<eos> We would like to heal you if you let us.
You may need this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just to clarify, we're not trying to justify anything.<eos> We would like to heal you if you let us.<eos> Before you go, There's something in the garden that I expected. That you could help me.
So beautiful.<eos> There is something very special that I want to plant here tomorrow.<eos> To prepare the soil, We have to dig up all the roots, Or they will return and undermine the new growth.<eos> But that's beautiful.<eos> You can start there.
It's all right.<eos> Caution.<eos> This one is deadly.<eos> What are you doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.
Caution.<eos> This one is deadly.<eos> What are you doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.<eos> Alone, The sap of that branch would kill you.
What are you doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You are presuming that poison is a bad thing.<eos> Alone, The sap of that branch would kill you.<eos> But combined with the nectar of this flower, Will suddenly contain incredible healing properties.<eos> Let me ask you, how much you trust In your ability to discern good from evil?
Or help those I love.<eos> And evil?<eos> It is harmful.<eos> It hurts someone I like.<eos> So, basically, you're the judge?
What do you think?<eos> It's still a mess.<eos> Yes, it is, Mack.<eos> Wild, wonderful, perfectly in process.<eos> This mess is you.
I'm thinking about it.<eos> Sarayu can be very persuasive, right?<eos> If you're smart enough to understand what she says.<eos> So if you are willing to walk, There's something on the other side of the lake. Which I would like to show.<eos> I just have to end up in the shed, And meet you there.
Mack!<eos> Mack, it's okay.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> It's not me.<eos> You told me to come here.
Good, Mack.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Now, let's get you off that boat.<eos> What?<eos> Did you hear me.
What?<eos> Did you hear me.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> I am not kidding.<eos> You can.
Must be about six inches.<eos> I've been trying to catch him for weeks.<eos> Why do not you order him to bite the bait?<eos> What would be the grace?<eos> You know, you really do not fit In the religious things they taught me.
Put your shoes on.<eos> I'll show you how.<eos> Go straight to the end of the path, and then... continues.<eos> Will not you come with me?<eos> This is a path that only you can follow.
Continues.<eos> Hello?<eos> Someone?<eos> Sorry I...<eos> Who are you?
Someone?<eos> Sorry I...<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am the Wisdom.<eos> Do you understand why you're here?
Do you understand why you're here?<eos> Not really.<eos> But I'm starting to get used to it.<eos> Today is an important day, with important consequences.<eos> You're here for a trial.
I do not think God loves his children well.<eos> If that's what you believe in...<eos> Come here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You can judge me from there.
If that's what you believe in...<eos> Come here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You can judge me from there.<eos> Judge you?
Come here.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You can judge me from there.<eos> Judge you?<eos> Do you have anything to confess?
Sit down.<eos> You can judge me from there.<eos> Judge you?<eos> Do you have anything to confess?<eos> You know what I did.
You can judge me from there.<eos> Judge you?<eos> Do you have anything to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes, but you are not being judged.
Judge you?<eos> Do you have anything to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes, but you are not being judged.<eos> Today, you are the judge.
Yes, but you are not being judged.<eos> Today, you are the judge.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> You spent your life judging everything and everyone, Actions and motivations.
Today, you are the judge.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> You spent your life judging everything and everyone, Actions and motivations.<eos> Like you only knew them.
What?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> You spent your life judging everything and everyone, Actions and motivations.<eos> Like you only knew them.<eos> You make shallow judgments, Just because of someone's color.
Like you only knew them.<eos> You make shallow judgments, Just because of someone's color.<eos> By the clothes.<eos> By body language.<eos> Because of this, You have experience, MacKenzie.
Or parents who discount their own suffering in their children?<eos> Let's not do that.<eos> Should that man be judged?<eos> Yes.<eos> You'll keep your mouth shut!
Yes.<eos> You'll keep your mouth shut!<eos> What about this kid?<eos> What about him?<eos> Would you judge him?
What about this kid?<eos> What about him?<eos> Would you judge him?<eos> Is a child.<eos> But you have already judged it.
Especially if he knew what would happen.<eos> You want me to say that?<eos> Absolutely!<eos> God is guilty.<eos> Well, if it's so easy for you to judge God... You must choose one of your children, To spend eternity in Heaven.
So, who will go to Hell?<eos> You can choose Kate.<eos> She said some very painful things.<eos> She pulled you away.<eos> You're not even sure if she still loves you.
You're not even sure if she still loves you.<eos> Or, you can choose Josh.<eos> He has been disobedient.<eos> He ran away, lied to you.<eos> Did not you know that?
I can not do this.<eos> Can not do what?<eos> I can not.<eos> I will not.<eos> You should do.
I can not.<eos> I will not.<eos> You should do.<eos> This is not a game.<eos> You have to do this.
This is not a game.<eos> You have to do this.<eos> Wants to know?<eos> That's not fair.<eos> You should do this.
I can not.<eos> Take me.<eos> I go in their place.<eos> I stand in their place.<eos> You will take me.
I stand in their place.<eos> You will take me.<eos> I go in their place.<eos> Leave my children alone and take me.<eos> MacKenzie, You have judged that your children are worthy of love,
He did not stop it.<eos> It does not stop many things that cause pain.<eos> What happened to Missy was a work of evil.<eos> And no one in your world is immune to this.<eos> You want the promise of a life without pain.
Can she see me?<eos> Do not.<eos> But she knows she's here.<eos> She is fine?<eos> More than you think.
Thank you for letting me see you.<eos> It was not my idea.<eos> It always works best when we do it together, do not you think?<eos> Does God have time to sunbathe?<eos> Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doing right now.
The pleasure was all mine.<eos> I can not describe The joy I felt when I saw you two together.<eos> And Missy is a special girl.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Now you understand.
After all I felt for you,<eos> Why continue working with me?<eos> That's what love does.<eos> I do not quite understand relationships, do you?<eos> But you still love me.
IT IS...<eos> Father.<eos> Mack, I'm sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> I was blind, I could not see you.
I know.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I did not know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.<eos> You became the father that I could not be.
We are almost there.<eos> We're here to do something. That will be very painful for you.<eos> Please do not.<eos> Son, We are in the process of healing to conclude That part of your journey.<eos> Do you want me to forgive you?
Yes.<eos> He killed my daughter.<eos> I want to hurt him.<eos> I want him to suffer... How he made me suffer.<eos> I want you to hurt him.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right. And that I know what's best.<eos> And then?<eos> Forgiveness does not establish a relationship.<eos> It's just relieving the lump in the throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.
It's just relieving the lump in the throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.<eos> It is stealing your joy. And deforming their ability to love.<eos> I can not.<eos> You are not arrested because you can not, He's stuck because he will not forgive.
Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.<eos> It is stealing your joy. And deforming their ability to love.<eos> I can not.<eos> You are not arrested because you can not, He's stuck because he will not forgive.<eos> You do not have to do it yourself.
You do not have to do it yourself.<eos> I'm here with you.<eos> I do not know how to forgive.<eos> Just say it out loud.<eos> I... I forgive... I forgive you.
I'm here with you.<eos> I do not know how to forgive.<eos> Just say it out loud.<eos> I... I forgive... I forgive you.<eos> MacKenzie, you're a blessing.
Maybe I have to forgive a thousand times Until it gets easier.<eos> But it will.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.
But it will.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.
Let's go.<eos> Let's take Missy home.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.
We've been collecting them for quite some time.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> MacKenzie, we have something to talk about.<eos> You can stay here with us, Or go home to Nan and her children.
MacKenzie, we have something to talk about.<eos> You can stay here with us, Or go home to Nan and her children.<eos> Anyway, we promise to be with you always.<eos> What about Missy?<eos> If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.
If you stay, we'll be with her this afternoon.<eos> If you leave, you'll leave her behind.<eos> But only for now.<eos> What does she want?<eos> She'd love to see you today.
To love my family.<eos> Do not know.<eos> What do I really care about?<eos> Completely.<eos> Mack, you're important, just like everything you do.
Mack, you're important, just like everything you do.<eos> Every time you love, Mack, or you forgive... In every act of kindness, The universe changes for the better.<eos> If something matters, then everything matters.<eos> So I want to go home.<eos> Good, Can we ask you to do something when you go?
Good, Can we ask you to do something when you go?<eos> Anything.<eos> Kate needs you.<eos> She blames herself for Missy's death.<eos> You had to deal with your own guilt.
Mack?<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack.<eos> Hi friend.<eos> Are you awake.
Mack.<eos> Hi friend.<eos> Are you awake.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You are in the hospital.
Are here.<eos> The nurse went to call them.<eos> They're in the cafeteria.<eos> What happened?<eos> Dude, you got hit by a truck.
What happened?<eos> Dude, you got hit by a truck.<eos> Yesterday?<eos> No, Friday.<eos> After you steal my truck.
No, Friday.<eos> After you steal my truck.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> I spent the weekend in the cabin.<eos> Mack, you never got there.
I knew God.<eos> Papa said to tell you that he loves you very much.<eos> Mack?<eos> Take a rest.<eos> Are you alright.
She is beautiful.<eos> She is very beautiful.<eos> Hi, champ.<eos> Hi dear.<eos> You are strong.
Thank you.<eos> Give me a minute with Kate.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You.
Over the next few weeks,<eos> Mack improved quickly.<eos> I know that some will ask If it all happened the way Mack remembers.<eos> Or if something like that actually happened.<eos> You'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose...
He'll give me $ 10 if I beat him.<eos> That's easy money.<eos> Did you bring me a stick?<eos> Choice.<eos> I brought it to you too if you're lucky.
Staying in confidence and wonder.<eos> I would not be surprised if, from time to time,<eos> Mack took off his shoes.<eos> Just to see if...<eos> Well, you know.
I know you did.<eos> Love you.<eos> - Hi, there.<eos> - Good morning, how are you doing?<eos> - Good, how are you?
Fun boat, you're gonna love it.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - I like this one. - How you doing, sir?<eos> - I'm good, how are you?
I'm... I'm Kevin, this is my wife, Julie.<eos> And I just want to say we're gonna be forever grateful for what you've done for us.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Listen, man, I want to help you.<eos> I want to save you and your family, okay?
I'll give you $40,000.<eos> How much is your family's life worth?<eos> I want one million dollars.<eos> I don't... I don't have a million dollars.<eos> But you're a doctor, right?
Y'all come down here and spend $10,000 on one vacation.<eos> That's more than I made this whole year, for four people.<eos> I need a million dollars or I'm leaving.<eos> Make up your mind.<eos> No, no, you can't leave us.
Make up your mind.<eos> No, no, you can't leave us.<eos> You can't leave us, you can't be serious.<eos> We'll die out here.<eos> You said you have a family, and I've offered you $40,000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't leave my family here.<eos> - One million dollars or no deal.<eos> - I don't have a million dollars.<eos> My son is six years old, you motherfucker.<eos> You can die here.
- Why are you doing this?<eos> - By the morning they're gonna die.<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> - Don't do anything stupid.<eos> Don't tell the police or anyone else, because if you do I won't tell anyone anything.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I gave you all that money.<eos> I swear on my son's life I will never tell anyone about this.<eos> You got the money.
I gave you everything I have.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Please just take me back to my family.<eos> I swear to God I'll never tell anybody.<eos> - How do I know you won't tell your government?
I'll never tell anybody, please!<eos> Don't let them die!<eos> Don't you let them die!<eos> Please!<eos> You've got the money!
We spoke on the phone.<eos> The US Embassy has been notified, and the US Coast Guard Captain will guide you through the rescue plan.<eos> - How's your leg?<eos> - I'll live.<eos> Now we're right here and these are the islands where you most likely made your initial landfall and then you drifted at sea for at least one full day and night more likely going north, northeast following the prevailing currents.
Where are you?<eos> This is starting to look very suspicious.<eos> What are you not telling me?<eos> I cannot just sit on my ass and wait for the sun to come up.<eos> I need you to tell me where you are, immediately.
That man is the only person who knows where my wife and my son are.<eos> - Sorry, sir, we can't...<eos> - Listen to me, the only person...<eos> Sir, we can't give out any patient's information unless you're a police.<eos> You should know that, you're a doctor, right?
I need his information for myself.<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - Please.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can.
"Miguel Kaba."<eos> I got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> I want you to wait here.<eos> A man is going to come with me.<eos> If you don't ask any questions I'm gonna give you another $100.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> - Do not touch my daughter!<eos> - I just need to know where Miguel is.<eos> - I don't know!<eos> I swear to you, I'm not gonna hurt your child or you.
GPC9243.<eos> - Take me back there.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Take me back there right this fucking second.<eos> - You kidnapped my wife and my son!
There's nothing else that I can do for you, listen...<eos> - ...my hands are tied. I'm trying to help...<eos> - What if you're wrong?<eos> It doesn't matter. Mr. Riley, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me, you are under investigation.
Actually, the lease was terminated on the slip yesterday.<eos> - Are you saying that the boat isn't there?<eos> - That's right, man.<eos> Sorry, but your fishing trip might not happen after all.<eos> You know, you can rent a boat from one of the locals if you want.
- Jorge has a cell phone.<eos> - Mr. Riley, you have got to understand...<eos> - The fisherman called Jorge on his phone when we left the bank.<eos> Being on the run, you are making your case infinitely harder.<eos> Jorge definitely has a cell phone, so the only way I'm gonna give myself up is if you... you trace his calls you get him, you bring him to Main Square at noon and you have yourself, the police, and a translator.
Look on this map.<eos> Where is my family?<eos> Which island, which island?<eos> Jorge. Jorge! Jorge!<eos> You have to look!
I want you to meet Uncle Ray.<eos> Why is that woman crying?<eos> Who can say?<eos> Probably a love thing.<eos> Do you love anybody?
- I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?
These are the worst.<eos> I hate optimistic people.<eos> They bum me out with their upbeat attitude.<eos> All they ever do is make me feel more alone.<eos> Are you real?
You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."<eos> Stupid.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
People will go nuts.<eos> Everything for a hundred bucks.<eos> On the table.<eos> I mean, well, name your price.<eos> And what about you?
And what about you?<eos> Well, see, I still... I get to live here while it goes on.<eos> It's kind of like a living showroom.<eos> Never been done.<eos> You're crazy.
You've got the gene for it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.
I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I never believed in the first place, but you, you wake up every morning disappointed to find the world the way it is because you're a dreamer.
Now... when my junky nephew and Jill bore a child, I simply wanted to have the little bean brought up properly.<eos> Of course, I was foolish enough to let her stay in the child's life.<eos> It was a tangled web indeed, but now I intend to clear the situation up, once and for all.<eos> You can have it.<eos> You get the card, Jill gets the girl.
USA!<eos> USA!<eos> USA!<eos> Wolverine.<eos> I knew it was you.
I knew it was you.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Please!<eos> I'm in trouble!<eos> You're the only one that could help!
Fuck, fuck!<eos> No, Mr. Esperanza, no.<eos> I know I said June, but I need the boat now.<eos> Why would that mean the price go up?<eos> Listen to me. I know you wanted 70...
Laura!<eos> Honey, you wanna stay where you are.<eos> You wanna see your friends, right?<eos> Command, stop.<eos> You said alive or dead.
- Uh, no, thanks.<eos> - That would be lovely!<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Zander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...<eos> But you need to rest, don't you?<eos> Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.<eos> The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.<eos> We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
Get the hell out of here.<eos> - You okay, boss?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Go!<eos> You've had training.
He's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!<eos> I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.<eos> Your friends had every chance.<eos> And so did you.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell... that nice little girl out in the waiting room... her daddy's gone.<eos> I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.
Any, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> - Fever, listlessness?<eos> He seems fine.<eos> - And you say he hasn't eaten in five days?
Did you find them?<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> I told you I would.<eos> I don't know why you keep hiding things in Daddy's office.<eos> You know how he gets when we touch his things.
No.<eos> Gretchen, it's me.<eos> It's me.<eos> So you believe me, doctor?<eos> You actually believe me?
What's up, bro?<eos> Come over here<eos> Your pockets were empty, I filled them.<eos> Right<eos> You gave me a flat, now fix it
I'll go one more round blind<eos> I'll check mine.<eos> Salaam Alaikum, Seth<eos> Salaam<eos> You bring me good luck, my Ace
I'll check mine.<eos> Salaam Alaikum, Seth<eos> Salaam<eos> You bring me good luck, my Ace<eos> You're funny, Seth
- No, Seth<eos> He'll set up his own business.<eos> It's not like that<eos> So you must've decided about vendors and distribution<eos> You are here.
Move it!<eos> God keep you<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Careful!<eos> You'd have killed it!
Careful<eos> Raees<eos> Hey, speak up.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> You bartered your motorbike for the car, and now the car for the goats
We're going to Mumbai?<eos> !<eos> We have to pay 100,000 to Jairaj in three days.<eos> Do you have a better plan?<eos> Do you have one?
Waleikom Salaam<eos> Can we set up shop in the corner?<eos> - Whose goats are they?<eos> - Mine<eos> Do you have the permission?
And here you are eating away!<eos> The biryani is worth 100,000.<eos> You should have some<eos> I could eat a horse!<eos> Well, you hardly took a beating.
Take the money and scoot.<eos> Move it<eos> Musa sent it for you<eos> He told us to kill Musa, and now he says he's Musa's man<eos> Who are you?
Now, please don't point that finger!<eos> I am Hasmukh bhai's guest.<eos> Whose guest are you?<eos> I am Hasmukh bhai.<eos> You are Hasmukh bhai?
Whose guest are you?<eos> I am Hasmukh bhai.<eos> You are Hasmukh bhai?<eos> Yes<eos> You are Hasmukh bhai?
That's me<eos> Your smile proves it<eos> - Is this your party?<eos> - Of course<eos> So you're serving people hooch.
Release them<eos> Sir, my name is Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar<eos> Ambalal is my late father<eos> Even if his spirit asks me to release Hasmukh bhai and his party, I'll take it in writing.<eos> And you are merely...!
He'll come to his senses<eos> Come on, bowl.<eos> Bowl him out, Sadiq!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You are out!
I love you I love you I love you<eos> I love you<eos> Awesome!<eos> Really?<eos> Not you
Father's down with cough again<eos> Salaam Alaikum, doctor.<eos> Waleikom Asalaam<eos> Something's wrong with my eyes<eos> It's you!
Okay<eos> And send the duffer in<eos> Yes, dear<eos> Here you are<eos> You are next
- Do you agree?<eos> - I do<eos> - Agree?<eos> - I do, sir<eos> You are married!
Hang on<eos> Catch<eos> The clock will be ticking<eos> Pull!<eos> You cut the wrong kite
It soars higher and higher<eos> The heart soars higher and higher like a kite<eos> As the two hearts soar, they unite high up in the skies<eos> I had no idea that the melody of your love would stir my heartstrings<eos> Neither did I know that you would traipse into my heart and stay for ever
He is completely floored<eos> That's me! Laila<eos> O Laila<eos> These moments are so enchanting My eyes are playing games with me<eos> You are here I can't believe my eyes
Laila<eos> O Laila<eos> O Laila<eos> They call you Laila<eos> That's you! Laila
O cruel one<eos> I'm drunk in your love Don't intoxicate me more, O cruel one O cruel one<eos> Those eyes, mesmerizing Your words, alluring I fall head over heels for you a hundred times over<eos> My heart ceased to be mine, ever since I fell in love with you<eos> You are the one who beats in my heart
Why should I alone express my love?<eos> Why don't you express it, too?<eos> Please do<eos> You are going to kill me some day, Your defence indeed is deadly<eos> You are the beginning You are the end
Please do<eos> You are going to kill me some day, Your defence indeed is deadly<eos> You are the beginning You are the end<eos> The story of my love is all about you<eos> You are my leading light Until death do us part, O my cruel lover
It's a boy, sir<eos> Congratulations!<eos> What have you named him?<eos> Faizan<eos> For a Hindu father, you give your son a Muslim name.
We even stole Gandhiji's spectacles!<eos> It was foolish, seriously.<eos> Your signal saved me that day, too<eos> Else, he'd have thrashed me<eos> You say it was foolish but I did it out of Miss Ratna's fear
The mill shut down<eos> The owner even refused compensation<eos> He's gone!<eos> 'So what if five laborers die? '<eos> 'You will employ twenty-five more' 'to fill your coffers'
'You will employ twenty-five more' 'to fill your coffers'<eos> - Bhimani Seth.<eos> - What is it?<eos> The laborers toiled for you for years.<eos> You must give them what is rightfully theirs.
It's really very beautiful<eos> Why did you have to do this?<eos> It's not a gift, son<eos> It's our blessings to you<eos> You helped us get our money and saved our families
You know Damla Seth<eos> - Aasiya, this is the CM.<eos> - Hello<eos> Let's have a drink<eos> You drink like a fish here, and in the parliament, you take to sloganeering 'Ban liquor, save Gujarat'
Deal, Raees<eos> You are right, sir<eos> Damla is here with Raees<eos> The Chief Minister and Pasha bhai are also here<eos> You quit the city but you haven't forgotten Raees
Involuntarily, Raees pulled me closer to him<eos> From this spot, I could hear his very heartbeat<eos> From this point to that,<eos> Twenty acres of land has been transferred to you<eos> You have made a huge investment
Besides, the liquor agenda is my ticket to victory<eos> This gimmick is inevitable.<eos> You know, Pasha, your procession will hamper my business<eos> Why don't we find a way out?<eos> You find a way out, I'll take the procession out
Yes, Popat<eos> Hot news<eos> Before it cools down, break it to the press<eos> 'Raees issues an open threat' 'If Pasha takes out a procession, it will be his final journey'<eos> You torched his castle, and he has no idea what hit him!
The winds blow south, Sadiq<eos> To be free again, I must win the elections<eos> Is it easy to win elections?<eos> We'll need votes as well as cash<eos> You organize the cash
That's Raees<eos> The name's Raees<eos> He is Raees<eos> He's a class apart<eos> I told you, you'd be the first to see Our World when I make it
Lions rule for ages<eos> Try tea from Our World.<eos> Come here, kid<eos> It might change your perception.<eos> To me, you are still the same
Run, Raees!<eos> I won't run<eos> I'm not a coward, Sadiq!<eos> I'm not!<eos> You are innocent.
Take Faizan and Aasiya to Sanjanwala's<eos> Now.<eos> Right now!<eos> You know that it's the only safest place for them<eos> - And you?
- Make preparations.<eos> - Sir<eos> - Now!<eos> - Listen up!<eos> You betrayed me, Musa
Says here you pressed domestic violence charges three years ago against your alleged assailant, Michael Vargas.
Fuck!<eos> Help, you gotta help me.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> You've handled this very poorly.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
You gotta help me.<eos> You've handled this very poorly.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> No, no, no! Argh!<eos> It was you.
You've handled this very poorly.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> No, no, no! Argh!<eos> It was you.<eos> You did this.
Anything you're not physically capable of doing?<eos> No.<eos> Anything you don't like doing?<eos> I like it all.<eos> You like cleaning toilets?
My piece-of-shit car is literally falling apart.<eos> My kid and my wife are two states away, so when I tell you I would do anything, Ma'am... I mean anything.<eos> Listen, I go through this everyday and it never gets any easier.<eos> Just do me a favor: black minimum wage into my profile there.<eos> But you're a Captain so you're entitled to be awarded...
Hello?<eos> Great.<eos> Hey!<eos> There we go!<eos> You OK, Sir?
Next week's my daughter's birthday.<eos> It would be quite a great homecoming.<eos> I just want to say, Dr. Greiss, that I'm feeling a lot better today than I was yesterday, and yesterday I was feeling better than before that and tomorrow I'm gonna feel better.<eos> Doctor, please!<eos> You already helped me, Dr. Greiss, I'm fine!
Countless locals have explored the vacant buildings of Eloise and reported chilling tales of hearing voices or screams and in some cases, seeing apparitions or even ghosts of deceased patients and staff roaming the asylum's empty, decrepit corridors,<eos> prisoners still.<eos> One former patient was reported as saying, "People tried to escape all the time."<eos> "But once you're committed into Eloise, you can't leave."<eos> "You can never leave."
Hello, Pia.<eos> My name is Detective Frazer.<eos> I'd like to ask you a couple questions, if you don't mind.<eos> Some kids found the body of this man at Eloise two days ago.<eos> In your statement, you had mentioned a Dell Richards.
We did find your brother's remains.<eos> The gas explosion was so intense that only dental records were able to make the positive ID.<eos> But we can't find Jacob Martin.<eos> During the course of my investigation,<eos> I've come across some things that are very strange, and I'm hoping that you can help me wrap my mind around them.
During the course of my investigation,<eos> I've come across some things that are very strange, and I'm hoping that you can help me wrap my mind around them.<eos> This is an old case file from a patient at Eloise.<eos> In it is Jacob Martin's birth certificate and these.<eos> Can you explain these, Pia?
Oh, you scared of a little straight razor?<eos> Come on!<eos> What's up, man, how you doing?<eos> I'm good, man.<eos> Yeah, I can see, you're like the GQ of delinquency.
Uh, yeah, it just says here that it's been remitted to the Annex, per Dr. H. H. Greiss.<eos> Oh yes.<eos> The Annex is where we keep all our nonpublic records.<eos> Sealed even to me.<eos> You'll need a court order.
Ah... and uh...<eos> How long will that take?<eos> We could put in the request right now, we'd hear back in six or seven months...<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Um... yeah, is there any way we could maybe just, you know, bend the rules a little bit on this just once?
You can use anything you want as long as you return it.<eos> This is Dr. Greiss, known for his famous confrontational therapy.<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Oh, do you want to see my favorite thing?<eos> Doctor, your critics have been extremely vocal about this radical, what do you call it?
Oh, do you want to see my favorite thing?<eos> Doctor, your critics have been extremely vocal about this radical, what do you call it?<eos> Confrontational Therapy.<eos> Some liken it to torture.<eos> What do you say about that?
I know, and he's all I've got and I won't have him taken advantage of.<eos> He is obsessed with that place and if he wanders off or something happens...<eos> Quick in, quick out.<eos> I'll watch him, I promise.<eos> You'll watch him?
I'll watch him, I promise.<eos> You'll watch him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - In Eloise?<eos> I think you're gonna have your hands full keeping up with him.
Quiet down please, take your seats.<eos> Quiet down.<eos> We have two interesting case studies today.<eos> This patient suffers from an acute form of claustrophobia.<eos> The most severe and frightening of which is specifically... the fear of waking up and discovering... that you're buried alive.
Clear the hospital!<eos> Clear the hospital!<eos> This way!<eos> Let's clear the floors now!<eos> You need to exit, everybody exit the building.
- Roger that.<eos> So what're you gonna do when you get back to the world, Chapman?<eos> I'm already set up with Eastern Air Lines.<eos> Grace and Billy all moved in in Atlanta, just waiting on me.<eos> What about you, sir?
You came here looking for a tracker.<eos> Who or what am I tracking?<eos> This is all the information that we have.<eos> Okay? There is no map. Only satellite images.<eos> So we need someone like you, with your skill your unique expertise in uncharted jungle terrain...
- Yeah.<eos> The guy's wound pretty tight.<eos> Well, the man's a decorated war hero.<eos> That's the package they come in.<eos> And you?
- How you doing?<eos> - I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> Good. Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.<eos> - But today...<eos> - So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> - Who are you?
Did you crash here?<eos> Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hotdog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.
Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> You are more beautiful than a hotdog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.<eos> But you're real.
You need to listen to us!<eos> - We're not at war.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!
Don't tell me you've never been to Mitchell.<eos> I can't say I have.<eos> I did send a bunch of resumes out last week, but I don't recall sending anything to Mitchell.<eos> Well, Fred, who owns the royal lodge, he sent it to me.<eos> He knew I was looking for someone like you.
Millard Verus Colvin.<eos> Counsel, it's my understanding that you've been successful in reaching an agreement today to settle this case out of court, is that correct?<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> That's correct, your honor.<eos> And Mr. Colvin, I understand that you are currently serving a five-year sentence for being an accessory to kidnapping, harassment and assault.
That's correct, your honor.<eos> And Mr. Colvin, I understand that you are currently serving a five-year sentence for being an accessory to kidnapping, harassment and assault.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> And it's my understanding that you are in agreement that you are going to transfer all of the inherited assets that you received from the late Mildred Colvin to Ms. Millard.
And Mr. Colvin, I understand that you are currently serving a five-year sentence for being an accessory to kidnapping, harassment and assault.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> And it's my understanding that you are in agreement that you are going to transfer all of the inherited assets that you received from the late Mildred Colvin to Ms. Millard.<eos> Not limited to, but also including the Oregon hotel, the gas station and the surrounding property, and I need to assure that you are entering into this agreement voluntarily of your own free will.
And counsel, it is also my further understanding that your client, Ms. Millard, has agreed to accept these assets in full settlement of this suit.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> Ms. Millard.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, you have to speak out loud.<eos> Here you to.
And afterwards...<eos> Well! You couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly. No one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.
Just to meet you.<eos> And he's dying.<eos> I don't know who you are, or why you're doing this.<eos> I am not his father.<eos> Well, then who are you, because that is you in the photo, and that is this house.
Hot dogs.<eos> It's all edible.<eos> All edible, except the squeal.<eos> - So you're the other Mirando.<eos> - And you are?
You already have a shitload of money.<eos> - Please.<eos> - This is business.<eos> Hey, Nancy!<eos> I hold all creatures dear to my heart, but you are crying out to be an exception.
Uh, me and my friends are renting your place out in sun prairie.<eos> 37 oak Dale?<eos> Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.<eos> Are you with them?<eos> You have a weird house, Mr. daizy.
Yeah, have a seat.<eos> Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "this is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.
I brush a few more.<eos> "Well, it's still a wall."<eos> But...<eos> What if I remove every single atom from this wall except for one?<eos> And you've seen me brush every single atom from this wall except for that one atom, and I point to it and I say,
You really think the truth-- honesty-- is the best policy?<eos> -I do.<eos> -Always?<eos> When wouldn't it be?<eos> You have kids?
-Always?<eos> When wouldn't it be?<eos> You have kids?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You have kids.
Maybe.<eos> You have kids.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> What if you saw the worst crime scene ever?
Don't say it.<eos> What if you saw the worst crime scene ever?<eos> A mass murder at a school.<eos> With dead bodies and brains and students and sneakers with blood on them.<eos> And you go home, and your kids say,
Hi, Mrs. Watkins.<eos> Hi,Elliot.<eos> I've been having some really strange thoughts about that bye bye man since we talked.<eos> Mrs. Watkins.<eos> Mrs. Watkins, you can't talk to anyone about it.
I said leave.<eos> Are you deaf or just defective?<eos> Mrs. redmon, did your husband write for the register a long time ago?<eos> You're too young to remember that.<eos> Mrs. redmon, you're still alive.
- But that's your truck.<eos> - I know it's my truck.<eos> I can't talk to you about this here. I told you.<eos> Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was. I'll tell you.
Never had to get out of my chair.<eos> What's your Skype handle, Doc? I'll, uh, saddle up.<eos> MiddleburyDoc.<eos> Be right with you, Doc.<eos> There you are, Doc.
So?<eos> Say what you came here to say.<eos> We have a feeling something is wrong.<eos> We don't know exactly what it is, but we need someone else who knows him extremely well to have a talk with him and afterwards tell us what you think.<eos> This is extremely important, Diane, and it involves something that you know about, and that's enough said about that.
Margaret, what can I do for you?<eos> Hawk.<eos> My log has a message for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Something is missing, and you have to find it.
I couldn't stand out in the parking lot all night.<eos> I hate cellular phones.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Lucy, hang up the phone.<eos> But you're in the mountains... fishing!
I don't understand it either, Andy.<eos> You collect yourself.<eos> I've got to go see Sheriff Truman.<eos> I know she seems like a strange one, but her information has always been spoton.<eos> So... Margaret says that something is missing having to do with Special Agent Dale Cooper and only you can find... because of something about your heritage.
I'm fine, Tammy.<eos> And who is Phillip Jeffries?<eos> He's a former FBI agent.<eos> You're wearing a wire, Tammy.<eos> You asked me to.
Sure did, pal.<eos> Hello!<eos> Mega, mega jackpot.<eos> Congratulations, sir.<eos> You are a mega winner.
As happy as this news makes us, Albert, we can't put this on the radio.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I've been dying to see Mount Rushmore.<eos> It's good you want to hurry.<eos> We fly at dawn, and, Tammy, you're coming with us.
Great.<eos> Yeah, well, not great.<eos> You think you're some sort of hotshot?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This résumé is one of the worst written I've ever seen, and you didn't even fill out this form properly.
Not even close.<eos> It's incomplete.<eos> It's worse than sloppy.<eos> I wanted to see you to tell you that if you ever want to find work anyplace, then you better get your act together, do things properly, and start showing some respect for a possible future employer,<eos> because based on this shit, you'd never get hired here, and I would never recommend you for any work, anyplace.
Yeah.<eos> When do you get those tests back?<eos> Sheriff Truman?<eos> Your wife is here.<eos> She went to your office, and you weren't there.
Your wife is here.<eos> She went to your office, and you weren't there.<eos> I could have told her that.<eos> Hold on a minute.<eos> She is now walking to Deputy Chief Hawk's office, where you are.
You're fucking fired.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Leave town.<eos> Don't ever come back.<eos> You.
Get him out of here.<eos> Leave town.<eos> Don't ever come back.<eos> You.<eos> You got his job.
II gotta pick up Linda's mail at the P.O.<eos> Sure, Mickey.<eos> Bill.<eos> Beautiful morning?<eos> You, you go into town about this time every day, don't you?
You've certainly given me a lot to think about.<eos> Think about.<eos> Dougie? You're an...<eos> An interesting fellow.<eos> You Jones?
Use the ladies' room, Chad.<eos> The hell are you doing?<eos> Please, Chad, use another restroom.<eos> Clear this with the sheriff?<eos> I'll tell him if you don't.
Um, I-I'll meet you there in two hours.<eos> 4:30, then.<eos> P-please leave.<eos> Please leave now.<eos> Is that you, Doc?
What's your Skype handle, Doc?<eos> I'll, uh, saddle up.<eos> MiddleburyDoc.<eos> Be right with you, Doc.<eos> There you are, Doc.
So?<eos> Say what you came here to say.<eos> We have a feeling something is wrong.<eos> We don't know exactly what it is, but we need someone else who knows him extremely well to have a talk with him and afterwards tell us what you think.<eos> This is extremely important, Diane, and it involves something that you know about, and that's enough said about that.
And we're very appreciative.<eos> What'd you say your name was, again?<eos> Tammy.<eos> Fuck you, Tammy.<eos> I knew it was going to be you.
Do you remember that night?<eos> I'll always remember that night.<eos> Same for me.<eos> I'll never forget it.<eos> Who are you?
That dog had four legs.<eos> One you found in my trunk.<eos> The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now.<eos> Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me.<eos> How do I know you know anything about... this?
What's your wife's name?"<eos> "Phyllis," I said.<eos> I didn't kill Ruth.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> You... you have to believe me.
I...<eos> I've never...<eos> I've...<eos> I've never read anything like it.<eos> You don't know.
Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Harold?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?
Has found its way nicely to Marks.<eos> Up the field.<eos> Oh, that's a lovely ball.<eos> Back again...<eos> Who are you?
Up the field.<eos> Oh, that's a lovely ball.<eos> Back again...<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
I'm here to help.<eos> There you go.<eos> You've been poisoned by Madame Gao's synthetic heroin.<eos> - You know her?<eos> Who are you?
Miss...<eos> We can pack these artifacts ourselves.<eos> You can leave now.<eos> Bye bye!<eos> You are more popular than these artifacts.
Doctor, how are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm Zhu Xiaoguang, Professor Chen's TA.<eos> You're Zhu Xiaoguang?
- Enjoy it.<eos> You won't be joining us?<eos> No, I've been fasting lately.<eos> I'll just have some of this.<eos> So, you're into fasting over here as well.
I'll just have some of this.<eos> So, you're into fasting over here as well.<eos> Yeah, Chinese fasting is very similar to Indian...<eos> Au revoid (French: Goodbye).<eos> You mean Upavase (Fasting)?
Look at you.<eos> Haven't seen you all these years.<eos> Now you look just like your dad.<eos> When I was little, didn't you say I was better looking than my dad?<eos> You are a smart-aleck like your dad, for sure.
No, I am not like him.<eos> You are both archaeologists.<eos> I am only a treasure hunter.<eos> Your dad also thought he was hunting for treasures.<eos> It seems you want to finish off what he started.
You are both archaeologists.<eos> I am only a treasure hunter.<eos> Your dad also thought he was hunting for treasures.<eos> It seems you want to finish off what he started.<eos> On the phone, you said you have a nice surprise for me.
This is Dr. Ashmita.<eos> It's a real pleasure.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Jones, this is my... - Let me guess.<eos> You must be Dr. Ashmita's assistant?
- Hi!<eos> Where is Xiaoguang?<eos> Xiaoguang!<eos> Hi, I am Xiaoguang.<eos> Do you remember the treasure your father was searching for his entire life?
If you want to have a good look at it, we can work together.<eos> Archaeology...<eos> Treasure hunting...<eos> That's not hunting treasures.<eos> You raid tombs, which is illegal.
Sometimes means no.<eos> Why not?<eos> Couldn't find a worthy partner.<eos> Just listen to yourself.<eos> This is why I think you are like your dad.
Sorry, I got them mixed up.<eos> "Ten feet ahead is not too far to strike."<eos> "A close hit..." Loosen up.<eos> "...is within an inch."<eos> You say one thing and do another.
Found the vanished Magadha treasures for the Tang Dynasty in AD 647.<eos> The location is about 30 meters under the ice surface, inside a huge ice cave.<eos> Another tremendous discovery of yours.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You are a part of it.
You see?<eos> There's a whip.<eos> Hey pal, I'm not here for vacation.<eos> I know.<eos> Tomorrow, you must win the bid for the diamond for me.
I finally won!<eos> Xiaoguang, where are you?<eos> By the pool.<eos> I don't see him here.<eos> What about you?
What favor?<eos> If it were 1.5 million, I can help you.<eos> Now, we are talking about 150 million.<eos> It's the key to the treasures...<eos> I know you are the best archaelogist.
I don't want to hear it!<eos> Just wait.<eos> Maybe someone will make a bid.<eos> Sold!<eos> Dad, you are so posh!
Oh man!<eos> Sorry brother, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why did you steal the diamond?<eos> You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else?
Stop finding excuses.<eos> If we don't bring the diamond back, because of you, professor will have to take the blame for stealing cultural relics.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Perhaps we will find the secret behind the diamond.<eos> Now you say "perhaps."
What are you guys doing here?<eos> None of your business!<eos> Listen to me...<eos> Why are you fighting?<eos> - You, come here!
- How's your heart?<eos> - Dad!<eos> Go!<eos> How's your heart?<eos> You broke my heart!
Honour to meet you.<eos> Nice meeting you!<eos> And you've come all the way from China.<eos> Yes.<eos> Is that you?
There's no need for that, I've come for the diamond, Princess.<eos> Jack, thank you for helping me find it.<eos> I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry.<eos> But I had no other way of making sure you'd come to India.<eos> After all, you're China's greatest archaeologist.
Watch closely.<eos> Find out where they are taking them.<eos> Hello Jack.<eos> The boss is waiting for you.<eos> And you, you have to stay in the car.
Please, come with me.<eos> Jack!<eos> Welcome to my humble oasis.<eos> Let me show you around.<eos> Actually, you look better without them.
Let them go.<eos> I don't care about the diamond.<eos> I care about you... helping me, open that treasure.<eos> I don't know if I can.<eos> Aren't you the greatest archaeologist in China?
Be careful!<eos> I guess the professor's not going to save us now, huh?<eos> We'll find a way.<eos> How?<eos> I mean, I know you're smart, but how?
But I'm gonna die now!<eos> I don't wanna die now.<eos> Stop crying, come on.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> You have a running nose now, come on.
- Jump!<eos> - OK.<eos> Xiaoguang!<eos> Now what?<eos> How you got in, we would get out the same way.
- OK.<eos> Xiaoguang!<eos> Now what?<eos> How you got in, we would get out the same way.<eos> When Xiaoguang asks you to run to him, you run as fast as you can.
Jack!<eos> Hold tight.<eos> I... I can't!<eos> Don't let go!<eos> OK, you're safe.
This is a treasure.<eos> It has the power to transform all of us.<eos> Now, according to Indian law...<eos> Don't try to teach me the law of my country.<eos> I know better than you.
Put it down.<eos> Honey!<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?
Come on, you pieces of shit!<eos> You want some, too?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> Who are you?
Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.<eos> You are walking into some weird-ass shit.<eos> Jessica Jones, stop talking.<eos> Hi, this is over.<eos> Who the hell are you?
If you grab me like that again, I'll punch you so hard, you'll see.<eos> - I've been here before.<eos> - Why are following me?<eos> - And you're in serious danger.<eos> - What kind of lawyer are you?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.<eos> This... is one shitty excuse for a hideout.<eos> Stick.<eos> Matty.<eos> Who the hell are you?
- About my dad again?<eos> About what happened.<eos> You said so yourself. He got mixed up with the mob or something.<eos> - Wasn't the mob.<eos> - Sorry. Who are you?
- Warm.<eos> Is this for free?<eos> Of course.<eos> You get to keep it.<eos> So, it's going to feel warm for a few days, then you and the media band will get used to each other, but it has to touch the skin to work.
- And I'm gonna see you next week, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Just a little FYI.<eos> I'm having this mindfulness retreat at Esalen next month.<eos> No pressure, but if you and Mickey felt that it would be, uh, valuable to you two...
Nothing. You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.<eos> This kingdom is mine and mine alone.<eos> All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you its privileges, sir.
It's not what he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.<eos> If you really wanna make him happy, if you wanna be happy, you'll let him go.<eos> There's no way that someone like you could ever understand what we have.
Yeah, you really are.<eos> Did you see his face?<eos> And you were knocked unconscious before the attack?<eos> Can you remember where you were or what you were doing when that happened?<eos> Were you tied up, Trish?
We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.<eos> I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.<eos> You will survive this.
Yes.<eos> Who did this to me?<eos> Have you got your front door keys?<eos> All right, sweetheart?<eos> Do you live by yourself, Trish?
Does anyone else have keys?<eos> Erm, Annie, a neighbor two doors down.<eos> Er, also Cath, my mate.<eos> We saw you had an invite to Cath's party last Saturday.<eos> Did you go to that, Trish?
Was it someone at the party?<eos> Erm, I was outside... and someone hit me on the back of the head, knocked me out.<eos> Cath's party was Saturday night.<eos> It's now Tuesday morning.<eos> So what did you do... between Saturday night and reporting the attack last night?
No. Sorry.<eos> Is there anyone I can call to be with you?<eos> No.<eos> A friend, or a relative?<eos> Did you not hear me?
A friend, or a relative?<eos> Did you not hear me?<eos> OK.<eos> I don't want anyone knowing.<eos> Trish, you need support.
We're meeting women in crisis.<eos> Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.<eos> You've got something special to offer, Beth.
Tell him, will you?<eos> I have been, for half an hour.<eos> Worried I'm gonna spoil your sales, Mag?<eos> That's not what I'm saying and you know it.<eos> You gave me the interviews.
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.<eos> The most talented chemist in the German army.<eos> I am a friend.<eos> I hope I'm not causing...<eos> I know you and General Ludendorff are... very close.
I know you and General Ludendorff are... very close.<eos> We work well together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tell me some one like me behind you... I could provide a lot more.<eos> And who are you?
Tell me some one like me behind you... I could provide a lot more.<eos> And who are you?<eos> A man who shows you appreciation a genius like yourself deserves.<eos> I love fire.<eos> Don't you?
A God who requires human sacrifices.<eos> And in exchange... war gives man purpose... meaning, a chance to rise... above his petty, mortal little self... and be courageous... Noble!<eos> _ Only one of the many Gods believed in that. - Um.<eos> - And he was wrong.<eos> You know nothing of the Gods.
Okay.<eos> Oh, goodness.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a pain...<eos> Forget it, it's not a big deal.<eos> You're in my seat.
Look, lady, what's the difference?<eos> If you don't want to sit here, you can just sit someplace else.<eos> Listen, you fucker.<eos> I don't want to sit somewhere else.<eos> My ticket says seat 44A and you're in my seat.
I'm gonna need you to return to your seat.<eos> Terry, I can't decide.<eos> And they also have strawberry cheesecake.<eos> Now, do I get the strawberry cheesecake or the butterscotch pudding thing?<eos> Are you okay?
I didn't get your name.<eos> Gretchen Blair.<eos> I'm a federal agent.<eos> Okay, I'm Luke Byres...<eos> You're the air marshal.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.<eos> You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.<eos> You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.<eos> What's that?<eos> You.
- I wouldn't recommend that.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's Top 10 Most Wanted list. - Top 10.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. That's all right.<eos> - Well, not you, Roman.
- Hurry up?<eos> - No more patience.<eos> Have a mint.<eos> - How can I help you, gentlemen?<eos> - You are so fucked.
It's always about money.<eos> It's Lew the Jew, come on, you need a few bucks?<eos> No, don't need money.<eos> But here is the deal we are gonna make you.<eos> You are gonna make Lew the Jew a very generous offer for all the shit that you've done to his apartment building.
Okay, this, uh... is a moment for me to call the police.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, good, well, you can show them this because right there, that is a signed...<eos> - Notarized.<eos> - Sworn affidavit by a Salvatore Lopez the graffiti artist that you hired to paint all over Lew the Jew's buildings so the Chinese would drop their offer and you could buy for less.
man: This just arrived for you, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The whores are freed.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> No, you're not.
Thank you.<eos> The whores are freed.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're not finished.
Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother?<eos> !<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
Britain and the United States are currently at war.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.<eos> You have two hours to get out.
This Nootka Sound is a curse.<eos> It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> This programme contains some strong language and some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> So, you've no problem with the principle of obeying me, just the execution.
Execution?<eos> Of Delaney.<eos> I told you to take care of it.<eos> It is taking a little longer than I anticipated.<eos> If you open up that ball of paper, you'll see notice of your dismissal from the East India, dated two days hence.
To keep things safe.<eos> What things?<eos> And Brace?<eos> Go to hell!<eos> You marched with Tremain.
March where?<eos> For what bloody purpose?<eos> For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.<eos> What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?
While we're on the subject of housekeeping,<eos> I mean to have a word with you about food.<eos> You're hungry?<eos> No.<eos> Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.
James Delaney.<eos> Well, look at you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?
As you may recall,<eos> I'm going to write a book one day about all I know about the world.<eos> I don't care.<eos> And I've been to most places, but not the devil's back yard where you went.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw, and the smallest?
"Say he falls in, the current takes him, how about that?"<eos> So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard"
So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard"<eos> "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."
He's dead.<eos> Well, £15... £15.<eos> ..and the return of your horse.<eos> I will give you £15, minus the heels on my boots... and I will need your eyes and ears from now on as well.<eos> Yeah, well, the enemies you're stirring up, James, you'll be needing them, my boy.
One can only imagine.<eos> Solomon Coop, your Highness.<eos> How is your TOE this morning?<eos> My toe is the first item of business.<eos> You evidently don't read the papers.
Solomon Coop, your Highness.<eos> How is your TOE this morning?<eos> My toe is the first item of business.<eos> You evidently don't read the papers.<eos> Oh, you mean the blockade?
Fuck them!<eos> Now, the red crosses are the positions of the American ships.<eos> They are attempting to blockade our trading routes to the West.<eos> And the blue crosses are the Royal Navy ships, um, preparing to engage.<eos> Why did you make the Americans red?
Now, the red crosses are the positions of the American ships.<eos> They are attempting to blockade our trading routes to the West.<eos> And the blue crosses are the Royal Navy ships, um, preparing to engage.<eos> Why did you make the Americans red?<eos> Why did you make them red?
My body was England.<eos> I was an island...<eos> Coop, pay attention!<eos> All these shrimps, like devils, with little bows and arrows, were surrounding me, firing into my flesh.<eos> You really must try and drink more from the green bottle and less from the pink.
It was a premonition.<eos> The shrimps were the American ships.<eos> Hear me, Coop.<eos> I am lying in the ocean like a whale and no-one in my Privy Council will raise a musket barrel!<eos> You sail this close to my nose, a kind of classless rebels, and you show me red crosses.
What the fuck is this?<eos> Oh, it's, um, from the East India.<eos> Fuck them as well.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Who are you?
To save your life.<eos> Mistress Helga gave information to a man with a silver tooth.<eos> I spy on her.<eos> From the conversation, he meant to do you harm, and the mistress knew it.<eos> She wants you dead, so she can have her rooms back.
How old are you?<eos> 13.<eos> Why would she keep you and not rent you?<eos> Too ugly. She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.
Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.<eos> Tell me about this man with the silver tooth...<eos> Winter.<eos> I can show you where he's moored, if you want.
He sleeps on this ship alone?<eos> He takes a particular girl abroad and does mean things, but there's no-one else.<eos> Are you tricking me?<eos> No.<eos> They say you was in Africa.
I want to go to America.<eos> Promise to take me to America one day.<eos> New York or Boston?<eos> The current here heads for Gravesend.<eos> You know navigation.
Yes.<eos> Us larks all want to be sailors.<eos> That's his sloop.<eos> Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?
That's his sloop.<eos> Right.<eos> Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?<eos> Because...<eos> What are you going to do?
The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?
Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...
What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...<eos> "Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"
Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.<eos> Sir, I have seen nae deerskin treaty, nor have I seen fairies or water sprites.<eos> But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.
But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.<eos> Breakfast will be out in half an hour... if you can contrive to stay alive that long.
A mulatto?<eos> I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> Hmm...<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.
People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.
I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.
What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.<eos> Winter, she's your daughter, isn't she?<eos> And that's why you don't rent her.
You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.<eos> Winter, she's your daughter, isn't she?<eos> And that's why you don't rent her.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.
I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.<eos> It's my first condition.<eos> I need to know where Mr Silver Tooth is hiding.<eos> Your new friend.<eos> Do you know him?
The Felice Adventurero - it's all yours now, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What was this ship?<eos> What was this ship?<eos> Me and you.
I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.<eos> I believe that would lead to anarchy.<eos> Are you not ever hungry?
A splinter... from the mast of a ship called the Yankee Prize... that was struck by a Yankee ball.<eos> So I should call you comrade?<eos> We shall see.<eos> How God makes his colours, I know not, but I'm pursuing him through his chemicals.<eos> They said you were a doctor.
They said you were a doctor.<eos> A sheep is a sheep, but also meat and wool.<eos> This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?

Uh-huh.<eos> Not yet in Hell?<eos> No, Ponta Delgada and the Azores.<eos> Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.
No, Ponta Delgada and the Azores.<eos> Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.<eos> No, we change the codes when we think that perhaps the scum British have overtaken it.<eos> And you do not trust the name Colonay?
Similar.<eos> You should know the wound in the shoulder is no longer used by us as a signal.<eos> No, we change the codes when we think that perhaps the scum British have overtaken it.<eos> And you do not trust the name Colonay?<eos> What do you want?
That name means nothing.<eos> But it will to the President and his representatives, who are travelling to the negotiations in Ghent.<eos> The border between the United States and Canada is being drawn up in a very... quiet...<eos> closed room, no?<eos> You see, I have something of great value to your nation.
And what?<eos> You seek protection?<eos> I have demands.<eos> Demands?<eos> You tell Carlsbad my name.
I know that name, because Colonay told me it.<eos> He was drunk.<eos> He was trying to push his jelly up a whore.<eos> Carlsbad will know my name and know my business.<eos> I'm afraid you've used the wrong words.
He was trying to push his jelly up a whore.<eos> Carlsbad will know my name and know my business.<eos> I'm afraid you've used the wrong words.<eos> Get out.<eos> Do you treat sickness of the mind, Doctor?
I'm afraid you've used the wrong words.<eos> Get out.<eos> Do you treat sickness of the mind, Doctor?<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> You're mad to have even come here.
Yes, I will use it for trade.<eos> With whom?<eos> There are only savages at Nootka.<eos> Then I will trade with them.<eos> I hear you bought a ship.
The shackles were all cast in London.<eos> The East India don't deal slaves.<eos> No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.
No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.<eos> And what connections are they?<eos> Mr Thoyt... you have been my father's lawyer for the past 40 years.

And in all that time, you reported every detail of his most intimate business to his enemies at the East India Company.<eos> You are their whore.<eos> The same as almost everyone else in this city, apart from those who are actually labelled a whore.<eos> Come on, James.<eos> When you left London, the East India was a trading company.
The Prince Regent fears it.<eos> No government in the world dares to stand up to it.<eos> It owns the land, the ocean, the fucking sky above our heads.<eos> It has more men and weapons and ships than all the Christian nations combined.<eos> You think all who submit are evil.
We are submitting to the way the world has become.<eos> All the good men in London... who fight them are washed up at Tilbury.<eos> They could hold a congress.<eos> Or perhaps they could simply board a ship and sail to Boston, where the Company dare not go.<eos> So... you'll add treason to the list?
Mr Delaney died a widower.<eos> He is survived by two children, both present at this division.<eos> Of his daughter, Zilpha Annabel Delaney, now Zilpha Annabel Geary, there is no mention in this last will and testament.<eos> To his son, James Keziah Delaney, is left the only existing assets of the Delaney estate, including the Nootka trading post and landing ground on the Pacific north-west coast of the Americas, in what was formerly Spanish America.<eos> Whatever you have, you will sell...
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
He was very, very proud.<eos> Why Dublin?<eos> Well, he was on business.<eos> Yes, but your business is here, isn't it?<eos> You're an actress who appeared on stage at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden in a play called The Painted Savage.
If the paperwork from Dublin is validated,<eos> Miss Bow will have a legal claim against his estate as widow.<eos> Mrs Delaney is my name.<eos> Bow was the name that I used for the stage.<eos> Are you a good actress?
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?<eos> My father was a very sick and old man.<eos> Do you have proof of consummation?
"that I would leave this cursed house by the river"<eos> "and go to the Americas with you and live there, naked and savage,"<eos> "and yet, we would have each other and be together."<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Do you possess any other documents of his?
I suggest you two refrain from any further contact with each other.<eos> Well, I have no love for the theatre.<eos> And I spend very little time in German brothels.<eos> Was he in there?<eos> The man - did you see him in the room?
It was him that came to the door and was indeed in the room.<eos> He was the one who declared your legacy a death sentence.<eos> Hmm.<eos> You, er...<eos> You want him to fall into the river, James?
Who claims to be the widow.<eos> The marriage is confirmed and is legal.<eos> What is the significance of this, Mr Godfrey?<eos> It's not written down.<eos> You have to work it out.
Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.
James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?
What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.
I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.
I would, yes.<eos> Is it my loudness that troubles you?<eos> In the forest, no.<eos> In the jungle, no.<eos> You used to straighten your skirt and march away like nothing had ever happened.
In the forest, no.<eos> In the jungle, no.<eos> You used to straighten your skirt and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> Who marched away?<eos> And thank God you did.
God?<eos> This is very simple, James.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Take away a little ancient history.<eos> You live in the East, I live in the West.
You live in the East, I live in the West.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?
Mm-hm.<eos> There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?
Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.<eos> Ah, ah, ah!<eos> And I can't stand to have you this close to me...
All right.<eos> I'll, uh, examine you standing up.<eos> Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben, it started last week when Dougie disappeared for three days.<eos> He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party, which we'd been planning for six months, and then he shows up straight from the casino.<eos> You know about his gambling problems and then the drinking, and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa, and the whole thing is just a downward spiral.
Okay.<eos> Thank you, Roger.<eos> Anthony, come here.<eos> Don't sit down, Anthony.<eos> Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.
Don't sit down, Anthony.<eos> Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.<eos> What's that, Mr. Todd?<eos> Do you recall my business rivals and bitter enemies the Mitchum brothers?<eos> You're gonna visit the brothers now.
You're gonna pin the blame for the insurance claim that we conspired to deny for them, a loss of 30 million that hit 'em hard, on the back of Douglas Jones.<eos> You're gonna convince them that Mr. Jones has it out for the brothers, a personal vendetta, and then we're gonna sit back, and we're gonna watch as the Mitchum brothers take care of our Mr. Jones problem.<eos> - But what if...<eos> - Don't speak, Anthony.<eos> If you fail to deliver on this, then you'll have to kill Mr. Jones yourself.
Candie, go get him.<eos> You want me to bring him here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did he just say?<eos> You want me to get him and bring him here?
Yes, margaret.<eos> Hawk, can you hear me?<eos> Yes, margaret.<eos> You found something, didn't you?<eos> It's just like you said.
Oh.<eos> This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day,<eos> What you did for me.
This is the man I told you about.<eos> I wanted to see you again.<eos> I've thought of you every day,<eos> What you did for me.<eos> You changed my life.
- To the bureau.<eos> To the bureau.<eos> Albert.<eos> Gordon.<eos> Okay, here's what you need to know.
Kriscol.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> You been selling your blood again?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, Kriscol, did you install a new propane tank for Jenkins last week?
Now, Kriscol, did you install a new propane tank for Jenkins last week?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Did you get paid for that?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Do you mow lawns around here and rake up?
Don't pay it this month.<eos> And the next time you're thinking about selling your blood, come talk to me about it.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> I don't like people selling their blood to eat.<eos> It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood, but you've given enough already.
I feel fine now.<eos> - Is somebody in the house?<eos> - No.<eos> No, just something in the kitchen.<eos> You're okay, then.
Come in!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - How you doing?<eos> Our new favorite insurance agency!<eos> Oh, my, God, Battling Bud, you're the man!
A set... of monogrammed diamond cuff links.<eos> Oh, they're beautiful.<eos> And the keys to your new car!<eos> A BMW convertible.<eos> Now you and Dougie have a matched set.
He explained all this already.<eos> He did?<eos> Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.<eos> Dougie even implicated himself.<eos> And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh.<eos> Dr. Jacoby.<eos> Nadine.<eos> - Is that you?
That's me.<eos> I usually leave out the back.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I love your show so much.<eos> You have done so much for me.
And I am your most loyal foot soldier... or... shoveler.<eos> You know, the... last... last time I saw you, it was about seven years ago.<eos> - You...<eos> - Mm.<eos> You were down on your hands and knees, looking for a potato.
- Mm.<eos> You were down on your hands and knees, looking for a potato.<eos> Where was I?<eos> It was, uh, you know, in the supermarket.<eos> You... you had dropped it.
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.<eos> Is that you, Lucy?
I don't know.<eos> What, with half his neck missing?<eos> Damn.<eos> You have something to do with this?<eos> What? You-you saw me.
There's no belt that fits me.<eos> I'm wearing police tape around my waist.<eos> I saw the kid was upset, so I took him for cannoli.<eos> That's not a crime.<eos> You don't know what a crime is.
- March.<eos> - No.<eos> - April.<eos> - You already said April.<eos> And you said?
Got you!<eos> Take it easy, alright.<eos> You said investigation<eos> No!<eos> You take it easy.
Please reboard the vehicle, ma'am.<eos> - You causing trouble, woman?<eos> - Get in the car.<eos> And don't ever blow your whistle at me again.<eos> You're new here. I'm not.
"Time played games to part Wrath wrenched the heart."<eos> "Here comes our prince dear Add him also to your vow here."<eos> "One with strong arms, Baahubali!"<eos> "Tiger who pounces without mercy."<eos> "Hark the lightning and thunder Tattooing against clouds loud and louder." "You deserve this glory, Baahubali."
When she was sharing your name, fame, title, eligibility, everything with him. Every single day I was dying to kill her.<eos> Today when she is bequeathing the throne meant for you to that lowlife. This hand is trembling to strangle her.<eos> Bhalla?<eos> Shall we kill her?<eos> You have drunk more than your normal limit.
By the time you return... I will find you a princess to narrate enchanting fairy tales!<eos> He is a thief.<eos> - Please forgive me. - lt has become a habit for him.<eos> Even at this age how are you so energetic?<eos> You seem surprised aboutjust this.
Queen Mother Sivagami Devi's command will be complied.<eos> Do not offer these gifts and degrade their value, mother.<eos> - Taste this sweet.<eos> - Alright, dear.<eos> You are a smart girl.
Do not offer these gifts and degrade their value, mother.<eos> - Taste this sweet.<eos> - Alright, dear.<eos> You are a smart girl.<eos> Sir, who are you?
By the way our hero seems to be missing in action?<eos> Where is he showing off his bravery-<eos> My lord.<eos> Go that side.<eos> - You go this side.
Baahu...!<eos> Baahu, weapon.<eos> Throw.<eos> Baahu...?<eos> You are distracted, Baahu.
!<eos> Wretched fellow!<eos> How well l took care of you in your childhood?<eos> !<eos> You should do much more to unite us you know.
Tie all of them.<eos> No one should escape.<eos> Tighten that knot.<eos> Long live, Your Highness!<eos> You were a godsend who saved us at the right time.
He is not adept at any job. - He was driven out of his house.<eos> - What...?<eos> Yourfamily threw you out?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> You seem to be really compassionate lf you can kindly teach him some skill... he will utter your name until his last breath.
'lmbecile! I will show our armory to you, come'<eos> This is a mace lt cannot be lifted.<eos> This is a spear lt cannot be thrown.<eos> This is a sword I will teach you how to wield it.<eos> What do you excel in?
- Lift it high.<eos> - Aiyo!<eos> Then 1 swift blow.<eos> Try your hand.<eos> You do not know, my dear boy.
How can I get a log of wood now?<eos> It is right there.<eos> Oh look!<eos> It was hidden there.<eos> You found it, huh?
Good you found this.<eos> But where is my sword-<eos> Overthere.<eos> Move a few paces away.<eos> Stop... stop, my lord lf a brave warrior like you... repeats the same feat at night it is considered a bad omen.
Stop... stop, my lord lf a brave warrior like you... repeats the same feat at night it is considered a bad omen.<eos> Are you not aware of this?<eos> Why not?<eos> I forgot.<eos> You reminded me at the right time.
Look!<eos> A wild boar.<eos> Boar.<eos> - Do not fall over me.<eos> - You ki-killed it.
Wi... wild boar.<eos> Will it be so huge?<eos> So fat, huh?<eos> Dead center!<eos> You were too good!
Where will I find someone to sing you a lullaby now?<eos> Do you know to sing a lullaby?<eos> - You do not know?<eos> - No.<eos> - What about you?
- You do not know?<eos> - No.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - l cannot sing.<eos> Neither can you, huh?
- What about you?<eos> - l cannot sing.<eos> Neither can you, huh?<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Do you sing?
'However off-key and jarring it may sound, I will do the honors! '<eos> "To shower words tender he has no mother." "No father either to comfort him here"<eos> "l wonder who is here, near to shed a few teardrops dear?"<eos> My dear, can you hear my soulful lament here?<eos> "Like the moon single and lovely you were also born on this earth lonely."
Queen Mother's compassionate gaze has fallen on your small territory<eos> Princess is indeed fortunate.<eos> Look at the trousseau Queen Mother has sent to seek your sister's hand.<eos> You would have never set eyes upon such wealth and valuables in your life<eos> is itjust you and your Queen Mother?
Look at the trousseau Queen Mother has sent to seek your sister's hand.<eos> You would have never set eyes upon such wealth and valuables in your life<eos> is itjust you and your Queen Mother?<eos> Or is everyone in your kingdom like this?<eos> Looking at these riches... you may wag your tail like a dog.
- Devasena...?<eos> - Bravo, Your Highness!<eos> Your Majesty, at least can you persuade- lt is her decision, Prime minister.<eos> You send a befitting reply, Devasena.<eos> Write this down. To Sivagami Devi, Queen Mother of Magizhmadhi kingdom... greetings from the princess of Kundala kingdom instead of seeking my hand in person courageously... '...by sending mere gifts' '... I learnt about your son's bravery' '...and the fact he needs a woman like you to hide behind' I am sending you my sword.
The physician saves it.<eos> One who protects that life... is a true Kshatriya!<eos> Your Highness, Four fingers. Turn the wrist facing outward.<eos> Release.<eos> Braveheart Who are you?
Fix the hooks below.<eos> Saranga!<eos> Not knowing your real identity I spoke out of turn<eos> I kicked you on your chest.<eos> Only when you stamped me I realized how strong you are!
I kicked you on your chest.<eos> Only when you stamped me I realized how strong you are!<eos> This is not blood, Kumara Varma.<eos> A mark of victory pronouncing you as a warrior and not a coward.<eos> You saved us like God from an unexpected peril.

You saved us like God from an unexpected peril.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> What does it matter who he is?<eos> We came believing only you can help us.
Queen Mother Sivagami has ordered me to bring you to our kingdom as captive.<eos> Treachery.<eos> Your-<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Just a while ago we hailed you as a godsend and our savior. You have proved our gratitude was false.
Treachery.<eos> Your-<eos> Your Highness.<eos> Just a while ago we hailed you as a godsend and our savior. You have proved our gratitude was false.<eos> Tell me Who are you?
Your Highness.<eos> Just a while ago we hailed you as a godsend and our savior. You have proved our gratitude was false.<eos> Tell me Who are you?<eos> Even a sweet will taste bitter when you are angry, Your Highness!<eos> Just answer my query Who are you?
Because you rejected her son she has sent for you in anger.<eos> My mother has never gone wrong, Devasena ln whatever she does, a deep inner meaning is bound to be hidden.<eos> This is an error based on confusion Not born out of contempt.<eos> Come with me as my prisoner.<eos> You are the brave warrior who won over my heart lf you ask me to come as your attendant I will gladly do so till the jaws of death.
"Like your veena's melody boundless make me forever your precious princess"<eos> "ln a swan sailboat in tranquility when your breath falls on me"<eos> "l, Devasena, am reveling in this love-ly heavenly feeling."<eos> "Like your battlefield of conquest."<eos> "You fight in real earnest o' warrior invading my chest."
"l, Devasena, am reveling in this love-ly heavenly feeling."<eos> "Like your battlefield of conquest."<eos> "You fight in real earnest o' warrior invading my chest."<eos> "O' enchantress, a flash of lightning ride my heart like a chariot enlivening."<eos> "Are you a demon kissing me random with your sword holding me to ransom?"
We need to focus only on our future.<eos> Queen Mother-<eos> Baahu I have given my word to your brother that he will marry Devasena.<eos> 'Stop it'<eos> Who are you to give your word for my marriage without my consent?
As you command, Queen Mother.<eos> A hand laid on Devasena... is equal to anyone touching Baahubali's sword.<eos> Mother I have given my word to Devasena to protect her dignity.<eos> Your Highness, are you the one confronting our Queen Mother?<eos> You always say 'Even Lord Shiva can make a mistake'
Promising your son blindly not knowing a woman's heart is wrong.<eos> What you did was wrong, mother.<eos> What Sivagami did was wrong?<eos> What is wrong?<eos> You killed your mother when you entered this world.
Was that wrong?<eos> 'Wrong doing! '<eos> Did you see that, Sivagami?<eos> Your sacrifice has been named by him as... misdeed.<eos> You must honor your promise. But your mother's word should vanish into thin air!
Even in my dreams and sleep I placed you on my head.<eos> After all these years. After all this struggle. Though in the palm of my hand why am I unable to clasp you?<eos> When I have given you pride of place... why did you prefer that lowlife Baahubali to me?<eos> Bhalla.<eos> Now you are the king.
I must change that.<eos> Change Sivagami?<eos> The sun cannot rise in the west, Bhalla.<eos> The sun will never rise in the west. But I shall bury it in the east.<eos> Sivagami, you nursed a snake and nurtured it on your lap lt is now baring its fangs and spewing venom ln another few days it will bite you.
After the umbilical cord is cut for the newborn according to our custom... he will be handed over to his grandfather.<eos> To be blessed to see 1000 full moons.<eos> Both our fathers are no more.<eos> Will you do us the honor, Kattappa?<eos> For a slave who has no right to even stand near you... you have elevated me to a father's position
'Hail Queen Mother Sivagami Devi'<eos> Mother...?<eos> You are bearing Magizhmadhi's heir.<eos> Take adequate precautions.<eos> You lost the privilege to address her as 'amma' long ago.
You have not given me any gift Will you give me what I ask?<eos> You must occupy Magizhmadhi's throne.<eos> That is my wish.<eos> Notjust mine. People of our kingdom wish the same too.<eos> You always claim a Kshatriya's duty is to fulfill people's wishes.
Your Highness!<eos> You can enter lt is alright You go ahead.<eos> 'Move fast'<eos> 'So many are waiting behind you'<eos> Next will be you.
Catch her.<eos> Handcop her.<eos> 'For the crime of chopping the fingers of the commander Sethupathy' 'lnterrogation of Devasena, wife of Baahubali' 'ln the presence of Queen Mother Sivagami Devi...' '...and Council of Ministers as witness'<eos> Start the inquiry ls there anything you wish to speak, Devasena?<eos> Without a fairtrial you have already shackled me.
Without a fairtrial you have already shackled me.<eos> You have charged me guilty of the crime<eos> - ls this what you call 'justice'?<eos> - This is the law of Magizhmadhi.<eos> You are guilty until proven otherwise.
Fame is never measured by gigantic forts and golden statues.<eos> Only through compassion born and bred in hearts I see no such big hearts.<eos> Nor open minds.<eos> Shameful!<eos> You heard her, Your Majesty?
Why are you intimidating the victim?<eos> The poison in a villainous heart will not spring if asked politely, Your Majesty.<eos> You are crossing your limit, Baahubali.<eos> When this royal court chained a woman in her final trimester... this court already crossed its limit, mother.<eos> Be it a pregnant woman, tottering old hag, you or me... rules of interrogation are the same.
Since Sethupathy was guilty, he was perturbed and panic-stricken. Because Devasena spoke the truth she stood absolutely fearless.<eos> His guilt has been proved. His head was cleaved!<eos> Baahubali...?<eos> As you suggested Sethupathy might even be guilty. Who should interrogate and pass the verdict?<eos> You or the king?
His guilt has been proved. His head was cleaved!<eos> Baahubali...?<eos> As you suggested Sethupathy might even be guilty. Who should interrogate and pass the verdict?<eos> You or the king?<eos> Or are you thinking you are the king?
Are you planning to become the king to make her wish come true?<eos> Mother?<eos> Your wife found fault with Magizhmadhi's reign.<eos> She maligned our Code of Law which is 100 years old.<eos> You proved her scornful words with your sword.
What is the punishment to be meted out to them?<eos> If any member of the royal family... violates Magizhmadhi's laws they should be expelled from the palace.<eos> So be it.<eos> Both of you leave the palace this instant, right now.<eos> On one hand is the law you trust. On the other hand is 'Dharma' you taught.
I will chop your head and place it in your hand... go.<eos> Bhalla, whose head?<eos> Who else?<eos> Baahubali of course!<eos> You usurped his throne, exiled him Stooping down further you want to kill him.
Bhalla, whose head?<eos> Who else?<eos> Baahubali of course!<eos> You usurped his throne, exiled him Stooping down further you want to kill him.<eos> You are my-
'That minute is ticking now'<eos> Are you totally in the dark of what is happening, Kumara Varma?<eos> Sacrificial offering is being performed!<eos> To get Baahubali's death warrant signed and sealed by Sivagami's own hands.<eos> A great 'yagna' ln that ritual, you are a small piece of wood.
History should not defame the king for murdering his brother lf that is so... what is your plan?<eos> Kattappa.<eos> Your ancestors have pledged their allegiance to the royal throne.<eos> They have promised to obey every command by the king.<eos> Do you adhere to that oath?
Forgive me, I beg you.<eos> Take care of my mother.<eos> Long live Magizhmadhi!<eos> I suspected you unnecessarily.<eos> You are my slave, my dog indeed.
Amarendra Baahubali 'l, Amarendra Baahubali' '...will protect the people of Magizhmadhi Their health, wealth, mortality, dignity'<eos> 'As your savior' 'With Queen Mother Sivagami Devi as witness' 'l take this oath of allegiance'<eos> Queen Mother.<eos> Foolish mother I deceived her, making her think you planned to kill me I made her sign and seal your death warrant.<eos> 'Who are you to take your oath swearing on her? ! '
What has happened to our Baahubali?<eos> Blood of Baahubali.<eos> Can we wash away this sin from our hands in this birth?<eos> Kattappa!<eos> You blundered, Sivagami!
When he breathed his last... he did not think of his wife or unborn child.<eos> Do you know the last words he uttered?<eos> 'Take care of my mother'<eos> "Close your eyes, my son."<eos> "To rule the world you were born."
"Baahubali." "Uncle Kattappa will be." "With you Wherever you go."<eos> "Your elder brother gaily will play with you daily." "You can call me 'mother' though born to another"<eos> "l will protect you eternally."<eos> "Jewel in my crown, Baahubali."<eos> You gave me the honor to hold your baby 1st in my hands. With the same hands I killed your husband, my dear.
This baby's cry will magnify into the revolting voices of our people.<eos> Before there is anarchy and uproar... kill this baby.<eos> Only if we stifle the cry of this newborn... all enemies of Magizhmadhi will be annihilated.<eos> Crush him, Sivagami.<eos> Realizing the virtues of Baahubali... you have risen above the infinite sky.
Queen Mother, step out to address our grievances.<eos> We are hearing various sad rumors.<eos> Mother.<eos> Not knowing for sure if Baahubali is dead or not... herd mentality, the people are clamoring for an official declaration.<eos> They will believe only if you announce.
Kattappa, call for an urgent meeting of the Council of ministers.<eos> The guilty should be hanged until death in public.<eos> So be it, mother.<eos> Baahubali was your breath.<eos> You executed his death believing he had sinned.
Find the sentry who operates the draw bridge.<eos> What are you doing, Kattappa?<eos> Your forefathers for generations were servile to the king.<eos> And earned unbounding good will.<eos> You have tarnished their good reputation.
Cover... protect her.<eos> How dare you break my statue's head!<eos> As soon as I set eyes on you when all along I thought you were dead... mere words cannot express how joyous I felt<eos> I orchestrated yourfather's murder. My own hands did not slay him has given me sleepless nights.<eos> You are the splitting image of him.
What are you talking about...<eos> Tell me about my son.<eos> Tell me one thing about Stiles that you remember.<eos> Just one.<eos> You swipe that key card, I'll tell you anything you want.
You killed the Mistress of the Eastern Wood, the Most Merciful and Stern.<eos> I told you, it was an accident.<eos> Only a witch can kill a witch.<eos> Or The Beast Forever.<eos> You are no beast.
Your lives I must take in my Mistress' stead.<eos> Faith and fealty to the end.<eos> No, please!<eos> Dorothy...<eos> You wear the elements.
Jane, look at this.<eos> It's working.<eos> I'm working.<eos> I'm proud of you, Jack.<eos> You all right?
I could say the same about you.<eos> We do what we need to survive.<eos> Which is why I need to ask you, where's the little witch?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> But if you let her go back to the North, she'll be safe, and so will you.
Frank!<eos> Frank?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> It's what I should have done years ago.<eos> Who are you?
What will it take to get you to shut up?<eos> Women!<eos> We'll take turns keeping an eye on him.<eos> That's enough. Get back!<eos> You would have done the same if you were in his place.
Women!<eos> We'll take turns keeping an eye on him.<eos> That's enough. Get back!<eos> You would have done the same if you were in his place.<eos> If he'd rung that bell, you'd be on that crucifix, snoring away to glory.
Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, what is that?<eos> Chicken or steak?<eos> You're funny.
He gives it to her.<eos> She says, "It's expired." He says, "It might not be a valid drivers license",<eos> "but it is a damn fine identification.<eos> "There's my picture, my weight, and my height.<eos> Who the fuck do you think it is?"
Because you would have said<eos> "I need to take your drink, sir"<eos> or "I'm gonna have to take that drink, sir," neither of which happened.<eos> So don't worry about it.<eos> I'll hold her very tight while you pour my friend here a Jack and Coke and get me another one?
Nothing to it.<eos> I offer you the worm from my beak, and you look at me like I fucked your mom?<eos> Sorry.<eos> No.<eos> You're just the first person I've talked to who wasn't an asshole.
I don't want your fucking job.<eos> Ask me about the job.<eos> I thought you'd want to reconsider on account of your friend Robbie's condition and on account of you being broke.<eos> What about his condition?<eos> The fuck do you know about Robbie?
Tails.<eos> I rigged the toss.<eos> Rigged games are the easiest to beat.<eos> It is always going to be tails because I don't want to work for you.<eos> You're a little creepy, and you're forward and familiar, and I don't like it.
OK?<eos> Could I have a volunteer?<eos> Anyone?<eos> No-one?<eos> You, Walker.
Right.<eos> All I know is sometimes if there's too many white people, I get nervous, you know?<eos> Oh! No. No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Aren't you something?
For phase three.<eos> The transplantation.<eos> Well, partial, actually.<eos> The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone, not completely.
If you were, I'd have to call the cops.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No cops.<eos> The fuck you do?
Look, I'm not fuckin' hungry. Okay?<eos> I was just hijacked by a toad-skin-smokin' punk in a virtual fuckin' limo.<eos> Said to tell you that he's reprogrammed reality.<eos> What a little asshole.<eos> - You know him?
Difficult decision.<eos> They threatened to reprogram reality.<eos> I mean, is... Is that what this is?<eos> Are they just fucking with my head?<eos> Are you fucking with my head?
"You didn't miss a beat."<eos> And I'd always have, you know, these soirée affairs, and I'd have a curator with all these fetish kind of an, and I'd have these custom-made outfits, and I'd have an open bar.<eos> And then, you know, I'd be double-fisting somebody in the dungeon downstairs.<eos> And, you know, my mom would be upstairs, and she's like, "I'm so proud of my daughter."<eos> And they're like, "Do you know what she's doing downstairs?"
Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.<eos> Destroying evidence.<eos> I'm not gonna let the school go down at the hands of whatever disturbed sophomore latched onto the term "Cum Dumpster."<eos> Okay?<eos> And I'm not gonna let them pin this on our staff or on you and Jane and me.
We got leftovers, we got steak, we got all the fixings.<eos> Have you met Peter before?<eos> Pam.<eos> Working late.<eos> You too.
An acquaintance would be more accurate.<eos> Reporter, can you mark this document as Exhibit three.<eos> Can you tell me who this is in this photo?<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> That's not you in this photo?
Well, Dennis, without the tapes in evidence, I'd suggest we move on.<eos> Hello?<eos> Miss Davis, it's important that you speak only to what you actually experienced.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, you and Hannah were friends?
How'd I die?<eos> We were at the beach.<eos> It was before.<eos> You got pulled under... and you didn't come back up.<eos> I was trying to find you, but you were gone.
I owe you.<eos> Then tell me why you were my dad's emergency contact.<eos> What you really want to know is if I killed him.<eos> The FBI said that Skinner and Escamilla had a solid alibi... For that day.<eos> So, if it wasn't one of them, it had to be you.
Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes...<eos> Um, this guy, the, uh... the, uh...<eos> I am Crocubot.<eos> Right, Crocubot.<eos> So, you're half cold, unfeeling reptile, half... also cold... equally unfeeling machine.
I am Crocubot.<eos> Right, Crocubot.<eos> So, you're half cold, unfeeling reptile, half... also cold... equally unfeeling machine.<eos> Yes. Wow. So, your origin is what?<eos> Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?
Got damn!<eos> Noob Noob, we're having a briefing.<eos> If I can continue, Rick.<eos> I anticipate sophisticated security measures.<eos> I trust you can be of service there.
Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.<eos> This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts."<eos> Don't worry, Morty, they love you.<eos> Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind blowing.<eos> I... think the personality conflict might have been... you?
Oh, God.<eos> Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night.<eos> Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can... clean up his diarrhea.<eos> Oooh, I'm nervous about my first mission!<eos> Actually, Noob Noob, you have a new mission.
Vance: Security drones, inbound.<eos> Star Mother, grant me your wrath.<eos> All aboard!<eos> Gun turret.<eos> Are you all right?
My queen is laying more. I am back to...<eos> one Million Ants.<eos> Someone wake up Sanchez.<eos> Ugh! Oh, Christ.<eos> Rick. You're up.
Rick!<eos> Hey, I can't help if I can't see.<eos> I could've just used a ghost train.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't say. You would've used a ghost train?
- Man, you.<eos> - Is there coffee?<eos> Hey, Morty, can you be a pal, Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship, you know, the French press thing...<eos> Get it yourself.<eos> Little extra snippy this morning, aren't you?
Hey, Morty, can you be a pal, Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship, you know, the French press thing...<eos> Get it yourself.<eos> Little extra snippy this morning, aren't you?<eos> Just focus on the mission, all right?<eos> Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry, oh, you're right.
So, now that we know...<eos> Rick? What's going on, buddy?<eos> Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.<eos> "Obviously?"<eos> You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?
And do it in three minutes or you'll all die.<eos> Screw this. I'm not playing his game.<eos> I'm gonna find us a way out of here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance.<eos> He said you'd die if you tried to leave.
I'm gonna find us a way out of here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance.<eos> He said you'd die if you tried to leave.<eos> That means there's booby traps.<eos> Why are you acting like that's not you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance.<eos> He said you'd die if you tried to leave.<eos> That means there's booby traps.<eos> Why are you acting like that's not you?<eos> What part of "blackout" don't you understand?
He said you'd die if you tried to leave.<eos> That means there's booby traps.<eos> Why are you acting like that's not you?<eos> What part of "blackout" don't you understand?<eos> I thought you drank. Like cool drinking!
What part of "blackout" don't you understand?<eos> I thought you drank. Like cool drinking!<eos> Like sexy drinking, not this psycho, trailer-park shit!<eos> Vance, stay calm...<eos> Oh, so you're the leader now, because we gave you a jacket?
I thought you drank. Like cool drinking!<eos> Like sexy drinking, not this psycho, trailer-park shit!<eos> Vance, stay calm...<eos> Oh, so you're the leader now, because we gave you a jacket?<eos> You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo ops with.
Come on, guys, we're all thinking it. Don't...<eos> Don't make me say it.<eos> Oh, okay. This again.<eos> You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that.<eos> I'm not the one that didn't want you back.
What the hell is "Israel"?<eos> It-It's just something Rick starts talking about when he's blackout drunk.<eos> W-What?<eos> In w... In w-w-what? Like, w-w-what's my point?<eos> In a way that has no point, you just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations and then you pass out.
Which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.<eos> I have not stake in this...<eos> I don't either, I'm... I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel he wants what's best for it and...<eos> Hey, man, I'm not touching this.<eos> You do you.
Sure, but were we married when you two were "stranded" on Delphi Six for three days?<eos> Because I sensed something was weird when you came back...<eos> But what do I know about sensitivity?<eos> I'm just a phantom train conductor.<eos> You're the pile of ordinary bugs that my wife!
You always put it in the weirdest place.<eos> Um, uh, over here maybe?<eos> Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb.<eos> It's a miracle I ever actually destroy anything.<eos> Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today.
Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today.<eos> The villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...<eos> I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators'<eos> So the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.<eos> Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick?
I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right.<eos> That's why popular people are dumb.<eos> And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.<eos> Disarmed.<eos> Holy shit. You're jealous.
And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.<eos> Disarmed.<eos> Holy shit. You're jealous.<eos> Yes!<eos> Is that what you want to hear? !
We loved each other!<eos> We had a child together!<eos> What? !<eos> I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it was half a million ants and half collapsing star!<eos> And yes. He was better than you.
If you know what it is, place it on the platform.<eos> Guess wrong and pla-planet will explode.<eos> And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.<eos> So what's the trick?<eos> Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert.
"otherwise I'll kill you."<eos> That is a... really specific guess.<eos> Look, I-I... there's nothing in the room but us.<eos> I'm just using logic to connect some dots, it's the best guess I've got.<eos> But you're betting our lives on it.
But you're betting our lives on it.<eos> I'll cover that bet.<eos> I get it.<eos> Well, Morty, I think you're doing that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment.<eos> I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.
I am not being coy about some hidden love for you.<eos> I want to be really clear that if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Sorry. I'm... not good at goodbyes, and... I'm drunk, so, you know, I just...<eos> It looks like I'm never going to see you again.
Sorry. I'm... not good at goodbyes, and... I'm drunk, so, you know, I just...<eos> It looks like I'm never going to see you again.<eos> I can't really roll with the hero types. And I don't... they...<eos> They don't want me around.<eos> But I want you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, I really appreciated you sticking by me.
They don't want me around.<eos> But I want you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, I really appreciated you sticking by me.<eos> God damn it, why am I crying?<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Ugh, you're... You're probably confused because we barely knew each other, but you really stuck your neck out when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room.
Everybody else had their head so far up their ass.<eos> Even my own grandson is like,<eos> "Oh, the Vindicators, they're so cool."<eos> I mean, he's a moron, that's their demographic.<eos> But you're different, Noob Noob.
"Oh, the Vindicators, they're so cool."<eos> I mean, he's a moron, that's their demographic.<eos> But you're different, Noob Noob.<eos> Mother<eos> You're cool. And you're smart.
But you're different, Noob Noob.<eos> Mother<eos> You're cool. And you're smart.<eos> And I bet we coulda hung out and shit.<eos> And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator and... and do...
Sweetheart.<eos> Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.<eos> It's for the greater good.<eos> Greater good? Titty Bean?<eos> It's like you said, Morty.
It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice... that taught me to be a man.<eos> When did it get so complicated?<eos> Who knows.<eos> But we can make it simple again.<eos> You were always the romantic.
I end up getting high with half of them.<eos> I mean, check it out, Gearhead's here.<eos> Hmm. Well, that's gonna shoot through me.<eos> Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket.<eos> Are you a little superhero now?
I'm sorry. I... I'm just amazed by patients who can harbor such profound self-awareness underneath the hard shell of denial.<eos> Find a friend to confide in.<eos> Do it today.<eos> Because?<eos> Because if there is a custody battle, you know what Perry's lawyer will be asking...
But she's dead.<eos> What you were seeing is not real.<eos> If you wanna get rid of her, I can help.<eos> - How do we do this?<eos> - You die.
- Maybe she didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> Love you.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - What are you doing here?
- ♪ ...and join the chorus ♪<eos> - ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la, la la la ♪<eos> - Crap. Oh, my God.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Are you just...
Are you just...<eos> Where are we going?<eos> What?<eos> Is that...<eos> You speak with sign language?
Are you familiar with Ghuilgul?<eos> It's Hebrew.<eos> It's a word that describes how an old soul attaches itself to a new body.<eos> Ray?<eos> Is that you?
The master of the field.<eos> His soul, he said, would bind and comfort theirs.<eos> Have you been to this place before?<eos> The bowling alley?<eos> Is that what you see?
Cheers.<eos> Hits the spot.<eos> We all end up here eventually.<eos> To be weighed and judged.<eos> As it is now for you and your friend.
We all end up here eventually.<eos> To be weighed and judged.<eos> As it is now for you and your friend.<eos> You know, some thought that he should have stayed behind, but I convinced him that he was on a better path now.<eos> And you...
It's a green Volkswagen Beetle.<eos> This is the universe at its most ironic.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Its sins have been swept clean.<eos> You and your friend should take it.
"thence will I bring thee down,<eos> "sayeth the Lord."<eos> "Though thou exalt thyself..."<eos> It's okay.<eos> You'll remember.
Mmm. When the Gophers play, put a little beer in a bowl and put it in front of the game.<eos> Napkins.<eos> And some vodka.<eos> Yuri...<eos> You are Yuri Gurka,
Please.<eos> In fact, there's some very good news.<eos> - Good news?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Today, you are $5 million richer than you were yesterday.
- No. I... That's fine.<eos> It was me mum's recipe, the secret of which she smuggled beneath her bosom all the way from Wales to Bristol.<eos> - It's a little bitter.<eos> - Yeah. Well, try some more, I think you'll find it smooths out nicely.<eos> Right, well, I'll tell the big man you stopped by, and don't worry about all this trouble with the police.
Copacetic?<eos> - Five million?<eos> - Bye-bye, Mr. Feltz.<eos> Anderson said he couldn't wait, said you should call to reschedule.<eos> You okay there, chief?
Both of you.<eos> - This is harassment.<eos> - We're on our lunch break.<eos> Heard it was shepherd's pie day in the cafeteria.<eos> And here you are.
- I bet that's it, Maddy.<eos> Probably he told me and I forgot.<eos> I'm sorry about your arm.<eos> No, it's...<eos> You were surprised, is all.
Setting me up...<eos> They?<eos> Ray and the girl.<eos> She's still out there according to... well, the cops and the newspapers.<eos> And you said yourself, your man never came back so...
Then she did what any smart person wanted for murder would do and then she ran away to Canada.<eos> Ray's car was parked in my spot.<eos> The Corvette.<eos> At the hospital.<eos> You were at the hospital?
- And all the pictures are...<eos> - Emmit?<eos> Emmit, are you listening?<eos> Yes.<eos> You won.
Life.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> Meemo will be over presently to take you home.<eos> There's some papers to sign.<eos> You're selling a shopping mall.
What?<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> He has a what?<eos> And you were here the whole time?
It's me.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Did he sign the papers?<eos> Emmit, we've talked about this.<eos> If you don't sign the papers, we don't make the money.
- You a rapist?<eos> - No.<eos> - Murderer?<eos> - Not recently.<eos> You?
And make it last. Is that clear? Is that clear?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Now get undressed.<eos> Fall out!<eos> You too, lieutenant.
But I do.<eos> You won't let yourself be loved.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't tell me you did all this just to have me as a reward.<eos> You're a good man.
Women here and women everywhere.<eos> It's no kind of life.<eos> Praying for your nephew?<eos> Every day, I pray for the Virgin to protect him.<eos> Who are you praying for?
Prep your teams.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Gunny.<eos> Up here.<eos> I know that you and your team did a rotation on the donnie.
Watch the deck.<eos> Come in.<eos> Chrisjen.<eos> Thank god.<eos> Are you all right?
Or what happened to the opa operative I tasked you to find?<eos> Or, maybe it's the story. Of where the hell you've been since then, Without one goddamn word of communication back to me.<eos> We were on eros.<eos> We barely got out alive.<eos> And the only reason we're here now. Is to see if you want to do something about it.
If you want to take that station, You need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.<eos> That's why we're talking to you.<eos> You're the military genius.
You're the military genius.<eos> Well, I don't do that kind of thing anymore.<eos> And the opa is not an army...<eos> We're going, with or without you.<eos> And if you'd seen what's happening on eros, You'd be right there with us.
It's not news to me that black sky. Resents my position here.<eos> But trust me,<eos> Now is not the time for factions or debate.<eos> There's opa. And there is opa.<eos> You?
But trust me,<eos> Now is not the time for factions or debate.<eos> There's opa. And there is opa.<eos> You?<eos> You're just an earther playing belter.
Don't know yet.<eos> But we've got cells on ceres, on pallas, hygea.<eos> When we hit the inners 100 more time, We gonna find out.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I wasted your time.<eos> You not wasting my time, earther.
But we've got cells on ceres, on pallas, hygea.<eos> When we hit the inners 100 more time, We gonna find out.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I wasted your time.<eos> You not wasting my time, earther.<eos> You're the one who don't belong here.
Here, I'll get the ball rolling.<eos> I'm a smug old bitch, Who enjoys playing with life and death. On her big chessboard.<eos> A snake in a sari...<eos> With dead eyes and a poison tongue. And the solar system is in tatters. Because of people like you and errinwright.<eos> Despite your delusions to the contrary, You, madam undersecretary, May be the worst person I have ever met.
Nah, we with our own air now, is all.<eos> You look like you see your own ghost.<eos> I just...<eos> Hate... Space...<eos> What kind of belter are you, pampa?
My uncle was a hero.<eos> He died fighting the inners.<eos> He put me out the airlock first, Because he had love for me.<eos> Now I fight like he did.<eos> You're still talking.
Everybody stay here.<eos> Nobody move.<eos> All right, turn it off, dirtbag!<eos> Now is the time for all good men to come. To the aid of their species.<eos> You.
Every scrap of data in this facility. Has been encrypted.<eos> We know what you were doing on eros.<eos> Nobody knows what we're doing on eros.<eos> And every minute I have to spend playing games with you, Takes me away from that work.<eos> You're in an excellent bargaining position.
Tell me what you want and we'll negotiate.<eos> You're going to help us make a vaccine.<eos> No.<eos> That goes against. Everything we're trying to accomplish.<eos> You infected a station full of belters...
It's the logical conclusion.<eos> I'm not here to draw conclusions.<eos> I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.
I'm not here to draw conclusions.<eos> I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.
You landed in Irkutsk first, then onward in a different plane to Samjiyon.<eos> I was in Irkutsk to meet with Kremlin officials.<eos> It's where the S400 is manufactured,<eos> - for your information.<eos> - And after that, you went to North Korea to discuss a parallel program there.
Saul Berenson said this.<eos> Mr. Berenson wasn't in the meeting, but his report called the evidence conclusive.<eos> Really? He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself.
That's why when George Tenet said "slam dunk,"<eos> we all sat up in our chairs.<eos> The other thing you need to do, if you don't mind me saying...<eos> - Please, it's why you're here.<eos> - Reach out to President Morse and make sure he knows that you're unconvinced.
I think she despises us, Saul.<eos> I think she blames us for her boy.<eos> The website is starting to see more and more traffic.<eos> We are definitely on the radar.<eos> Sekou, we took a look at your website, and you've been openly critical of America and supportive of its sworn enemies.
Max?<eos> I understand he's your business manager.<eos> No. He's my babysitter.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't like it, but if you want,
it's up to us.<eos> He called in about an hour ago to follow up.<eos> Rob managed to stall, but he is pushing for a response.<eos> Obviously, Dar would like nothing better than to get the nod from you.<eos> We're talking exactly the kind of operation you want to eliminate.
He called in about an hour ago to follow up.<eos> Rob managed to stall, but he is pushing for a response.<eos> Obviously, Dar would like nothing better than to get the nod from you.<eos> We're talking exactly the kind of operation you want to eliminate.<eos> Unleash the Agency, even in a supporting role, and you've abandoned your policy before you've even begun.
Unfortunately, that's not an option.<eos> Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this, and the accusation is too serious to ignore.<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example?
- What gang? - The one you got arrested with.<eos> I know everything...<eos> why you met Sekou, pretended you were Muslim, pretended you were his friend and mine.<eos> Pretended? So that's what she's been telling you?<eos> You're not the bad guy here.
Did he say that no one would ever know?<eos> 'Cause if he did, he lied to you, and if he lied to you, you're on the wrong side.<eos> I'm not on his side.<eos> Sekou's facing 15 years in prison here.<eos> You're on a side.
'Cause if he did, he lied to you, and if he lied to you, you're on the wrong side.<eos> I'm not on his side.<eos> Sekou's facing 15 years in prison here.<eos> You're on a side.<eos> You gave him $5,000, which you're saying was for a man in Africa, a jihadi.
- I told you.<eos> - He's just a kid.<eos> He's a harmless kid accused of terrible things that he didn't do, alone in a cell.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> No, no. You don't know what that's like.
- He's just a kid.<eos> He's a harmless kid accused of terrible things that he didn't do, alone in a cell.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> No, no. You don't know what that's like.<eos> You don't know anything.
He found out that I'm half Pakistani and he said he had important work for me in New York.<eos> Fucking Conlin, he doesn't care about anything.<eos> All he keeps saying is "Just get him to take the money, get him to take the money."<eos> So it wasn't to give to a man in Africa?<eos> You can fix this.
- Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That woman who just went in... she got here two hours after you put my name on the list.<eos> So tell your friend, next time, limit himself to misdemeanors.<eos> You said you'd check on him?
Nothing just slips that woman's mind.<eos> Relax.<eos> There.<eos> I wouldn't be asking if I didn't absolutely have to know.<eos> You're right, sir.
Step into the hall, please.<eos> Step into the hall.<eos> She may still be at lunch.<eos> What is this place, anyway?<eos> You told reception you were looking for a car.
A blue Jeep registered to this address.<eos> - I think you've made a mistake.<eos> - I think I haven't.<eos> What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.
What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.
I've never voted for you.<eos> I'm okay with that.<eos> Half the country can't stand me.<eos> I'm just curious why you agreed to do this.<eos> Because you're the president-elect, you asked me, and I know it's right.
I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.<eos> She is perfectly equipped.<eos> Ma'am, I understand your impatience, but it's still possible that you were the target
All right, if everyone will just settle down, I will answer a few questions. Nancy.<eos> Madam President, can you tell us where you've been the last two days?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.
If you stop pushing back against them here, every minute, if you are that stupid, what do you get?<eos> Boom! That's what you get!<eos> Madame President-elect, I hope you're listening, and if you are, hear me now.<eos> You brought this down on us.<eos> You did.
I am not alone.<eos> If you want a fight, and apparently you do--<eos> If you want a fight, you've got one from me.<eos> In spades.<eos> You've got the fight of your life.
Sir, we're looking for Carrie Mathison for comment on the attack.<eos> Can you tell her?<eos> She's not here!<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Do you live here?
Okay, sir.<eos> You don't want to talk.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Just let me go, I'll leave you in peace.<eos> - Who are you?
You're not saying he was heading toward me.<eos> We just don't know.<eos> Thank God he never reached his destination.<eos> But this was a man who hated the US government.<eos> You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.
And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!<eos> - I- - You need to!
You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location."<eos> Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.
- Exactly.<eos> You held your ground.<eos> Now, this woman has been telling us since she hit the campaign trail two years ago--<eos> "Don't over-react," and here she is, not even following her own advice.<eos> And what I'm wondering-- would you fight for her, General?
W-Why the change of heart?<eos> I realized I might've been giving people the wrong impression.<eos> What impression is that?<eos> Well, that somehow, I wasn't proud of him or the sacrifice that he and so many others made in this war.<eos> You were proud of him.
I'm too old to worry about optics.<eos> If I did, I'd never look in the mirror.<eos> This isn't a laughing matter.<eos> The Director has been on the receiving end of some very heated phone calls, and not just from Tovah Rivlin.<eos> Look, I know this is a pain in the ass, but the Director is hoping you'll cooperate so he can get Mossad off his back.
This led to an incident which Mr. Quinn held Franny and her nanny hostage for several hours.<eos> I described it in detail in my report.<eos> I've read it.<eos> Your Honor, Quinn thought he was protecting Franny.<eos> You'll have your chance to address the court, Ms. Mathison.
Excuse me.<eos> Sure you have the right seat?<eos> You're Saul.<eos> I am.<eos> Who are you?
No!<eos> I just...<eos> I just thought that...<eos> That...<eos> That you, of all people, would understand.
Because I can't go through that again.<eos> I-I can't lose another one.<eos> I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.
I-I can't lose another one.<eos> I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.<eos> Here is you, and here is your child.
I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.<eos> Here is you, and here is your child.<eos> And how do you balance that?
You might want to confirm your three o'clock.<eos> What?<eos> At Children's Services to see your daughter.<eos> How do you know about that? Hey!<eos> Who the fuck are you? !
Sir.<eos> Uh, please, uh, sit.<eos> You don't mind if we, uh, jump right in?<eos> I'll start by asking you a few general questions about your career at CIA, then I'll ease into a conversation about Berlin--<eos> How it was you who discovered a Russian agent had infiltrated the station there and how Dar Adal and Saul Berenson
I wasn't satisfied with the way our meeting went yesterday.<eos> I felt you weren't, either, and so, those names you requested for cabinet positions--<eos> I have them now.<eos> Because this... friction between us... it has to end.<eos> And you think this would help end the... friction?
And I'd ask you to reconsider-- advise you to.<eos> So this is your idea of advice?<eos> Does it really matter what we call it?<eos> Not if we're both clear on what's really going on.<eos> You think you know better than me.
He found out you were advising me, and he got to you, just like he got to Majid Javadi before.<eos> Tell me what he's holding over your head.<eos> Is it your daughter?<eos> You asked me about that situation.<eos> And you said you couldn't get involved.
Yes, I am.<eos> And I'm calling on the media to do their jobs and check their facts.<eos> I was elected by the people of this country to be their next President.<eos> I will represent them.<eos> You think you know better than me.
They're coming down the east stairwell, ma'am, and evacuating through the back entrance.<eos> I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.<eos> Now get in.<eos> Okay. You and you in number one.
Not many people in that room voted for us,<eos> I'll give you that, but nobody in there was responsible for those leaks.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.
Right.<eos> Cute.<eos> And where's your room?<eos> Right next door, just through here.<eos> There's a place for you to sign here acknowledging that we completed the home report.
She's been taken, placed in a state-registered youth home.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that Franny's in foster care.<eos> In this case, it's clearly the right thing to do.<eos> It's why I contacted you.<eos> Peter, are you okay?
Astrid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's me.<eos> I have to get back to New York.<eos> You will be arrested again.
You will be arrested again.<eos> That's the deal.<eos> What deal?<eos> The deal Dar Adal made.<eos> You shot a civilian, Peter.
You shot a civilian, Peter.<eos> 'Cause they were coming for me.<eos> Who is?<eos> The people who built the bomb.<eos> You were in a coma, Peter.
Got an agitated non-compliant patient. - Get away from me! Aah!<eos> - What's his name again?<eos> - Peter Quinn.<eos> - Peter Quinn.<eos> You will not be able to stay home, brother.
- Rudy.<eos> - He must have taken...<eos> Rudy.<eos> Rudy.<eos> You're late.
- No, you keep it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> - All that footage you gave us.<eos> You already earned it.
- No.<eos> - All that footage you gave us.<eos> You already earned it.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you can't let us down.
But you can't let us down.<eos> I'm...<eos> Look at those guys over there.<eos> Look.<eos> They are here because of you, because you had the guts to speak out.
I'm...<eos> Look at those guys over there.<eos> Look.<eos> They are here because of you, because you had the guts to speak out.<eos> Now, you were the only one who was actually out on patrol that night.
Now, you were the only one who was actually out on patrol that night.<eos> I know that.<eos> But... my head's a mess.<eos> 'Course it is.<eos> You got sent down IED Alley every single day for a whole year.
I know that.<eos> But... my head's a mess.<eos> 'Course it is.<eos> You got sent down IED Alley every single day for a whole year.<eos> You yourself got hit four times.
No, sir.<eos> We've heard a lot about how Captain Keane stayed on base, sent his men into enemy fire.<eos> But in his defense, there was at least one day he went out.<eos> May 14, 2007, the day he was killed.<eos> Rudy, you were there that day, out on patrol with Captain Keane, weren't you?
Is there a problem, Saul?<eos> No, no problem.<eos> She's the next President of the United States.<eos> She's a little busy at the moment.<eos> You still haven't spoken to her, have you?
And why not?<eos> Let me worry about that.<eos> Saul.<eos> We've spent our entire careers seeing around corners.<eos> If there's something I need to know, you should tell me.
Saul.<eos> We've spent our entire careers seeing around corners.<eos> If there's something I need to know, you should tell me.<eos> We need to take precautions, Majid.<eos> You don't have many friends here.
We've spent our entire careers seeing around corners.<eos> If there's something I need to know, you should tell me.<eos> We need to take precautions, Majid.<eos> You don't have many friends here.<eos> Neither, it seems, do you.
Who said you could come in?<eos> Bell didn't work.<eos> Door was open.<eos> 'Cause I'm putting in a security system.<eos> Who are you again? Max.
Carrie.<eos> I swore to myself it would be different here.<eos> I swore to myself I would be different.<eos> And look what happened.<eos> You'll get her back.
I-I have to know that's she's all right.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.
At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.<eos> May?<eos> In the hospital.<eos> You don't remember?
Uh, realness. Reality?<eos> My reality has a dreaminess.<eos> And my thoughts keep... disappearing.<eos> It's funny.<eos> You talk more than you used to.
No.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday.<eos> It was a lot to process.<eos> How long can you stay?
How long can you stay?<eos> Two weeks, give or take.<eos> Okay if I go for a run? Sure.<eos> We can head into town after, do some shopping.<eos> Don't know about you, but I need some decent coffee.
I'm not fucking around.<eos> Remember Mr. Nafisi? Of course.<eos> Paymaster for the IRGC, all-around creep.<eos> Correct.<eos> It was me who recommended you for the mission.
The deal with Iran has been formally adopted.<eos> It's settled policy.<eos> Any attempt to undermine it's--<eos> Treason.<eos> You have proof of all this, I'm assuming.
Let's just say the facts make it extremely fucking doubtful.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Two days later, the FBI agent I'm working with on the investigation is also murdered.<eos> Oh, my God, Carrie.<eos> You had all this.
You had all this.<eos> Why didn't you come to me?<eos> You should have come to me.<eos> Honestly, Saul, I...<eos> I didn't know whose side you were on.
It just seems weird.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - If he wanted me gone, why not get me out of the country?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to ask him.
- What do you mean?<eos> - If he wanted me gone, why not get me out of the country?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> You keep saying that.
I don't know.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> "I don't know. I don't know."<eos> - What do you know?
- Take it easy.<eos> I didn't come all this way to get yelled at.<eos> - Tell me, then.<eos> - What?<eos> What did you come here for?
Sorry?<eos> Dar Adal called you.<eos> - Yeah, he did.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> That you were in bad shape and needed help.
Dar Adal called you.<eos> - Yeah, he did.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> That you were in bad shape and needed help.<eos> And you just came running like Florence fucking...
- Yeah, he did.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> That you were in bad shape and needed help.<eos> And you just came running like Florence fucking...<eos> Why would you do that?
And you just came running like Florence fucking...<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> ! Why would anybody do that? !<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Same reason I risked my life getting you out of Islamabad.
More than that.<eos> We fucked each other because we were lonely.<eos> That doesn't make us friends.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You don't mean it.
What about the guy you were talking to in the supermarket?<eos> - What?<eos> Who?<eos> - The one with the... baseball.<eos> You were talking.
- That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - Move!<eos> - No!<eos> Told you.<eos> The king can move where he wants, and you can't predict the king.
That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you, you're here at great political risk, so thank you.
I have not.<eos> Saul and I sometimes speak when it's mutually beneficial.<eos> Well, I need some straight talk now.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> As far as you know, is there a concerted effort to get me to withdraw my support for the nuclear agreement?
A faction in Israel and one in your own national security establishment, whose concerns, I'm afraid, are valid.<eos> Majid.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It appears certain payments have been made.<eos> - What are you doing?
This financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent.<eos> The whole thing is a charade.<eos> The only charade was the deal itself.<eos> It never had a chance.<eos> I'm sorry to disappoint, Madam, but if I were you, I'd watch your back because my country is not your friend.
I'm sorry to disappoint, Madam, but if I were you, I'd watch your back because my country is not your friend.<eos> We should go.<eos> Ma'am, please.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> You brought me here to listen to him.
Saul would not have made a mistake like that.<eos> Javadi is lying.<eos> It's the only explanation.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I can think of others, including one where you were wrong and I was wrong to have ever listened to you.
Goodbye, Carrie.<eos> Majid, wait.<eos> Talk to me, for Christ's sake.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> You really don't know, do you?
- Why, Majid?<eos> - Because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. - Sorry, old friend.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Dar?<eos> You reached out to Dar Adal?
I bet on a horse.<eos> In the end, I went with the sure thing.<eos> No, I won't let you do this.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> Are you all right?
In the end, I went with the sure thing.<eos> No, I won't let you do this.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Saul, you all right?
Are you all right?<eos> Saul, you all right?<eos> No, I'm not all right.<eos> Fucking miles away from all right.<eos> Where on earth did you get this?
Astrid!<eos> Stupid.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Stupid!<eos> You stayed.
All your neighbors flew south for the winter.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Car keys?<eos> Yeah, in the ig-- key thingamajiggy.<eos> What are you doing?
I got the wrong...<eos> That's it?<eos> That's your apology?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You punched me.
Are you going to be able to do this?<eos> Live out here?<eos> Make a life for yourself?<eos> In truth, I don't know.<eos> You going to try?
Make a life for yourself?<eos> In truth, I don't know.<eos> You going to try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're different than you were.
Can't you stay?<eos> I'm still here, aren't I?<eos> Say something nice now, Peter.<eos> This is the time.<eos> You're my friend.
Friend?<eos> Yes.<eos> Friend.<eos> You idiot.<eos> Don't you know anything?
Excuse me.<eos> You have ID?<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sure each president can remember a time not that long ago when there was this consensus-- you are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own facts.
And I'm calling on the media to do their jobs and check their facts.<eos> Are you aware of the petitioning to have your son's body removed from Arlington Cemetery?<eos> - Well, they've collected a quarter-million signatures online.<eos> What about the rumor that your nominee for Secretary of Defense has withdrawn his name?<eos> As far as I know, you are starting that rumor yourself
He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.
You're fighting for your lives here.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> You can't afford to stay silent-- and I don't mean press conferences.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said, "Show your face."
Elizabeth Keane.<eos> Welcome, Madam President-Elect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, let me ask you what everyone is asking right now-- why are you here?<eos> Because you invited me.
Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.<eos> Trust me, I have taken some beatings from the mainstream media.<eos> I'm here because a video was released last night which viciously slandered my dead son.<eos> I challenged the people responsible for making it to show their faces, and you did.
So, here I am.<eos> You do know it's not slander if it's true?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Not true.<eos> Have you seen it?
Some men ran towards the fight.<eos> Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother-- any mother-- watch the last moments of her son's life?
But what happens next?<eos> Six eyewitnesses testified Andrew was killed pulling a wounded soldier out of enemy fire.<eos> So, what happens next?<eos> Where is the original footage?<eos> You produced the video.
- Yes.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.
- Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video.<eos> You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.
No one's faking that.<eos> Boy, are they angry.<eos> You know what would make them even angrier?<eos> If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.
You know what would make them even angrier?<eos> If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.<eos> That is an outrageous lie!<eos> You are not a free voice speaking truth to power.
If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.<eos> That is an outrageous lie!<eos> You are not a free voice speaking truth to power.<eos> You're a government shill.
- I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.
Hey, there.<eos> This is Bill.<eos> I just want to say--<eos> Hang on, Bill.<eos> Are you real?
He looked so calm and at peace.<eos> And all of a sudden, he just kind of faded out like he was on a dimmer.<eos> And, um-- and he was gone.<eos> And it was beautiful.<eos> So, you just happened to be awake and looking right at him at the exact moment that he, uh, dimmed out?
Your children, Erin and Jeremy, would you like to see them again?<eos> I've got news for you, you shit.<eos> Your third party obviously doesn't know that I'm a fraud investigator for the DSD and I'm gonna have this call traced and I'm gonna find out what exactly it is--<eos> They know your kids' names, Nora.<eos> I'm pretty sure they know what you do.
Oh, of course. May I have the guest's name, please?<eos> Um, Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> Mark: Who is it?<eos> They just called from downstairs.<eos> You know who it is.
They don't stay in one place for too long.<eos> That was smart of them.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> They made me go to a hotel in Phoenix.<eos> I felt the same way you do right now when I heard it the first time.
Uh, I think it's based on a percentage of your overall net worth.<eos> - I can tell you what I paid--<eos> - Mark.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place to be with their loved ones.
Please insert your parking ticket.<eos> Please insert your parking ticket.<eos> Please insert your parking ticket.<eos> I prepaid at the fucking machine!<eos> What do you want me to do?
Which one do you wanna print?<eos> This one, please.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - How big can I make it?<eos> You are a heartless bitch.
I-it's just, um,<eos> Ginny's not feeling well, so...<eos> Ginny?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know who she is.
Indeed it is.<eos> "And He looked at them and raised His hand, but they did not wave in response.<eos> And so He clutched the stone to His chest and jumped into the water."<eos> I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> I know who you are.
"And He looked at them and raised His hand, but they did not wave in response.<eos> And so He clutched the stone to His chest and jumped into the water."<eos> I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Well, I don't know who you are.
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> My name is Grace Playford and I need your help.<eos> Well, Grace, uh, I'm off duty, so why don't you and your girlfriends run along home before I call Mr. Playford?
The President is just fine.<eos> Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.<eos> - Howdy.<eos> - G'day.<eos> Do you deliver mail to the communities around here?
Sharon's over at the Cultural Center on Borland Circuit.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had my mail forwarded.<eos> I heard how helpful you were down here.
Every sacred site, every ceremony, every word.<eos> You want my song?<eos> It's the last one.<eos> The last one.<eos> And it is my understanding that you are the only man alive who knows it.
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me.<eos> Sit!<eos> Sit.<eos> Friend, I am acting in your best interest.<eos> You are looking at an initiated Yanmedjaran.
Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> We all know each other.<eos> It's a tiny country.<eos> I know Chris.<eos> You're the fella that landed on him.
Because I thought he'd come back.<eos> And once I'd proven my faith, he would have no choice but to help me talk to my children one last time.<eos> So, I thought you were sent by God.<eos> Sent with a message just for me.<eos> But you're not an angel.
Let's have a baby.<eos> I just killed a man, a police chief named Kevin, because I thought he'd come back.<eos> I've gone a bit crazy, haven't I?<eos> No, Grace.<eos> You just got the wrong Kevin.
- Okay.<eos> - God bless you!<eos> There we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Well, you're a good person, taking a stranger's baby.
- God bless you!<eos> There we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Well, you're a good person, taking a stranger's baby.<eos> She could run off right now, you'd never see her again.
- I was just...<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> Let's take a walk, mate.<eos> I need to get a book that I was looking...<eos> You're leaving.
- I have to go.<eos> - No, no.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> What?<eos> I have compassion for you because you are ill.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> She told me to tell you that I was who you thought I was and then you'd go away.
No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?<eos> Everything I need is here.<eos> What about you?
I don't like the odds.<eos> Odds?<eos> All we know for certain is that we are sending people to the exact same destination the others went seven years ago.<eos> The odds that this destination has a sustainable environment with a breathable atmosphere and ample food supply are very, very low, so it is more likely there are 140 million corpses floating out there in space somewhere.<eos> You make it sound so appealing.
Oh, yes.<eos> And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.
And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.<eos> Um, she believes that you're curious, but once the time comes, you will get...
We know who Kevin is and we're not worried.<eos> What's your question?<eos> Two infant twins are born.<eos> One of them will grow up to cure cancer, but only if the other one dies now.<eos> You don't have to kill the baby yourself, but you do have to nod to make it happen.
Reverend, I-- I can't leave my mother.<eos> That's $20,000.<eos> It should be more than enough to compensate you for your time and get excellent care for your mother.<eos> Something incredible is gonna happen in the next few days on the seven year anniversary, but only if we go now, right now.<eos> You-- you said that we needed to be in Miracle on the 14th.
Stop, stop!<eos> Man overboard!<eos> Man overboard!<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw what you did.
We need to focus on Kevin now.<eos> Where's my book?<eos> I threw it overboard.<eos> It was just getting good.<eos> You know how it ends.
I threw it overboard.<eos> It was just getting good.<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Because you know everything.
What makes you say that?<eos> Because you know everything.<eos> You're being sarcastic.<eos> No.<eos> Why don't you, uh, transform those ropes into serpents and free yourself?
You're being sarcastic.<eos> No.<eos> Why don't you, uh, transform those ropes into serpents and free yourself?<eos> I don't need to do that.<eos> You're going to untie me once you get what you want.
You'll tell the captain and the authorities?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm the authority.<eos> Oh, right, you're the authority on everything-- creation, Isaac and Abraham, the decathlon.
Mount Everest?<eos> The Mona Lisa?<eos> - The sudden departure?<eos> - Yeah, that was me.<eos> The sudden departure was you?
Everything you've done you've done because you thought I was watching.<eos> Because you thought I was judging.<eos> But I wasn't.<eos> I'm not.<eos> You've never done anything for me.
Ladies and gents, we will be docking in Melbourne shortly.<eos> Please dispose all rubbish and collect your personal belongings before you disembark.<eos> Thank you for sailing with us.<eos> We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.<eos> There you are.
We're all gone.<eos> Bye, Laurie.<eos> Good-bye, Kevin.<eos> Far out as I can take you with that storm rolling in.<eos> If you're gonna go, you best go now.
Right.<eos> "He stood on the bow of The Merciful... the water endlessly stretching to the infinite horizon as he contemplated the impossible distance between them, but he would not stop until he found her."<eos> What, are you writing a book?<eos> There's no shame in it.<eos> What you do in your time is your business.
President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.<eos> And based on our intel, in, well, just under two hours he's gonna start an unsanctioned nuclear war.<eos> And you are the only man alive who can get to him before he does.
Christopher Sunday.<eos> Christopher Sunday?<eos> The Prime Minister of Australia?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Man, you want that kind of high-level access, you're gonna have to talk to the boss yourself.
Yeah.<eos> Man, you want that kind of high-level access, you're gonna have to talk to the boss yourself.<eos> Here.<eos> Stick that in your ear.<eos> You'll hear him, he'll hear you.
- Mission control.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> ♪ I'm sitting in the railway station ♪<eos> ♪ Got a ticket to my destination ♪<eos> ♪ Mm... ♪ You made me sing.
My father?<eos> John.<eos> He wants me to tell you... he wants you to know... that you're loved.<eos> Is there anything you want me to tell him?<eos> Are you fucking serious?
You're not!<eos> You're just a puppet.<eos> That speech you just gave?<eos> Were those even your words?<eos> Because it didn't sound like you believed a single thing you were saying.
Because it didn't sound like you believed a single thing you were saying.<eos> You just do what they tell you to do.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> What do you want?
I just got off the phone with the Kremlin who confirms that there is no submarine, no separatists.<eos> This is a smoke screen.<eos> You have been fed bogus intel.<eos> I don't get fed, I feed.<eos> And you clearly have no goddamn idea what's happening around here.
We give them what they want.<eos> And they want to die.<eos> Well, that's not gonna work.<eos> You can't launch without going through the Fisher Protocol.<eos> You know about the Fisher Protocol?
Show us your hands!<eos> - Show us your fucking hands!<eos> - Here!<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - Did you fucking sell me out?
Don't you fucking move.<eos> Hey, are you there?<eos> I said don't fucking move!<eos> Jesus.<eos> You look just fucking like him.
Yes.<eos> Then you know that the president will not hesitate to cut you open and pull it out.<eos> I mean, I know this man.<eos> He is cold and he is merciless.<eos> You think he gives a shit about you if he's willing to end the world?
What's happening?<eos> What was that noise?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're God.
I don't know.<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're God.<eos> That was just a pick-up line.<eos> Did you fucking kill her?
Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you Christopher Sunday?<eos> Yes.<eos> My name is Kevin, and I know this is gonna sound crazy... but you're not the Prime Minister of Australia.
Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...
Oh, well, that's strange.<eos> Is that your room?<eos> It might be.<eos> But I certainly haven't seen any men on ladders.<eos> You just had sex with him.
- Did not.<eos> - Then swear to God.<eos> All right.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> You're a fucking liar!
You need to trust me to do the job.<eos> Rebecca, what is this?<eos> Is Rebecca having second thoughts about giving up her career?<eos> You're gonna make a great First Lady.<eos> Maybe part of her doesn't want you to win and have everything change.
I guess I just convinced myself it happened so long ago no one would ever find out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I will, I'll draft my letter of resignation and explain how I kept...<eos> I won't accept your resignation.<eos> It's true you should have told me... but it's also true that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
Gage will just keep playing the national security card.<eos> Rebecca could help us out there.<eos> - You'll still take a hit. - Well, the hit I can take.<eos> It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me.<eos> Standing up for the truth the way you did, it's what I've been telling the American people I'm gonna do for them.
I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air.<eos> There's no air that needs clearing.<eos> We have nothing to talk about Andy.<eos> Agent Locke, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Sorry, who are you again?
_<eos> Rebecca respects you.<eos> It's not about not trusting you.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> Once she confirmed you weren't the breach, she was relieved.
He's not the leak.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Now, he's up to speed on everything.<eos> He knows you need to get Grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.
Over the last few hours, terrorists killed four of the Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.<eos> This is a copy of my server log.<eos> The highlighted subroutine contains the wit-sec information on those Rangers. It was accessed 25 days ago at 6:05 a.m. from your I.P. address.<eos> Nilaa, we've known each other a long time.<eos> I don't want this to be you, so help me understand.
The terrorists, they... they got away with the list.<eos> I don't know how many times I can say it.<eos> I didn't leak the identity of those Rangers.<eos> I saw that ATM footage.<eos> You say you were out there jogging, but it shows you at the exact place at the exact moment when the data on those Rangers was stolen.
- Talk to me!<eos> Please, I just said, go.<eos> I am not going anywhere until you tell me the truth.<eos> I have told you the truth. You're not listening.<eos> You understand,
We'll work on her there.<eos> Okay.<eos> On my way.<eos> With me.<eos> You're coming with us to CTU.
Eric... are you hearing what you want to hear from Grimes, convincing yourself you can trust him?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you blame yourself for what happened today.<eos> Look, Rebecca, I told you and Mullins what I think. And right now, I don't see any other option.<eos> Do you?
Do you?<eos> I can't get you the Onyx schematics.<eos> Right.<eos> But I know someone who can.<eos> You'd have to handle the rest yourself.
Rebecca, the list of sleeper cells, the terrorists have it.<eos> My God.<eos> You got anywhere with Nilaa Mizrani?<eos> Right now, she's our best hope to stop Jadalla from activating those sleeper cells.<eos> You're coming with us to CTU.
You ever heard of an arms smuggler, goes by the name Gabriel?<eos> He's a ghost.<eos> I can get us to him.<eos> See if he knows where Bin-Khalid's people are.<eos> Carter, you're an Army Ranger, you're not a CTU agent, and I cannot authorize this mission.
It's over.<eos> You're in the clear.<eos> Was someone else arrested?<eos> That's classified.<eos> You accused me of doing some terrible things. You really believed it.
People inside the campaign were already whispering about me before the Gage ad.<eos> Now they will never stop.<eos> My reputation's destroyed.<eos> How do I go back to my job now?<eos> How do I just go back to my life knowing what you and John really think of me?
Son of a bitch.<eos> This may be our only lead.<eos> All right, Tech's still scrolling through the hard drive's data. If we find something.<eos> Copy that.<eos> You steal classified missile specs to use as bait. Draw out Gabriel, only for him to end up dead before we can question him?
I need to speak to Rebecca Ingram.<eos> Rebecca is indisposed.<eos> What do you need from her?<eos> I want to assist in Jadalla Bin-Khalid's takedown.<eos> Uh, look, Carter, you got us the lead we needed, and we're grateful, but...
Rebecca is indisposed.<eos> What do you need from her?<eos> I want to assist in Jadalla Bin-Khalid's takedown.<eos> Uh, look, Carter, you got us the lead we needed, and we're grateful, but...<eos> But you're not a CTU agent.
Thanks.<eos> This is Locke. Go ahead.<eos> Uploading satellite feed and property schematics to you now.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> You seem to be the only one running point for field operations today.
Uploading satellite feed and property schematics to you now.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> You seem to be the only one running point for field operations today.<eos> Where's Andy?<eos> I think you better ask him yourself.
I gotta go.<eos> Nilaa.<eos> I questioned your loyalty, I'm sorry.<eos> John...<eos> Rebecca told me you were the one who knew I was innocent. That you turned in your father.
Uh, wait a minute.<eos> You're... you're not actually asking me to repair the drive, are you?<eos> I'm asking you to help me destroy it.<eos> I'm gonna bring you to him.<eos> We will tell him that you're gonna repair the drive, but instead, you're gonna erase it.
How long ago did he call?<eos> 15, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Senator, we haven't finished yet.<eos> Unless I'm under arrest, you need to stand down from this door, sir.
I always have. Always will.<eos> Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> And you must be Mr. Shalowitz.
Andy Shalowitz on a suicide mission.<eos> That's hard to believe.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> He's not exactly known for his fortitude.<eos> Yeah, maybe he decided he had nothing left after you took the job he loved and lived for.
Andy.<eos> I need you to keep it together.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Now you.
Meantime, this dude gonna tell us where they took Eric.<eos> They messed with the wrong people.<eos> You think you can do this to me and just get away clean?<eos> I'm a powerful man.<eos> This will catch up to you.
They messed with the wrong people.<eos> You think you can do this to me and just get away clean?<eos> I'm a powerful man.<eos> This will catch up to you.<eos> You're young.
Relax.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.<eos> This was a decoy.<eos> The real flash drive is safe.<eos> And now that Hamid knows where your virus is, he can disable it. And you'll recover the list for us.
I won't do it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said I won't help you recover your files.<eos> You're very brave.
We'll see.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> How did you and Jadalla Bin-Khalid communicate?<eos> Mr. Donovan, you have to know<eos> that by keeping quiet, you're putting thousands of American lives in danger.
We gotta look at the larger picture here.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't go along with this.<eos> I'll appeal directly to the Secretary of Defense if I have to...<eos> This has been cleared through the SecDef.<eos> The fighters are in the air, waiting for the coordinates that you're gonna provide.
Already being done.<eos> Carter, are you sure it was Naseri?<eos> It was him.<eos> Look, get more men here, pull up whatever satellites, just do whatever the hell you gotta do, okay?<eos> You know what he is, and what he's capable of.
Fix the flash drive. Recover the data on it.<eos> I won't help you recover your files.<eos> Andy Shalowitz on a suicide mission.<eos> That's hard to believe.<eos> Yeah, maybe he decided he had nothing left after you took the job he loved and lived for.
Where is he?<eos> Asim Naseri is in the country.<eos> He was here.<eos> Naseri?<eos> You know what he is, and what he's capable of.
What is your name?<eos> Now. It's Jennifer Marshall.<eos> Secure the house.<eos> Put your hands above your head.<eos> Who are you?
I'm fine.<eos> I just, uh... Fighting something.<eos> Ms. Ingram, biometrics are in place, whenever you're ready.<eos> I'm Rebecca Ingram.<eos> But you already know that.
Henry.<eos> I just got your message.<eos> What do you mean, "John's in trouble"?<eos> Henry, he's been taken.<eos> By Jadalla Bin-Khalid, the man you sold those soldiers' lives to.
I don't understand.<eos> Jadalla's men broke him out of CTU.<eos> John was on his way here to see me, and they took him.<eos> He's gone, Henry, and right now, we have no way to get him back.<eos> You were in contact with Jadalla.
Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Hello.<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> But he's not our enemy, you are.
I need to take this.<eos> Hello.<eos> John Donovan's execution in front of the world would make a powerful statement.<eos> But he's not our enemy, you are.<eos> You are the one who dedicated your life to hunting us down, who got a medal for leading the raid on my father.
Jadalla and Naseri, they want to stage my execution.<eos> They wanna show the world that they can defeat the woman who tried to destroy them.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You wanna use yourself as bait?<eos> And I want you to finish them off.
I guess the only monsters in this world are the ones who kill Americans.<eos> No.<eos> No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people.<eos> On that score, your wife is second to none.<eos> And you're a liar.
No, those who, for whatever their reasons, murder innocent people.<eos> On that score, your wife is second to none.<eos> And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but... You're never gonna see her again.
Step out of the vehicle with your hands raised.<eos> On your knees.<eos> I said on your knees.<eos> Drop it.<eos> You, too.
I want you to move to the center of the field.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I hear you.<eos> But I'm not moving until you release my husband.<eos> No, you're not making the demands here.
That's the only way this is gonna work.<eos> Look at your husband.<eos> Now, do what I say. Or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.
Look at your husband.<eos> Now, do what I say. Or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself, my husband means nothing to you.
Now, do what I say. Or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself, my husband means nothing to you.<eos> You want the woman who almost took your life. You want the woman who killed your father.
Get ready.<eos> What is it?<eos> The field's soaked in gasoline.<eos> Rebecca, get the hell out of there.<eos> You're gonna read your confession!
Rebecca, you're not seriously considering this?<eos> They want to stage my execution.<eos> They're gonna want to kill me themselves.<eos> You wanna use yourself as bait?<eos> And I want you to finish them off.
Why is he coming here?<eos> I've given him provisional status as co-director of the CTU.<eos> From now on, any planning or decisions are to be coordinated through him.<eos> Sir, with respect, um... I think that's a huge mistake.<eos> Keith, you allowed Rebecca Ingram to fall into the hands of terrorists.
And they got to her before I could, and I just...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am sorry, but I still think there's time to save Rebecca.<eos> Well, I wish I could believe that.<eos> But like you, I came face to face with this Naseri and Bin-Khalid.
You're absolutely sure about all of this?<eos> Andy Shalowitz is. And I trust him.<eos> So does Rebecca.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to get you to start looking like a Secret Service agent.
I was wrong, Eric.<eos> I shouldn't have come down on you like that before.<eos> You weren't wrong.<eos> No, no.<eos> You were just following Rebecca's lead.
We know what you did to Asim Naseri's daughter.<eos> What?<eos> John, I honestly don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Don't give me that.<eos> You have information that could potentially save Rebecca's life, and you're holding on to it so you could cover your ass?
That'd save some American lives.<eos> I should have thought that being married to Rebecca would have opened your eyes by now.<eos> Why would you say something like that?<eos> Because your wife understands how the world operates.<eos> I think I've learned enough about Rebecca to know that, yes, she's willing to push some boundaries, but she would never do what you've done.
Pressure from the agency, the president?<eos> Are you suggesting that she had a part in all of this?<eos> What if I told you that it was her idea?<eos> You're supposed to call me a liar, John.<eos> You are a liar.
You can't escape justice.<eos> We should've known you'd try something like that.<eos> It's what a coward would do. Someone who'd take the life of a 10-year-old girl.<eos> I can't imagine it was too difficult for you to order the death of my daughter.<eos> After all, you don't have any kids.
Hello?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hands.<eos> On the floor. Now.<eos> Who the hell are you?
The Sheikh wants you to execute the sentence.<eos> Asim?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know you turned this down before, but I promise you, this is the last chance.<eos> If Rebecca dies, I will put Ara back where I found her, and you'll never hear from her again.
You'd rather die than expose your country's crimes?<eos> It wasn't my country.<eos> It was me.<eos> God willing, you will be punished for your crimes.<eos> And you for yours.
Uh, Senator, we're almost there. I'll reach out the moment<eos> I have anything new.<eos> You think you're saving your wife, John?<eos> Once this gets out, she'll wish she was dead.<eos> Well, you seem to have lived with it just fine.
She was shot.<eos> They're taking her to a hospital.<eos> How about Naseri's daughter?<eos> Safe in the Jordanian embassy.<eos> Which means everything you've done will come out, and you won't be able to talk your way out of it.
How without Nomi?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hello, Officer.<eos> I do believe you're in need of assistance.<eos> Who the hell are you?
If you see me at the coffee machine, you wait until Steph is there before you pitch me the cream.<eos> I am a survivor.<eos> And I will do whatever it takes to avoid my fate.<eos> Ask yourselves... Are you?<eos> You have an amazing level of insight into how we hedgies think.
Who isn't excited about textbooks?<eos> We aren't here about textbooks.<eos> We're recruiting officers.<eos> We're with an agency called the Institute for Global Advancement.<eos> You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.

And you happen to be the perfect man for the job.<eos> - All right.<eos> - You own two properties.<eos> A one-bedroom condominium and a home where you used to live with your wife and your daughter.<eos> You make your alimony payments on time, you help in paying for your daughter's private high school education, and you carry no unsecured debt.

Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes.<eos> The bad guys missed you.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night.<eos> You were one of them.
Hang on, hang on.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry, love.<eos> Hey, you okay?
Ran.<eos> Oh, you got a problem with how I do shit, pretty boy?<eos> Taystee?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm telling the real story, 'cause you sure the hell didn't.
We?<eos> Piss off, Bloody Mary.<eos> I'm not helping you.<eos> I'm making earplugs out of pencil erasers.<eos> You know, Flores is outside with a shiv, and I'm closer to the door than you are.
With the O2 level so low in the rest of the ship, it will target oxygen candles.<eos> We can use them as bait.<eos> There are two lifeboats, A and B.<eos> Both set to default entry trajectory.<eos> You press the button, they autopilot themselves to the surface.
'Rohan, please be there at 10:45 am, okay? '<eos> I'll be there on time.<eos> Please don't worry. - 'Okay.'<eos> But Mrs. Mukherjee, it would be nice to have you there too.<eos> It was you who fixed this.
All set!<eos> - Yes..<eos> Thanks, Rohan.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - You're the best.
- Yes.<eos> What is it?<eos> Did you see her?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Rohan, you are fair but she is much fairer than you.
I am not dependant on anyone.<eos> But in real life, how can two negatives make a positive?<eos> Actually..<eos> It's funny, because I too don't wish to get married.<eos> So, then.. Why did you.. - The same!
So, then.. Why did you.. - The same!<eos> Mrs. Mukherjee and her pressures!<eos> Oh!<eos> But..<eos> In this one meeting, I have learnt that you are very confident and independent
and I think, that's really amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May I say something, Su?<eos> A person's trust in himself, is his strength.<eos> We are not weak, you and I.
Then, why are you afraid of being a companion?<eos> Because darkness cannot bring light in a dark room, Rohan.<eos> Right.<eos> But.. In the dark, if you have a partner the void can be filled. Am I right?<eos> You have confused me, completely!
I dance.<eos> Do you dance well?<eos> - I think, I dance quite well.<eos> Really? - Yes.<eos> What about you?
- Yes, I am.<eos> Rohan, are you mad?<eos> What will the people think?<eos> If we think what people think, what will the people think, Su?<eos> Rohan, you are..
Security.<eos> I have been trying to find my friend for a while now.<eos> She is lost.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> You have a mic.
You're using my line on me!<eos> But actually, Rohan<eos> I have never even dreamt about such beautiful things fearing they won't come true.<eos> No, Su.<eos> You.. You must dream more.
"This is the start of our lovely lives."<eos> "Your dreams and mine are locked up in our minds." "And the key to that is at a place we cannot reach!"<eos> "Yet, if I fulfil the dreams, we will then be certain" "if I am capable of your love or not." "I am capable of your love or not."<eos> "I will write your name on sand by the waters."<eos> "I will then call out you! You make me happy."
"Your dreams and mine are locked up in our minds."

"I am capable of your love or not."<eos> "I will write your name on sand by the waters."<eos> "I will then call out you! You make me happy."<eos> "You are so wonderful, as the bliss of spring."
Besides, everyone wants results in the first year.<eos> Don't worry about that, though.<eos> There are many kids in the colony already.<eos> You take your time.<eos> - You are crazy!
- What?<eos> I mean, without seeing, how can they..<eos> They touch and feel!<eos> Candles!<eos> You remembered!
Are these candles?<eos> I don't know how they got here.<eos> Really?<eos> Liar!<eos> Su, you have completed my incomplete life.
'Oh, who is that? '<eos> 'Don't worry, dear.<eos> - Dad! '<eos> 'Listen..'<eos> 'You cannot do this, Romeo.
Who is speaking?<eos> This is Amitabh Bachchan speaking, Rohan's friend.<eos> How are you?<eos> Mr. Amit!<eos> It's really you!
Since Anup told me about it I have buttoned my shirt till the neck.<eos> Can you imagine!<eos> - Really?<eos> Who started it?<eos> - You did.
- Really?<eos> Who started it?<eos> - You did.<eos> I did?<eos> - You are such a liar!
Hey, what happened?<eos> - That's better.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Actually, Ms. Su the driver thought we would not realise it.<eos> And I knew that it was you, my dubbing artist.
Actually, Ms. Su the driver thought we would not realise it.<eos> And I knew that it was you, my dubbing artist.<eos> Oh, now you're using my line on me.<eos> Seriously, Su!<eos> You are so smart.
I must watch out.<eos> Well, that is true..<eos> Who is there?<eos> Amit?<eos> Is that you?
Go on.<eos> Listen to me..<eos> I had something important to ask.<eos> Despite trying so hard, we cannot even lure a maid.<eos> But you, being blind, hit just the right one..
Wasim, look at this.<eos> It seems this guy went all the way, last night.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> - Rohan, tell me something.<eos> Did you bite her too?
I called you so many times!<eos> You know who was at the studio today?<eos> Aamir Khan!<eos> I wanted you to talk to him but you never answered my calls.<eos> You are too much!
Aamir Khan!<eos> I wanted you to talk to him but you never answered my calls.<eos> You are too much!<eos> You had such a good chance.<eos> You missed it.
We need to get to the hospital!<eos> Open up!<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> Who is it?<eos> - Hey, you.. You've irritated me with all the banging!
Rohan!<eos> Rohan!<eos> Rohan..<eos> - Supriya!<eos> You..
Your report is ready.<eos> The doctor will see you now.<eos> Mr. Bhatnagar, do not expect much from this report.<eos> The 24 hours following the molestation are the most critical for evidence.<eos> You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.
You people are very cunning.<eos> Ma'am.. Are you really molested?<eos> Or are you just making up..<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> You just don't understand!
'No clinical evidence of rape.' It says here, clearly!<eos> You guys are frauds.<eos> You filed a complaint of molestation and then, disappeared for 24 hours.<eos> You must have thought of a plan in the 24 hours, right?<eos> What kind of a man are you?
Have a little before going to bed.<eos> 'Your wife is so good that she can starve for you..'<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Rohan, I'm not forcing you, but we have a deadline to meet.<eos> Since you had dubbed these voices, I had no other choice.
If she had to commit suicide, why didn't she do it after the first molestation?<eos> Why did she do it after the second one?<eos> See you around.<eos> 'Rohan, neither you nor your love for me is weak.' 'We would have been normal in a few days' 'and continue living our lives peacefully.'<eos> 'But if, what happened today, happened often' 'you would have shattered' 'and I would not be able to tolerate it.'
'Percy.'<eos> 'I found the ball, ma'am.<eos> - Good.'<eos> 'And don't worry about the glass, I'll clean it up.'<eos> 'Ma'am, have you made 'Parathas'? '
Do you think he's free for you?<eos> Do you know how many precincts he looks after?<eos> He has to handle so many cases.<eos> You don't even have a case.<eos> You're a fraud.
I asked you to leave!<eos> Enough of this!<eos> Out!<eos> Nalavde.<eos> - You..
- You know why Nalavde is here?<eos> - No.<eos> Here I am, spending Rs. 4 lakhs on such a matter!<eos> The news reached the party headquarters too.<eos> You just don't seem to care.
- No.<eos> Here I am, spending Rs. 4 lakhs on such a matter!<eos> The news reached the party headquarters too.<eos> You just don't seem to care.<eos> You do all the misdeeds, while I pay the price.
Come.'<eos> 'Let's have some drinks.<eos> Come.'<eos> 'Do you think we're your servants? '<eos> 'Do you have any idea how vast the area is, that he covers? '
- Do something about Wasim right now.<eos> He's with Amit all the time.<eos> Tell me, sir.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> Well.. You arrest people for a couple of days..
Tell me.<eos> Should I book a room?<eos> Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.
Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> So what if you're my friend's son?
Lubna, leave!<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Let me teach him a lesson first.<eos> D-Drop the knife.<eos> Shakeel, you..
How dare you file an FIR!<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Mr. Shelar, Mr. Chaubey is senior to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You're always the first one to ask for money.
I didn't sleep at all.<eos> What?<eos> So..<eos> What were you doing?<eos> Waiting for you to wake up.
Good morning..<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Bhatnagar.<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "you've become my habit."
"Your smile makes me smile." "I want to get lost in you."<eos> "I don't think" "I can live without you now."<eos> "My love for you" "is in the air these days.." "I want to follow your footsteps"<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "you've become my habit."
"I don't think" "I can live without you now."<eos> "My love for you" "is in the air these days.." "I want to follow your footsteps"<eos> "Since a few days" "I've gotten used to you."<eos> "Since a few days" "you've become my habit."<eos> You didn't get the time to get used to it, Rohan.
Everything.<eos> She was all I ever had.<eos> How did you talk in Amit's voice?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You were the one on the phone, weren't you?
- This isn't suicide.<eos> It's a murder case.<eos> How are you, Chaubey?<eos> Amit was in Pune yesterday.<eos> Do you have proof that Amit was in Pune last night?
Do you have proof that Amit was in Pune last night?<eos> Are you questioning me or suspecting me?<eos> Both.<eos> Look, Chaubey<eos> I've been in power for as long as you've been an officer.
All of you pray for the deceased's soul.<eos> Raise your hands.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> One day, you'll have to cry too, sir.
Next time, we'll meet not in your kitchen but in our interrogation room.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Only if you find evidence against me, sir.<eos> You called for me, sir?<eos> Have you got Amit and Wasim's call records?
Your handkerchief was found on Wasim's body.<eos> Are you all crazy!<eos> I didn't kill Wasim.<eos> I know that.. And I know who killed him.<eos> You're next.
Bye.<eos> 'Are you all right, Rohan? '<eos> You!<eos> How did you talk in Nalawde's voice?<eos> You're a very talented guy, Rohan.
Hit me!<eos> My turn.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I must say, although you're blind, you're quite gutsy!
Give it to me.<eos> I must say, although you're blind, you're quite gutsy!<eos> So, handsome!<eos> Are you dead?<eos> Your wife was mightier than you.
Do you have a plan B?<eos> You were right.<eos> This is my revenge.<eos> Hey!<eos> You didn't kill Supriya.
Are you crazy?<eos> We don't have any evidence.<eos> Moreover, he's blind.<eos> The NGO and media will harass us.<eos> You've done what you had to, Rohan.
It's nothing.<eos> Listen, you missed school again?<eos> There's a football match between our colony and Navjeevan Society.<eos> I'm going to practise for it.<eos> You're too much.
How did he come to Mumbai from Pune?<eos> He was safer in Pune.<eos> Who called him?<eos> And how did he agree?<eos> Whose voice did you imitate to call him?
He was safer in Pune.<eos> Who called him?<eos> And how did he agree?<eos> Whose voice did you imitate to call him?<eos> You're very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.
Who called him?<eos> And how did he agree?<eos> Whose voice did you imitate to call him?<eos> You're very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> Remember, you told me that this game has no lifeline.
Sabalkar.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I gave you four numbers.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You've sent me just one address.
Sir, it isn't very late for the people of Mumbai.<eos> Anyway, do I need your permission to go out?<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't argue with me.<eos> You're Bhatnagar's friend, aren't you?
I could have arrested your brother in Pune for Wasim's murder.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I show my cards only when I have three aces.<eos> Neither you, nor this city will burn.
How did you get out of that colony?<eos> Zaffar.<eos> - Yes, Rohan.<eos> - Listen.<eos> I need Percy, Sakharam and you.
I've been punished for it, but.. Now.. It's your turn, Brother..<eos> - What rubbish!<eos> It's not rubbish, Brother.<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> Who are you?
Come out.<eos> Sir.<eos> Anna, get him.<eos> Anna!<eos> You're next.
Let it go.<eos> Your plan has failed, Bhatnagar.<eos> One movement of my finger will bring your life to an end.<eos> But not so soon, Bhatnagar.<eos> You killed Amit in such a way that I couldn't even cremate him.
You killed Amit in such a way that I couldn't even cremate him.<eos> I'll kill you like that too.<eos> Get up!<eos> My Supriya didn't have an easy death.<eos> You won't have an easy death either.
Shelar committed suicide.<eos> Wow!<eos> That was an intelligent plan, Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> But every criminal leaves some evidence behind.<eos> You left behind a witness.
Ouch. I got it, give here.<eos> I parked just out front, sweetheart.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Marteen McGuire, new patient, she came in last night?<eos> Are you family?
What did you observe?<eos> An injured young female came towards us from outside the boat house.<eos> This young girl here? Bethel McGuire?<eos> Yes.<eos> And when you entered the boat house, what did you observe?
We lost our house. That's what happened.<eos> No, they wouldn't run! I'm telling you. They wouldn't do this.<eos> Mrs Fick, have you heard from them?<eos> I'm their mother. They would've let me know. They would tell me something.<eos> Do you think we will hear from your sons? All right.
No, I think this'll be fun.<eos> We both seem nice and normal, right?<eos> Uh, well, you know, I seem normal.<eos> I know that much.<eos> - But... - Grazie. If this gets weird, by the way, by which I mean, if you get weird, then I'm gonna put my headphones in, listen to a podcast, and just eat the food.

If this gets weird, by the way, by which I mean, if you get weird, then I'm gonna put my headphones in, listen to a podcast, and just eat the food.<eos> I won't even look at you. It will be like we're eating alone.<eos> Well, if you get weird... I'll do the same thing. That's a really good plan.
Mm-hmm. Thank you.<eos> Um, so, when I finally got to New York and I knew that I wanted to support myself on my own so I could write, well, I thought that was gonna mean, you know, serving cheesecake in Junior's or temping in the Bronx. And it turned out it meant part-time sex work in an oddly clinical townhouse in midtown.<eos> And you know something?<eos> That was the happiest I've ever been.<eos> But I don't understand because you came to New York because you wanted to write, so I don't really get, like, how, like, servicing other people would give you what you wanted.
Woody Allen, Saul Bellow.<eos> If you give the men the space that they say they need, then their work suffers, they suffer.<eos> I guess that surprises me because I've always thought that I was working towards this moment when everything else would fall away and I would just be, like, you know, alone and able to just indulge my thoughts.<eos> No, but that's bullshit.<eos> I mean, can you even picture that?
I am not a mother, and there's a reason for that.<eos> Because childlessness is the natural state of the female author, okay?<eos> Write that down.<eos> Get used to it, you know?<eos> And, you know, I hate it when everyone says, "Having a baby makes you part of the world."
So, then I'll just put it out there... is being a writer and being a woman at the same time, is it as hard as it seems or...?<eos> Harder.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> As long as I can keep my mother alive, I'm not scared.<eos> You mean tell me mission does not scare you?
- Jesus fucking...<eos> - Cut, please, now!<eos> Take break, Jadviga.<eos> What?<eos> - Still, I feel there's no emotions from you, this feeling of big nothing, which, for me, is not okay.
So, what is it about now that makes him all of a sudden wanna go on and on and on...<eos> - These are lines to explain! - Yes, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I just think I could do a better job if I don't say the lines.<eos> So, which lines would you say, hmm?
- Just...<eos> I... I want lines sometimes, Director Olatta.<eos> Other times, I don't.<eos> It just depends.<eos> Adam, you're very talented, but I cannot keep with the debating you!
- Best of luck with your son's graduation.<eos> I'm fucking leaving!<eos> "Wh-what?<eos> This thing is itchy as fuck!<eos> Oh, you're so hot.
And then I'll come with your cum in my body.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> - I want a countdown. - Yeah.<eos> Five, four, three, two...<eos> You came early.
- Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But couldn't we just, like, um... just get dinner sometimes?<eos> - I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks.<eos> You're always at rehearsal or booty body camp, whatever it is.
You're always at rehearsal or booty body camp, whatever it is.<eos> Ray, it's not my fault if I wanna get strong for myself.<eos> Yeah, no, I know.<eos> And that's great. That's good.<eos> And you are strong.
I don't know. Look, I wanna be in the lion's mouth with you.<eos> - That sounds nice.<eos> - Good.<eos> It sounds cozy and warm and exciting and dangerous.<eos> But I also, I don't know... don't you just wanna, like, get dumplings and throw down a few beers and just catch up?
It sounds cozy and warm and exciting and dangerous.<eos> But I also, I don't know... don't you just wanna, like, get dumplings and throw down a few beers and just catch up?<eos> See what you've been up to and stuff?<eos> Yeah, obviously that would be great.<eos> That's, like, if you asked me like, "What's your ideal plan?" That's my ideal plan.
Oh, no, I can't tonight.<eos> I have a thing. And don't ask.<eos> It's far too long and boring a story to explain what it is.<eos> But, actually, that reminds me, it's gonna be a total nightmare getting uptown.<eos> Do you think if I Uber, it will be made worth it if I'm able to meditate and catch up on emails in the car?
It's not funny.<eos> It feels so bad, okay?<eos> And I didn't even get this one from sex.<eos> I just walked around in wet underwear for a couple of days.<eos> You're gross.

I don't know, Elijah.<eos> My bladder's on fire.<eos> I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.<eos> Jaden Pinkett Smith is starting a greeting card line.<eos> Please! You're gonna look cool for even knowing about it.
I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.<eos> Jaden Pinkett Smith is starting a greeting card line.<eos> Please! You're gonna look cool for even knowing about it.<eos> Can I at least have some pain killers?<eos> Oh, I wish you had asked me, like, two hours ago.
Clean out.<eos> Well, will you tickle my back?<eos> You know how they're shutting the N/R down at DeKalb?<eos> Reminds me of this time back when I was assistant to the transportation commissioner when... and they don't tell you this... they shut the B down, or let's just say they pretended to shut the B down,<eos> - I think you can imagine who I might be talking about. But if you can't, picture this... a train full of homosexuals, me... I don't judge... riding in secret.
Woman: Guys, someone call 911!<eos> Bobby?<eos> Bobby?<eos> and, Desi, it is my personal opinion that we really need to get back to work.<eos> More specifically, you need to get back to work.
More specifically, you need to get back to work.<eos> And I think it would be good for your health.<eos> Oh, for my health? Okay.<eos> So, I should just bail on my recovery?<eos> - Do you think that's a good idea? - No.
So, I should just bail on my recovery?<eos> - Do you think that's a good idea? - No.<eos> Hey, nice doing business with you.<eos> It's been great.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.
- Do you think that's a good idea? - No.<eos> Hey, nice doing business with you.<eos> It's been great.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.<eos> What you just did right there... and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.
It's been great.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.<eos> What you just did right there... and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.<eos> - Okay. - All right.<eos> It's not an insult. Nobody's blaming you.
I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.<eos> What you just did right there... and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.<eos> - Okay. - All right.<eos> It's not an insult. Nobody's blaming you.<eos> Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support, - even encourage his relapse. - Yeah.
- Oh, my God!<eos> - It's not absurd.<eos> - Oh, am I... you're hearing what I'm hearing, right?<eos> - It's okay, it's okay.<eos> We're going to let Desi finish, and when he's done, you can then let us know how you feel.
Good.<eos> As I was saying...<eos> I've had a lot of time to think about this.<eos> And I take full responsibility for where I'm at.<eos> That said, Marne, you were there with me the whole time, right next to me.

You were my partner, but you never saw me.<eos> You just saw this dick... or this voice, you know, or this guitar, or this record contract.<eos> You had this idea about me, but you never actually saw me as a human.<eos> - Me, Desi.<eos> And I fucking loved you.
I loved when things were Marnie.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - You know? And I was all in.<eos> I just couldn't handle me.<eos> And you made that worse.
- Mm.<eos> - You know? And I was all in.<eos> I just couldn't handle me.<eos> And you made that worse.<eos> You did, because when I was struggling, you know, you just shut down.
- You know? And I was all in.<eos> I just couldn't handle me.<eos> And you made that worse.<eos> You did, because when I was struggling, you know, you just shut down.<eos> I mean, you just fucking walked away.
I just couldn't handle me.<eos> And you made that worse.<eos> You did, because when I was struggling, you know, you just shut down.<eos> I mean, you just fucking walked away.<eos> You gave up.
Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me?<eos> I have bruises all over my body from the two-hour massages that I need to deal with the stress of your addiction.<eos> Are you... are you serious?<eos> - Did you hear what she said, man? - Yeah.<eos> Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.
Are you... are you serious?<eos> - Did you hear what she said, man? - Yeah.<eos> Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.<eos> You did.<eos> You really did, Marnie.
Yeah, I know, darling.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you get to keep those jeans, though?<eos> I-I'm sorry?<eos> You don't know. You can do your job without a whole crew of assholes in your face.
I know.<eos> Do you get to keep those jeans, though?<eos> I-I'm sorry?<eos> You don't know. You can do your job without a whole crew of assholes in your face.<eos> You just have one fucking psycho to analyze.

Adam, this is why I'm saying you need to make your own movie.<eos> You are an artist!<eos> I'm someone who knows how to psychologically support an artist.<eos> You can't just make a movie, Jessa.<eos> You need funds and sandwiches and people who care what you have...
You are an artist!<eos> I'm someone who knows how to psychologically support an artist.<eos> You can't just make a movie, Jessa.<eos> You need funds and sandwiches and people who care what you have...<eos> I mean, honestly, you're so boring.
He was trying to tell me this long, elaborate story about Ed Koch, some secret gay train, but I was working, you know?<eos> You can't... you can't listen to everyone at the same time or your fucking head will explode, you know?<eos> Maybe it's about picking who to listen to.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> How long were you on the community board? Three months?
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> How long were you on the community board? Three months?<eos> Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.<eos> I'm worried about you, Ray.<eos> You're smart. You've always been smart, but your priorities are... cuckoo bananas.

You hate your job.<eos> The only thing that gives you a glimmer of joy on this planet is recycling soda cans.
- It's free money! - You know what, Herm?<eos> You're starting to really fucking piss me off.<eos> You know that?<eos> I work hard for you. I work hard for this business, and you're gonna stand there and call me a waste of space?<eos> I don't need you to judge me for not letting Bobby gnash his dentures in my fucking face.

I don't think I'm God, Ray.<eos> Good, because there is no God.<eos> That's a very arrogant position, Ray.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I've been with you through all these phases... the music, the failed sitcom script, the communism, community board, and now you're just coasting.
It's been a brutal fucking day.<eos> I'm not getting into this with you right now.<eos> So sensitive, so testy.<eos> Come on, Ray-Ray.<eos> I'm not calling you a waste of space. I'm calling you a waste of potential.
Yeah, too much.<eos> I'm slipping.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Uh, I remember you.<eos> - How you doing?
It's very noble.<eos> But I do want you to know I tried to sign up for Obamacare and the website fucked me over, so...<eos> Well, I'll get right on that.<eos> Um, I have a UTI.<eos> I get them all the time, so I need, like, Cipro, Pyridium, codeine if you're feeling, you know, fun and fancy.
Yes, your urine tested positive for infection.<eos> In the future, I'd come see us a few days earlier when the symptoms start.<eos> Yeah, it's just sometimes hard to tell if it's, like, just the baseline level of weirdness of my urethra or an actual issue, so it's like what's being alive and what's an infection?<eos> These are my questions.<eos> I'm not sure if you... if you pee after intercourse, but that can also help in preventing them.

And, plus, you're pregnant.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I do now.<eos> The hug kind of feels like the wrong thing, so I'm gonna...<eos> Do you know who the father is?
Yeah, he's a waterski instructor who I'm not likely to see again, so...<eos> He's thrilled.<eos> Listen, um... the abortion is an out-of-pocket expense, but if you need help, I can bring you.<eos> I can have a friend handle it, somebody I trust.<eos> What makes you think I want an abortion?
Ray: How dare Hermie accuse me of wasting my potential?<eos> The audacity.<eos> What has he done with his life?<eos> He's got 20 years of wasted potential on me. 25!<eos> Okay, well, maybe that's why he's being so hard on you, because, you know, he doesn't want you to end up like him.
- And even if I did end up like him, is that so wrong, is that so bad?<eos> He's got a wife, he's got a business, he's got the wisdom of a thousand fortune cookies.<eos> I mean, I don't know.<eos> Maybe that's... maybe I'd be totally fine if I ended up like him.<eos> Well, maybe he wants you to have a life that's better than fine.

- Uh-huh. - You know, something people will remember.<eos> - You know?<eos> - W-wait, like kill yourself?<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, it just really sounded like you were gearing up to that.
I'm sorry, it just really sounded like you were gearing up to that.<eos> I'm not gonna kill myself, Shosh.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Do you wanna kill yourself?
No, no, no. No, we're so not there yet.<eos> - We're way far down.<eos> - We, um... no. We just want you to think about how rich this is, cinematically. You know?<eos> And to think about the story that we could tell.<eos> And we just would really hope that you will grant us permission to share what has transpired with the world and sort of elegantly unfold this...
What about the party?<eos> Ugh, it was total bullshit.<eos> It was just, like, a bunch of old gays being like, "Oh, I'm so busy during the week. I can only do uppers on the weekends."<eos> Oh, well, good for you, Anthony.<eos> - Did you go to the ER? - Uh-huh.
Come here, little girl.<eos> I'm sorry I'm using my pizza hand.<eos> Just adding more grease to this situation.<eos> Hermie?<eos> You there?
No, just these vehicles went missing.<eos> - That's why Alterplex sent me.<eos> - So it's not...<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - Like I said, as far as I know the other you is alive.
We're going home.<eos> All of us.<eos> - First thing in the morning I'm going to quit and we'll get on the first plane out of here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What kind of person are you?
I know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?<eos> That was your mother's decision. Uh-uh.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> That is a lie.<eos> It... it was you.
That was your mother's decision. Uh-uh.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> That is a lie.<eos> It... it was you.<eos> It was you.
Yeah.<eos> I've gotten to know this nice girl, Joanne.<eos> She's helping me with my store Website.<eos> She's single and says she never meets anyone.<eos> She's really cute and nice, and you're really cute and nice.
I've gotten to know this nice girl, Joanne.<eos> She's helping me with my store Website.<eos> She's single and says she never meets anyone.<eos> She's really cute and nice, and you're really cute and nice.<eos> My husband doesn't know many people here, and I'm trying to get him to see how cool this place is and, you know, meet the locals.
I want everyone on the same sheet of music.<eos> This was two delusional maniacs, investigation ongoing.<eos> Okay? You guys know the rest.<eos> You call the National Security Advisor, tell him I'm on my way.<eos> Who are you?
FBI? They're all wrong?<eos> - They're hiding the truth.<eos> - Why would they lie?<eos> I don't know, Dad.<eos> All I do know is I'm not gonna risk you and Mom getting caught up in this, too.
Agent Hall.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> - They took my daughter.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You heard.
Over.<eos> Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?
Who shot me?<eos> Who saved your life?<eos> Tell me what you believe in, Bryan.<eos> Because what I see is a man who is wired to protect others.<eos> It's how you're built, it's who you are.
If you're not responsible, as you say, then how do you even know about this supposed killer?<eos> Because I've been reading Dr. Brennan's e-mails.<eos> Given the evidence, it was only a matter of time until I was considered the prime suspect.<eos> Wait.<eos> You've been reading Dr. Brennan's e-mail?
Dr. Brennan, Hodgins, Angela, and Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Zack, you've been spying on all of their e-mail accounts?<eos> I do not care for the word "spy."<eos> But, yes, I've been keeping myself abreast of what they've been doing on a day-to-day basis.<eos> Let me ask you, you mentioned everyone at the Jeffersonian.
Yes. Based on the texture and color, I was able to ascribe the majority of the fragments to Melissa Goodman, the most recent victim.<eos> What about any evidence that could possibly exonerate or... convict Dr. Addy?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't find any such evidence. Nor was I looking for any.<eos> You always taught me to examine the evidence without any preconceived bias.
I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when... when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.
I admit I have had lapses in memory, most likely due to changes in my medication.<eos> Now may we continue?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Dr. Brennan. If we could, I would like to start with the third victim.<eos> Specifically, on the right hand, you found longitudinal fractures of the second, third and fourth proximal phalanges.
And also, I got Dr. Roshan waiting for you.<eos> Apparently he's got some suspects he wants you to look at.<eos> Okay, bring him in here.<eos> Doc. Agent Booth, thank you for seeing me.<eos> I wanted you to have these as soon as possible.
Where were you?<eos> L for Loafer.<eos> The priest wants to know when he has to perform the rituals. He has to go somewhere else.<eos> Everybody here has had a drink.<eos> Usha, you don't drink.
Who's brown here?<eos> Everybody in the family is nice and fair.<eos> Dear, since this is for Anu, why don't you do it?<eos> Since this is for Anu, why doesn't she do it?<eos> But you are the one born under a cursed star.
Everybody in the family is nice and fair.<eos> Dear, since this is for Anu, why don't you do it?<eos> Since this is for Anu, why doesn't she do it?<eos> But you are the one born under a cursed star.<eos> So, you are the one who has to get married.
Let's have a drink.<eos> Mom, what is this.. - Let's go.<eos> So what can I get you?<eos> "My beloved is here, and the ambience is made."<eos> Technology has advanced so much and you're still listening to these old records?
What happened, baby?<eos> Isn't everything happening too fast?<eos> We've been seeing each other since high school.<eos> How much more time do you need?<eos> Don't you need more time?
So how does it make a difference if we get married now or later?<eos> I can't keep waiting for you to be in the right frame of mind.<eos> That's true.<eos> So you're happy, right?<eos> According to your horoscope if you don't marry a tree first something terrible will happen after your marriage.
I can't keep waiting for you to be in the right frame of mind.<eos> That's true.<eos> So you're happy, right?<eos> According to your horoscope if you don't marry a tree first something terrible will happen after your marriage.<eos> Such as, both of you can fall ill. Your careers might get ruined.
Dolly, handle it. - It's okay.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Yes, let's go.<eos> There's nothing to worry about. - Let's go.<eos> You got us worried for nothing.
Can I sleep with you? - No way!<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Don't try to pull any stunts at night.<eos> What?<eos> - You know..
Why didn't you tell me that he's upstairs?<eos> I.. Okay then, he's not in his room.<eos> What's going on?<eos> So early in the morning..<eos> You too?
Come naked for all I care. Why would I care?<eos> Yes, Piyush, come in..<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> But it is.<eos> Who are you?
This can't be happening.<eos> But it is.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm stuck here from last night.<eos> Who are you?
Who are you?<eos> Why have you got me here?<eos> I.. I.. Why would I get you here?<eos> How do I know? That's why I'm asking you.<eos> You're driving me crazy.
- Tree!<eos> 'After marrying the tree, all your problems' 'will be sorted.<eos> The ceremony is now complete.'<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're a ghost. I'm scared.
So they cut down the tree after I got married to it.<eos> So that's why I'm here.<eos> - Why?<eos> You don't marry a tree, you marry a girl.<eos> And there was only one girl there. That was me. You didn't marry the tree.
I.. 26.<eos> What? - 26.<eos> That's a long time to wait.<eos> - For what?<eos> For you to die.
Or I.. I could even live for 100 years.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> I hope you die soon so that I am free of you.<eos> Here I'm the one who is saddled with a ghost. You want to get rid of me?<eos> Yes, but you are the one who married me.
I'm not exactly having a party here.<eos> I agree I've made a mistake, but is there no way out?<eos> Apart from me dying? Can't you just go?<eos> Where?<eos> You have cut down the tree.
You..<eos> Were you alive before you died? No, no.<eos> I was born a ghost.<eos> - What?<eos> What! Are you daft?
Shut up, you idiot. I don't need a medicine.<eos> Then, what's the matter?<eos> Is it there?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> You keep saying you don't like Phillauri. But you look forward to reading his poems every Monday.
- Let's go.<eos> Why, Shashi? Why don't you come to listen to my songs?<eos> Girls don't go to such gatherings.<eos> Of course they do. They come secretively.<eos> But you don't do that.
You don't like my songs, but you read my poems in the journal.<eos> You can fool the world but how can you lie to yourself?<eos> You have been blessed with such a good voice.<eos> Everybody comes to listen to you sing.<eos> You are so fortunate.
Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> Please.<eos> You know why..<eos> A married woman has to stay in her husband's house as long as she lives.<eos> But aren't you dead already?
Do you remember the editor Gurbaksh Singh's open letter in the newspaper asking Phillauri to disclose his identity?<eos> - I sent a reply to him.<eos> Really?<eos> What did you write?<eos> That you are the real Phillauri.
Try and understand.<eos> I'm not even allowed to go up to Ludhiana.<eos> It took me a lot of courage to write and get these poems published.<eos> Girls from respectable families cannot get involved in such things.<eos> You will go, won't you?
I'm not even allowed to go up to Ludhiana.<eos> It took me a lot of courage to write and get these poems published.<eos> Girls from respectable families cannot get involved in such things.<eos> You will go, won't you?<eos> You are a poet, so intelligent.
- He comes over at odd hours.<eos> Wait, I'll be there!<eos> I'm coming! I'm coming!<eos> Brother!<eos> - Kishanchand! You'll kill her!
I didn't get married so that I could give you all my love.<eos> What did I do wrong that you punished me like this?<eos> He's not worthy of you.<eos> He's worth nothing.<eos> Girls like you don't get involved with men like him.
- Anu, please let him speak.<eos> Kanan, don't be scared.<eos> Tell us what the problem is.<eos> - Let me tell you.<eos> He actually got married to me. And then you got the tree cut down.
What is too early?<eos> I just finished my studies.<eos> Getting married at this age?<eos> So when do you want to get married?<eos> What is it that you want to do that can't be done after marriage?
Well done!<eos> He's got his first world issues to Amritsar.<eos> Where exactly are you searching for yourself?<eos> What does he mean?<eos> You are right here.
What does he mean?<eos> You are right here.<eos> - Should I help?<eos> See..<eos> This is you.
He doesn't know what he is saying.<eos> You guys just don't get it!<eos> - So explain!<eos> - So explain.<eos> My dear, after marriage, you can search..
But they don't know that she is the poetess.<eos> I will make sure she gets her due.<eos> On Baisakhi I'll ask you for her hand in marriage.<eos> Please take care of Shashi till I return.<eos> After that, I'll take better care of her than you ever could.
Don't ruin it for her.<eos> I'm trying to do what everybody wants me to.<eos> I'm trying to make everybody happy.<eos> If you aren't happy, how can you make others happy?<eos> You are a man, so act like one.
If you go ahead and get married in spite of she being there you'll be lonely, always.<eos> "They were empty letters. I cried and sent them to you" "putting the stamps of love on them."<eos> "The paper boat of my love got drowned" "in the river of tears."<eos> "The unmelodious tune of my heart is telling you something, listen to me."<eos> "You are my mirror, so why don't you recognise me?" "You don't believe who I am.
"The unmelodious tune of my heart is telling you something, listen to me."<eos> "You are my mirror, so why don't you recognise me?" "You don't believe who I am.<eos> Don't act like a stranger now."<eos> "A cry of pain is erupting from my heart." "It is ringing like musical notes."<eos> "In my breath, you are like mellow tunes." "Like few strands of saffron, you got dissolved in it."
She's harmless.<eos> It's all right. It's all right.<eos> Anu.. Anu, it's all right.<eos> Wh..<eos> You are lucky you can only see the veil.
Think of how scared I have been.<eos> I can see the ghost.<eos> Why can't I see her?<eos> Well, I'm married to her, so only I can see her.<eos> You didn't want to marry me, but you went and married a ghost?
"The auspicious day is here, come, the courtyard is decorated."<eos> "I met my soulmate. Congratulate me for that."<eos> "He'll come to me with a wedding procession."<eos> "I met my soulmate."<eos> What had I stolen from you that you stole Phillauri from me?
Wait, I'll call your brother.<eos> What happened?<eos> Yuck! Disgusting!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Did you do it with him?
Don't worry. He must have missed the train.<eos> The next train is in the evening. I'm sure he'll be on it.<eos> I will be there to receive him.<eos> All right?<eos> You are looking beautiful.
There is a doctor in Lahore from a good family.<eos> I'll send him a telegram tomorrow.<eos> Lahore is very far from here.<eos> Nobody will know about your past.<eos> That you were disgracefully left at the altar.
Why am I here?<eos> Hey, groom!<eos> You.. You're in the bedroom already?<eos> You can't wait, can you?<eos> Anu's grandfather was just like you.
Here.<eos> This might break, you might lose it but his love will be there forever.<eos> Just like Kanan's love for you.<eos> Isn't it, my dear?<eos> You look so beautiful.
You look so beautiful.<eos> Just like an angel.<eos> Kanan..<eos> Don't you have something to say to your bride?<eos> I was living in a half-remembered dream. And you brought me to my senses.
Don't you have something to say to your bride?<eos> I was living in a half-remembered dream. And you brought me to my senses.<eos> Idiot, say it to her.<eos> I was living in a half-remembered dream.<eos> And you brought me to my senses.
I was living in a half-remembered dream. And you brought me to my senses.<eos> Idiot, say it to her.<eos> I was living in a half-remembered dream.<eos> And you brought me to my senses.<eos> You are my truth. And I bow down to you.
Idiot, say it to her.<eos> I was living in a half-remembered dream.<eos> And you brought me to my senses.<eos> You are my truth. And I bow down to you.<eos> You are my truth. And I bow down to you.
Where are you going? - Come..<eos> Anu, where..<eos> Where are we going?<eos> What is happening, Kanan?<eos> You have no idea, right?
How would you know?<eos> Killed yourself like a fool.<eos> Everybody knows what happened in Amritsar on Baisakhi, in 1919.<eos> What?<eos> "What happens when your past haunts you.." "You are left with no option" "but to seek solace from God!"
You remember that so clearly.<eos> Does that mean you're doing better?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I mean, I do remember things.<eos> I-I remember watching Cam propose to you, how happy you looked.
I don't know where he is. No, no, no.<eos> Your husband calling your phone-- okay, that was a setup.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through.<eos> I saw the explosion on the news.<eos> You know more than what you're telling us, and you're hiding someone.
That's very heavy work.<eos> Sister Ursula charged me with setting out the furniture.<eos> It is a necessary task, and one I do gladly.<eos> Pink ticket number 21.<eos> I think that will be you, Mrs Watts.
Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
But I can't stop stressing about it.<eos> Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.<eos> That is one way of putting it.<eos> Do you think it'll seem like a red flag if I call the NFL and I ask them to use you as a reference instead?
I had no idea those files were classified.<eos> We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.<eos> Why would I want to kill him?<eos> You tell me.
We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.<eos> Why would I want to kill him?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're the one who attacked him with the baseball bat.
Literally. Well, the killer certainly didn't make it easy for us.<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> You mind grabbing that there for me, Tinker Bell?<eos> What?<eos> It's the swab results from the shoulder tissue you gave me.
Okay, yeah.<eos> I did beg Austin to let me keep one student.<eos> He refused.<eos> But I would never murder him over it!<eos> Come on. You weren't just a little bit jealous of Austin being so much more talented than you?
I ran a computer analysis...<eos> No, you didn't. of the prose from that story with work you've written for me.<eos> The result was conclusive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've not only read my novels, but you were once a devoted fan of them.
The X-rays show pronounced bone loss on both femurs.<eos> Almost certainly due to Vitamin D deficiency.<eos> Chances are, she didn't get much sunlight.<eos> And what are you finding?<eos> That you think it's appropriate to share personal details about me with everyone here.
And what are you finding?<eos> That you think it's appropriate to share personal details about me with everyone here.<eos> You have nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> You like to shop on TV.<eos> And you enjoyed telling everyone about it.
You can stop!<eos> That must've been a nightmare for you, 'cause you love your dad.<eos> My father was a monster.<eos> Yeah, but he was still your dad, right?<eos> Who are you?
My client did not...<eos> I do not need a confession.<eos> I got him.<eos> You're done.<eos> Did you kill my father, Agent Booth?
It's just a game, Agent Booth.<eos> Oh, come on. Let's lose that "It's just a game," okay?<eos> There's a lot of money to be made here.<eos> - Right? There's tons of sponsors.<eos> - You would remove - anyone who got in your way.
Victim's sister's here.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Special Agent James Aubrey, work with Booth and Brennan.<eos> Tim Sullivan, former special agent, now professional sandwich maker.<eos> - Oh. You may be my new idol.
I don't know, how about Julia Henshaw?<eos> The college classmate who accused you of sexual assault?<eos> The case was settled.<eos> That's because your daddy paid it off.<eos> How about the reports where you blackmail contractors if they don't do what you tell them to do?
I'm really not trying to shut you out here.<eos> Of course you're not, no one is.<eos> Of course, I remember that.<eos> I had to go to work in that shirt.<eos> You did?
I know.<eos> So, why didn't you?<eos> Because somewhere deep down, I knew where this was going.<eos> It's probably why I left in the first place.<eos> I mean, if I'd have come back, I'd have had to deal with the fact that you still wouldn't choose me.
The victim was thrown.<eos> So, someone else was there.<eos> Two days ago, Adam Hitchcock made an offer on your land for $3 million more than what it's worth.<eos> It was a payoff, wasn't it?<eos> You didn't kill Sarah Abbott.
From what we can tell, he struck our victim with a monkey wrench before shooting him. Will do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, man. How you doing?<eos> Big, big fan. I got to tell you. That is one hell of a ride you got there.
Angie's plotting all the acacia trees in D.C.<eos> in case the apprentice is buried underneath.<eos> Well, that's great, but believe it or not, that's not what I was calling about.<eos> Uh, listen, Doc, I need your help breaking a suspect.<eos> Booth says that you got wicked, Jedi-like ninja powers or something? Why?
I think I have a solution for you-- you should let the idiot go free.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> At minimum, the guy's an accessory.<eos> Which is why you should keep him in your sight, but first let him lead you to his partner in crime.
On the day of the robbery, you handed over the $40,000, but you pocketed $20,000 for yourself.<eos> It was a victimless crime-- the bank is insured in case they're robbed.<eos> Yeah, but the only problem is the bank manager went on TV and said exactly how much was taken.<eos> Dustin must have figured out what you did.<eos> So after he got beaten up by his accomplices, he came back to confront you-- that's when the two of you struggled and you shot him.
And I have to thank you.<eos> You were correct-- the derby was just what I needed.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it.<eos> You see, I think it's very therapeutic every now and then, to-to get out of your proverbial skin, yeah? Right.<eos> What about you, huh?
Slow.<eos> You're still not driving. That is a pretty gnarly scar you got there.<eos> Bald eagle tried to rip my eyes out during a car commercial.<eos> Turns out they don't like wearing top hats.<eos> Doesn't look like you got the, uh, best record with these animals, Dwayne.
Okay. Which would've been fine, if I had a chance to work with it.<eos> So Ron got scratched because he didn't give you enough time to properly train the animal.<eos> The guy didn't know what he was doing.<eos> When you're in charge of a set with weapons, and stunts, and animals, and you don't know what you're doing, people get hurt.<eos> And if anyone knows that, it's you.
My God, he's lying, okay?<eos> Get in his face.<eos> Tell him that we can nail him.<eos> Pin him against the wall.<eos> Look, you seem like a nice guy, Allen.
This industry will eat you alive if you let it.<eos> Hey, do you need anything else, Dr. B?<eos> No.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> You, too.
What's the Bone of Contention dude doing here? You're kidding me.<eos> We're questioning you for murder, pal.<eos> Well, I must be in some serious heat if you brought in the big gun.<eos> Uh, actually, I'm the big gun on this.<eos> Uh, yeah, I know big guns, and you are not a big gun.
I agree.<eos> Anyway, we don't need to talk about this now.<eos> I just... it's something to think about.<eos> And just so you know, Christine's trying to give Michael Vincent a wet willy. Oh, Christine!<eos> You could perforate his eardrum.
Close the banks across the street.<eos> Clear the floor.<eos> Only essential personnel.<eos> No campaign staff, no press, no family, no local police, no florists, no orderlies, no administrators.<eos> I want to see only doctors and nurses, agents, me, and you.
Or it could be Mellie or Jake or me or the Marine standing in the hall out there.<eos> The fact is, it could be almost anyone who meets the basic qualifications to be President, because, legally...<eos> And there are very few limits on what the Electoral College can do and very little precedent to indicate what it might do in a situation like this...<eos> Legally, the next presidency is wide open.<eos> But practically, I think it makes an enormous difference what you do.

I need to call my children.<eos> Their father's dead.<eos> I have to tell them their father's dead.<eos> I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss, but that can't happen.<eos> Who the hell are you? !
Then I realized we shouldn't be caging them, we should be killing them, eradicating them to protect the rest of us.<eos> You don't have a cell in here that can hold me.<eos> Deputy, you're not our first Hellhound.<eos> Human body is 60% water.<eos> Even you can freeze solid, Deputy Parrish.
Telling me where you are.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> _<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.
There's only one way to find out.<eos> _<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.<eos> I know what you've done.
It cannot be done without a general anesthetic.<eos> Oh, I've done it before, friend.<eos> And look what it got you.<eos> You do anything untoward to me while I'm under and I'll...<eos> You are the last man I'd run afoul of.
Everyone scratching each other's backs.<eos> ISIL is starting to attack the city.<eos> They have been building up out in the desert for months.<eos> If they... take the city, they will kill all the secularists, install Sharia law.<eos> You don't seem worried.
You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth.<eos> Your soul.<eos> I just put the hardware into you.<eos> You're the thing that runs it.
"Solve the puzzle and get away with murder."<eos> "Or fail and go directly to jail."<eos> Cops get one more clue about what we did..<eos> It's game over.<eos> All that talk about Lucas backing you all the way, he's selling your business out from under you before we've even started.
Lucas and Charles made this together?<eos> Yes, and Lucas kept it.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Whoever took it knew where to look.<eos> You'll do as you're told.
We have to shut this thing down.<eos> I'm going to have the baby.<eos> - Oh, we'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Did you know that Dunhill was at the Radley bar the same night that we were?
I'm going to have the baby.<eos> - Oh, we'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Did you know that Dunhill was at the Radley bar the same night that we were?<eos> - What were you doing tonight?
- Maybe he wasn't after all...<eos> But his credit card was.<eos> I requested paper receipts from the hotel. I'm interested in seeing a signature on that bill.<eos> Once that happens, there's gonna be more questions.<eos> Why didn't you come to the Radley hotel that night?

- Was it $79?<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> - What was...<eos> I don't recall!<eos> You may wanna wait for me to ask the question first.
- What was...<eos> I don't recall!<eos> You may wanna wait for me to ask the question first.<eos> That's enough for now, Barry.<eos> You okay?
You may wanna wait for me to ask the question first.<eos> That's enough for now, Barry.<eos> You okay?<eos> Sort of like setting fire to my house and then asking if I'm too warm.<eos> Spencer, I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.

Really?<eos> You wanna pull good cop, bad cop on me?<eos> Please.<eos> You are standing on quick sand.<eos> The more you struggle, the faster it's gonna pull you under.
Please, do yourself a favor and get a lawyer.<eos> Two days from now, I'm gonna have<eos> Rollins' credit card slip in my hand.<eos> And if your signature is on it a warrant for your arrest.<eos> ♪ Got a secret can you keep it?

When did you do this?<eos> Look, I know it's a little early and I know it's not going to be a permanent situation but I just figured while the baby is here, that...<eos> Em, stop.<eos> This is great.<eos> And you can stay as long as you want.
And you can stay as long as you want.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it... just makes sense.<eos> At least for a little while.<eos> Where did you find all this?
Rule number one, never send me to voice mail.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Is it?<eos> I think you were having some serious nightmares last night you were really tossing and turning.
Take a look at these.<eos> - Ballroom dancing classes?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Salsa, Tango, Waltz, take your pick.<eos> Since when do you like to dance?
- Ballroom dancing classes?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Salsa, Tango, Waltz, take your pick.<eos> Since when do you like to dance?<eos> I don't, but unless you want our first dance together as a married couple, to be the electric slide
Salsa, Tango, Waltz, take your pick.<eos> Since when do you like to dance?<eos> I don't, but unless you want our first dance together as a married couple, to be the electric slide<eos> I should probably learn.<eos> So, when are you free?
So, when are you free?<eos> I will sign us up.<eos> Um..<eos> I don't know, I'm not really sure about my schedule right now.<eos> Oh, well, I mean any night you want they pretty much have classes going...
- Okay.<eos> Well, we'll figure this out.<eos> And, actually, I've to go meet Jillian to talk about a press schedule.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Well, we'll figure this out.<eos> And, actually, I've to go meet Jillian to talk about a press schedule.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, are you sure you're okay?<eos> You're not still upset with me about...
No, promise.<eos> He doesn't have anything on you, right?<eos> He does.<eos> 'Because that night, I got drunk at the Radley' and I used Rollins' credit card by mistake.<eos> You got drunk?
W-what about our timeline?<eos> For all the cops know Dunhill could have actually been in that bar.<eos> No, they have me on surveillance.<eos> They can't see the card, so they need my slip with the signature on it, and they're gonna have that in a few days.<eos> - You screw anything else up?
No, they have me on surveillance.<eos> They can't see the card, so they need my slip with the signature on it, and they're gonna have that in a few days.<eos> - You screw anything else up?<eos> - No.<eos> How would you know?

Anyone one of us could have made a mistake that night.<eos> That's my point, Emily.<eos> Now, they're gonna be looking.<eos> And I'm the one who turned Dunhill into roadkill.<eos> Spencer, why the hell were you drunk?
Now, they're gonna be looking.<eos> And I'm the one who turned Dunhill into roadkill.<eos> Spencer, why the hell were you drunk?<eos> 'Cause I was upset.<eos> And from what I remember, you had a pretty good view.
In your book store.<eos> - Tomorrow night's event...<eos> - What is this, Jillian?<eos> It's a press packet.<eos> Those are talking points we'd like you to consider...
Um, how we fell in love, Nicole's disappearance<eos> Nicole's rescue, our reunion.<eos> That is what the book is about?<eos> Nicole.<eos> Nicole and you.
Oh, right, but how is Aria supposed to address any of this.<eos> Why don't we talk about, uh, the-the writing process?<eos> Ezra, I understand your life is...<eos> your life.<eos> But you wrote a book about losing the woman you loved and then she was found.
I'd have to be the dumbest publisher since Gutenberg put ink to paper if I didn't take advantage of that.<eos> Look, Aria created Nicole in the book, and...<eos> Everyone at the company respects Aria's contribution, but..<eos> But what?<eos> For goodness sake, Ezra you couldn't have waited till after the book launch to get engaged?
Ashley hired me to create the entire security system.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> But I can't do it for more than ten minutes.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What kind of crappy system did you create?
My head hurts.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not now.<eos> "Pick up my homework or go to detention."<eos> Remember, prison food makes you fat."
I'll have to bring it to the school.<eos> _<eos> I don't even know why we're fighting about this.<eos> - I'm going with you.<eos> - No, you can't.
I don't even know why we're fighting about this.<eos> - I'm going with you.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> I have to go alone, I have no choice.<eos> You don't even know what you're getting yourself into.
I have to go alone, I have no choice.<eos> You don't even know what you're getting yourself into.<eos> It doesn't matter, alright?<eos> If I don't play this game, bad things happen.<eos> Like you winding up in the ER.

What are you supposed to pick up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, I'm not letting you put yourself in danger.<eos> It's a computer repair shop, Caleb the only danger I'm in is being bored to death.<eos> I saw you almost get your face re-heeled at that cobbler shop.
We owe it to her.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does that mean, Hanna?<eos> I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.
What does that mean, Hanna?<eos> I don't think that she would have self-sabotaged that night if it wasn't for everything going on with the three of us.<eos> I was there behind the door when you were begging her to let you in.<eos> She was a mess. I promised her I was over you I gave her permission to fall in love with you.<eos> Well, that doesn't mean that you have to punish yourself and do this solo.
I know that he still cares about me.<eos> Okay, don't overestimate someone's feeling's for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> It-it's risky.<eos> Okay, well, aren't you taking the same risk?
Okay?<eos> It-it's risky.<eos> Okay, well, aren't you taking the same risk?<eos> - With Ali?<eos> - What do you mean?
It's not a puppy, Em, it's a baby.<eos> Okay, Ali is going through this experience, too.<eos> And I think she wants to be a part of the baby's life.<eos> - Is that something she said?<eos> - What are you doing?
Okay, Ali is going through this experience, too.<eos> And I think she wants to be a part of the baby's life.<eos> - Is that something she said?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I know that you guys have made this decision but I think that you're assuming a lot.
Oh.<eos> I'm not the happy ending Jillian was hoping for.<eos> I'm not Nicole.<eos> I'm telling her I'm not doing it.<eos> No, I want you to do it.
But I'm not eager to be in the spotlight right now.<eos> When I wrote this book<eos> I was giving a voice to a ghost.<eos> But now, Nicole can speak for herself and I don't feel comfortable answering questions about her.<eos> It just doesn't feel right not having you there.
I was giving a voice to a ghost.<eos> But now, Nicole can speak for herself and I don't feel comfortable answering questions about her.<eos> It just doesn't feel right not having you there.<eos> I will be there.<eos> Sitting front row and cheering you on.
I got to go shower.<eos> Why wouldn't A.D. pick up this hard drive on her own?<eos> Because it's probably a weapon or something.<eos> Hanna, stop pacing.<eos> Well, how do you know it's not going to explode once you hook it up?
Hanna, stop pacing.<eos> Well, how do you know it's not going to explode once you hook it up?<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> Well, it was sent from A.D.<eos> It might explode, it might poison you and it might poke you in the eye with a box cutter.
That much I figured out, Hanna.<eos> No, I mean A played this in the dollhouse.<eos> Not this song, but Pasty Cline.<eos> It means something.<eos> Well, can you think of any connection that Lucas would have to this?
Hi, Marco.<eos> The apartment's different than how I pictured it.<eos> Don't.<eos> Just say what you came here to say.<eos> Look, I didn't exactly expect a warm welcome but it's-it's hard to talk to you when you're looking at me like that.
Just say what you came here to say.<eos> Look, I didn't exactly expect a warm welcome but it's-it's hard to talk to you when you're looking at me like that.<eos> How am I supposed to look?<eos> I'm the same person that I was three days ago, Marco.<eos> I'm the same person that you brought dinner to and you played ping pong with and the same person that you kissed.
I'm the same person that I was three days ago, Marco.<eos> I'm the same person that you brought dinner to and you played ping pong with and the same person that you kissed.<eos> Well, that might be true.<eos> But it turns out I didn't know that person much.<eos> Well, I know you.
I'm the same person that you brought dinner to and you played ping pong with and the same person that you kissed.<eos> Well, that might be true.<eos> But it turns out I didn't know that person much.<eos> Well, I know you.<eos> I know that you're fair and decent.
Well, that might be true.<eos> But it turns out I didn't know that person much.<eos> Well, I know you.<eos> I know that you're fair and decent.<eos> You're involved in a murder.
Why shouldn't he die in the same disgusting way that he lived?<eos> Because we have something called the justice system.<eos> Yes, and justice is just another way for saying that people should get what they deserve.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Look, I'm not saying I don't understand why you would want him dead.
Yes, and justice is just another way for saying that people should get what they deserve.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Look, I'm not saying I don't understand why you would want him dead.<eos> But it's my job to figure out who broke the law, not why.<eos> Okay, but can't you just stop being a cop?

I'm just asking you to just.. just... please let this one slip through the cracks.<eos> Please, just this once.<eos> You can do that, can't you?<eos> No.<eos> I guess you didn't know me as well as you thought.
You can do that, can't you?<eos> No.<eos> I guess you didn't know me as well as you thought.<eos> I've got to get that.<eos> You've got to go.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alright. What does Lucas have to do with this? I don't know, I didn't ask.<eos> I was too busy committing the theft.<eos> Can you state your name please?
Can you state your name please?<eos> Lucas Gottesman.<eos> Wait, I recognize this.<eos> This is from after Charlotte's murder.<eos> You claim you were at the hotel with Miss Marin.

This is from after Charlotte's murder.<eos> You claim you were at the hotel with Miss Marin.<eos> Are you willing to testify to that?<eos> No.<eos> You caught me in the lie, so I came back to tell the truth.
Are you willing to testify to that?<eos> No.<eos> You caught me in the lie, so I came back to tell the truth.<eos> I have no clue where Hanna was.<eos> Why did you lie?
And I don't think that Hanna had anything to do with Charlotte's death.<eos> What about her friends?<eos> I can't vouch for them.<eos> Now, I've see too many things that they're capable of.<eos> Do you think they did it?
And what about destroying Ali's memorial?<eos> Stealing Caleb's money, joining Mona's army.<eos> I mean he has a dark side, Hanna.<eos> We all do when we're pushed hard enough.<eos> I don't care how many videos you show me he's my friend, just like every one of you.

And no matter how shady you guys looked<eos> I know in my heart you would never hurt me.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You haven't always known that.<eos> You were once so afraid of Lucas you pushed him out of a row boat.
That's not true.<eos> You haven't always known that.<eos> You were once so afraid of Lucas you pushed him out of a row boat.<eos> Maybe there's a way that we can find out if it's him.<eos> What do you mean?
Maybe there's a way that we can find out if it's him.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Hanna's waiting to hear from A.D. to tell her when to take that hard drive to the school we should stake out the locker.<eos> Locker?<eos> Yeah, I thought-I thought that's what you said.
I think I'm gonna hang it today.<eos> - Is that your breakfast?<eos> - Yeah, I'm running late today.<eos> Okay, that's not real food.<eos> Give me five minutes, I'll make you something.
- They're important.<eos> - I know.<eos> And I'll take them.<eos> I just keep forgetting.<eos> Okay, well, set an alarm in your phone while you're at it, maybe one for breakfast too.
I just keep forgetting.<eos> Okay, well, set an alarm in your phone while you're at it, maybe one for breakfast too.<eos> - Grumpy much?<eos> - No, I'm not grumpy.<eos> I just can't believe you're already flaking out on me.

What?<eos> Well, you say you wanna do things and you end up bailing.<eos> Get a grip, they're just vitamins.<eos> It's not about the vitamins, okay?<eos> I'm looking down the road and what I see is you tossing me the baby and runnin' off to Paris.
It's the text from A.D. that was sent this morning.<eos> Hanna has to drop off the hard drive at the school at the exact same time the staff meeting starts at the Radley.<eos> Great, so basically Hanna has to be in two places at once.<eos> It just means that we're working in a tight time frame.<eos> Okay, so Caleb will disable the cameras and, Hanna, you'll grab the credit card slip.
Yeah, but I only have ten minutes to do it or the SWAT team shows up.<eos> It's enough time.<eos> The boxes are all marked.<eos> It shouldn't be hard.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're confident.
Rosewood PD wants to schedule my second interview.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You weren't drinking at that bar to celebrate.
I hope that that still means something.<eos> It does.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Where're you going?
Didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Where're you going?<eos> Oh, um, I'm going to meet the girls.<eos> Don't bother, it's like watching a frog trying to jump out of a pot of boiling water.<eos> - Why are you shutting me out?
Oh, um, I'm going to meet the girls.<eos> Don't bother, it's like watching a frog trying to jump out of a pot of boiling water.<eos> - Why are you shutting me out?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> You showed me the game for a reason.
I'm ready to play but I can't help you if I'm kept in the dark.<eos> A.D. is going to pick this up from the school tonight.<eos> It's the best chance we've had in a long time to expose this person.<eos> So, let me be another set of eyes.<eos> Mona, you know that I want that but the others can't find out that you're involved.

Mona, you know that I want that but the others can't find out that you're involved.<eos> You didn't tell them that I know about the game.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> They still don't trust me?<eos> Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.
Mona, come on, it's not like that.<eos> I have literally bled myself for you, Hanna.<eos> Trying to protect you.<eos> How many times do I have to save all of you until I'm finally part of the group?<eos> Well, you might as well head over to the high school.
I know that Lucas destroyed your memorial but do we really think he's as disgusting as all this?<eos> I could kick myself.<eos> I was so close to catching him.<eos> I'm just glad he didn't hurt you guys.<eos> He clearly didn't expect you to be home.
He knew we were at the school.<eos> I think the hard drive thing was a setup.<eos> Did-did you catch a glimpse of him?<eos> No, if Lucas is A.D., he definitely has a helper.<eos> What do you mean?
- We-we can fix it.<eos> - Here.<eos> Look, we can glue this back together, see?<eos> Em, don't let this scare you.<eos> When you do that, you give A.D. power.
They are, but it wasn't in there.<eos> - Hanna, we have to go. - No. Not until I find it.<eos> Caleb, I'm not letting Spencer go down for something I did.<eos> We have to find that credit card slip, we promised her.<eos> What the hell are you doing?
- Hanna, we have to go. - No. Not until I find it.<eos> Caleb, I'm not letting Spencer go down for something I did.<eos> We have to find that credit card slip, we promised her.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Have you lost your mind?
An entire police force is going to come in here and pick through that.<eos> They're gonna find it eventually.<eos> There'll be nothing left to find.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Can you hurry up?
My stomach has done so many backflips<eos> I can join the Olympic team.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Okay, I have to run downstairs and reboot the security system.<eos> - Are you okay on your own?
Your gal pals mistook me for Uber A chased me and then just took off.<eos> Must've scared the real devil away, because no one has showed up to get this thing.<eos> Call me back.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Do you know why I'm calling?
Call me back.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Do you know why I'm calling?<eos> How many guesses do I get?<eos> You took something from me, and if I don't get it back.
- Do you know why I'm calling?<eos> How many guesses do I get?<eos> You took something from me, and if I don't get it back.<eos> I'm sending an officer to your door.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't help you if I don't know what you're talking about.

If I had that thumb drive that would mean that I was in your apartment alone with you that night.<eos> I wonder if people would think that was strange.<eos> _<eos> It's over Lucas.<eos> We know it was you.
It's over Lucas.<eos> We know it was you.<eos> Look, I can explain why I'm here.<eos> Did it feel good to scare us?<eos> - Did it make you feel powerful?
Look, I can explain why I'm here.<eos> Did it feel good to scare us?<eos> - Did it make you feel powerful?<eos> - What?<eos> You smeared blood on a crib.
If he isn't A.D. then why is he here?<eos> - I'm not staying.<eos> - Lucas, at least tell me why.<eos> I saw the police tape.<eos> I know you took it back.
- Lucas, at least tell me why.<eos> I saw the police tape.<eos> I know you took it back.<eos> Being our alibi after Charlotte was murdered.<eos> - You saw that?
I know you took it back.<eos> Being our alibi after Charlotte was murdered.<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - It didn't work the first time.<eos> So now you're sending body parts.
- You saw that?<eos> - It didn't work the first time.<eos> So now you're sending body parts.<eos> What the hell is she talking about?<eos> If you don't know, why are you so freaked out?
Because of the book.<eos> Because of my friendship with Charles.<eos> I figured he found out.<eos> But I swear, I swear that I didn't know that he..<eos> She was the one who was torturing you.

She was the one who was torturing you.<eos> I didn't think that he and Charlotte were the same person.<eos> You just said that you stayed friends.<eos> Over e-mail.<eos> If you didn't know that you were friends with A then why would you lie about it after you found out.
If you didn't know that you were friends with A then why would you lie about it after you found out.<eos> Lucas, speak!<eos> Because it may be a part of the reason why you were tortured. Most of the e-mails that I sent in high school were about mean queen Alison.<eos> And her loyal band of followers.<eos> I gave details about how you made my life a living hell.

Most of the e-mails that I sent in high school were about mean queen Alison.<eos> And her loyal band of followers.<eos> I gave details about how you made my life a living hell.<eos> And how the rest of you just watched.<eos> So that's why you stole back the comic book.
It was sent to me, along with this.<eos> "Want to keep your friendship a secret?<eos> Meet me at the Radley."<eos> I went but nobody showed up.<eos> Why'd you come back here if you already had the book?
It was never finished.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Lucas?<eos> I believe you.<eos> That you weren't part of what happened to us.
I believe you.<eos> That you weren't part of what happened to us.<eos> But why is the factory for sale?<eos> And was our business partnership ever real?<eos> I think you're so talented, Hanna.
I think you're so talented, Hanna.<eos> I just..<eos> I had trouble getting other people to take a chance on you.<eos> Well, what about the investors?<eos> You're lookin' at him.
Well, what about the investors?<eos> You're lookin' at him.<eos> I was too embarrassed to tell you that I couldn't do it anymore.<eos> So my friends made your life miserable in high school.<eos> They almost broke your collarbone tonight and now you're telling me that...
I'll make it back again.<eos> Besides... it was worth it.<eos> How was it worth it?<eos> What's worth losing everything?<eos> You.
How was it worth it?<eos> What's worth losing everything?<eos> You.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I never doubted that you were... I know.
Almost.<eos> We'll just have to broaden the scope of my investigation.<eos> - Of a flood?<eos> - Of a homicide.<eos> Let's hope your friends are as lucky as you are.

Carmen, you can't say you want to ask me something personal and then drop it.<eos> Okay. [Chuckles]<eos> Well... the last time I was in here, you... kissed me.<eos> And I was wondering if that meant that you were a little bit... - Mm... - Gay?<eos> Uh... - But now I see you kiss everybody, so clearly, you know, you're not.
But killing a little dog...<eos> The German soul will not forgive it.<eos> My wife and I became ill after watching this.<eos> I wish you all the best.<eos> Now you're at the helm.
it's just nice guys aren't usually interested in me, and i thought... that i was a sleazebag.<eos> yeah. you know how many directors have lied to me and used me?<eos> they act like these nice guys and... you're a nice guy, navid, and i guess i got scared.<eos> hey, that's terrible, but sometimes a nice guy who acts like he likes you is just a nice guy who likes you.<eos> but you paid for my rehab.
Unfortunately, I think I was thinking about another guy we know.<eos> Handleman, Andrew Handleman.<eos> -He didn't take shit from nobody.<eos> -Oh, yeah.<eos> You used to take shit from everybody, though.
