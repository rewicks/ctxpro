She died.<eos> There was an illness.<eos> My son has not spoken since.<eos> Seven months and 16 days.<eos> Alessio will see you to your room.
She allowed it to flood at the beginning of the War.<eos> Times were difficult and she had her career.<eos> No more need for the stone.<eos> Jakob swims there.<eos> He'll take you there if you wish.
Shit.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Good evening, Mr. Munson.<eos> What brings you out this way?
Be right with you, Doc.<eos> Now.<eos> There you are, Doc.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> Doc, do you remember way back when, the night Harry called you in to examine Special Agent Dale Cooper at the Great Northern?
So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.<eos> That's how he works.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.<eos> I will take you to him.
- He's been different?<eos> Secretive?<eos> - Maybe even a little nervous?<eos> - And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.<eos> You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
But it's important.<eos> Well, my wife Anne, she stumbled and hit her head and...<eos> No, she's okay, I took her to a doctor but he wants her to stay home just in case she's concussed.<eos> No, I think she'll be fine but um,<eos> I guess the reason I'm calling you is because I'm...
Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate.<eos> We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment.<eos> I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish.<eos> I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through.<eos> There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you.
If you know your part in extension, you may dial it anytime.<eos> If you wish to speak to operator... please stay in line and someone would be with you as soon as possible.<eos> MIT Mathematics, how may I direct your call?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm sorry. I can't hear you wery well. No!
I wish I was.<eos> I heard a bunch of kids talking at the Yale Club.<eos> Shao heard it, too.<eos> Even his daughter, Claudia, she told me her father just uses people.<eos> That he calls you "the arrogant spic" behind your back.
I fucking owe you one.<eos> - Nobody get up!<eos> - Stay where you are!<eos> Please rise.<eos> Mr. Harlon, with this court finding you guilty of assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon I'm sentencing you to the middle term of four years.
- Nobody get up!<eos> - Stay where you are!<eos> Please rise.<eos> Mr. Harlon, with this court finding you guilty of assault by a prisoner with a deadly weapon I'm sentencing you to the middle term of four years.<eos> In addition, having been found guilty of committing this crime in association and for the benefit of a gang, I'm sentencing you to an additional five years to run consecutively.
Why participate in the riot?<eos> You know why.<eos> You got your rules and we got the gang's rules.<eos> And theirs matter.<eos> Yeah, well, it cost you a year of good time on top of the new sentences and put you with the heavy hitters, so... I hope it was worth it.
I have a daughter.<eos> Fathers and daughters, eh?<eos> Very special.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'll look you up when the kids have left home.
I don't care what you believe in.<eos> I wanna bring you to God. I want to save your soul.<eos> I don't wanna be brought to God.<eos> I don't want to be saved.<eos> And I don't want Jesus, thank you very much.
Brothers, stay the F away from me!<eos> Watch your language.<eos> Don't provoke him, Joan.<eos> You threatening me, new woman?<eos> Yes, I'm threatening you.
Censoring it is like putting pants on Elmo so no one sees the nothing between his legs.<eos> Elmo doesn't wear pants?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Yeah, I'm threatening you.
I screwed up a lot of stuff, and now...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> No one'll listen to me.<eos> How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.
General Kellermann thought you might like to see the Houses of Parliament on the way, sir.<eos> As I say, a pig.<eos> Does that mean you would or wouldn't like to see the Houses of Parliament?<eos> It means, my dear Superintendent, that I do not have the slightest intention of spending the evening watching a roomful of army officers and their overdressed women guzzling champagne and, between mouthfuls of smoked salmon, telling me the best place to buy Staffordshire china.<eos> Very well, then, I'll take you to your accommodation on Brook Street.
Now, you listen to me, Major.<eos> If you want my co-operation, you're going to have to woo me,<eos> and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.<eos> It will get you nowhere.
Well, I wouldn't know what to do.<eos> I'm a policeman.<eos> You are also a survivor.<eos> A winner, perhaps.<eos> I'll make you a German citizen and bring you into the SD immediately.
I've set aside some men to secure it.<eos> An American plane will fly His Majesty out to the Ark Royal but only if we can get the King there in time.<eos> Well, Douglas?<eos> You're our best chance by a country mile.<eos> And that Resistance attack on you puts you above all suspicion.
Great.<eos> I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.
Get Persikof to switch back to us.<eos> Let me get my purse.<eos> Thanks for jumping in and sticking up for me, Pete.<eos> I'm not suicidal.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to see me.
Yeah, we just got his medicine.<eos> Everything all right at home?<eos> Yes, sir, I've just been sick.<eos> I'll be there tomorrow.<eos> I won't let you down.
I figured it was a sign.<eos> Yeah, but... wait a second.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> Maybe I'm not on your list.<eos> Hey, well, if you go out with me, I can show you.
I manage a lot of the fighters here.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I did my homework on you.<eos> You got a good reputation. People respect you.
Think of this as a murder case.<eos> We're just eliminating suspects.<eos> What do you think it is?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Come on, I'm not gonna fucking sue you or anything. Just tell me what you think it is.
My car!<eos> Look what that animal did to my car!<eos> Madeline, call my wife, will ya?<eos> Madeline?<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.
I'll talk to him.<eos> That's all I ask.<eos> Any calls?<eos> I left the slips on your desk.<eos> Also, there's a man waiting to see you.
You'll need to file for Chapter 11 immediately.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Your personal wealth, the profits you've made as a partner in this venture, have all been carefully hidden. So...<eos> Not all bad.<eos> Mike and Mike will show you out.
E-mail?<eos> Mr. Varga.<eos> You're asking me if there are phones in Belgium?<eos> Let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> Three agents from Homeland Security are gonna put handcuffs on you and take you to Rikers.
I am of Death.<eos> You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.
It's not poisoned.<eos> On TV you said you were being framed.<eos> Look me in the eye and tell me you didn't murder my husband.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Did you know Julio Farkas was looking for you?
They proved the theorem, not the existence.<eos> I already know He doesn't exist.<eos> All right?<eos> So if you can't tell me what's wrong with me, at least tell me you know how to make it go away.<eos> I could give you drugs that will turn you into a zombie.
A private one, and you're trespassing.<eos> What's your position here?<eos> Could I have your name?<eos> You wouldn't have lied your way in if you had any legal authority, like a warrant.<eos> The guards will escort you out.
- Agent Thoms?<eos> - Ma'am, are you safe?<eos> If you're asking if this was my idea, the answer is "yes."<eos> Then please ask Mrs. Diehl to pull over.<eos> We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.
No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.<eos> Not the easiest conversation I've ever had.<eos> I think they're waiting for you.
Your staff will be brought up separately.<eos> Brought where?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> They'll tell us when we're airborne, ma'am.<eos> Go. I'll catch up with you.
Who are you?<eos> Amir.<eos> You and I have a friend in common.<eos> Where is our friend?<eos> Someplace safe, waiting for you.
- Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video. You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.<eos> People hate you, Madam President-Elect.
Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.<eos> Which means, unfortunately, until the swelling goes down, we're not able to operate on you, Dustin, so...<eos> No.<eos> Nobody calls me Dustin.<eos> Well, I'm not calling you "Doctor."
The fuck are these?<eos> Uh, my sunglasses.<eos> No reflective surfaces.<eos> Do not look into them no matter what.<eos> That's how they found you.
It'll stick.<eos> Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.
The sooner they know, the sooner they can pick another candidate.<eos> I'm not dropping out of the race.<eos> We need to talk this through.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> Director Mullins is expecting you.
Where are you?<eos> Listen...<eos> I love you.<eos> I don't know what an actor can do to help put the memory of my son to rest.<eos> But he obviously thought highly of you.
Listen to yourself, Detective.<eos> Is this the system you serve?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
The law is imperfect.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.<eos> I don't need anyone's protection.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.<eos> This could've happened to any of them.<eos> We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.<eos> I want to go.<eos> No one's keeping you.
You okay, ma'am?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Do you live near here?<eos> Yeah. Just, like, a little while that way.<eos> So, uh, what brings you out here without pants and shoes?
I had the exact same face.<eos> - Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.<eos> This is the gate. It sends you into the echo a safe distance from the tower.
We'll give it a go.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?
Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna take action, all right. By holding you right here.<eos> Dr. Brennan... No, Daisy.<eos> I still have not heard from the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will inform you the minute I do.
I can't say with any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death, I will sue you for slander.
She was showing people this painting of a cove. I offered to drive her around, look for it.<eos> Why did you tell her she'd regret turning you down?<eos> Who wouldn't regret turning me down?<eos> I don't know, how about Julia Henshaw?<eos> The college classmate who accused you of sexual assault?
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Viola.<eos> And I wouldn't worry just yet, okay?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on her behavior here at school.<eos> You keep an eye on her at home.<eos> Okay, thank you so much.
Well, she did, most of the year.<eos> We're doing up a house.<eos> - What, Ambersea?<eos> - Aye.<eos> Right, we'll get you back over there.
Davy's parents were up there somewhere. They would have seen the body straight away.<eos> You needed her sitting in that hut because you knew Ryan would be able to see her there from his boat.<eos> You wanted everyone to think she was still alive.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Then you went to the pub and made sure everybody saw you.
She didn't ask me to do it.<eos> I found her in the garage, crying.<eos> I've failed my girls all my life. I... I just wanted to make things right.<eos> You didn't fail us.<eos> Victoria Hogarth, I am arresting you for the murder of Gemma Wyatt.
Victoria Hogarth, I am arresting you for the murder of Gemma Wyatt.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you say may be given in evidence.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Michael Hogarth, I'm arresting you for being an accessory to murder.
What?<eos> You lost him?<eos> You lost him after he discovered the burner phone you used to frame my client.<eos> That's a good story.<eos> Be careful who catches you in here.
Come on.<eos> - Oh... - Ahem. Take a breath.<eos> Start breathing evenly.<eos> In and out.<eos> Feel the weight of your limbs pulling you down.
If you feel like a change.<eos> Allison, what are you doing here?<eos> There was no one out front to...<eos> Well, there's a waiting room.<eos> You're supposed to sit there until I come get you, and you're late today.
I don't have anybody else.<eos> I can't count on my mom.<eos> What would you do if you found out your daughter was a fuck-up?<eos> It's okay. You can stay here for a while.<eos> I'm not gonna send you home like this.
I'm talking about the Downworlders.<eos> Jace, you didn't know.<eos> Wasn't your fault.<eos> I never said it was.<eos> Come on, you got another round in you or Startin' to get tired?
No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.<eos> Or when you were seven and you took your silly rowing boat out and you got lost in that storm, and me and your dad were out, shouting and screaming, losing our minds.<eos> And when your dad found you, how he cried.
Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it. He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.<eos> And you're gonna remember how much I love you.<eos> I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.
I remember the first time your mum and dad brought you home.<eos> They were so exhausted.<eos> And they gave you to me.<eos> This tiny, defenseless little creature.<eos> And they said, "Look after him," and I said, "Sure." And I scooped you up in my arms, and I held you, and you opened your eyes and you looked at me.
- Yeah?<eos> - You're looking for father burk.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - I'm Dr. Cathy Monroe, I'm father burk's attending.<eos> Father burk's been incredibly insistent that we find you.
Little girls!<eos> They have an instinct... which they can ignore sometimes for years because... .. who would want to ever dig that up.<eos> But then one day, I guess it just gets too much.<eos> And maybe you follow him... from work... .. on one of those nights when he always said that he had late meetings.<eos> One of those nights when he came home smelling of booze and something else, something that scared you.
Great minds, it seems.<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm on a fungi hunt.<eos> And they are elusive little beasts.<eos> Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight to aid you in your quest.
Or individually.<eos> I've never seen him like this about anybody, you know?<eos> Hope you're ready.<eos> Because you two are off to the races.<eos> Does anybody call you Luddy?
I'm not like you.<eos> You've always been so sure of who you are.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> I've been through some very dark places, as have you.<eos> You need to find your true north and let that guide you.
I just don't see why you're defending the yellow guy.<eos> Yes, he goes everywhere The Flash goes, but this morning, for example, he's just standing back, waiting for the warehouse to burn down.<eos> Well, maybe he's training with The Flash. - You know, learning the ropes?<eos> - Okay, well, we send rookie cops out on patrol, expect them to perform.<eos> Look, I think the yellow guy's gonna surprise you.
- Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> - B.A.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Look, don't let the naysayers get you down.
Ashley.<eos> It just won't stop.<eos> So, this is where the... healing happens.<eos> It's cute.<eos> So, what brings you here?
You relax, okay?<eos> Is she...<eos> Wound's healing up nicely.<eos> Nothing too serious.<eos> Oh, that's so... thank you so much.
- Yeah.<eos> - Find people annoying?<eos> - No.<eos> - I find this annoying.<eos> - Right. What about this is annoying to you?
In this town, that's like trying to topple a small government.<eos> We have to check the credibility of our witness.<eos> We need to be patient and keep digging.<eos> I'm done being patient.<eos> We apologize for contacting you so late, sir.
Yeah.<eos> Words don't mean a whole lot.<eos> Sometimes you just need a hug, you know?<eos> I am tired of talking.<eos> What keeps you going?
That's wrong.<eos> You look tired.<eos> Do you have trouble sleeping?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> What keeps you up?
That's my mom! Son!<eos> Extra patrols...<eos> With the exception of a few isolated pockets of unrest, the violence seems to be contained.<eos> But we're all on alert should there be any more incidents.<eos> That video of you is all over social media, Lieutenant.
It's afternoon. And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.<eos> The ride along that smelly road was dull and unpleasant, and Stephano is very tired.<eos> You're Count Olaf, and if anyone ever deserved to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.<eos> We will not help you with your luggage and we will not let you in this house.
I'm closing my eyes.<eos> I heard that.<eos> How's the house hunt?<eos> I've got four appointments this morning.<eos> Of course, if there's anything I like, I'm gonna run it by you, Maddie.
The dumplings from Galen's cottage... the ones that made everyone sick.<eos> You're telling me that I have a worm living in my brain?<eos> - Yeah. - Oh, God, I'm gonna die.<eos> I do one humanitarian act in my whole life, and now I'm gonna die?<eos> Well, we booked an O.R., and we'll get you there right away.
Mr. McGill.<eos> So, on to the issue of bond.<eos> You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<eos> And where are you currently practicing law?<eos> I haven't seen you in my court in a while.
I can take a message.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> You... you don't have to do that.<eos> I'd be happy to take a message.<eos> Uh, I'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn't want to keep you waiting.
What the hell does that mean?<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Homeland security believes you may be a target in an ongoing case.<eos> This about the accident?<eos> I told the police already-- we're moving you to a secure location where we can guarantee your safety until the threat is under control.
- It's okay.<eos> I'm a woman, but I used to be a man.<eos> That's right.<eos> I remember you told me.<eos> Are you still comfortable with me representing you?
What, did you watch a couple episodes of Law Order and now you're a lawyer?<eos> - Albert.<eos> - What? !<eos> Can you give us a minute alone, please?<eos> Without physical evidence connecting you to the murder, we have reasonable doubt.
I didn't shoot nobody.<eos> Where's Wade Houghton?<eos> He's not here right now.<eos> You're not helping us to help you here, my friend.<eos> I know the judge and he'll go easy on you, get you out of here, but only if you help us.
Well, we all need a "Middle of the night" rate sometimes.<eos> So where are you joining us from, Miss Samuels?<eos> Los Angeles?<eos> That's a very busy place?<eos> What brings you up to white pine bay?
Who?<eos> I think his name was Churchill.<eos> I'm going down to the station to give a statement.<eos> I'm sorry, Sheriff, I'm not quite sure how to answer your questions.<eos> Security footage shows you and the victim's general vicinity the last time he was seen.
You have an abscess, Mrs Williams.<eos> A serious infection beneath your tooth.<eos> I will prescribe you painkillers and a course of penicillin.<eos> I want this cleared up before baby makes an appearance.<eos> I'll also refer you to the dental department at the hospital.
How many?<eos> Given the extent of your gum disease, I think all of them.<eos> All of them?<eos> And, bearing in mind how poorly you've been feeling, the sooner the better.<eos> I'm going to put you to sleep and while you're dreaming of lovely things, I will deal with everything.
How would he know how I should be sewn?<eos> I'll talk to someone.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Your breakfast tray lies neglected in your room.<eos> The rats may thank you for the gesture, but your health will not.
Clean to you.<eos> Listen, Del. Wh... Whatever money you're missing,<eos> I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation. No. "Stolen." That's my word.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Mr. Del Rio... I swear, we are not stealing from you.
Where you belong.<eos> That's right.<eos> To my assholes.<eos> I think that toast was probably a first.<eos> It's been a rough one for you.
What's new?<eos> - You were here yesterday. Yeah.<eos> - That's right!<eos> They love you so much, they can't keep away.<eos> Ma'am, that was a month ago. Gary is humoring you. - Okay.
Two... stay the fuck away from me.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I won't let you down.
Where was the danger here?<eos> From Heyward?<eos> You saw his hands.<eos> From his dad?<eos> He had his hands in the air and was begging you not to shoot.
20 hours of darkness in the winter can be a bitch, but...<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Are you...<eos> blackmailing me? With every passing moment, the people responsible for murdering our president-elect get further away.<eos> I am not blackmailing you, Major Morales.
Who?<eos> Me.<eos> Just me... and I am tremendously excited to serve our country.<eos> I am confident you will handle the rest from here.<eos> Mr. Peus, thank you so much for finally showing your face to me.
That's what makes you just like me?<eos> That's what makes you know?<eos> You never wanted control.<eos> You don't know what control is.<eos> You are so... And she loves you.
Sir, I have no control over what people do or say about me.<eos> If you're expecting me to cut you slack for your current misadventures, you're mistaken.<eos> I do not expect anything.<eos> I think you do.<eos> And I think if you're not careful, it will eat you alive.
He prescribes...<eos> Uh, yeah, he prescribes Ibuprofen every four to six hours and alternating hot and cold compresses.<eos> Very good.<eos> And the patient's incredulous and looks at the doctor says, "Why do I have to do that?"<eos> The doctor says, "Because I'm still examining you."
Kelsey?<eos> I'd consider doing pink covers.<eos> If your next novel can have a female protagonist just as adept as your previous male ones, this market is yours.<eos> And I can guide you there.<eos> Women who love spy novels will love you.
Everything I do is in service to your family.<eos> You included.<eos> In that case...<eos> I require a list of all the women with whom my husband has fraternised behind my back, every sordid little story that you've helped to hide.<eos> Your husband loves you very much.
That's one way of putting it, yeah.<eos> So, what's in it for me?<eos> It's Friday night, Mr. O'Hara.<eos> And you're in your room alone.<eos> Ever since your broadcast about the hotel, most people around here are ignoring you.
- Visitor for you.<eos> - Emma.<eos> Mr. O'Hara.<eos> - Boys.<eos> - And what brings you here?
Or, rather, you paid for it.<eos> You got me, Axe.<eos> You did.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'll get you back.
And then there was this guy.<eos> He was following me.<eos> And then I guess I drank too much. Look. Can you take these off?<eos> - Oh, of course, of course.<eos> A guy was following you?
I'm concerned that Cal is gonna run circles around this woman.<eos> - How you feeling, Agent Gaines?<eos> - I'm solid.<eos> - We've been investigating the Meyerist Movement.<eos> Regardless of how they may have helped you in the past, you understand they're threatening you to get what they want, and that's illegal, and a god-awful way to treat someone that's come to you for help.
You do.<eos> You want to save yourself, or you wouldn't even be here right now.<eos> - Welcome, Ms. Jackson.<eos> You can just park right up here.<eos> Someone will take you to your meeting.
Even I can tell that that man's head is so far up his ass, he can't see what's obvious to everyone else.<eos> And what's that?<eos> That this place ran a whole lot smoother when it was an actual emergency room.<eos> Let's focus on you, shall we?<eos> What brought you in today, other than the hyperhidrosis, which is a real condition, by the way, if she gives you hell again.
That's why we want to talk to you.<eos> Who you?<eos> Florida Grange, Attorney at law.<eos> All right, girl.<eos> All right, well, where you are, I'll talk to you.
All right, let's see here.<eos> That's a pretty bad fall?<eos> That what you told 'em?<eos> Yeah. Real bad fall.<eos> Well, sit tight, and we will get you out of here in a jiffy.
Come on.<eos> 'You alright?<eos> It's this block, yeah?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you need me to walk you in?
Uh, I came to apologize.<eos> I completely overreacted to the situation.<eos> I know you were just trying to do what's best for the children.<eos> And... Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.<eos> I've actually been expecting you.
You better think about what you're doing.<eos> We're doing our job.<eos> You're not helping Burkhardt.<eos> I suggest you take me back now.<eos> We're not taking you back.
Now, I killed a man in front of you.<eos> I kept my part of the bargain.<eos> And then you got blood on my shirt.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I tear the throat out of a man who's blackmailing you, you're complaining about a little blood on your shirt?
It was dark.<eos> He always stayed in his Van... Handed me cash in an envelope out the window.<eos> To tell you the truth, I didn't want to look at the guy.<eos> That's all I know, I swear.<eos> Next time he calls you... Call us.
The fact that you called. The morgue is mildly interesting, you know? Called the hospitals, too.<eos> Morgue was just a shot in the dark.<eos> He was just doing what I asked.<eos> Is this why you read us our rights?<eos> Don't let clark farman drag you down with him, mr. Day.
Do I smell a child?<eos> You smell a lot, Doctor.<eos> Please.<eos> Please sit.<eos> So, what brings you to the Mennen Speed Stick. Maximum Security Prison?
- Congressman Ryan!<eos> I haven't spoken to you since the historic House vote.<eos> Yes...<eos> I just wanted to thank you for all that you've done for me.<eos> And I wanna let you know that I will destroy you in ways that are so creative, they will honor me for it at the Kennedy Center.
Either way, like I said, Ms. Zane's interview is in two weeks.<eos> - reckless endangerment?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> - I guarantee you, Sofia price isn't laughing.<eos> - Well, any judge in his right mind is gonna laugh you out of court, because you don't understand the law.
Well, I'm surprised.<eos> Usually, when Criminal Intelligence takes possession of evidence...<eos> No one ever sees it again, that's right.<eos> But...<eos> Winnie Davis is watching you - as closely as she is me.
You don't know anything about me.<eos> All you know is what I eat for dinner six nights a week.<eos> Look, I've always found the best way to understand someone is to hear their story.<eos> So... maybe you'd like to tell me yours.<eos> Why don't I show you instead?
Okay, um... Let's talk about what happened beforehand.<eos> Now, you said that you were at work, late.<eos> And then you went to a bar, right?<eos> Now, do you remember anything unusual happening there?<eos> Anybody staring at you or watching you?
Take a breath. So when we first met, you said that Ray Wilson had been stalking you for years.<eos> Yes.<eos> I guess... that was a bit of an exaggeration.<eos> Um, I just... this past month, ever since Ray moved back to New Jersey, I just felt like someone's been watching me.<eos> Did you ever seen anybody actually watching you?
No, we actually believe you.<eos> We know you weren't in Manhattan the night that Quinn was attacked.<eos> - Okay. So why are you here?<eos> - Well, we think someone planted your cigarette butt there at the scene.<eos> Notice anybody suspicious watching you?
Everybody uses them. No big deal.<eos> Even if the women don't know?<eos> How could they not know?<eos> If they're coming to party, they know what to expect.<eos> And there's a young woman who's, uh, accusing you of rape.
Yeah, and weren't you the heir apparent at one point?<eos> Objection.<eos> Relevance. Goes to the credibility of the witness.<eos> I'll allow it.<eos> Mr. Hendricks, isn't it true that your father booted you out of the company a few years ago and installed your sister in your place?
You're one of the best soldiers we have.<eos> Silver Star, first female Ranger, three confirmed kills.<eos> We didn't just pull your name out of a hat.<eos> Now it's time for the country to hear your story.<eos> Once you're off leave, I will escort you on a three-month media tour throughout this great nation of ours.
It's good to see there's still some fight left in you.<eos> But I should expect as much from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Inhuman director.<eos> You're the one they take orders from.<eos> Da.<eos> Then I'm placing you under arrest in the name of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Really.<eos> Skye!<eos> What happened?<eos> She was nice to me.<eos> Hydra thanks you for your service.
Thank god.<eos> Do you know me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's what the other agent told me to say.<eos> Hydra thanks you for your service.
Well, think I need a drink.<eos> In the... in the real world, how well do we know each other?<eos> Are we friends?<eos> More like coworkers.<eos> But I do think of you in a friendly way.
Hang in there, boo boo.<eos> I'll let you know what Anderson says.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi, um, it's Spencer Strasmore.<eos> Yes, we've been expecting you, Mr. Strasmore.
Of you, thank you very much!<eos> - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - Oh, you did not touch me!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> You don't know me well enough!<eos> - Let me walk you out.
- I know it seems like a lot of money...<eos> - It is a lot of money. - Not when you have to split it between 150 men who have cancer.<eos> - Do all the math you want, Mr. Ross, but 100 million is a hell of lot better than zero, which is what we've been walking around with.<eos> - Mr. Stamos, you have to trust me.<eos> We know what we're doing and I am not gonna let you down.
And if there's one thing that a jury hates more than a fake lawyer, it's an insurance company that rips off widowers and children.<eos> - What do you want? - 50 million.<eos> With an admission of guilt.<eos> Okay, then here's what you're gonna do instead.<eos> A reporter's gonna call you.
I didn't know this would happen. I swear on my life.<eos> All right, Teresa.<eos> Breathe. Breathe.<eos> Deep, long breaths.<eos> Why is Julie-Ann calling you at a phone box?
No.<eos> Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you. - Oh?
- Yes, we will.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> You can push me around all you want... - Thank you.<eos> - But Josephine will stop you.<eos> The children will stop you.
All right, I'm going.<eos> That's hardly a motive for murder.<eos> No.<eos> But money is.<eos> Lady Malmort pays you handsomely for your... discretion.
Come on in!<eos> Captain Beau Atkins at your service.<eos> My cousin Pritikin was courteous enough to call and alert me to your arrival.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Captain.<eos> Thank you so much for having us at your precinct.
Update status.<eos> Here for the hybrid?<eos> Update status.<eos> IADG coming through.<eos> The IADG has been looking for you for a long time.
It's not bad.<eos> Listen, Georgie, I got some thoughts on the criminal justice system...<eos> This is last of them.<eos> You should be back to a fair fight now.<eos> Your troops are waiting for you outside, General Washington.
No, no.<eos> I, I, I hope when I sell this place to move into a small apartment in town.<eos> I'd like to be a little, um, closer to the action. - And they'll find me sooner if I die at home by myself.<eos> Oh, don't say that.<eos> I'm sure someone would find you here.
- What?<eos> It's time.<eos> - You and I both know...<eos> - I'm not stopping.<eos> Your loyalty is distracting you from the truth.
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.<eos> -How long have you been with the paper?<eos> -Thirteen months.<eos> Style section.<eos> Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.
The boys make all sorts of jokes.<eos> Well, I suppose they'd just laugh at something else if it wasn't that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Perhaps it's good to localise the target of their ridicule.<eos> It's all very well for you -- the boys admire you.
I don't know.<eos> I ain't the god damn post office.<eos> Ms. Grant, you don't have a record. You haven't committed a crime. As far as I can tell, you're a good person.<eos> Answer my questions and you can get back to your life, your shop, your son.<eos> If you don't cooperate, I can't help you.
Previously on Doubt...<eos> I'd like to submit my blood.<eos> Without physical evidence connecting you to the murder, we have reasonable doubt.
Oh, guess what: Gemma and I are back together.<eos> I'm getting an award at work tonight.<eos> There's a big dinner, and I want him to come, but more than that, I want him to want to come.<eos> I do want to come.<eos> What's stopping you?
Are there other firms who perform a similar function?<eos> There are four others.<eos> And they're all here, as I mentioned, in Luxembourg.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Can I help you?
- Why do you keep doing that?<eos> - Because you don't live around here.<eos> You're walking her over here. That's weird.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Is this woman bothering you?
Shell companies, dummy investments, offshore trusts.<eos> But what Jamie found in your house proves that you're an investor in Tyneford Estates.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Ah, come on, Alan.<eos> You know this implicates you.
I'm sorry, son.<eos> We need to be sure beyond reasonable doubt.<eos> I punched him, in the face.<eos> I punched him as hard as I could.<eos> Alan Marston, I am arresting you for the murder of Jamie Marshall.
Hi.<eos> You look lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Doug picked up some of my things from my apartment.<eos> Ms. Anders, thank you so much for letting me stay here.
It's all here.<eos> You can go.<eos> Nice doing business with ya.<eos> I have no interest in helping you or your client.<eos> Yeah, well, why isn't the prosecution calling you as a timeline witness?
Go away.<eos> Oh, I'm going.<eos> But I'm not gonna get back till late.<eos> So feed the kids!<eos> I will now connect you to the number you requested.
Forty-five miles an hour.<eos> -How fast was I going, Officer?<eos> -I'd say around 90.<eos> Suppose you get off that motorcycle and give me a ticket.<eos> So I'd let you off with a warning this time.
The polling results are in.<eos> We've dropped several points on average.<eos> Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.<eos> You're not invoking faith in the electorate.<eos> They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
What if we succeed?<eos> Then they will write books about us.<eos> The Fuhrer himself will pin medals on our chests.<eos> We shall be heroes.<eos> Something troubling you, Professor?
I can do this, Mr. Halliwell.<eos> I don't doubt your qualifications.<eos> What I don't understand is why.<eos> I'm too old to join the army.<eos> If we do take you on, well... let's just say you might be asked to do things that you find... unsavory.
Unfortunately, my client list is full.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Thank you for coming in, though.<eos> Yeah, business is very busy right now, but I... I so appreciate you coming in and it was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> At least let me repay you for your thoughtful analysis.
Yeah, I'm a fucking asshole.<eos> Eric, if I get up in front of the jury on day one and I say that John Rayburn is a liar and a murderer, and I imply that he's a fucking piece of shit, the jury is not going to hear anything else<eos> And that's how that will go.<eos> Because if they don't like me, then they don't like you.<eos> And at the end of the trial, they're gonna send you to jail for the rest of your fucking life or worse.
That is correct.<eos> What were you doing in there, Detective Rayburn?<eos> Well, as I said, I was, uh... I was looking for leads.<eos> I was... I... I was saying goodbye to a friend.<eos> Did any of these leads lead you to believe that Eric O'Bannon had committed this crime?
A chocolate bar?<eos> No, you know, you can't eat anything until we do the blood work, and I'm hoping that goes better than the last time.<eos> Yeah, don't count on it.<eos> So my heart isn't even beating anymore?<eos> No. But the ECMO is keeping you alive.
- Check again.<eos> Sir!<eos> I found something.<eos> For Christ sakes!<eos> Lily Hill, I'm arresting you on suspicion of possessing Prohibited Weapons defined by Section Five of the Firearms Act, 1968,
Make a gold bathtub?<eos> - I'll give it a crack.<eos> Albert Hill!<eos> You've been a naughty boy!<eos> Lily Hill, I am arresting you on possessing prohibited weapons.
Congratulations.<eos> You seem like quite a catch.<eos> Listen, I'm not going anywhere until I get in my room.<eos> I demand...<eos> These gentlemen will be escorting you off the premises.
He symbolises the disapproval of society.<eos> And, like all prison officers, he is a member of the Church of England.<eos> He is not the "Whore of Babylon".<eos> But I want you to know that I understand your predicament.<eos> You are a carpenter by trade and I understand that prison life has deprived you of your means of self-expression.
It's just, my career, sort of, depends on it.<eos> - And as you say, she probably just forgot to invite me.<eos> - To be honest with you, if I don't pull this off I may as well stick my head in the oven.<eos> Oh, don't do that. Um...<eos> Well, if you say she normally invites you, I'm certain she wouldn't mind you being there.
You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.<eos> Well, I've had a lot of practice.<eos> Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> I'm... sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.
Stay on it.<eos> I'm gonna get with Scolari, see if I can get a read on him.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to meet, Senator Scolari.<eos> Call me Joe.<eos> What brings you up the Thruway?
- You first.<eos> - What the hells?<eos> - Is it too late to go back in the closet?<eos> - Yeah, a little bit.<eos> Captain Cardiff, we're taking you to the Quad now.
Please.<eos> Kill the spider.<eos> - Save yourself.<eos> - I will not kill her.<eos> Mrs. Raven, I'm not punishing you.
Always trust a sandhog.<eos> You have a confusing resume.<eos> What's with the, fox-trot from Southern District to Eastern and back?<eos> Nothing. It happens.<eos> It never occurred to you that Rhoades was moving you around to serve his purposes whenever he found himself holding a Yarborough?
Anyway, so Daddy never came home empty-handed.<eos> I have the most amazing snow globe collection. - No.<eos> Really? - I haven't even shown you that yet.<eos> - Yeah, you're gonna die.<eos> Yeah. - The board is ready for you.
Okay, fine, I'll go.<eos> Okay?<eos> But I am not gonna have a good time.<eos> And if one person mentions Tom James to me, I'm gonna go piss in that punch bowl.<eos> - This country doesn't deserve you.
There's a story that I love about LBJ.<eos> Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.<eos> A congressman was ducking him...<eos> and he came back to his office to find the president sitting in his chair... waiting for him.<eos> The president expects to see you within the hour.
- What is your big seller?<eos> - Well, it was gingerbread, but nobody's buying since Larry added genitals.<eos> Any more threats from your landlady?<eos> No, but I know she's out there.<eos> Vasilia will always hate you as long as you let the Englishman woo you.
I usually get "adorable" or "cute" or "hot."<eos> Yes, well...<eos> Let's see. Philadelphia Savings Bank, Montclair Insurance.<eos> These are all excellent references.<eos> What brings you to Seattle?
On your abdominal wall?<eos> Sorry, it's a doctor joke.<eos> I know it's stubborn, but I can handle this without surgery.<eos> Layla's, uh, quite famous, actually, for her self-guided healing techniques.<eos> Well, we are going to check you out anyway, as long as you're in our house.
- Somebody's got to be.<eos> - Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Although... seems like the only time I'm spending with them lately is just driving them someplace or busting their chops for not doing chores.<eos> But they admire you.
It says you exceed the age limit.<eos> Mine says you're too old too.<eos> Well, they can't all say that.<eos> The "Rich Kids of Beverly Hills" says no, but the E!<eos> Channel wants you for something else.
I need to lead this country back from this terrible tragedy.<eos> Are you still up for this?<eos> Mr. President, I haven't even gotten started yet.<eos> Good.<eos> This is a Presidential Finding absolving you from all FBI supervision.
He's still a member of my party.<eos> Respectfully, ma'am, I disagree.<eos> I think you need to push back... hard, before it's his party.<eos> Show him. He's not the only alpha dog in Congress.<eos> Senator Hunter, thank you very much for coming.
Because the, uh... the guy at the restaurant said that if we headed down this road...<eos> I told you.<eos> I... - You're not from here.<eos> - I can't help you.<eos> Okay, thank you for your time.
- You as well, sir.<eos> - Please.<eos> I saw you on television earlier.<eos> I really appreciated what you had to say.<eos> You know I'll always protect you, sir.
In order to prove conspiracy to commit murder, they need an overt act.<eos> There is no overt act.<eos> Well, I did bring those brownies in to fatten up my coworkers.<eos> Joke.<eos> And that's why we're not putting you on the stand.
How many guards are sitting outside right now? None.<eos> Blair said you weren't going anywhere.<eos> Well, he's wrong.<eos> Well, the unsinkable Miss Clark.<eos> Thought you'd have bodyguards to protect you against rogue agents.
Let's bring her in for a chat.<eos> How do you know Anton Stepulov?<eos> Who?<eos> The Dabbur Zann terrorist that wired you a quarter of a million dollars.<eos> - What's he paying you for?
The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication. But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.<eos> Although this is a more serious surgery, I've performed it many times.<eos> We go in and stabilize you with diuretics, and then repair the septal defect.
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.<eos> Neither here nor there.<eos> I literally uprooted my entire life for this play. It's the only reason I'm here, sir.<eos> And the crazy part about this whole thing is it's actually really good... it is.<eos> But no one's gonna come see it, sir, unless you tell them to, so I am begging you, please... give us another chance.
Funnily enough, that's what we've all been doing, Sarge.<eos> Hi, Melanie.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Thanks for coming in again.<eos> PC Nayar's going to take you through the video identification process.
I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> I'm sorry, Hana, we really need to search your flat.<eos> Jodie, Section 18.<eos> Do it. DCI Huntley leaving the room.<eos> Hana Reznikova, I am arresting you in connection with the murder of Timothy Ifield.
I'm the senior ranking officer here, darling.<eos> I'm only putting you back where you belong.<eos> What are friends for? Hmm?<eos> Hana Reznikova was the last person known to have had contact with the victim.<eos> Hana Reznikova, I am arresting you in connection with the murder of Timothy Ifield.
That sample, KRG-13, was tampered with.<eos> He was one of our own.<eos> I'm going to get on with finding the bastard who did this.<eos> Hana Reznikova was the last person known to have had contact with the victim.<eos> Hana Reznikova, I am arresting you in connection with the murder of Timothy Ifield.
And you've lied about it to every police officer you've spoken to.<eos> - To protect you! - No.<eos> To protect yourself.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Nicholas Huntley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Timothy Ifield.
Anything you do say may be used in evidence.<eos> Mr Huntley, please don't make this any harder than it is already.<eos> - Hands behind your back.<eos> - She's lying! She's lying!<eos> Sir, please just calm down and let us take you to the station.
Yes, sir, but my team were investigating another case, and our inquiries led us unexpectedly to these findings, which I'm sure you'll agree, sir, put a completely new complexion<eos> - on everything. - What other case?<eos> That would be the disappearance of Jackie Laverty, sir.<eos> A property developer, not seen since 2012.<eos> Something troubling you, sir?
I used to think that they were all monsters, too.<eos> But they're not. They're just men, and occasionally women.<eos> And not to respect the people I hunt would be like a soldier not respecting his enemy.<eos> And that mistake costs lives.<eos> But how do you know he felt the same way about you?
- I'm Ethel.<eos> - I'm Edna.<eos> And we're the Beat Down Biddies.<eos> You want a piece of me? I got moles older than you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll come at you.
He worked with David for nearly two years, and they were making progress... real progress.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You don't have any record of him either.<eos> Perhaps you have us confused with another facility.<eos> Is someone putting you up to this?
I represented Michael.<eos> What went on between myself and my client is privileged.<eos> I've got tangible concerns that she's involved in a serious crime.<eos> You were at the crime scene the night Tim Ifield was murdered.<eos> Nicholas Huntley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Timothy Ifield.
Does anyone have anything to say?<eos> Stay quiet.<eos> There's a car waiting for you at the gates.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> You have friends on the outside that want to help you.
You can't lie to me.<eos> You can't operate without my authority. Ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.
I'm afraid...<eos> You can't tell me?<eos> What a surprise!<eos> Sorry, Padre, but if you want out of here, you're going to have to be a little more forthcoming.<eos> How about I leave you alone to think about that?
Missed me?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Look, we normally turn a blind eye to your "activities".<eos> Mostly because whenever we bring you in, Goodfellow has to hose down the cell afterwards.
Oh, and this amputation's got to go...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> What is wrong with you? Okay.<eos> No one touches the board except Chief Bailey.<eos> If Chief Bailey even sees you lay a finger on it, she will take that finger, and she will kill you.
Pelvic fracture along with bilateral hip dislocations.<eos> Is that the femoral head inside the pelvis?<eos> The pelvis is broken, trapping the baby's head.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mindy, we're gonna take you for some CT scans.
Uh, snakes...<eos> You might need to call security. This...<eos> There's no snakes here.<eos> There's no... There's no snakes...<eos> Okay, we're gonna get you over to someone.
Your girlfriend contacted my firm asking for a lawyer. Everyone else was busy, so... tag...<eos> I'm it.<eos> I-I think we need to talk about a few things...<eos> I got to get back.<eos> Uh, when the Feds call you in for an interview... and they will... call me.
Now, remember the burden of proof on a grand jury is low.<eos> Your job is merely to indict, not to convict.<eos> So please keep in mind you don't need to believe beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> You only need to believe that the accused... could have committed a crime.<eos> Miss Tascioni, this is an order from a federal magistrate compelling you to assist in our investigation.
Do you know of any other dates?<eos> Any more meetings?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> That doesn't bother you?
Membership has its privileges.<eos> So work your magic and make these charges go away.<eos> I need to look clean.<eos> Then get Hess to testify on your behalf.<eos> This drug testimony - from Theroux hurts you.
From Gail Meyers.<eos> There were 16,726 individual contributions to my campaign.<eos> People give me money because they know I cannot be bought.<eos> My entire campaign was built on a lifelong reputation for integrity.<eos> On October 24th, the polls have you down by three points.
All they needed was a little nudge.<eos> And it worked.<eos> I mean, we got on the charts and we started getting radio play, we were gonna be booked for this big tour.<eos> I mean, we were gonna make it so big.<eos> We have a photo linking you to the crime scene.
Get a cart ready!<eos> No.<eos> I signed that DNR for a reason.<eos> You can rescind.<eos> Let us help you.
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> Who taught you it was okay to speak to patients that way?<eos> She's not my patient.<eos> The embolization went well. I was able to stop the bleeding on your spleen.<eos> We'll just have to monitor you for the next 24 hours, and you should be okay.
You really think you can get the tumor?<eos> I told you I could get it.<eos> I meant it.<eos> Yeah, but other doctors have meant it.<eos> I'll put you on bypass. And I'll remove your heart so I can get all the tumor.
Go for it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Shepherd, I've got Social Work paging you.
You'll be fine, all right?<eos> Um, you're just gonna get a bit of fresh air, all right?<eos> Okay, we got Mr. Pruitt downstairs safe and sound.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Okay, these two very capable doctors are gonna carry you down.
My name is Cheryl, and surgery would be better than this.<eos> Being sliced open and gutted would be better than this.<eos> It's just kidney stones!<eos> Okay. Look, no, we gotta get you out of this hallway. There's way too much smoke, all right?<eos> I'm gonna pick you up. Is that okay?
Do you have something to confess?<eos> No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Help him!<eos> Nobody's gonna help you.
It's important that you make it clear that the suspect was reaching for his gun, and that fearing for your safety and the safety of those around you, you defended yourself and shot him.<eos> I mean, do it in your own words, but keep it boilerplate.<eos> Detective Sullivan,<eos> Lieutenant Cynthia Barrow, Internal Affairs.<eos> Lot of people calling you a hero.
He's just like my burrito. Except we made this together.<eos> Well, I will tell you one thing.<eos> You won't forget this birth.<eos> I know. First one's always the most exciting, right?<eos> No, I mean it's probably going to split you from tip to tail.
James.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> It turns out I was right about the contamination in Claudia Guerrero's neighborhood.<eos> There was a microchip factory there until 1983.<eos> Why is this one hitting you so hard?
We'll administer a sterile talc powder via a chest tube, which will reinforce your lung lining and reduce the chances of a tension pneumothorax rupture.<eos> I know this is a lot to absorb, Claudia.<eos> We believe the surgery will be successful, and we can keep you healthy until the synth lung is ready.<eos> What happens if it isn't?<eos> If your lungs fail, we'll put you on ECMO.
[Sighs]<eos> You're... different than the cops and the FBI.<eos> They asked a lot of questions about when I was a kid.<eos> Weird.<eos> They were evaluating you for the Macdonald Triad.
We grew up in the same house for 18 years. You get to know a person.<eos> It's been a long time since you guys were kids.<eos> When was the last time you spoke?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> Is that because he molested you as a child?
No. I think we're good.<eos> You are in big trouble, young lady.<eos> You're not in an open relationship.<eos> You're so not in an open relationship that your husband hired a private investigator to find out what you were up to.<eos> Remember that Civic you saw following you on a date with Jamie?
And if she is dead or in prison, she is no help to him.<eos> Do you see my problem?<eos> We wouldn't need much from you.<eos> What means "not much"?<eos> Well, an occasional question about how TASS works, maybe the name of an employee or two, who watches over you, if you know what I mean.
I reached out to his sister, who tried, but they got to her, too, and he stopped returning my calls.<eos> So I stopped calling.<eos> A year goes by.<eos> In the mail, a wedding invitation.<eos> "Sir Laurence Bishop invites you to attend the wedding of his son."
I like it.<eos> You must be messed up then.<eos> I'd totally get a tattoo of that.<eos> Does that make me messed up?<eos> How's that ATM treating you, officer?
That product was<eos> - bought and paid for.<eos> You are not gonna weasel me this time.<eos> - I want my 35 grand. - Oh, just hold on.<eos> Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?
Put it away, Bates.<eos> But he's raising my morale, sir!<eos> Ready to move? Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah? Everybody here...<eos> Bates will drive you to a rendezvous point, and then you'll be driven back down to the boat from there.
Well, then, neither did I!<eos> Uh, ditto for me.<eos> You can't take back a confession! This isn't church.<eos> It's not official because the jury didn't hear it.<eos> Mr. Segal's right, although I caution you to not waste the court's time like this again.
Where's H.G.? He ran into some trouble.<eos> Carl's on his way to get him right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> The lab is downstairs. We should hurry.<eos> The only thing that's gonna get you out of this is the truth.
I don't know why I bother eating food any more, I should just glue it to my hips!<eos> Morning, it's only me.<eos> Good morning!<eos> You know, one morning, you'll surprise me and say good morning back and I'll probably have a heart attack.<eos> Then you'll have to speak to another human being on the telephone about where they should send the ambulance, and that'll upset you. ♪ Gloria!
You're at the Quai des Orfevres and what we need to do is we need to take you inside and ask you some questions.<eos> Take me home.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> I understand that.<eos> And, hopefully, we will get you home very soon.
The neighbours say her brother keeps her locked in the bedroom.<eos> They haven't seen her for over a year.<eos> Take her home, I'll interview her there.<eos> Don't let her talk to anyone.<eos> Constable Bertinet will show you where.
No.<eos> Maybe all men want to trap you in the end.<eos> And I was sick of that.<eos> I don't think Carl wanted to trap you.<eos> I think he loves you.
You are charged with the manufacture and possession of propaganda intended to undermine the True History.<eos> This is in contravention of the Memory Crimes Act of 1975.<eos> 1975?<eos> The Monks have only been here a few months!<eos> Therefore I sentence you to ten years in a labour camp.
Ms. Gladys, thank you so much for doing this for us.<eos> Now you know I loved it. Call me anytime.<eos> And that niece of yours.<eos> She all right when she want to be. I love her.<eos> Thank you, Auntie.
Thanks for letting me sit up front.<eos> - I get car sick.<eos> - Ugh!<eos> So does Josh... er, Mr. Kaminski, I mean.<eos> So, uh, what brings you to town?
I'm not exactly qualified in a traditional sense.<eos> I'm a doctor by trade.<eos> - Do you know your Bible?<eos> - I do. That's a good start.<eos> What's troubling you?
Perhaps.<eos> But unlike Nolan and his friends, I keep my promises.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> Just work with me.<eos> And in exchange, I'll protect your son and keep you from going to the factory.
Um, it just means you get 10 percent off a pay-per-view movie. Oh.<eos> Could I trade that in for a free breakfast?<eos> I can look into that for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what brings you to Denver?
Well, it's about to take a turn for the worse if you buy these defective trash bags.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not gonna be okay.<eos> Trust me... these bags will betray you.
So, I... um...<eos> "Um," what?<eos> I put a GPS tracker on his car.<eos> I thought that he was cheating on me.<eos> Hey, nobody's judging you.
But when Mr. stone asked you why you were divorced, one of the reasons you gave was this gun.<eos> Wait a minute, did you even tell the investigators you had been married?<eos> No.<eos> All due respect, Ms. Butler, but that's a little weird, don't you think?<eos> I mean, they were accusing you of murdering judge kinzie, and you forgot to tell them that your overly protective ex owned a gun just like the murder weapon?
Oh, God, no! No. I...<eos> I work at Greggs.<eos> I'm what you call...<eos> emotionally intelligent.<eos> Well, sadly, that won't help you with the cryptic.
Here you go.<eos> Up.<eos> I need to see your I.D. before you take the patient anywhere.<eos> Well, unfortunately, my previous patient got some unsanitary fluids on it, so, um, kind of waiting for a new one.<eos> I can't let you out of here without hospital credentials.
From our wedding.<eos> You better stop making that joke, Allison!<eos> Has my rash gotten worse?<eos> You know, as a nurse, I would say yes.<eos> As just someone who knows you, I would say,
You guys should do this one without me.<eos> Bye.<eos> Abigail Pershing?<eos> That's me.<eos> I'm from the United States Postal Service mail recovery center and we have been looking for you for... well,
You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, you wrote this report just after you got the promotion.<eos> A few months before Alistair died.<eos> Did the fire have something to do with him stepping aside?<eos> Look, you can tell us here now, or I can arrest you in front of everyone.
You let an innocent woman go to prison.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please, please, will you tell her I'm so, so sorry?<eos> Stand up, please, both of you.<eos> Betty Platt, I am arresting you for the murder of Alistair Liddell on the 15th of December, 1962.
Madam Secretary!<eos> Mr. Chen, we've got to stop meeting like this.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I would think your plane would've been repaired by now.<eos> Or perhaps, something else is keeping you here.
All right, let's go talk to Roman.<eos> You're here early. Our appointment's not for another 30 minutes.<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> That's what appointments are for.<eos> No, I mean, thank you for your help, but I think I'm done with therapy.
Colonel Yularen.<eos> I don't know if you remember me from the academy...<eos> Of course, young Agent Kallus.<eos> I keep tabs on all my star pupils.<eos> What brings you to Lothal?
Get him to open the door with it.<eos> I am Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Admiral Thrawn told you to expect us.<eos> Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Thrawn told me to expect you.
Of course he's lying! Well, when he told me what happened, he started to cry.<eos> And then he turned to his father, and he begged him not to hate him.<eos> We have a believable 15-year-old boy in there who is claiming that you sexually assaulted him and Trey Franklin.<eos> Making things worse, Trey is dead.<eos> Because you told your son that he was raping you, when, in fact, you were raping him.
You know what?<eos> I just can't keep doing this.<eos> Stop calling me, please.<eos> The interview will not be happening.<eos> Someone will escort you back to your hotel.
Hey.<eos> What do you do here?<eos> I work for them.<eos> The president asked me to make sure that you get home safely.<eos> I have a car for you.
We're following protocol, ma'am.<eos> National Security Advisor Cafferty is on her way.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - No, we'll wait for Francis.<eos> He'll meet you inside.
- Ma'am, Homeland is over... - The president is right.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> This is President Underwood.<eos> At this time, we have no idea who's responsible.<eos> Director Green, perhaps it's better I patch you into the whole room.
Never know when you might get a chance to press some flesh.<eos> - Uh-huh. - Yeah.<eos> Hi, I'm Alex Romero.<eos> I represent the Seventh District of Arizona.<eos> I want to know what keeps you up at night so I can work all day to address it.
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man that wants many things.<eos> But you have made a mistake.<eos> There's only one thing, professionally, that I've always wanted.<eos> - It's to work in the White House.<eos> - Hmm. Seth will see you out.
Well, yes and no.<eos> History has a way of looking better than it was.<eos> Or perhaps Shakespeare was right. We're all just madmen leading the blind.<eos> Ms. Lee. This is Seth Grayson, from the White House.<eos> Yeah, thank you for taking my call.
Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss.<eos> I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next.<eos> Isn't that it?<eos> Isn't that what really bothers you?
I know.<eos> What's a funny farm?<eos> A funny farm is where you go when you do funny things.<eos> Or... people THINK you're being funny but actually you're being completely serious.<eos> When I say that we're managing without you, I don't want you to think that we're not missing you to bits.
- He or she is the one with the quality our research reveals is the most toxic to our defense:<eos> A strict constructionist.<eos> No Thomas Jeffersons.<eos> No one who believes in the literal interpretation of rules.<eos> They'll never forgive you for leaking the memo.
- And that you would do everything in your power to stop their impending marriage?<eos> Jake's lying.<eos> How could you talk all this crap, man?<eos> Just answer the question, Mr. Soto.<eos> In fact, you went there alone and stabbed him to death because the thought of Trevor and Mia together enraged you.
No, I like the first idea.<eos> - You're a genius.<eos> - I know.<eos> You're not actually thinking about cooking that thing?<eos> Mr. Hoenigsberg, what brings you round on Christmas Eve?
Ms. Wilson, if you don't go, how are you gonna know?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> This is it!<eos> A birthday trip!<eos> Okay, you are going to Vegas, and we are taking you.
Someone important.<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> The first Verdammt taxi that came couldn't accommodate the car seat.<eos> Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Kitty's been expecting you.
Like him?<eos> I know who you are, and that you're willing to kill me if you have to.<eos> But you don't know who I am.<eos> And I am not someone who's gonna help you commit a crime.<eos> I'm not gonna help you.
I promise. It'll be just fine.<eos> Doctor?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The night I was poisoned... Last night, I can't remember...<eos> People will see you.
Save your bloody breath, you heartless bitch, and turn around.<eos> They took Helena.<eos> To the island, presumably.<eos> I wouldn't be so certain.<eos> Neolution will survive Rachel's betrayal. But the stress has taken its toll on you, so...
- at the senior center. - Please. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yep, ye... okay.<eos> Well, it has to be okay with Dylan's mom. Oh, Mom, can I, please?<eos> Oh, I don't think so, sweetheart.<eos> It's no offense, I just don't know you very well.
I'm just not strong enough for this.<eos> Wait, Mimi Kanassis with the butt implants?<eos> That woman is a nightmare.<eos> Well, yes, but--<eos> No, honestly, I don't blame you.
I mean, I just hope Mateo's aide is going to be there because I can't handle that situation on my own.<eos> - Ugh, trust me, I know.<eos> - Excuse me. So you know, my son is not a situation to be handled.<eos> And I'd appreciate it if you grew up and stopped gossiping.<eos> Just stay out of this. I don't even know you.
Communism, it's like a cancer.<eos> Something funny? No, no.<eos> It's just cancer.<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> You cooperate now, you give us their names... you give us those names or I'll put you up in front of a Senate subcommittee.
The big dog.<eos> Dawson, right?<eos> Grab a seat.<eos> Butchie, get Investigator Dawson a beer, will ya?<eos> What brings you here?
Uh, we met before.<eos> You were in high school, playing basketball against my son's team. Ha.<eos> Yeah, you were point guard.<eos> Yeah, well, long time ago.<eos> Well, I mean, my boy towered over you, and he's barely six feet.
Look, I just need to talk to someone about the money you guys owe me.<eos> Unrelated question:<eos> how often do you receive big cakes that a person could fit in?<eos> Good afternoon, Mr. Bortz.<eos> Are they expecting you?
I'm not just a Sikh or a woman.<eos> I'm a red-state Democrat.<eos> That's three strikes.<eos> The last thing I can do at a time like this is vote my conscience over my constituents.<eos> Well, you may not want your faith to define you, but this bill defines my people by theirs.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Everyone must die.<eos> I have aligned my life to my purpose: To fight for the autonomy of the Tibetan people.<eos> And as for them, I ask that you endorse my choice for my successor over China's.<eos> Well, as always... the United States encourages you to achieve your goal through direct dialogue with China.
I ran a tox screen.<eos> You tested positive for DMT.<eos> What?<eos> It's a psychedelic compound.<eos> Now, look, I don't know if you're taking it or they're dosing you, but, either way, you're compromised.
Well, I am pulling up zero.<eos> There's no current address for Sarah Huntley or Jaines, and nothing to date appears online.<eos> There's no social media, no car, no bank account, no credit cards.<eos> This girl's a ghost.<eos> Thank you very much.
[chuckles] Well, hold on, boys, okay?<eos> Look, I-I'm just trying to locate Shanee Wallis, same as you.<eos> You know, we should compare notes.<eos> The first time we ever heard that name was when you went public.<eos> So who's paying you, and what do they want?
I think you'll hear ia lot about him soon.<eos> And I've noticed that Rebecca Sherman and Thomas Roth were both at your daughter's wedding.<eos> I thought you were asking about my charitable giving.<eos> I don't respond to fishing expeditions from arts reporters.<eos> If you have any real questions, you can find me anytime, unless I see you first.
- Also, it's rude to unfollow.<eos> - Oh. When's the last time you saw her?<eos> Uh, seven months ago.<eos> I should go.<eos> Hey, listen, thank you so much for taking the time to sign with us today.
I know I did it to myself.<eos> But I really thought it would make Mark happy.<eos> And do you know the thanks I got?<eos> He started shtupping the plastic surgeon.<eos> Miss Broden, security video places you at your husband's home the night of his death.
Then, out of the blue, there's this little voice.<eos> "Could be shingles."<eos> It's Dr. Dummy.<eos> We had just read a chapter on shingles.<eos> Why did they call you "Dr. Dummy"?
Wait, you're the landlord.<eos> Can you unlock his door for me?<eos> Nah, I like him more than you.<eos> You like him?<eos> He calls you Mrs. Chiquita Banana.
Maybe you can come visit me sometime.<eos> Call me, please.<eos> Te quiero.<eos> Te quiero mucho.<eos> Camila, thank you so much for coming in the office.
It's yours.<eos> So, what was this all about?<eos> A distraction to keep you away from your comrades while we turned one of them against you.<eos> The job is done now, so you're free to go.<eos> The President thanks you for your service.
I'm just gonna take that off and start right over.<eos> I have to run.<eos> Ick.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, well, obviously, we won't charge you.
- Previously on "Wynonna Earp"...<eos> - I'm not a bad person, and if you know what's good for you, stop treating me like one.
- How come just a peek?<eos> - The data upload was compromised.<eos> Compromised by Jane Doe.<eos> It says here that she aborted the mission to save her brother, another terrorist.<eos> How many criminals need to undermine you before you realize that there is something rotten inside your team?
He's delusional.<eos> Not dangerous.<eos> The witness, Linda mcfaden, where are you keeping her?<eos> Okay, first of all, I don't know any Linda. But if you put the gun away, I'm sure we can work this out.<eos> No, there's no way you'd let her out of your sight. Not when she's the only person that can tie you to Reven Wright's murder.
Thank you.<eos> How many people have you killed in prison, sir?<eos> None.<eos> So the urge went away. There aren't any women there.<eos> But this urge... This wave growing and pulling you out to sea...
Nam?<eos> Water, please?<eos> You think you can cause havoc all over my city and not pay a price?<eos> You know, this is all a big misunderstanding.<eos> Until your government bails you out, you are my prisoner.
I got you.<eos> Look at me. Breathe.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> An officer will meet you at the hospital, and he'll take your statement when you're ready.
- If you let me...<eos> - You have to go.<eos> - I...<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> There's someone looking for you.
This place has stood here for a long time.<eos> I'm sure it has a few more years in it.<eos> What's your story?<eos> Sorry?<eos> You have something weighing on you.
Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Please, take your seats.<eos> Sorry you have to sit next to a baby.<eos> I promise she's one of the good ones.<eos> I don't know you, so your promise doesn't mean much.
Uh, actually, Greg, let's step outside for a second.<eos> Okay, well, I'm just waiting for, you know, a "no biggie, you're forgiven" from Max - and his lover here...<eos> - Lawyer.<eos> - Huh? - Damn it.<eos> And I should inform you that we're suing you for the pain and suffering that you've caused my client.
I'm here to talk to you, detective to detective.<eos> I know you broke into NYOOPI's computer today.<eos> Someone used Fred Kirby's old log-in from an I.P. address inside the NYPD, and then they downloaded a bunch of our tax records.<eos> I could tell you didn't like us when we met.<eos> Got the feeling we embarrass you.
Lock her up!<eos> Well, Roger has a really rough reputation.<eos> They talk about "dirty trickster" and lots of other things, but I've known him for a long time, and he's actually a quality guy.<eos> He's a nice guy.<eos> Just a few descriptions of you here:
He's just using you to try and...<eos> and chip away at me, and you're letting him.<eos> This isn't personal.<eos> The hell it isn't.<eos> Mr. Plame, my agent is gonna escort you off the premises.
She thinks I'm responsible for bringing her back into Wentworth.<eos> Well, that would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?<eos> No, Franky's always had a vivid imagination.<eos> She's highly intuitive.<eos> I hope that Vera is supporting you through this trying time.
She's shooting on Stage 6, and if you're lucky, you might see her walking from the stage to her trailer.<eos> Sure.<eos> Say, is there a john nearby?<eos> Yes, it's right over there.<eos> Hey, listen, if anybody stops you, asks what you're doing here, just say you were making a delivery, and you got lost on your way out, okay?
Yeah, I, uh...<eos> Stop it, Miner.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> I'm not gonna squeal.<eos> I'm just gonna put you to work.
Really.<eos> Vargas, you got a meeting with your new attorney and a visitor.<eos> We're gonna need a moment of privacy.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She's got files linking you to the Colibri Trawlers.
Great, I'm happy that I know that now.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Never seen an IADG clearance quite that high before... Agent Garrison.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've had my eye on you for quite some time, Detective.
But there's not really a market for open sadism.<eos> Crimes of revenge, on the other hand?<eos> Now there's a gold mine.<eos> And Tyson Pryor... he's gonna get his money's worth.<eos> Can I help you?
There must be some mistake.<eos> Look, I don't...<eos> I'm nobody.<eos> Which is your dominant eye?<eos> Agent Mojtabai, thank you for coming in.
At least you've got a life to document.<eos> I took out tours at 11:00, 12:00, and 1:00.<eos> I can show you ticket stubs.<eos> Bring them in today.<eos> We received a call naming you as the killer.
Would we find your fingerprints on this?<eos> Swift gave that to my daughter.<eos> I listened to the first song, and it was obscene, so I fired him to protect my little girl.<eos> A phone message has come to our attention.<eos> The person who sent it claims to know something that would send you to prison.
Hold it right there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's a, it's a toy.<eos> Armed with a paintball gun and wearing a body camera, just like our victim.<eos> Dr. Eriyo, we've been expecting you.
Have you got any evidence to support that?<eos> Bigots in your community - they look at brown people, and they immediately assume we're terrorists.<eos> Yeah, well, let's just sidestep the identity politics.<eos> It's discrimination!<eos> Our treatment of you has nothing to do with discrimination, and everything to do with your propensity to lie.
- Eddie, please.<eos> Welcome to Continuum.<eos> - Bonnie.<eos> You need to stay on Maxine.<eos> What brings you here?
That statement from Pearl.<eos> - I'll keep you updated.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How do you think you'll go today?<eos> Will the Devils release you from your contract?
your product has arrived.<eos> OK, when?<eos> That wasn't him.<eos> The... the man, his voice is colder.<eos> Senior Constable Page will take you back now, Mr Cartwright.
He's gonna cut right there? !<eos> Hey, hey, Travis, look at me.<eos> I'm gonna be with you the whole time. All right?<eos> I've got you.<eos> I'm just gonna cover you for safety.
That was a lie.<eos> You perjured yourself, Mr. Wilcox.<eos> That voids your deal with the State of New York.<eos> We can use the testimony you've already provided to roll up your gang.<eos> And now, we can send you to prison with them.
The V.A. might not pay for it.<eos> And our deal with them won't kick in for a few weeks.<eos> You know, Scott and I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Mac.<eos> And I wouldn't have done his surgery if you hadn't ambushed me with a press conference.<eos> Look, Julian, we thank you for going the extra mile for Mac.
Is that a problem?<eos> I made a statement.<eos> I don't know what I can add to it.<eos> You alleged you found Niall Swift - at the bottom of Carn Mohr.<eos> We have evidence that puts you at the top, where he was murdered.
Yes!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Craig Petrie, I'm detaining you under Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1995.
Looks like he had Petrie on speed dial.<eos> Mr. Petrie, I'm a criminal psychologist helping with...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Let's talk about Niall Swift.<eos> We have evidence that puts you at the murder site.
I'd like to ask you for a personal favor before leaving.<eos> Now you know who is to blame for all this, Saavedra.<eos> It's your own fault that your article didn't get published.<eos> I know I can trust you, Conrado.<eos> I won't let you down, Mr. President.
Any other family in the area?<eos> Parents?<eos> No, they're both dead.<eos> Can you please tell me what's gonna happen to me?<eos> Well, when we're done here, we'll be moving you to county jail in Kingston for booking. You'll be held there until your arraignment, which is when you and your lawyer will be able - to make your plea to the judge.
"Because I love novels."<eos> If that's the case, then why don't you just write a diary.<eos> Mr. Michima, don't underestimate the power of expression.<eos> Isn't that why your novels never sold?<eos> They're only selling now because of the scandals surrounding you.
How can you tell?<eos> Alan.<eos> Keith.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - So what brings you to Paris?
We won't just make you better.<eos> We will make you better than better.<eos> A superhero.<eos> Look, Agent Smith, I tried the hero business and it left a mark.<eos> But if I ever hit "fuck it," I'll look you up.
- It's Fernando?<eos> You should do whatever you can to look younger.<eos> For starters, lose the beard.<eos> An image consult is included with the Platinum Package.<eos> We'll give you a workstation, some place to go every morning. And we will produce a video résumé that will set you above the rabble.
Wilheimer has an 85% placement rate, Mr. Davis. - Wow!<eos> - How do you think we make that number?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - That's a rhetorical question.<eos> While everyone else is out there wasting their time, meeting mid-level HR hacks, Wilheimer will be putting you in front of the person who can pull the trigger and actually hire you.
Nieves was accused of misprision of felony and sent to prison in Brieva, where she found inmates imprisoned by her husband.<eos> When they offered her an isolated cell she said that she didn't need to isolate herself from anyone.<eos> 1,200 people live in this tower.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> Nobody will notice you.
To stop bullets.<eos> Do you know anyone in Venezuela?<eos> My mother lives there.<eos> Why?<eos> The Spanish police are looking for you there too.
OPERATION LUNA<eos> Your passport.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for respecting my first name.<eos> You'll fly with Jesus and Hans to Bangkok, where two Laotian policemen will hand you over to the Spanish police and they'll take you back to Madrid.
The President will be seated at his desk. But please wait by the door until he addresses you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Presley will enter. If he leaves his sunglasses on then Nixon should wait until Mr. Presley speaks.<eos> His sunglasses?<eos> The President will then shake your hand. And then invite you to sit down, he will instruct you where to do so.
But my friends call me Desmond.<eos> No, maam this is my first time.<eos> I always dream about being a doctor but ahhh Didn't get much school.<eos> Might be a little dizzy when we're done.<eos> Somebody picking you up?
You really don't know when to stop, do you?<eos> Connor?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'll tell you over breakfast.
Thank you, Miss Roe.<eos> You must be Maso's new find.<eos> I guess something like that.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> So, what brings you by?
It's almost white.<eos> Would you like a menu? Thank you very much.<eos> Could I have a cup of coffee, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why does my father hate you so much?
Did you tell her?<eos> I had to.<eos> Give me your keys. Jesus.<eos> Just have a seat, please.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.
That's all I got, Rose.<eos> That's all I got to give.<eos> Can't give nothing else!<eos> Mr. Maxson?<eos> Commissioner will see you now.
- Zed!<eos> - (GASPS) Sorry.<eos> Simply dreadful what Ratchet has done to you.<eos> He's made people forget who the real hero is.<eos> All you wanted to do was protect the galaxy, and how do they repay you?
We found our otter.<eos> Mr. Otterton.<eos> My name is Officer Judy Hopps.<eos> Your wife sent me to find you.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here now.
My wife was in last week and she ordered a brown duffle in leather.<eos> We were only able to locate in black, sir.<eos> Well, she'll be very disappointed.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, thank you very much.
No, I'll have a schnapps, too.<eos> So, we begin.<eos> From now on, we are alone.<eos> You will not leave this room for a certain period of time, possibly a long time.<eos> You are my guest. But believe me, the moment you step out of that door, I will no longer know you.
Right.<eos> Professor Langdon ?<eos> Hello, yes.<eos> Speaking.<eos> Thank heavens you're alive. We've been looking for you.
So we took you from her on the street.<eos> The hospital scenario encouraged you to trust Dr. Brooks.<eos> And your call to the consulate was answered by our man.<eos> Professor Langdon?<eos> Thank heavens you're alive. We've been looking for you.
Oh.<eos> Been a bad day, miss.<eos> Meeker.<eos> Nicole Meeker.<eos> What brings you to me?
Mr. Paczynski is a genuine gumshoe, in the great grand tradition of Philip Marlowe.<eos> I always preferred Mike Hammer.<eos> Even your idols are second rate.<eos> Must be interesting work.<eos> What brings you here?
What brings you to the party?<eos> My boyfriend, Charlie's bank, does some kind of business with the company that I guess just bought your paper.<eos> You all work for Hobbs now, I guess.<eos> "All" meaning mankind? Yes.<eos> You grateful you landed a job that pays you to stare at people?
You think I went out of my way to screw up my own investigation?<eos> You think I'm that big of an idiot?<eos> You know what I think now? I think you're smart, but you want everybody else to think that you're an idiot.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> Cowan, I know I'm new here, but as far as I can tell, people who don't even know you, think you're an asshole.
Thank you for what you did.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> Thank him.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> When I got to you, I was sure he'd already killed you.
- Excuse me.<eos> Hey! Hey, mister!<eos> Hey, mister.<eos> Hey, fella.<eos> Mr. Kowalski, Mr. Bingley will see you now.
- See it through my eyes.<eos> I find you in the stable, alone, your head bleeding and your camera smashed, an empty glass of bourbon on the porch.<eos> Can you at least appreciate my perspective?<eos> - I understand how it must look.<eos> - What's really troubling you, Mr. Dawles?
- Just one more second.<eos> - Open the door, now.<eos> Open the door, now!<eos> - I'm kinda busy right now.<eos> If you'll leave your name, your number at the tone, I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as possible, beep.
- Dammit.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> It's okay. Hey, hey, look at me.<eos> It's okay. It's okay. Alright?<eos> We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
And these are now empty.<eos> Do you know who I am, Major?<eos> Yes, General. I do.<eos> You're the man responsible for the deaths of two of my men.<eos> Now, open up those crates before I grab you by your hair plugs and bitch slap that smug look off of your face.
There you go. He's slower.<eos> A tenth of a second slower, Jesse.<eos> Two-tenths, Coach.<eos> Relax.<eos> I won't let you down in front of Cromwell.
Hey, miss.<eos> Miss!<eos> You gotta, you gotta stop here.<eos> You're gonna help me find him.<eos> I can help you if you just..
Dmitri.<eos> You should see your face.<eos> Dmitri sokurov?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What can I do for you?
I'll go down this road<eos> To find a sinner in myself<eos> I'll go down<eos> Down this road again<eos> Can I help you?
Y'all could learn something out here today. - Yes.<eos> This here... This is my town.<eos> Anybody who don't know it, you better take notice.<eos> Now you gonna face me like a man or what?<eos> No offense, mister, I don't know you and I don't think nothing cross about you. But that shot is on the house if you will get out of here.
Do I know you?<eos> Name's Jebediah... been here such a long time.<eos> And what is your name, kind sir?<eos> Reggie.<eos> What brings you to this... God-forsaken place, Reggie?
It has a name brand.<eos> It has an identity.<eos> We get a case like this, a litigation at this level, I need lawyers who kill.<eos> Lawyers with reputations walk into a courtroom and intimidate.<eos> I don't see you in that picture, Mr. Cahill.
Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.<eos> Semira awaits you in her private chambers.<eos> Semira?<eos> Where is Cassius?<eos> The entire council will greet you, of course, sir... but Semira requests just a few moments.
Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.<eos> Oh boy, it's about time for that.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the...<eos> Director, what brings you to Scarif?
What more do we have to do?<eos> You want me to call in the retaliatory strikes?<eos> For an attack which may or may not have happened?<eos> Planes are ready to go on your command.<eos> Mr. President, this puts you in a terrible position.
- Not without an X-ray.<eos> - Did you always wanna be a doctor? - Yes.<eos> But why is that relevant?<eos> - Say you're walking down the street, all right, and this kid runs into the middle of the street and gets hit by a car.<eos> You run to save him but by the time you get there, there's a crowd, there's cops, they won't let you through.
Not unless you are family.<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> This is Allison Morley speaking.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.
If I lose power, it might still happen.<eos> Your American friends wouldn't like that.<eos> Okay, I will send you 1,000 of our best former legionnaires.<eos> The mining companies will hire them as security officers, but you will give the orders.<eos> Katanga thanks you for that.
One that few people could even imagine.<eos> Treasure it.<eos> Keep it safe and secure, tucked away in some special place in your heart,<eos> but... don't spend the rest of your days chasing a ghost.<eos> Not when there's a man, a real flesh and blood living man, who loves you still with all his heart.
You can't come back.<eos> Well, you're right about not coming back.<eos> But if that is the case,<eos> God has just revealed to us that we haven't finished our search yet.<eos> Doesn't that scare the shit out of you?
Okay?<eos> Tie off the suture.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's a nice-- That's a nice union.<eos> One more, and then we'll send you on your way.
The extension is a bitch.<eos> You know it and they know it.<eos> Stop twirling and end this.<eos> I want that place in the market at the end of the month.<eos> Sure, thank you Mr. Hurman I do not bother you anymore.
How do you do?<eos> I read your column.<eos> It's great fun.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -What brings you here?
Oh, yes, please!<eos> You know I rather envy you.<eos> You live life as you please.<eos> You have a motor car, your work and now a genuine passion.<eos> And no-one ever bothers you with endless questions about when you'll marry and why you don't have a gentleman friend.
Now that Miss Whitmore is at the women's hostel, we're no longer her nearest practice.<eos> Should I send her records on?<eos> Has she requested that we do?<eos> I just thought that with Sister Evangelina away and Nurse Mount unable to take midwifery cases, it might, well, ease the load a little.<eos> Is something troubling you, Sister?
I seem to remember WE helped shell peas number two, three and four.<eos> I hope we haven't done anything to offend.<eos> I'm going to the clinic at St Cuthbert's.<eos> They want me to have it in hospital, on account of my age.<eos> Well, they're obviously taking very good care of you, because you look extremely well.
- Turner speaking.<eos> - 'Turner, it's Jacques here.'<eos> - Dr Jacques?<eos> - 'You rang me earlier.'<eos> Yes, yes, it's good of you to take my call.
You should tell the group that.<eos> You really do care, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> Let's go, Carl.<eos> It's not often I see a prisoner leave you speechless.
Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you.<eos> My lab is not my lab anymore.<eos> I wouldn't know where to begin.<eos> What if we can help you with that?
You're accusing me of stealing your tools?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Walter. Don't let him smoke you.<eos> Sir, we have evidence that, if true... you know, indicts you, more or less.
Sullivan.<eos> Sullivan.<eos> Burn unit, third floor.<eos> He's not here.<eos> If I ever see you back here again, I'll report you to Homeland.
Senior Constable Fergus McFadden has re-entered the room.<eos> It's 9:51.<eos> I hardly knew Chloe Holloway.<eos> She was a baby when I left.<eos> Is that before Roy smuggled you off the island?
If you'll excuse us... we have to go pack.<eos> After tonight's sold-out show...<eos> We're leaving on a 50-country tour.<eos> And all of them are outside of America.<eos> We're gonna take you down, Price, and your little dummy, too.
Don't worry, Detective.<eos> As the expression goes, there's more than one way to look inside a ferret.<eos> I spent some time as a veterinary gynecologist.<eos> I don't think that's a thing.<eos> Yes, and a judge agreed with you.
Or did he find out about the affair you were having?<eos> The two of you decided to kill Otis so you could start a new life, didn't you?<eos> I would never hurt Otis.<eos> I may not love him anymore, but I would never hurt him!<eos> Oh, sure you would, especially if you found out that he was trying to cut you out of your share of the store.
What were you thinking?<eos> You know your crime is punishable with lashes.<eos> So, pray that he shows mercy.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Look, I'm letting you off this time with a warning only because Mrs. hashemi has vouched for you.
Good morning, Detective. And a question.<eos> Is it a normal procedure for three detectives to rush from an ongoing crime scene investigation to the home of the former spouse of the victim simply to notify that person that someone whom they used to be married to has been killed?<eos> Well, every situation is different.<eos> And there were children involved.<eos> And at the Bundy scene, didn't Detective Fuhrman inform you that Mr. Simpson and the victim had a history of domestic violence?
It's full of gypsies and blacks.<eos> Grace says he exports automobiles to the colonies.<eos> Pol, now.<eos> So, what does he say?<eos> He won't meet you unless you give us the name.
And honest, it seems.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I must warn you, a man with integrity in a water company... is as rare as a white rhino.<eos> I need someone like you.<eos> Give me some time to find an opening. But we are going to get you in here.
The one, the only national bandstand coming to you live from Rydell high hosted by the one, the only Vince Fontaine.<eos> That's me. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.<eos> The national danceoff.<eos> One lucky guy and gal will go home with a fan task prize.<eos> Don't feel bad if I bump you out, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's what you do with your dancing shoes. Throw your mittens around your kittens and away we go!
Is that Penguin?<eos> - He seems drugged.<eos> - He's been quite agitated since he arrived.<eos> We put him on a mild sedative to keep him from hurting himself.<eos> Dr. Thompkins, my assistant, Ms. Peabody, will accompany you to the infirmary.
You're surrounded.<eos> Please come out, give yourself up, and let's avoid any more sadness.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you be very kind and go tell the police that I'll do as they say?<eos> Nora loved you very much.
Negative 20 degrees.<eos> And I'm not even cold.<eos> Your formula appears to have lowered your core body temperature.<eos> You can only survive in severe hypothermic conditions.<eos> Anything above freezing will kill you.
I have other reasons, deeper plans for Cobblepot, that you can't know about now.<eos> For your own safety.<eos> Deeper plans?<eos> Deeper than building semi-human creatures in the basement?<eos> I'm sure I don't want to know, thank you very much.
Your father took responsibility for his actions.<eos> He fought very hard for what he believed in.<eos> And I will not stop you from doing the same thing.<eos> So... off you go.<eos> Gordon and Mr. Fox be waiting for you.
- Watch me.<eos> - Oh, please, don't go.<eos> Please, you're breaking my heart.<eos> I love you like my own daughter.<eos> No one could love you more, but I will have to kill you before I let you go.
He's not in good health.<eos> Don't hurt him.<eos> We are not as loaded as it may seem.<eos> Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?<eos> Name a price. I'll pay you from my own pocket...
Hey.<eos> Mr Cheuk, you know who Kun-xi is?<eos> It's Kun-xi speaking.<eos> Look me up in Guangdong.<eos> I won't let you down.
Big Red and Little Sylvia.<eos> - Hello, Ms. Song.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> I'm Helen to everyone except Ronnie.<eos> - What does Ronnie call you?
I agree.<eos> In this dream, Orson was young and he was a murderer.<eos> Maybe... maybe I'm feeling anxious about going to see this private detective, Harry.<eos> There's also Vivian and Moby's rehearsal dinner tonight, sir.<eos> Perhaps that's troubling you.
- Quiet!<eos> You live in a dream, Blunt.<eos> You don't know who you are.<eos> Your face is a mask.<eos> No one knows you.
You know what I mean?<eos> I mean, people got to like your ass.<eos> Look... Look at Lee Russell over there.<eos> He laughing it up with them teachers.<eos> Now, how come the teachers never invite you to eat lunch?
Before this all started, I saw you sailing at the Cairo Yacht Club.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, that's only when I'm invited.<eos> Which isn't often, to be honest.<eos> Who invites you?
Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> I got to talk to someone. I will...<eos> I will call you later, and I will explain everything, all right?<eos> Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.
I'm going to Azwai.<eos> With your help, or without it.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Aram Askari.<eos> I won't take you, but Askari is a fixer the Reuters guys swear by.
And I told him that Jason was staying with a friend out in Maspeth.<eos> Mrs. Lutz, do you mind if I keep this card?<eos> - Huh? No.<eos> - Thank you. You've been very helpful.<eos> Someone will show you out. Okay?
I heard just north of the city.<eos> Where north?<eos> That's all I got.<eos> Okay, that's a start.<eos> We find that stash, we might be able to find something that links him to Shane Barton's murder, and we get you outta here.
And Hale?<eos> Won't she be an impediment?<eos> No doubt she will try.<eos> But I'm sure we'll be able to keep them at bay.<eos> Something else is troubling you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, of course I remember you.<eos> Vanessa Hamilton.<eos> Vanessa Hamilton.<eos> Yes, I'm sure he'll come and meet you.
Al Templeton?<eos> He stayed here.<eos> I don't recall anybody by that name.<eos> Oh, my mistake.<eos> What brings you to Dallas, Mr. Amberson?
Chuck?<eos> Get me home.<eos> Ernie!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Again, we want to thank you for accommodating the Major like this.
Well, the good news is that, physically, he's okay.<eos> The radiologist said everything looks normal with Charles' head and spine, so we took his neck collar off.<eos> His head wound will heal just fine.<eos> We gave him a tetanus shot because his immunization records were not current.<eos> I'm sure that's no surprise to you.
Still holding even... good.<eos> The interviews you're doing have stabilized the stock.<eos> Let's line up some more. Set a meeting with P.R.<eos> Right away.<eos> Ted talks have always wanted you, as well.
Oh, yes, I have you.<eos> And you're gonna be staying with us for three nights.<eos> - Are you traveling alone?<eos> - Just me.<eos> And what brings you to L.A.?
I'm afraid to fall asleep.<eos> As soon as I close my eyes, it'll all be gone for another year.<eos> It's okay, Daddy.<eos> Rest.<eos> What brings you to the Cortez?
You like jazz music?<eos> At 2 in the morning?<eos> At any time in the morning.<eos> Your name is Veronica, right?<eos> Anybody ever call you Vonnie for short?
Okay, thank you.<eos> But I'm not famous like you are.<eos> I'm not famous. No pathologist is famous.<eos> Maybe I'm known in certain professional circles, but that's about it.<eos> No one recognizes you on the street?
Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.<eos> Someone's sending you a message.<eos> Sheriff Lotus.<eos> - What do you think, Deputy?<eos> - I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
- How'd you do it?<eos> - That's the trick, isn't it?<eos> Just when I thought I'd seen it all.<eos> Wow, amazing what low self-esteem can do to a sociopath.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.
Me?<eos> No, I used to live here.<eos> For almost 10 years.<eos> And you left?<eos> So what brings you back?
And still, it is.<eos> Come.<eos> We will show you why Spanish is known as the language of Cervantes all over the world.<eos> - The whole world will know my work?<eos> - The whole world will admire you.
Now you look like an agent.<eos> - Hold this.<eos> - Agent... Let's see, let me.<eos> I do not know who invented this damned contraption.<eos> - Hold still, I might choke you.
It's my fault, I'm sorry.<eos> I was supposed to talk with Napoleon and I've failed.<eos> After all the time I spent learning about his life on the Internet...<eos> This outfit is more my style.<eos> The Ministry's contact will meet you upon arrival.
No one knows, but I desire you and many men.<eos> - "Moi..." - "Toi" are forgiven.<eos> It's more sinful to kill someone that to desire... a man or a woman or a... marshal.<eos> - "Vraiment!". Who am I to judge?<eos> I forgive you in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
- They're called antivirals.<eos> Mary, mother of God.<eos> - What a devilish name.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> That will cure you.
- Sure you just want water?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yes, yes, you know I don't drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I see that not even an extreme situation can change you.
Oh, I wish you well.<eos> It's gonna be a loss not having you here.<eos> I guess I'll miss it, but I won't miss the stress.<eos> There's something to be said for that.<eos> But, you know, maybe this will all blow over and they'll reinstate you.
We got to vote on this guy in a week.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You didn't need to do this, you know.<eos> We have agents coming to interview you.
It's great, huh?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Peter Gramercy.<eos> Hi, this is Chelsea Rayne.<eos> I got your message, just calling you back.
-Yeah.<eos> -Man, that's an epic turn of events, bro!<eos> You gotta get in with a lady.<eos> Those Holy Rollers go to bed early.<eos> We'll wait till your parents are asleep and then we'll sneak you out.
- It's a party anthem.<eos> In a 4/4 beat, but with subtext.<eos> I wrote it.<eos> All the big discos, they're eating this shit up.<eos> I won't let you down, Mr. Moreno.
-Yo, get on the one. -♪ The truth to-- ♪<eos> ♪Fromtheapple-<eos> -Apple-- From the apple-- ♪<eos> -♪ From the apple-- ♪<eos> I don't think we can use you, Ra.
And, uh, one last signature here.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We are official part owners of the bar!<eos> SCHMIDT:<eos> Yes! Sir, we won't let you down.
SCHMIDT:<eos> Yes! Sir, we won't let you down.<eos> I'm just a notary.<eos> Hey, the note... arize.<eos> All right, we're not gonna let you down.
Two years ago, you were a school prefect and active in the church.<eos> And now you're here in court, on trial for murder.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You were a husband, a father, but now neither your wife nor your daughter will visit you in the cells and they've not attended court, either, have they?
Good.<eos> What are you having?<eos> The roasted chicken salad.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> So what... uh brings you to Toronto?
And the tea is cold.<eos> Madam President, Chinese hackers breached an NSA firewall earlier this morning.<eos> - Any chance they fixed the Wi-Fi?<eos> - I'll check.<eos> And the director of the Secret Service is waiting to see you.
And when he turned on you, it became self-defense.<eos> You're a hero, detective.<eos> - Let me take a look at that. - Sorry.<eos> This is a federal case now.<eos> FBI's recommending you for commendation.
Finch, they're grabbing him up.<eos> - John, you can't intercede.<eos> - The hell I can't.<eos> The CIA thinks that John Reese is dead.<eos> If Beale sees you, he can marshal all the forces of the Agency to hunt you down, and none of us need that.
He just broke into Krupa's apartment.<eos> Lower your weapon, nobody gets hurt.<eos> You were at the RTCC this morning.<eos> John Riley.<eos> Took you long enough.
- Okay.<eos> - They want to meet you. - Okay. And this is the name of the hr person, and the name and contact information of the creative director.<eos> - Give them a call if you're interested.<eos> Wow.<eos> Dr. Reese, if you weren't like an older version of my gbf, I would totally kiss you right now.
"My home sits on Mount Liang Liang Liang."<eos> Begin!<eos> "YAMAGUCHI<eos> - CAPTAIN, JAPANESE MILITARY POLICE"<eos> Captain! Phone call for you.
Did he go to heaven?<eos> That's another story.<eos> Do you want to hear it?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Okay, I'll tell you.
I ain't.<eos> You don't want me to go.<eos> You ain't cut out for something like this.<eos> You ain't gonna do nothing but slow us down, get us caught.<eos> And if a catcher get a hold of a girl like you, he just gonna... he gonna eat you up.
It's not a pain, but I have an awareness, an awareness in my right thumb, and when I move the right thumb, what happens is, I will experience a kind of disorientation, a dizzy feeling,<eos> and... and maybe some slight loss of appetite. I can't afford not to eat because I can't lose weight, because I need the weight to protect me against disease.<eos> What disease is that?<eos> Is there a possibility that I could have malaria?<eos> I'll call you when the blood work gets in.
We have credible information implicating members of the Arena Club in a conspiracy that involves numerous murders and experimental work in a highly dangerous substance.<eos> There is no legitimate reason to prevent the SSR enforcing the law, even on those who believe they are above it.<eos> How are you enjoying your vacation, Agent Carter?<eos> Vigorously.<eos> Jack Thompson thinks very highly of you.
Was that the first time that you'd seen someone die?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside.
I don't imagine you'd like one of these.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> Nurse Appleyard.<eos> What's he calling you?
What's this one about, then?<eos> It's about an old clock which keeps breaking down.<eos> Is it called Winston?<eos> Miss Appleyard.<eos> The Prime Minister's asking for you downstairs.
I am anything but better.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with the doc on this one, hon.<eos> His eyes are okay, but he still looks skeevots to me.<eos> Well, no matter.<eos> We're gonna get you back to the city now and fix you right up.
Nothing pulls this out of you, and I know you could give it to me if you choose.<eos> It will kill you.<eos> Let me be the judge of that.<eos> Miss Frost?<eos> Someone here to see you.
I got it. The detonator's now blocked.<eos> Finally.<eos> "Hey, great job, doctor.<eos> You really saved the day."<eos> Samberly, I'm gonna kill you someday.
-and you're gonna need a bypass.<eos> -A bypass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> I think it would be best if we did this as soon as possible so we can probably get you into an OR in a few hours.
I'm gonna ask you once, Billy.<eos> Where... is my fucking... cocaine?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> A bit of coke, is it?<eos> I can get coke. Is that alright with you?
And he came down to lunch in plus fours.<eos> Plus fours!<eos> My old regiment would have set the dogs on him.<eos> My husband is always joking.<eos> You must have a great deal to do today, Captain, so we mustn't keep you a moment longer.
Why was he taking pictures?<eos> Was he paparazzi?<eos> I don't know. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Mr. Weaver is expecting you.
One, two!<eos> One, two!<eos> One, two!<eos> So, Mr. Brufort, you've recovered the boat?<eos> I understand why they call you the Eternal, with all the lives you've saved.
I wanted you to meet my friend, Kate Sacker.<eos> We were in Tiger, in together.<eos> And she's a voracious reader.<eos> Hello there.<eos> What brings you to this haven of words and wine?
I find that shocking.<eos> Constance, you called your former boss 1,985 times between November 8, 2013 and March 4, 2014.<eos> You sent him 1,089 texts.<eos> And you slept outside his door.<eos> I'm your lawyer, I'll defend you, but I have serious reservations about your chances of success.
- Yes?<eos> This is Willamette County Hospital.<eos> Dr. Palma has approved discharging your son.<eos> He'll be ready at noon today.<eos> Okay. Okay, thank you very much.
Well, I know, but I'm gonna get him in there.<eos> Well, whatever you do, I'm going to need to know that he has a doctor and a plan for treatment, or I'm going to return him to this facility.<eos> No, this place can't help him.<eos> Doing nothing isn't, either.<eos> Social Services will be contacting you in the next 48 hours.
What?<eos> Is it Jewish?<eos> It's... it's Ukrainian, ma'am.<eos> It's all... this is all very sad.<eos> It is, but thank you for your time.
I'd like a cheeseburger, medium, with cheddar cheese, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, and tomato.<eos> And some curly fries.<eos> Crispy.<eos> Ms. Morse I'm your only ally here.<eos> There's no one else to help you, nowhere to run.
She saw an opening and...<eos> Ma'am, there's been a change of plans.<eos> Uh, hold on.<eos> What change of plans?<eos> We're taking you back to the White House.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, it's hurting my... Oi!<eos> I can't feel my...<eos> Principal Skinner?<eos> What brings you on this mission to make mankind a two-planet species?
Good morning, Mrs. Rose.<eos> Here's your name tag.<eos> Oh, bless you, dear, but a name tag does not go with this ensemble.<eos> Oh, it's just so people know who you are.<eos> Not that people won't know, when they see you in that outfit.
It does.<eos> Please log on immediately.<eos> Okay...<eos> Jocelyn has made allusions to certain... Sensitive photographs from my past.<eos> Uh, are you sure you don't want me to just leave you to do this on your own?
Sherry?<eos> Thank you.<eos> They say you know you're getting older when policemen start to look younger, but I think, in my case, it's undergrads.<eos> Coming through the quad there, it's... hard to believe I was ever here at all.<eos> It was funny, seeing you through the window, you had that same look on your face the first time I ever saw you.
Trying to get this house in order 'fore Avery take it in his own hands, you know?<eos> You're a bright guy, Dan.<eos> Real bright.<eos> Everybody in this house recognizes that.<eos> But I'm gonna be honest with you.
They would literally kick me out of my own home.<eos> Can I talk about the elephant in the room for a second?<eos> I wish you wouldn't. I look across from me and I don't see a monster.<eos> I see a human being fighting to control the animalistic parts of his brain, true grit overcoming impulse.<eos> Not everybody judges you.
"And the false prophet<eos> "shall be tormented by day and by night for ever and ever."<eos> It's like I said a prayer and there you were.<eos> Thank you, Padre.<eos> And now my sergeant here will escort you from my crime scene.
And now... I am lost.<eos> No, no.<eos> God doesn't give up that easily.<eos> I'm past penance, so what do you suggest?<eos> I think... ..that you should love yourself, as much as He loves you.
Padma, you cannot call off the wedding!<eos> I have already paid a large dowry to Dhiraj's family!<eos> But it would be wrong to marry someone I do not love.<eos> The one I love is Brian.<eos> Sir, what if I were to repay you for all you've spent?
- No.<eos> Your hair... it's a new cut, isn't it ?<eos> No.<eos> Why ?<eos> Is something bothering you ?
It's a risk we had to take.<eos> But he had the opportunity once before, and he let her go.<eos> I don't think he's meant to kill her.<eos> Who put him on the Quinjet?<eos> I did while Coulson was keeping you distracted.
I won 90 quid.<eos> Davy shouldn't really have been in Aberdeen.<eos> I didn't mention it before because I didn't want to incriminate him.<eos> You're seeing something that isn't there.<eos> I've got a witness that places you near the connecting door to the car deck in the middle of the night.
As far as Waldron was concerned, the case against him was closed.<eos> Who knows what was going on in his head?<eos> I was downstairs at the Abbott's Lane address and didn't witness the incident at the upstairs bedroom.<eos> Authorised firearms officer Victor Charlie 52,<eos> Victor Charlie 53, Victor Charlie 54, in my view, you have failed to give a plausible account of the events leading up to the death of Sergeant Daniel Waldron and, therefore, I am arresting you on suspicion of his murder.
I began to know my own mind.<eos> Before this, everything used to frighten me, but now, in spite of all this, I'm not so afraid.<eos> I'm of some use.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Well? General Lowe thanks you for your advice regarding the collection and burial of civilian bodies,
And you've had one too many.<eos> Okay. Positions, please.<eos> Welcome, Mr. Seavers.<eos> $3 million in cash. We'll secure your money.<eos> In the meantime, your seat and chip stack are waiting for you.
But don't go too far. You'll be hearing from me.<eos> I wouldn't dream of it.<eos> Listen, Garroway, do you think I'm trying to be a pain in your ass?<eos> Well, the thought had occurred to me.<eos> Dude, we've got your car wrapped around a street light, drenched in blood, carrying a GPS that puts you at the scene of the crime.
Jokes are never telling.<eos> They're jokes.<eos> Well, Holy Father, first of all, a small piece of information of a practical and picturesque nature...<eos> Under your desk, on the right, you will find a button.<eos> If you feel that an encounter is becoming disagreeable or a waste of time, all you have to do is to press it discreetly, and an assistant will swiftly appear with some excuse, liberating you from your engagement.
And that you're a nothing.<eos> Nothing!<eos> Your Holiness Pius XIII...<eos> Tell me about my parents.<eos> Your parents left you at the orphanage, saying they couldn't keep you any more because they had to go to Venice.
With the silence.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you should never stick your nose into other people's business.<eos> Especially not in the Vatican.<eos> The Prime Minister of Greenland is waiting for you.
I haven't said anything to the Cardinal Secretary of State.<eos> Thank you so much, Sister Mary.<eos> Monsignor, I forgive you for having betrayed our confidences to the Cardinal Secretary of State.<eos> Your Holiness, how did you find out?<eos> I forgive you for being an alcoholic and I recommend you stop drinking now that you're about to set off on a challenging mission to America.
Holy Father, I've already destroyed those pictures.<eos> It's true, I was thinking of using old, violent methods, but I repented in time, Holy Father.<eos> I repented before I could sin.<eos> The wonderful words that you said to that young woman illuminated me.<eos> I implore you, forgive me.
We all have to get used to new things, Holy Father.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> - Yes, yes you're right, Peter.<eos> Valente, was there something you wanted to tell me?<eos> Holy Father, the Italian Prime Minister is waiting for you in the Vatican.
I don't know, Jennifer.<eos> Holy Father, reliable sources say that the Kurtwell investigation is at a standstill.<eos> They say that you've sent a man with no experience to conduct that investigation because you don't actually want to investigate.<eos> And there's a very specific reason for that:<eos> Kurtwell is blackmailing you.
They say that you've sent a man with no experience to conduct that investigation because you don't actually want to investigate.<eos> And there's a very specific reason for that:<eos> Kurtwell is blackmailing you.<eos> Is that true, Holy Father?<eos> And what is Kurtwell blackmailing you about?
So you are from Almendralejo.<eos> And how did you find the place after all these year?<eos> - The same.<eos> - Changed.<eos> The first challenge in a marriage is staying united with someone who thinks the opposite of you in everything.
Sorry.<eos> Who is this fella?<eos> Me... I am Master Hashimoto's inte... intelligence agent.<eos> Captain Hashimoto.<eos> Chief Higashi is looking for you.
Why's that, ma'am?<eos> Why you're under the weather, aren't you?<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> I am so sorry to be bothering you when you're not feeling well.<eos> Thank you so, so much for all your help.
And I have to assume you wondered what type of leader you'd be.<eos> Well, my instinct tells me you'd be a great one.<eos> And I'm willing to give you the chance to find out.<eos> What would I be doing, exactly?<eos> Well, I envision you as a kind of cultural ambassador to young people.
- Hi, Frank.<eos> Um, we've been, uh, looking over similar cases... legal precedents, and, uh... we... we think it would help to bring forth someone from your past... maybe from your... your military unit, someone who could, uh... speak to the nature of your service.<eos> - What's that got to do with anything?<eos> - Um... it's a character witness.<eos> Uh, we put someone on the stand who... who knows you well. Uh, can... can speak to what you've been through.
We'll nail him.<eos> Until then, I'm just glad you agreed to accept police protection.<eos> I appreciate the offer.<eos> All right, the car's outside.<eos> Powell and Reed will escort you to a safe location.
Again, I'm sorry that you got caught in the crossfire, Mr. Morningstar.<eos> Oh, it's just a graze. I hardly felt it.<eos> And call me Lucifer.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Thank you again for all of your help.
It's not just a secret identity to me.<eos> I almost did something today that I would've regretted the rest of my life.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> My friends.<eos> The DEO keeps you human.
Give us this day our daily bread...<eos> You're laundering god only knows how much money.<eos> God forgives me all my sins!<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't forgive you.
JT, I never called you that, not even when we were dating.<eos> I mean, please, a hot job offer out of the blue?<eos> It's got to be a trap.<eos> Give me this.<eos> No. Mr. Forbes will meet you at Il Cantuccio in one hour.
But I'm afraid you fail to understand, Bishop.<eos> I was talking about you.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> Oh, I know you don't.<eos> But soon, Bishop James Greenleaf, soon enough. Yes, soon, Lord, that sun of righteousness will rise on you like a fiery furnace and you'll be longing for the days when all I did was call you out.
Can I refresh your coffee, Pastor?<eos> I still got some, but thank you.<eos> May I?<eos> Please.<eos> So, Bishop's really icing you out, huh?
So, how are you finding Canberra, Ambassador?<eos> Cold.<eos> Yes.<eos> You never really get used to it.<eos> Minister, this is gonna feel tropical, compared to the fuckin' freezer the White House is gonna put you in.
- We'll ask for a reschedule.<eos> - But it's her birthday tomorrow.<eos> - Please, it's my only chance to wish her happy birthday.<eos> - I understand your concern...<eos> - Why don't I get back to you tomorrow, than?
You're being detained.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> We believe you have information related to a terrorist offense.<eos> We have a warrant to detain you for up to 168 hours.<eos> After which time, we can release you.
If you're handing me court papers, can't we safely say your life is unmanageable?<eos> Thank you for that. In the meantime, I'd appreciate if you signed the papers.<eos> Or, if you have a problem with that, I could go to some other meeting.<eos> You will stay in my meeting.<eos> And since you don't have a license, I'll drive you here every day myself.
All units, withdraw!<eos> It's over.<eos> The strongest will prevail.<eos> - Where's my son?<eos> - Your wife and your child call to you.
It's already off the cliff!<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Take the rope.<eos> Tie it off.<eos> Do you want me to help you? Let me take this for you.
Your father has it?<eos> Yeah. Him. That's my father.<eos> Test his DNA. He has it, too.<eos> That's why Connor took her.<eos> Agent Pritchard, I'm relieving you of duty effective immediately.
She's a Pritchard.<eos> Gracie has the genetic precursor.<eos> Where is she?<eos> ! I know where Gracie is.<eos> Agent Pritchard, I'm relieving you of duty effective immediately.
You want me to get a DNA sample of the blood from an elf ear?<eos> No, he tried to grab it back.<eos> I want you to run this bloody fingerprint right here.<eos> Swelling's gone down nicely.<eos> Now, don't be surprised if someone mistakes you for your daughter.
- Then how do we explain his DNA turning up?<eos> When I went to lure him in, someone arrived.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - His father.<eos> Alan Wells, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Jesse Wells.
But I'd say:<eos> "I have."<eos> "He's tough,"<eos> "he's big.<eos> If you don't watch out, he'll come and get you."
They've been fumbling with rulings on it since the Nixon administration.<eos> And that was the president who let all the water out of that gate!<eos> This hand sanitizer is not meant for humans.<eos> I know what I have to do!<eos> So I ask you, sir, please, please do something about this.
- His hands work...<eos> Both of them.<eos> I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> I put my top guys on your personal detail.<eos> They've been running full-spectrum surveillance on you, tailing you here, and your apartment, to your wife's place, and despite your concerns, there doesn't appear to be anyone following you.
There were so many.<eos> I know.<eos> We're trying to keep it discreet.<eos> No point in spreading panic.<eos> What took you up there?
Don't get me wrong.<eos> I mean, I love the man, but he's not exactly spiritual.<eos> If you love him, why kill his wife?<eos> Well, now that is a... somewhat long, complicated story.<eos> Even if I were to tell you, I don't... think that you could comprehend it.
A boyfriend? No.<eos> No boyfriend.<eos> - It's for my dad.<eos> - Tight, tight.<eos> Well, I could take you over there personally.
- Seriously?<eos> - Morning, ma'am.<eos> Will somebody wake up Mike?<eos> Or not. What's the difference?<eos> Ma'am, last night I ran a flash poll on presidential scholars. They have rated you the 43rd most effective president ever.
There are gonna be a lot of opinions flying around.<eos> The CDC's credibility took a few hits during the Ebola crisis.<eos> Social media is gonna break this before we do, and once the media gets hold of it, well, we're gonna need a face, a man of the people, someone they inherently want to trust.<eos> This is in your zone.<eos> These people know you.
You keep this on.<eos> Yeah, yeah. We'll be there.<eos> My guy's at the data center now, but he's only gonna be there another 20 minutes.<eos> He got tickets to the damn baseball game, if you can believe it.<eos> And this guy just lets you in. No badge, no warrant, nothing.
And you can use the cart as a walker, take some pressure off your foot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Truly.<eos> You're one of the good ones.<eos> Don't let this place convince you otherwise.
That's funny.<eos> I see three tickets out of here for you and your family.<eos> _ I'm nowhere near having a vaccine, - and you know it.<eos> - I said you were working on one.<eos> That's the only reason they're protecting you.
Somebody's got to put a bullet in the man's head.<eos> You and your guys can be first in line for a vaccine.<eos> I'm nowhere near having a vaccine, and you know it.<eos> I said you were working on one.<eos> That's the only reason I'm protecting you.
Klaus Frommer?<eos> Perfect.<eos> Have a seat and roll up your sleeve, please. Thank you.<eos> Good to meet you, Frommer.<eos> How have they been treating you here, everything all right?
No, thanks, Elliott.<eos> Um, I'm fine.<eos> So, what have you found out about my deal with Jonathan? Is getting out an option?<eos> Because I'm officially worried.<eos> I've gone over the paperwork, and if Jonathan stops paying you, we can sue for breach of contract and get you out.
- Sorry. - Thank you<eos> I'm here because my husband is being a real a-hole, pardon my French, and I need an even bigger a-hole to put him in his place.<eos> You seem to fit the bill.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> It is ridiculous and illegal for your husband to treat you like this.
I've had the most incredible night.<eos> Sometimes the Lord does smile on us, doesn't He?<eos> He certainly does.<eos> Hallelujah.<eos> I've been watching you. You seem so...
I suppose we could use some general help.<eos> - Errands, tidying.<eos> - That's wonderful.<eos> And in time that might become actual nursing.<eos> Dr Margo will see you now.
All in good time.<eos> I said no back roads.<eos> Change of plan.<eos> Nearest station's Polk Avenue.<eos> They can charge you for impersonating a police officer. That's you back inside.
Losing my son's trial, for one.<eos> I haven't lost anything yet.<eos> How exactly do you plan on winning this when our only alibi in the morgue?<eos> - You did this. - Excuse me?<eos> She was terrified of you.
- Annalise, I need you to stay calm.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Tell me!<eos> We haven't been able to find a heartbeat, but that doesn't mean that this is over.<eos> Okay, babies at this stage are resilient, which is why we're taking you into the O.R. right now.
What did you just say?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Frank told me... that he killed Lila because you asked him to do it.<eos> Which makes all the sense in the world... that you started all of this.<eos> Sam was cheating on you with a younger woman.
I understand.<eos> Let us arrange to have him returned to our control.<eos> I'm afraid it's not that simple.<eos> So bin Rashid is already gone?<eos> I'm sending you home, Mr. Ambassador, with a letter of protest to your government.
I feel sorry for you.<eos> Two years.<eos> That's all you're gonna get in here.<eos> You're not gonna last any longer than Walker did.<eos> And what kills you is that I'll make a great president.
Out of respect...<eos> for the gravity of this situation.<eos> I think your intention is to humiliate me.<eos> You've been properly clothed, offered food.<eos> How are we humiliating you?
Because you know that all of this has to be done behind closed doors.<eos> We need to give the appearance that we neutralized ICO.<eos> What happens if they don't release the hostages?<eos> Well, then you go back to Cuba.<eos> If they do, then we put you on the phone with them... and you tell them to release the third.
'You're someone who speaks your mind.<eos> 'He means you're a dangerous woman.'<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - He means how do we feel about that?<eos> He means that when the tabloids come for you, they take you down.
'He means you're a dangerous woman.'<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - He means how do we feel about that?<eos> He means that when the tabloids come for you, they take you down.<eos> They take you round the corner and they kill you.
- Thank you.<eos> - He means how do we feel about that?<eos> He means that when the tabloids come for you, they take you down.<eos> They take you round the corner and they kill you.<eos> And then they kill you again.
- Suntan lotion.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.<eos> Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation. And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.<eos> What if I told you I will put you in an airplane back to the United States tonight?
How do you know about my daughters?<eos> And they are special to you?<eos> I want to send you home tonight. To be with your daughters.<eos> But first I need to know the truth about everything.<eos> About Milo, about the boat. Then I promise I will send you home, far away from here.
You okay with that?<eos> Um... uh, yes.<eos> Yeah, of course, thank you.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Well, you better not, or I'll take you down along with your husband.
It didn't define who I am.<eos> You don't appear sad.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to contradict the fact that you are sad.<eos> Only you know how you feel.<eos> But your colleagues, your friends at work, I get the idea that they see you as the life and soul of the party.
It might be relevant.<eos> I'll mention it.<eos> Mr. Tattersall?<eos> I'm Sergeant Cawood.<eos> If you want to give me a few brief details I can pass your information on to CID, and somebody'll contact you.
How about 17 rue de Foss?<eos> Bien sûr<eos> Where are you from, then?<eos> San Diego, California.<eos> And what brings you to Paris?
Her eyes are so pretty, though.<eos> I'm almost wondering, what if you don't do any eyeliner at all?<eos> Well, we've got to do something to draw attention away from that chin.<eos> I said don't move.<eos> Or do you want me to strap you into this chair?
Specifically, the Hermes scarf that was sent over by the hospital.<eos> So what did you do with it?<eos> Who do you think you are, lady?<eos> I came here as a courtesy, and you're gonna accuse me of misconduct?<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything.
It's not possible to answer that question responsibly.<eos> Spike, welcome aboard.<eos> All right.<eos> I wish you worked a little harder on the delivery, Spike.<eos> I'll never let you down again, sir.
You... admit to stealing the mind-files?<eos> We bought them on the black market at the behest of some very important people in our government.<eos> I have the letters sanctioning it. Look, you-you should be happy that we have them.<eos> Imagine our enemies with a cabal of our best minds working around the clock, figuring out ways to harm this country.<eos> The letters that you have... Did they authorize you to murder Eloise Carlisle?
Sir, please hold right there.<eos> - Are you Brian Finch? - Yeah.<eos> He's positive.<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> - What the hell? Under 42 CFR 70, we're placing you into quarantine.
I almost had the cuffs open when they pulled the truck over.<eos> Hey, did I forget to mention that there are people looking for me, you know?<eos> Americans, you know.<eos> We tend to be tenacious.<eos> Mr. Lavrov invites you to leave our country immediately.
Are you all right?<eos> You look like you could use some rest.<eos> Andrew Inouye!<eos> Willing to ask the tough questions.<eos> I can see why they call you "Greenland's favorite son."
I once did an x-ray on a guy after he had surgery.<eos> Surgeon left a latex glove inside his stomach.<eos> - How do you leave a glove inside?<eos> - I don't know, he found a way.<eos> Well, thank you very much... for your time, and if anything else comes to mind about this morning, just give me a call.
What is she doing here?<eos> I want to see her.<eos> The evidence suggests that she killed Vince.<eos> We believe that you knew about the murder and tried to protect her.<eos> We're charging you as an accessory after the fact.
I don't want it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't even want you here.<eos> Mr. Miller, we're ready for you.<eos> Thank you so much.
I really do, but I gave you explicit instructions not to follow me.<eos> Well, I had a hunch, and it paid off.<eos> You and your son are alive because of it.<eos> And I appreciate it, once again.<eos> Whoever tried to kill you won't stop because we thwarted one attempt.
Okay, this is gonna take the sting off.<eos> You must feel like a rechargeable battery right now.<eos> We need to get him upstairs so can interrogate the device.<eos> Where is the microfilm?<eos> Simon, Dr. Bell is gonna get you upstairs and, uh, check some data on your pacemaker.
Just having second thoughts.<eos> My sister wants me to... meet somebody, and she says that I'm not doing it here.<eos> She has big plans for me out west.<eos> But I'm not sure I want to go.<eos> Mind if I ask you what's holding you back?
I asked him to go to a meeting with me, that I'd even drive us there.<eos> But he ended the call, so I assumed that was my answer.<eos> If you try to warn her... I won't, I swear.<eos> This is Tanya Benton in client services.<eos> Please leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. This is too bad for you.
Hardly.<eos> All I do is bring you things to sign. Then take them away again.<eos> And so the wheels keep turning, and the business gets done, and the country is governed.<eos> But what's my personal contribution?<eos> You improve the quality of life for all that deal with you.
Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe Jessica knew about Mike Ross all along, in which case, maybe you would turn on her.<eos> Why don't you get the hell out of here before I turn on you? I will.<eos> But if I find out you resigned, that's evidence you're a co-conspirator.<eos> And I'll not only get you off this case. I'll put you behind bars along with your little pet.
Up here, in the maid's room.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We were gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> You seemed a tad... curt earlier.<eos> We were wondering if something might be troubling you?
She wouldn't have wanted us sobbing over her grave, wallowing in self-pity.<eos> I am trying to honour her memory.<eos> Then throw a party.<eos> Ma believed that life was meant to be lived!<eos> - Can I help you with that?
I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were the type of man that was willing to take risks.<eos> I am... but not if it puts people I care about in jeopardy, which is why I'm here to tell you that when Donna offers you her 401(k), you're gonna tell her you don't need it anymore.<eos> No offense, Mr. Specter, but what my daughter does with her money is none of your business.<eos> Well, it became my business when Donna put you so far up on a pedestal that she couldn't smell the bullshit you were dishing out.
On the grounds that it's completely fabricated.<eos> Where's your proof?<eos> Besides the fact that I actually went to Harvard, there's no way you could have contacted all of those people since last night.<eos> Then I suggest you call every one of these people and put 'em on the stand.<eos> But when you do, every single one of them is gonna look you in the eye and say, "Who the hell are you?"
Hand over the case file.<eos> I don't have to give you anything.<eos> You're not his attorney.<eos> Mr. Diaz, my name is Mike Ross.<eos> Now, do you want me to represent you or do you want to stick with this asshole Perkins who didn't even show up to your hearing?
Mm. The FBI raided their chamber of horrors-- killed one, captured some others.<eos> They'll talk.<eos> And when they do, they'll talk about you.<eos> So, my proposition is this.<eos> Do what I'm asking, do it now, and I'll make sure you go someplace quiet where the FBI will never find you.
I'm gonna sleepwalk my way in.<eos> Stella, this is Dr. Charles over at Chicago Med.<eos> I would like you to be aware that Grant left the hospital tonight without being discharged.<eos> I have no idea what his state of mind is.<eos> I don't want to alarm you.
Mayor Warren! Mayor Warren!<eos> Mayor Warren!<eos> Hey, Papa bear, you got a lot of supporters out there.<eos> People who vote.<eos> What do you say to the people who see you as a, uh, vigilante?
Bottom line...<eos> You're a one issue candidate.<eos> Your son was kidnapped.<eos> A terrible thing happened to you.<eos> But since when does that qualify you to govern a state?
Not much room for rational thinking.<eos> - Nope, not much.<eos> - Captain Tucker?<eos> I'm Chief Gabriel, incident commander.<eos> Hostage negotiation team can walk you through this.
A jewel thief?<eos> Oh, so you were a bad boy.<eos> I can't understand what you're saying.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Let's get you in the car, okay?
I work for the U...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Bassam has told me about you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> The United States is keeping an eye on you.
What happened earlier today, you challenging me in front of Army CID, that was unacceptable.<eos> I'm sorry, I... I wasn't...<eos> I wasn't trying to challenge you.<eos> Just don't let it happen again.<eos> I wasn't trying to challenge you, but you shouldn't have let them take Charlie.
It was out of my hands.<eos> If we hadn't let him go, he might still be alive.<eos> In this job, we all have to accept decisions that we don't agree with.<eos> It's called chain of command.<eos> Ma'am, they're ready for you upstairs.
I'm not here in any official way.<eos> I know they've been watching me.<eos> No.<eos> Please.<eos> The FBI is not watching you.
I know things, uh, didn't work out with you and Caleb, but I hope that we can still be friends.<eos> I see a lot of myself in you.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You know, you once told me that women get judged more harshly than men, so I don't want what Caleb's been up to to get out and blindside you.
Flora, you killed 6 truckers.<eos> Why not more?<eos> I got caught. No.<eos> No.<eos> You eluded the authorities for months before they found you holed up in that barn outside the city.
Please leave.<eos> Now. -Get back in your car, sir.<eos> -Oh, Jesus.<eos> You've got a gun on my girlfriend.<eos> Well, if your girlfriend joins you in your car, she'll be far away from the gun.
Oh. Well, don't ever become a spy.<eos> Sophia is falling apart down here.<eos> At least I didn't stand by idly.<eos> So, if you want to punish me for having a... a conscience, then, fine.<eos> I am not punishing you for your conscience.
Wait. Is this what I think it is?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> That is hilarious.<eos> Seriously, I can move a lot of these in my store.<eos> How about I hit you up on linkedln?
This is the home you and your ex share with your two children?<eos> Yes, yes, it is.<eos> Until she fell for that no good commie slut.<eos> Okay, you discover your employee's being deported.<eos> Moments later, your live-in partner of many years dumps you then runs off to city hall to marry this employee because they're "in love."
I'll be out by dinner. You're throwing your career away right now. I hope you know that.<eos> I don't care who your father is, you're done.<eos> No, sir, you are.<eos> I don't know what you think you have on me.<eos> I have a witness who knows everything about you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Dr. Daniel Charles, Chicago Med.<eos> Man, they sure are going after us these days, aren't they?<eos> You out on bail?<eos> I mean, why are they even charging you in the first place?
Is Tiffany okay?<eos> No. She's not.<eos> I mean, I knew something was wrong when she didn't return my phone calls, but...<eos> All right, start from the beginning.<eos> Tiffany was helping you with a cold case off the books, unrelated to ATF.
Well, I'll see you in a few seconds.<eos> All right, we got six more votes this morning.<eos> - Whoo!<eos> - We're never gonna close that gap.<eos> Well, on the less shitty side, people are really loving you and Charlie Baird.
Yeah.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning, ma'am.<eos> Madam President.<eos> What brings you here?
[grunting] -Sorry. The other thing.<eos> -[Todd] Okay.<eos> Hey. Goddammit!<eos> -[yelling] -I apologize for...<eos> I understand. Mind if I put you on hold one second?
You never saw me.<eos> On the phone.<eos> I don't want to talk to anybody.<eos> What I want is to have control over my own life. [engine starting]<eos> Which is why I'm begging you to please cancel my delivery of the L.A. Gazette.
Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?<eos> ! Yeah.<eos> [Bleep] 'em all.<eos> You admitted you didn't know how to run a country.<eos> You agreed people were supporting you just because they liked the new "Star Wars," and you begged me to help you lose!
Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization like we've never seen.<eos> Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.<eos> Well, what do they want me to do about it?<eos> You're the leader of the free world.<eos> Everyone is looking to you to be the calm and steady voice they all need.
I admire your courage for testifying so frankly here today.<eos> You lied to the police and to your friends. Is that your story?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not proud of it.<eos> You did so because your friends were taunting you that you hadn't scored?
I love the beach.<eos> "The end." That's it?<eos> 12 corpses wash up on the beach and that's not enough to keep you up at night?<eos> What can I say? I'm a chill dude.<eos> Well, since you're so chill, I guess it wouldn't surprise you to learn that all those people you said drowned actually overdosed on an illegal weight-loss drug.
I need you to go up on a cell phone for a Bobby or Robert Marks.<eos> See if you can find his last ping.<eos> Well, I have some good news and good news.<eos> Could you use either one of those right now?<eos> All your test results came back normal, so we're sending you home in a bit.
I'm not saying you have to be a writer.<eos> But you do have skills that would improve with a little hard work.<eos> I mean, why won't you even try?<eos> Because who wants to spend time doing something they aren't good at?<eos> I don't see you out there on the court playing basketball.
Simplifications.<eos> But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.<eos> Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?<eos> No.<eos> Because I know you.
Did they know what they hid from the media and the French people? They were not in contact with the terrorists for more than nine months?<eos> They did not appear?<eos> Monsieur Labarthe, not all want the hostages released.<eos> There are obstructionist forces ...<eos> The Secretary of State will meet you.
Are you okay?<eos> They are not too badly mauled?<eos> Clement var i bilen?<eos> -Gav the images to the media?<eos> -By the where they would lead you to?
We just wanted to delay it.<eos> Regardless of what information you give your minister so the gap in the polls too large to be closed.<eos> Chalamont winner.<eos> And what happens after the election?<eos> So I contact you to discuss your role in the organization.
That's ridiculous.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> So, are you?<eos> Mr. Carroll, no.<eos> Look, I don't know where this is coming from, but there's a hundred very important people waiting for you.
I'm... I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Josh would never have hurt his sister.<eos> - It had to be someone else.<eos> - Then why would he confess?<eos> No one is judging you, we're only trying to establish what happened.
The State Department puts out thousands of documents, feels like every day.<eos> Well, this is called<eos> The World in 2030, and I just...<eos> I have to tell you, it's not a pretty world, particularly for Myanmar, after we sign this trade agreement.<eos> What in particular about the trade agreement bothers you?
Ma'am.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> There's someone asking to see you.<eos> Can we tell Max Lord that I'm not at his beck and call?<eos> That's not who wants to see you.
But lucky for you, not a criminal.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's lying.<eos> He told you he tried to rescue your father.<eos> He told you he's protecting you.
Any idea who's in 15D?<eos> That gentleman right over there.<eos> Great.<eos> Mmm. Four inches of hairless chest.<eos> Let me bump you to first class.
The "man of the moment".<eos> Do come up.<eos> Will you sit?<eos> Following consultation with the government, the Foreign Office, and Her Majesty's press secretary, the decision has been taken to move forward your posting to Brussels with immediate effect.<eos> A car is waiting to take you first to your apartment, where you will pack, and then directly to the airfield.
No, no.<eos> No, no, no, it's... it... "R."<eos> Can... can you tell me if... if, uh, either of them were, uh, previously married?<eos> Uh, to a man.<eos> Thank you so much for your help.
Please. That's not a challenge.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Okay, well, what's it worth to you?<eos> Poor bastard.<eos> So, where has Interpol been hiding you?
For panic attacks?<eos> No, for stress.<eos> It... it's no big deal.<eos> Totally good otherwise.<eos> There's a patient for you in bed 2, and a Paul Weatherly is calling for you again.
You!<eos> You're in charge here, right?<eos> My daughter is in surgery.<eos> I want it stopped immediately.<eos> Actually, Mr. Benton, I was just coming to find you.
But how can I do that if my ministers lie and plot and hide the truth from me?<eos> You have prevented me from doing my duty.<eos> You have hampered and bamboozled the proper functioning of the Crown.<eos> How could you?<eos> My own late father valued you greatly.
You come to Chicago Med, you get me.<eos> Chart, please.<eos> You're in good hands.<eos> Honor to meet you.<eos> So... what brings you in here?
You are a dutiful agent, Mr. Garrett.<eos> And a man of faith.<eos> A catholic.<eos> You would have me disobey canon law and divulge information I learned in this sacred space that we are now in?<eos> I understand the position I'm putting you in.
Alissa.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> Nice to meet you, Alissa.<eos> How you doing?<eos> So, uh... so, Alissa, what takes you to Maui today?
You're in Wayward Pines.<eos> Attention, citizens of Wayward Pines.<eos> Due to recent rebel activity, curfew will begin in 25 minutes.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I told you. We're taking you to the hospital.
Well?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I knew that was the right tactic.<eos> You give me two more weeks, I'll give you Adolf Hitler.<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow and I won't see you again.
You're suing a sitting judge?<eos> Do you understand the meaning of professional suicide?<eos> I know the meaning of a judge who let an innocent man sit in prison - for eight months with a bail amount...<eos> - Did you miss the day in law school where they taught the concept of judicial immunity?<eos> That protects you from being sued for what you did professionally, not personally.
I hope this campaign isn't over tomorrow.<eos> I'd really like to get to know you, Alicia.<eos> Why?<eos> You're... interesting.<eos> You don't let things confuse you.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.<eos> That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.<eos> You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.<eos> So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.<eos> Would you like me to take you to see her?
Soon.<eos> This is a little sudden. I know, but would you back me if I said yes?<eos> If you win, what happens to you here?<eos> Well, I'd have to resign.<eos> Well, whoever replaces you won't know how we handle things.
Oh, I'm so glad I came.<eos> My husband's gonna think he's having an affair.<eos> And I might have one myself.<eos> Ms. Calvert?<eos> Dr. Forbes will see you now.
No. She loved Leslie.<eos> She just said so.<eos> We'll put her on ice for a little while.<eos> At least until we talk to her coworkers.<eos> Ma'am, I'm arresting you for breaking and entering.
We are sending the transmission between your pilot and the control tower.<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course we are very interested to hear the recording.<eos> I assure you that will conduct a thorough investigation and we keep you informed.<eos> Thank you, President Peng, and I will call you soon.
It's not the black guy.<eos> Just this week, I met with about a dozen companies.<eos> You're the first woman at the table.<eos> You're also the most successful.<eos> When they look at you, they see easy money.
My parents would kill me.<eos> Yeah. I understand.<eos> I can put it back for you.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Oh, man. I can't thank you enough.
In the flesh.<eos> NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.
Pavlenko came to you and your people, warning that the Russians tricked you into selling them Manta Ray.<eos> But it wasn't a trick, was it?<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> You just accused me of treason.<eos> Also accusing you of ordering your man Huxley to commit at least six murders.
Also accusing you of ordering your man Huxley to commit at least six murders.<eos> Are you arresting me?<eos> I'm a sick man, need medical attention.<eos> That's 'cause you poisoned yourself.<eos> You wanted us to find you in that cabin.
We're just gonna enact the plan that we set up for when you see an ankle boot you really, really, really like, right? What do we do?<eos> We walk away...<eos> And if I dream about it in the middle of the night, then it's meant to be.<eos> We're gonna walk away, Philip.<eos> Thank you so much for all your help.
In the flesh.<eos> NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.
Also accusing you of ordering your man Huxley to commit at least six murders.<eos> Are you arresting me?<eos> I'm a sick man, need medical attention.<eos> That's 'cause you poisoned yourself.<eos> You wanted us to find you in that cabin.
I was wondering if you'd care to join me there tomorrow lunchtime.<eos> Well, I have a WI meeting.<eos> The speaker runs a cattery in Painswick.<eos> Well, surely the WI can do without you for one day.<eos> No, I don't think I will. But thank you for the invitation all the same.
She was wearing a cardigan, same colour as that.<eos> Iris Lightman?<eos> Is that her name?<eos> Thank you, George.<eos> I'm sure we'll have you out of here very shortly.
No, not just by you.<eos> When I looked at Edie's flower arrangement, I realised mine would never be as good.<eos> And I think I've been punishing her for that ever since.<eos> That was very brave of you to say so.<eos> And God, I am sure, will forgive you.
I want to confess to the murder of Vera Blanchett... ..and to my role in a barbaric police cover-up.<eos> You what?<eos> I should have known it was too good to be true.<eos> Come now, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.
The so-called "48"" of the Ghost Mountain Triad.<eos> Everyone on this block pays you protection, Mr. Xi, there's no sense denying it.<eos> I do deny it.<eos> There's no one here named Xi.<eos> The department has been keeping an eye on you since June.
I know it's dreadful, but the stench would be much worse if Sven Eklund hadn't embalmed the body.<eos> What we wanted to talk to you about was why he stopped midway through that process to call you and why, just two hours later, he's getting his arm stitched up at Hamilton Hospital.<eos> And why, the very next day, he started photographing faces that would help him shoot up a Chinese Triad.<eos> Figuring out how those three things connected cost us a lot of sleep.<eos> You see, we now know why Sven was calling you.
I have no choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's all I remember.<eos> Then I woke up here.<eos> Okay, hey, fellas... these gentlemen are gonna get you to a hospital.
Come on back down if you need me.<eos> I don't think I will.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Thank you! - Enough!<eos> Look, my Mom inviting you over is a little too "Exorcist" for my taste, but I have questions and no one is willing to answer them.
Those bikes don't come with brakes.<eos> How I can I put on the brakes, when they can't?<eos> You're not making sense.<eos> I'll double it.<eos> The boss will chew you out if you don't write up that report.
I wonder what it was like to wake up to him every morning.<eos> You know he was involved with the Lobos murder, somehow.<eos> Now, I don't think he did any of the dirty work, not with those bespoke suits and all, but I bet he knows who pulled the trigger.<eos> I don't know what he knows, if he knows anything at all.<eos> You know this is a death penalty case, and you know a jury would eat you alive...
I had to.<eos> Catherine didn't give me a choice.<eos> Oh. What is it?<eos> You can go.<eos> The law will punish you.
Urgh! Arrest this man!<eos> He murdered Mrs Garrity and Nurse Fletcher!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Sergeant...!<eos> Malcolm Braithwaite, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murders of Doris Garrity and Peggy Fletcher.
Yes.<eos> What did it say?<eos> "If you don't confess, you will die today."<eos> Confess to what?<eos> Who's threatening you?
20 years.<eos> 20 years you guys have been coming in here with all these accusations against ol' Lucky Jack.<eos> Your problem is that none of you ever follow it up with the proof.<eos> So, unless you're here to buy a pair of crotchless panties for that special someone in your life, I suggest you grab your hat and your books, and you get the hell out of my store.<eos> See, that's how I know I'm gonna take you down.
- How exactly did you get the job?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> We're just talking now.<eos> - Well, I was headhunted.<eos> - Who headhunted you?
Yeah. - Like I thought.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Okay, look, you obviously believe you're a lawyer because... you play one on TV, and that's a little far to me.<eos> I like your style.<eos> You're a good man, you're a good attorney, but you got a brick chained to your ankle and it's holding you back.
Bye.<eos> Elmslie wants to meet at his apartment, and he sounds scared.<eos> That's not good.<eos> I need to get back to work- - Labelle has fired people for less.<eos> We're gonna talk to Elmslie first, and then if we don't need anything else, we'll release you.
- The problem is...<eos> - I don't want the job.<eos> I don't need the job.<eos> Look, I'm retired, okay?<eos> Well, thank you for considering it.
Everybody knows that.<eos> And you need a quick rebuild to get it.<eos> And we can do that.<eos> New York, it's a media cesspool just waiting to take you down.<eos> But Nola press and New Orleans Stingers fans will embrace you, especially with Charley and Micah by your side.
It is...<eos> I... I will have it in a moment.<eos> Oh, you'd better, old clanker!<eos> Keep an eye out for stowaway rebels.<eos> They get by on your watch, I'll put you in the melter myself.
Tell me the Italians came through. Big-time.<eos> The recording's authentic.<eos> Former hostage ID'd it as the voice of Jibral Disah.<eos> So we have a target?<eos> White House is expecting you.
Freshly squeezed.<eos> Yeah. Nice, nice.<eos> Bought myself a juicer.<eos> SkyMall.<eos> So what brings you to the poor part of town, Mr. Price?
You're shitting me.<eos> Mr. Alderson, you do realize Mr. Lenny Shannon's dog was an expensive purchase at $1,200?<eos> That makes your theft a felony.<eos> Let the record show, Mr. Alderson nodded his head up and down indicating "yes,"<eos> and you're admitting you hacked into Mr. Shannon's email, social media, and bank accounts, which will convict you on both counts of computer hacking?
Yes... and I plead guilty.<eos> Do you make this plea out of free will - and free mind?<eos> - No! No. He's fucking crazy.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Alderson, I declare you guilty of computer hacking, computer trespass, grand larceny of fourth degree. I hereby sentence you to 18 months in county jail.
So listen, this is gonna be your choice, but you need counsel that has your best interests at heart, so if I were you, I would call this firm.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I can't afford...<eos> - Yeah, you won't have to.<eos> You tell them that Oscar Vega sent you.
Where you been?<eos> Why don't you come around anymore?<eos> 'Cause your beautiful daughter broke up with me.<eos> Ah, women... Who can understand them?<eos> Hey, when am I gonna see you out on the links again?
See?<eos> Gabi, I don't want any part in this.<eos> - Come in, Mr. Kaminski.<eos> - It's happening!<eos> So, what brings you here today?
I loved Dan.<eos> I still do.<eos> It may sound pathetic, but I thought we still had a chance.<eos> Well, thank you for your time.<eos> We'll leave you alone, let you get some rest.
She's just another convict...<eos> This ankle monitor is a next-generation device with a variety of new tracking features.<eos> This is the instruction manual.<eos> Now, I could walk you through some of the features... What does he have to do with this?<eos> Uh, Detective Ryan's gonna accompany you to the bar he's...
Back off.<eos> I would look really cute in a little pillbox hat, though.<eos> Bet you would.<eos> That lady who was here earlier today, she left a message for you.<eos> "Meet me at this address in an hour, and I'll never bother you again after that.
Yeah.<eos> I'm not itching now.<eos> Arms up, please.<eos> And that should do it.<eos> An orderly will take you to a treatment room, and we'll go find you some clothes.
-Really?<eos> You play?<eos> -Swear to G-dash-D.<eos> Just play me a few bars. I can pick it up, follow along. Oh!<eos> Mr. Cameron, thank you so much.
I-I don't do drugs or drink Or anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's very hard to determine what causes the disorder.<eos> But it doesn't really matter in terms of treatment.<eos> Our first step will be to treat you To a heroic dose of antidepressants.
I could pull it off, right?<eos> No.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You think you're just going to sit there waiting on me to take you home?
For your information, the divorce papers aren't even drafted yet.<eos> Soon-to-be-ex-wife.<eos> Point is... if you're looking for a success story, it ain't Kevin.<eos> And where are you living these days, Bill?<eos> 'Cause I've been picking you up and dropping you off at your office almost like you're sleeping there, but that can't be true.
Not if contraband is in plain view.<eos> I spy with my little eye what looks like...<eos> explosive residue.<eos> We'll give you a couple of options.<eos> Either you talk, and maybe we can work out some kind of a deal, or we'll take you in right now on conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.
-Piggy?<eos> Give me those lashes! Mine!<eos> Mine!<eos> -Miss Piggy!<eos> No one is going to see you, anyway. You're not doing your show tonight.
(Southern accent):<eos> Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle. (quietly):<eos> Yes, do it, baby.<eos> "Vehicle"?<eos> What vehicle? The metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back. Oh.
Thank you.<eos> This place is great.<eos> - We do share an affinity for science.<eos> - We do.<eos> We don't get to see enough of you, Dr. Radford.
Kate had a baby boy she gave up for adoption.<eos> - Meet Charlie.<eos> - Go home.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without my kid.<eos> If I see you again, I put you in cuffs.
I know you didn't know this, 'cause you were smoking.<eos> You're pregnant.<eos> Mr. Warner, let's go.<eos> Do you have any idea how much I want to hurt you?<eos> We're not charging you for the attempt on your mother's life.
- What's "huh"?<eos> You and the governor are both wearing maroon ties.<eos> - Is that important?<eos> - Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery.<eos> So, Governor, why do you think the FBI is interested in you?
You will go to his home and bring me back a full, detailed report.<eos> Jemma Moore.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - What is this?<eos> Director Bennett will be contacting you shortly.
I'll tell you what, I don't like seeing people get cheated and lied to.<eos> I really like you, honey.<eos> Enough of them politicians.<eos> I'm gonna vote for you.<eos> Well, thank you so much.
Well, I'm a straight shooter too, Matt. So I'll lay it out.<eos> Do you think I came to you because I swooned over your ideals?<eos> No, I sought you out because I think with a little help, you can win this thing.<eos> But if I don't get some assurance that you appreciate my help, it's no big deal.<eos> I'll just throw my support behind Alderman Becks... and make damn sure he destroys you.
Patrol officers gave me an address at 324 E. 8th Street.<eos> - That's Ames apartment. - Right.<eos> And his cellmate two years ago was Johnny Zakarian.<eos> Find Peter Walker.<eos> Detective, the owner of Pure Green Medical is waiting for you. Really?
If you had any proof, you wouldn't be asking me questions.<eos> And let me clarify my relationship.<eos> I let him cuddle, but that was it.<eos> Must be real proud of the way you played him, hmm?<eos> What happens when the people who burned down Johnny Zakarian find you?
And let me clarify my relationship.<eos> I let him cuddle, but that was it.<eos> Must be real proud of the way you played him, hmm?<eos> What happens when the people who burned down Johnny Zakarian find you?<eos> Because we will toss you back on the street wrapped in a bow.
Lisbon, Maine.<eos> All the way from Maine?<eos> I had cousins in Lisbon.<eos> They were very sweet girls.<eos> So, what brings you to Jodie?
An Owen Dixon.<eos> Once an operative for...<eos> Wynnewood Security Services.<eos> Yes, I remember him.<eos> Justine knew that Dixon blamed you for what happened to his unit.
He said just one thing before he left.<eos> He asked me where you lived.<eos> I told him your home address.<eos> Didn't he visit you?<eos> Did I put you in an awkward position by asking you for that favor?
Look at you!<eos> Pop-Pop's little Dale Evans!<eos> Dale Evans was a movie cowgirl back in the '50s.<eos> She wrote the song "Happy Trails"<eos> and I used to sing that to you when you were on the potty, when we were saying good-bye to your poops!
CNO on the bridge.<eos> You get the go from POTUS?<eos> He understands the importance of what we're doing here but has requested proof-of-life videos.<eos> It's a morale boost for back home.<eos> Land team's waiting for you.
I would like to see my wife... my son.<eos> Good evening, Mr. President.<eos> Commander Green.<eos> The President would like to keep these briefings to senior advisors for the time being.<eos> We'll summon you if we need you.
- We all go through bad stretches. Oh.<eos> No, I'm not going through a bad stretch.<eos> Then my language was too strong. It's just that when I hear that someone of your caliber is living here and there, I wonder if I can be of assistance.<eos> I appreciate it, but I don't think teaching's my future.<eos> But thank you so much.
That was a long time ago.<eos> Yeah. Not many laughs now.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't make you laugh now?<eos> The wife of someone you're prosecuting for corruption doesn't amuse you?
Are you making fun of me?<eos> I promise I am taking you very seriously.<eos> We found these in your place.<eos> Kayla is my friend.<eos> Kayla doesn't know you, Brandon.
Do you mind if I hang on to this?<eos> You know, you didn't need to bring an attorney, Ms. Monahan.<eos> Far as we know, you're not in any trouble.<eos> If Vincent Bader's all right, no crime has been committed.<eos> I'm going to cut you off, Detective.
Today, the name of Escobado comes to an end.<eos> Let Roman take the prize.<eos> Buy his friendship with my head.<eos> Mr. Danvers.<eos> I haven't seen you in a long while.
Of course, I came. I believe in yo...<eos> I believe in Furguson.<eos> Is that offer a joke?<eos> Huh?<eos> Because I will feed you to my eagle.
...preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Mr. President, you're gonna have to come with me now.<eos> Mrs. Kirkman, the Secret Service will take you up to the residence now.
James hasn't... He hasn't been interested, I guess is the word.<eos> This has been a very difficult transition for him--for both of us.<eos> He feels nothing' down there, so...<eos> So... you're actually here for more than an explanation.<eos> Well, I did read up on you, and I know that you're not one to back down from a challenge, so I suppose what I'm askin'-- really, begging-- you for is... some kind of hope.
And I'm, um... I'm worried that you still might be a suicide risk.<eos> - And if you insist on leaving...<eos> - I do. I'm going to have to place you under a temporary psychiatric hold.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Well, Earl here is going to take you someplace quiet. - I... - And hopefully we can talk.
She didn't infect anyone.<eos> She's still within the incubation period.<eos> You saved the town, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> Maybe they'll appreciate you for it.
With respect...<eos> - With respect, Adrian, he's a big boy.<eos> He knows we're being relieved in two days.<eos> He'll come back when he remembers that and realises just how many STDs he's racked up.<eos> Last thing I need is even more of you buggering off to indulge yourselves.
Sit.<eos> We don't have long.<eos> What?<eos> Take a seat, Mr Gettrick.<eos> You are not a stupid man, so I will not treat you as such.
If you exploit him for ratings, our lawyers will bury you.<eos> There are two versions of the story.<eos> And one, the Army took your technology and used it to massacre a million people. And the other, Phenotrans built Afterlife from the ground up.<eos> Which do you think I should go with?<eos> When Lyons comes for you, you're going to need friends.
But next time, let's do... dinner and a movie?<eos> Lyons won't stop.<eos> Best case scenario... he kills our customers and doesn't get caught.<eos> Worst case... he finds a way to frame us for it. Decides he doesn't need us anymore. Puts us in whatever shallow grave he dug for those reporters.<eos> You think he'd kill you?
I used to be a Catholic priest.<eos> Became involved?<eos> We were in love.<eos> I asked her to marry me, to start a new life together.<eos> But she turned you down?
If you wanna ask me about Normandy's finances, I'm happy to answer any questions. But this line of questioning<eos> I'm - - I'm not very comfortable with.<eos> Well, we have Otto's bank records here.<eos> Money going from his account into yours.<eos> It's only matter of time before we connect you to Billy.
I am sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> Are... are you crying?<eos> I am just so grateful to you.<eos> I don't know you, but... perhaps you know what it is like to love someone with every atom in your body, to be so intertwined with him for most of your life.
What would it have to do with you?<eos> May be one of my old cases; I'm not sure yet.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes...<eos> Well, that's all you're doing.<eos> I don't blame you, but I need you to back off, funny feeling or not.
But how serious is it?<eos> I'm...<eos> Only time will tell.<eos> If it gets worse, you need surgery.<eos> But for the moment, we just wait and see, and we watch you very closely.
I wanted to call my wife before, but they took my phone.<eos> No one's allowed to make outgoing calls.<eos> They even took my phone. I have to call her.<eos> She might think I'm not calling because they took me or something, por favor.<eos> I promise we're gonna get you home as soon as we can, okay?
Who's the terrorist in this scenario, Dina?<eos> That suit you're wearing.<eos> Eh, no one's a terrorist.<eos> Again, you don't have to be here.<eos> Oh, I'm not gonna leave you alone with these two monsters.
The few remaining doses will be given to Westerners, no doubt?<eos> Don't bother to answer, Madam Secretary.<eos> We both know how this game is played.<eos> Yes.<eos> For the greater good, on behalf of the government of Cameroon, you have my permission and we thank you for your effort.
So really I have two choices - I either resign from public life or produce a sudden success so you can claim a glorious victory.<eos> Well, technically, yes, although I'm assuming the second option is completely unrealistic at this point and certainly beyond your power to control it anyway.<eos> So that only leaves... ..resignation.<eos> Or a completely ruined reputation.<eos> The state's corruption watchdog has you in their crosshairs.
Think about it.<eos> Give me that.<eos> And tell us how heather lutz paid for all this work. Wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Heather wasn't paying you, was she?
No.<eos> Can i just say i lost my father when i was 11, And i'd have been lucky to have somebody like julio step in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's say you're a child who loses a father.<eos> Julio fosters you, then gets himself killed.
I'll stay. You go home.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> My husband, he's... having issues.<eos> So, you'll turn yourself in tomorrow at noon. Alicia will come with you.<eos> They will process you and release you on a signature bond.
What?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> I don't understand what just happened.<eos> What... You're a valuable asset.<eos> The Canadians want you for themselves.
Why don't you call my office and check with them?<eos> - Do you have their number?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> Um, can... can you give to me?<eos> Sorry, I'm, uh... I think I'm losing you.
- There you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> Can I help you with your bag?
Bobby was the divorce lawyer for her parents.<eos> Why?<eos> What does this have to do with Brie Miller?<eos> Please stay where you are, Mrs. Cushing. Someone will...<eos> someone will join you shortly. One second.
Hello.<eos> I'm fine, don't worry.<eos> Oh. Hi, James.<eos> How long am I gonna be dead?<eos> Until we find out if anyone else wants to kill you.
Sorry to upset you, and I...<eos> I didn't pick you specifically. I looked for every Jennifer, Jen, Jenny Edwards or Edwards as a maiden name on Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook.<eos> Well, I'm the lucky winner, then.<eos> What did Gene say to you about me?<eos> Gene is using you as an alibi.
The statute of limitations...<eos> Has expired on the number of times you knocked Jennifer around.<eos> Yes, her statement about the watch, taken with the partials, and denying your alibi...<eos> Very bad.<eos> So the terms of our conversation have changed... Because two murders doesn't just jerk you out of Kern and throw you into Pelican Bay.
- Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Miss beisel. Mr. Davidson.<eos> How are you?<eos> I haven't seen you since... The tragedy at the race.
Demonstrate expert control in extreme circumstances on and off the track.<eos> Here!<eos> Oh, what a show.<eos> What a show!<eos> Mr. Carlisle, we'll be expecting a visit from you when we get back about securing a sizable loan.
Oh, Pierce, there you are.<eos> Wanted to see about getting you in on an elective VATS in the morning.<eos> Uh, yeah, absolutely.<eos> That is a two-hander, so let's do it. Mm.<eos> I'll put you down for 9:30, yeah? - Mm-hmm.
I'll take her up.<eos> - By yourself?<eos> - Go!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, Gretchen, as soon as the elevator gets here, we're gonna take you up and take care of you, all right?
He wants you to see it.<eos> Did he pull it out, or did you?<eos> I helped.<eos> All right, we'll get you to CT first and then up to O.B.<eos> Uh, the kids can meet you there.
Why didn't you? Erm...<eos> There were times where she wanted to be left alone.<eos> You rang her.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> You didn't think it was strange when she didn't call you back?
So you're a writer?<eos> Yes, which is why when I heard about your case, - I just had to come in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Um... we don't do interviews.<eos> So I'll, uh, get an officer and he'll escort you...
Okay, well, who is this mystery partner?<eos> That's what we need to know.<eos> And we needed you to look like a free man so we could draw your partner out.<eos> - My charges have been dismissed.<eos> - About that. We found new evidence that'll put you away for good.
I'm sorry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Gomez, please come in.<eos> The doctor will see you now.
Previously on Bitten...<eos> I know every wolf in this territory - and I do not know you.
I know every wolf in this territory - and I do not know you.<eos> - Elena, I am your father.<eos> I have been tracking a very dangerous Russian Mutt.<eos> Sasha Antonov.<eos> I haven't seen you in a long while.
Indeed I was.<eos> I have half a mind to sue him for stealing my song.<eos> What do you think my odds are on that there, Kenny-Ken?<eos> You gotta leave him alone.<eos> Okay, if I record you, you have to stop.
- Yes.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Then I'm in... yeah, I'm in the right room.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I'm sorry. I just didn't recognize you.
Emma Harris?<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.<eos> Come in, it's freezing out here.<eos> So, what brings you all the way out here?
We were never this motivated.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Blaustein, just calling to make sure I've got your support for the BTA.<eos> Yes, that thing that Frannie did.<eos> Yes, splendid.<eos> I won't let you down.
He'd become the new Asher.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I could encrypt the firm's files, update your firewalls.<eos> That way, no one like me could hack you.
A quick hug?<eos> Am I, am I really in danger?<eos> We don't think Kang is who he says he is.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> We think he may be using you to pass along information to a foreign agency.
Just send me somewhere that has flights back to my base in Sao Paulo.<eos> The U.S. base in Sao Paulo was decommissioned.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Look, I've got to get back - to my commanding officer.<eos> - Just tell me where home is, and I'll send you there.
- Just tell me where home is, and I'll send you there.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I want to go back to my unit.<eos> You don't have parents, family?<eos> Wherever there are people waiting for you,
If Seeley gives me a penalty shot rematch, we can finally settle this debate.<eos> There's no debate.<eos> I took the shot, it went in, we won, you lost, life goes on.<eos> But if you give me a rematch, I'll tell you why I was there.<eos> Or you could just tell us why you were there, and we won't arrest you for impeding an investigation.
Now he's saying, "Why don't you come here yourself?"<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Yeah, hold on, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I beg your pardon?<eos> You're a sergeant, you're often desk-bound.<eos> Difficult to effect any real change, though not for the Midnight Ranger.<eos> Perhaps you thought an alliance with him was an attractive idea.<eos> Look, no one is accusing you of anything, okay?
They're meant to carry extra ammunition.<eos> Before you shot Mike, there was a struggle, and he ripped this from your belt.<eos> It was a coincidence, an armored man being shot by armor-piercing bullets.<eos> They weren't meant for him. They were meant for your tormentors at Superlative Comics.<eos> You wanted to be able to shoot through furniture, you wanted to be able to shoot through other people, through anything and everything that stood between you and them.
And you save the world.<eos> Bye.<eos> In 100 feet, stay to the left.<eos> Drive through the gate.<eos> The security guard will wave you through.
Not for any political or ideological reason, he just wants to see a city burn.<eos> And you're letting it happen.<eos> Now you're grasping. Am I?<eos> Ask yourself one question.<eos> Am I more helpful here, mentally preparing a report to the subcommittee that's gonna haul you in, or out there, catching Rawdon?
- No talk.<eos> Okay. You got it.<eos> No talk.<eos> Is Rodrigo here?<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
Okay.<eos> How 'bout we get a divorce?<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll make it even easier for you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm here.<eos> You did? Great.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Okay, thank you so much.
God, why didn't you say anything?<eos> Don't go into the light!<eos> Mr. Bender!<eos> There you are.<eos> Everyone has been looking for you, so let's get you in there.
You have to help us!<eos> Shelly.<eos> I'm gonna make you a promise right now.<eos> I'm gonna find out what's wrong with your boyfriend, and then I'm gonna cure him.<eos> Dr. Cascade, thank you.
10,000 pop-up ads for male enhancement.<eos> Did you, uh, handcuff yourself to that desk?<eos> Yes.<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.<eos> Well, I just came in to let you know Dean Munsch has been looking for you.
I'll take care of everything.<eos> The patient was admitted complaining of lower back pain and abdominal cramps.<eos> Now, the routine x ray showed a... An enormous mass in his stomach. We don't have the results from the MRI yet.<eos> - I don't understand. - Why do you need me?<eos> I don't need you, he was asking about you.
Bam, nice try, terrorists.<eos> Another victory for women's rights.<eos> Actually, I was gonna tell her to do it.<eos> In my book, there are extenuating circumstances... rape, incest and... whatever this is.<eos> Mr. Benson will see you now.
Well, we'll be here.<eos> You don't have someone you need to get home to?<eos> I do, which is why I know how you must feel.<eos> I'm gonna have the sitter bring him here.<eos> We're not leaving you alone.
Let me rephrase.<eos> I'm looking for detective burkhardt.<eos> He's here.<eos> He's upstairs.<eos> If i tell you where the book is What's to stop you from killing me?
He's lying.<eos> Is he lying?<eos> Or are you?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Ms. Boatman, I should caution you that you may plead the fifth in order to avoid incriminating yourself.
The official charge...<eos> Arson and first-degree murder.<eos> - The evidence?<eos> - An anonymous source.<eos> They've provided information that ties you to the charges.
They know something's going on.<eos> They're watching you.<eos> Abogado.<eos> A second later, I would have missed you.<eos> That alarm's not going to help you.
Yes, but he only moved in a month ago so he hasn't done the paperwork yet.<eos> We'll bear that in mind in case we need it.<eos> - Okay. Bye.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What time shall I pick you up tomorrow?
He's got a gun.<eos> Merry Christmas, Maggie!<eos> Was Maggie a good little girl?<eos> She was? !<eos> Well, you did such a good job, Mr. Gnome, that we're gonna leave you here all year round.
It's what makes us civilized.<eos> Oh, that's very forgiving of you, considering Landon's beliefs.<eos> "The recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends, he shall have his reward from Allah."<eos> Is that from the Qur'an?<eos> I wish that didn't surprise you.
Making it back might be a problem.<eos> Looks like we're at an impasse.<eos> Have your men withdrawn.<eos> You stay.<eos> Once our FTL is operational, we will make the jump... and we will drop you off at the nearest space station.
Proves trafficking of stolen goods on the internet--<eos> Federal crime.<eos> So's killing sailors.<eos> Whoa, wait, I didn't kill anybody.<eos> Why's everybody afraid of you?
Your family's downstairs.<eos> They're upset.<eos> They don't understand what's going on. They want to talk to you.<eos> We can make that happen.<eos> All you have to do is tell us about the person who's been helping you.
- Well, I'm always here for you, ma'am.<eos> All right, Jay, you should go ahead and liaise with DoD about the agreement renegotiation. But I want to check in with the president.<eos> Which you can do at the dinner for his big-ticket donors in exactly two hours, leaving you enough time to go home and change - if you leave right now.<eos> - Uh, Madam Secretary,<eos> Zuhair Mossadek, the foreign minister from Tunisia, is waiting for you in my office.
No, once the shoe is down to two decks, it's the simplest math.<eos> He's a math genius.<eos> We're just trying to get your attention.<eos> We wanted a meeting with the main man in Sofia. We knew that wouldn't come cheap.<eos> Your reputation precedes you all the way to the U.S.
No.<eos> Never in fun?<eos> He never pins you to the bed, never holds your wrists, never pulls your hair?<eos> No, no, no, none of those things, no.<eos> Has he ever asked you to do anything you're not comfortable with? No.
As I recall.<eos> Was she reacting pleasurably? Yes.<eos> And she then stripped you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you like it when a woman strips you?
I still don't understand.<eos> The last thing I remember was getting off the train. Everything else is a blur.<eos> I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.<eos> After our investigation, we concluded you were kidnapped by an imposter, some idiot posing as you trying to bring down Capone.<eos> The gentleman who was impersonating you was trying to do the right thing.
Your opposition to this rezoning, it's not political.<eos> It's--it's personal.<eos> I get it.<eos> You're trying to protect an investment.<eos> Susan Williams isn't shadowing you at the moment, but to me, this feels like a story she would like, so should I call her?
Actually, we've reached an accord.<eos> The Bratva will lay off hostilities as exchange for a percentage to my casino's profits.<eos> Your first two lies were more believable.<eos> I told you truth is a matter of perspective.<eos> Ask yourself which is more likely, that the Bratva will let an American into their brotherhood or that they're using you for whatever little value you can provide.
Yes.<eos> Well, actually, it's not about one of my books. It's about my mother's.<eos> No, I-I only wish I was joking. - Are you a cop?<eos> - Geez!<eos> I don't recognize you, and I've lived in this building for years.
No need walking us out.<eos> You want to tell me what this is about?<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Just not right now.<eos> Agents Butler and Lake will take you back to the Stanbridge.
Not a very good cover... unless you weren't planning on staying around for very long.<eos> Don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Interpol is running your DNA as we speak.<eos> Any assassination attempt... any terrorist act you've ever committed... we're gonna find out.<eos> And then the U.S. Government's gonna send you to Guantanamo.
What's up with number two?<eos> Yeah, get him a glass of water.<eos> Keep going, Claudia.<eos> Uh, Senator Healy, you have your own troubles, don't you?<eos> Isn't Ella Pollack challenging you for the whip position?
Melanesian Choir?<eos> Yes, you know it?<eos> - Not many people listen to it.<eos> - I know. I don't even listen to it, and I listen to everything.<eos> So how can I help you, Dr. Bobb?
Where is this guy?<eos> Where is he?<eos> What, no alcohol swab this time?<eos> No need.<eos> This stuff will kill you in about 12 seconds.
This your shop?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You run Chicago for Horizons.<eos> So what's that make you?
I just know you are. Oh.<eos> I don't know about any of that, Don.<eos> I wanna help them, I wanna get out of here faster. I just...<eos> I'm... I wanna...<eos> What's holding you back?
Uh, right, tell her I need to reschedule.<eos> Like you did last week?<eos> Yes, Maggie, like I did last week.<eos> Ms. Rhodes, he's with a patient.<eos> He said he won't be able to make lunch today, but he'll call you back to reschedule.
Ms. Desai, your boys would rather spend 100 Chicago winters in a shelter than a lifetime without their mother.<eos> Don't orphan them for this money.<eos> Neela, look at me.<eos> Look at me, Neela.<eos> Dr. Choi is gonna take you up to OB, and you are going to deliver this baby.
- You know, toss me a pair. - Oh?<eos> You know, the kind that, uh, stick to yours when you pull 'em out.<eos> - You want in? - Heck yeah.<eos> We've come this far.<eos> And they call you Robocop.
- How's that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'd hoped to make it to the islands one more time.<eos> Flying's such a hassle these days.<eos> As soon as we can, we'll get you out of the ICU and into a room... one with a view.
Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Writing in my phone number so she can reach me any time she needs to.<eos> Okay, you put your number in there, you better mean it.<eos> She calls you, you pick up.
- Why don't you pick one.<eos> - Well, with my sister, it was...<eos> I, um... you know, normal sibling stuff, and with my ex, it was...<eos> I mean, that's just a cruel thing to say, "You have creepy eyebrows."<eos> Do you think this focus on your eyebrows is distracting you from something bigger?
And the others?<eos> Satellite feeds picked up Price's jet touching down in St. Louis.<eos> Our guess is she's headed to the White House to meet with Shaw.<eos> I've diverted all teams to that location.<eos> Once we have them in custody, we'll get you on the air to address the people.
How's Tom Anderson?<eos> His arm's broken.<eos> He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should...keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.
We are at an impasse here.<eos> If we don't settle, if we go to trial, you risk losing it all.<eos> Only one of you is walking out of that court with sole custody.<eos> I am painfully aware of that.<eos> Then I urge you to consider their offer.
No, sir. You can't go out there.<eos> The press, the cameras, - the optics would be awful.<eos> - Abby.<eos> Do you really want the entire world to see you get reprimanded by your ex-wife on national television?<eos> You could bring about world peace, put a man on Mars, but that footage will still be the only thing that people remember about you.
Caught our eye, too.<eos> It's a couple hours north of the city-- nothing but farmland.<eos> Makes one wonder whether the propellant was distilled from a pesticide purchased near there.<eos> I'll make some calls upstate, see if anyone remembers him.<eos> Watson will assist you.
-That'll work.<eos> Everyone has stops they make along the way.<eos> Tommy is one of yours.<eos> -So, I should dump him?<eos> - This, uh, card suggests that he's cheating on you.
WILL: I can see the crown, Miriam. Keep pushing.<eos> They can see the crown, Mim!<eos> MIRIAM: I'm in labour, not deaf!<eos> (Groans) Everything is going terribly well, Bryn, and Miriam is in very good hands.<eos> But it has been suggested that your encouragements through the door are proving an unwelcome distraction, so if I may suggest that you make yourself comfortable in the front room, and I will come and fetch you the minute your presence is required.
No, sir.<eos> For a woman your age seeking asylum, the ability to bear children is a factor.<eos> You're wrong, Miss Crain.<eos> We do owe you.<eos> We're not going to send you back to face the Kempeitai or the Resistance.
I hate these parties, too.<eos> Nicole Dahmer.<eos> Joe Blake.<eos> Blake?<eos> I thought the Reichsminister called you "son."
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.<eos> So stubborn.<eos> Let her go now.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> But if you let me leave with my dear sister, my dear Alice... then I'll free you from that nasty little impulse.
Girl loves it there.<eos> Well, she's hardly what you call a girl, - is she?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, thanks for the crustless egg thing, but I got errands to run. Uh no, sorry, miss.<eos> No one is to leave the house, until we find exactly who is following you.
Mother...<eos> I-I shouldn't have?<eos> No, you didn't have to redo your entire place just to impress me.<eos> I do adore Mondrian, though.<eos> I, for one, do not even want to know you if you do not love Mondrian.
Bitchy women are often bitchy because they're smart and neglected.<eos> Old money means Scandinavian help.<eos> Well, at least it did back in the 1950s.<eos> And, uh, if you had balked at Swedish, I would have done some sort of double-talk and backtracked around, uh, Chinese.<eos> -Wonderful. - Well, it is until they get you to the ATM to take the curse off your money.
I'm ready.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> They're coming your way.<eos> They just pulled into my road block.<eos> Sir, this doesn't involve you.
It won't be robots rising up to slaughter us in our beds. It's machines sending silent messages in the middle of the night when no-one else is looking.<eos> You're right. I need the money and I have to take it.<eos> I just came to tell you what I think 'cause that's what people do.<eos> I have a reservation.<eos> Mr Khoury is waiting for you.
I am not returning empty-handed.<eos> It's a little selfish.<eos> That very much depends on your point of view.<eos> You have a hammock, I have a boat.<eos> Now, I can either collect you on my way back, or you could come with me, it's your choice.
No, you don't know...<eos> I knew the moment that I heard your name.<eos> I just didn't know that I would be here.<eos> Call 911 and go!<eos> Because we considered you as a host.
You mean my computer?<eos> Tell me... do you have plans to meet anyone tonight downtown, on the 12th floor of an abandoned building, about 11:17?<eos> No.<eos> Why... Why would I do that?<eos> Well, I guess that means I won't be seeing you there.
On my terms.<eos> - Mr. Bligh.<eos> - Roy.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> How are they treating you up in Canberra? - All right? - Yes, yes.
I'm your superior officer.<eos> Who advised you?<eos> That uniform is obsolete.<eos> I order you to let me into the church at once!<eos> Do you want me to report you for insubordination?
Is this a joke?<eos> I did one for each man.<eos> Your mayor will know that you came and you fought.<eos> When we get back to Spain, I'm telling them what went on here.<eos> And I hope they kick you out of the Army.
Actually, yeah, water would be great.<eos> If I could...<eos> Sure. There are a couple of details that we need to iron out, and one or two bits and pieces I'm going to need to see some more on.<eos> It says in here that you opened a business with your partner... Mm-hm.<eos> I'm sorry, that kind of thing won't get you very far here any more.
Good-bye, Donna.<eos> _<eos> Mrs. Howe-Rendon?<eos> Hi.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.
Yes, the sexual harassment case.<eos> It's a 7pm arrival tonight for a 7.30 surprise, OK?<eos> - ALL: - Surprise!<eos> Sounds like a blast.<eos> That kind of thing won't get you very far here any more.
I just pay the bills.<eos> I heard about Carrillo.<eos> If that son of a bitch was still alive, many more policemen would have died.<eos> I did the police a favor. Believe me.<eos> Do you think the police agree with you?
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified intelligence is a federal offense.<eos> Especially when it ends up in the hands of a death squad that's killed innocent people.<eos> I'm sure some newspaper in America might be interested in hearing more about that.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Yes, I'm threatening you.
It's not safe. I just wanted to hear your voice.<eos> Of course it has to be lasagna night.<eos> My favorite.<eos> Then why don't you stop by? I'll be serving it up, just like always.<eos> I could always count on you to keep your routine.
Where was he going after he left the store?<eos> What store?<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> You're moving way beyond suspect now.<eos> You're helping a fugitive to evade capture, and that pushes you into a whole new piece of real estate.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know. Why should you?<eos> Just because you kill Ukrainian doesn't mean you know Russians.<eos> I hate to disappoint you, but I didn't actually shoot the Ukrainian president.<eos> Too bad, because they're going to capture you and eventually kill you and your cute little family.
Like you have that kind of juice.<eos> I don't.<eos> My boss does.<eos> This was a test of your leadership abilities, and you failed.<eos> You know, winning doesn't mean whether your men like you or even respect you.
Not if I was running an illegal protection racket.<eos> In fact, they'd be distancing themselves from me.<eos> How much of this is bullshit?<eos> You've gone to an awful lot of trouble to try and throw me off track. I must be right about a thing or two.<eos> Do you really think your colleagues at the FBI are gonna back you up?
Well, do me a favor, you take a read, and if it's any good,<eos> I'll put it on my reading list.<eos> Well, fantastic.<eos> Just let me know.<eos> Well, it's here waiting for you, so whenever you want to come in, just pick it up.
It matches to the skull we dug up.<eos> They used it as part of their ritual.<eos> They dug him up.<eos> We have to bury him and end this.<eos> What brings you to camp, deputy?
Can you just... can you please just take it back?<eos> You her daughter?<eos> No, but I'm looking after her, or trying to anyway.<eos> Look, I-I could say you refused delivery, but if you want a refund, you're gonna need to cancel the order on her credit card.<eos> Okay, thank you... very much.
This can't be happening.<eos> I'll go.<eos> - I'm going to jail, aren't I?<eos> - Not if we can help it.<eos> Shade's confidence is rubbing off on you.
Do you want to die?<eos> - No. - No.<eos> So let us do our job.<eos> All right?<eos> Let's get you inside.
Jerrod, is your father in?<eos> Uh, he's upstairs resting right now. Can you come back later?<eos> Nope.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> What brings you to Omaha?
If you can't name it, externalize it, then you can't move past it, Kurt.<eos> - _<eos> - We're gonna have to call this one short.<eos> Your father's dead, Kurt.<eos> It's too late to confront him now, but until you confront your feelings about him, his shadow will follow you wherever you go.
I'll be good.<eos> Oh, I've always lived in this neighborhood.<eos> And when this house went for sale, I just knew.<eos> I had to have it, you know?<eos> So it didn't bother you that it was the scene of the first SBK murder?
I heard Miranda was performing here.<eos> So I came to clap for her in case no one else does.<eos> [shushes and stammers] You can't be here.<eos> Non-magicians are not allowed at these judging events.<eos> If anyone sees you, Miranda will be disqualified.
Yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Joshua Copeland.<eos> Dr. Copeland.<eos> What brings you here?
- God, you are selfish.<eos> You're like...<eos> You're like Goldilocks, when you stumble in the bears' house, you eat all their food...<eos> You break their chairs, you sleep in their beds.<eos> And then you scream when they catch you, like you're the victim.
But not every truth needs the light of day.<eos> You'll be one of eight participants in today's test.<eos> Your goal is to dream and, in your dream, rendezvous with the other subjects.<eos> - Would you like a sleep aid?<eos> If you change your mind once you lie down, raise your hand; we'll come to you.
Hello.<eos> - Lee Ga Jin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let's go, Mom.<eos> What's bothering you today...
I mean, you know, how could he not know?<eos> Thank you for making the time for this deposition.<eos> I promise it will be quick and painless.<eos> So, Mr. Nighthorse,<eos> Sheriff Longmire arrested you for conspiracy in the attempted murder of his deputy, Branch Connally?
I'm working on it.<eos> Is that Grand Teton?<eos> South Teton.<eos> We were gonna do the Grand the next summer.<eos> So, what brings you here?
- Commander Steve McGarrett.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> I've heard great things.<eos> I'm Madison Gray.<eos> How can I help you?
Twenty years of study... twenty years to come here and do everything myself.<eos> This upgrade in power will be overseen by the very best; allowing Olympus Town to generate all the water, oxygen, and physical infrastructure they'll need to support our settlers.<eos> With world-renowned nuclear physicist Leslie Richardson entering Mars atmosphere as we speak,<eos> to take a role as director of MMC's Phase 2 expansion.<eos> I have the report for you Commander Seung. Thank you Jane.
Mr. Frink got us into this mess.<eos> He should be the one to... make the drop.<eos> It's okay. I'll do it.<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> You do realize they're just as likely to kill you as they are to honor the deal.
- You're sorry?<eos> - Logan.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - What did I tell you about "I'm sorry"?<eos> Why are they letting you in here?
You're gonna make it.<eos> What's your name?<eos> They call me the Mayor.<eos> Miss Mayor.<eos> The United States government thanks you for your service.
- I...<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> And you have something these girls don't have.<eos> Please don't say a good personality.<eos> He loves you.
I got a piece of your company too, which means you either hire me and we fight that bastard together, or you go with him and you take me on.<eos> Either way, you're not walking out of this thing without a war.<eos> All I ever wanted was to work together, but I do not like being bullied.<eos> No, you like to bully, which is exactly why<eos> I never wanted to represent you in the first place.
Bullshit.<eos> None of you have the balls to go up against me.<eos> I'm not here to go up against you, William.<eos> I'm here to buy your shares back at a tidy little profit so you can use it to hire whoever you want to be your lawyer because it sure as hell isn't gonna be me.<eos> Yeah, maybe instead I'll make sure his company gets in my pocket, never hires you, and your firm is out of business by the end of the quarter.
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of assholes like you not taking this thing seriously.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say I wasn't taking it seriously.<eos> Yeah, I don't give a shit what you said.<eos> I give a shit that you start listening to what I'm goddamn telling you because when the SEC gets you on the stand, they're going to go through your life with a fine tooth comb, and if you got something to hide, they're gonna find it.
Which building you want, Buzz?<eos> You can have your pick.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Mr. Cobblepot, you're back.<eos> We haven't seen you for some time.
It's such an honor to work alongside you.<eos> Well, Connie, your sword-fighting skills have far exceeded my expectations.<eos> And, with my careful supervision, of course, I'm confident that you can handle a simple gem-recovery mission like this.<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> I promise I won't let you down, ma'am!
I'm not surprised.<eos> Biggest pain in the ass hooker I ever met.<eos> - You're telling us that-- that she's a prostitute.<eos> - Are you guys gonna jam me up on a solicitation charge?<eos> - Tell us what happened, unless you want us to jam you up on a rape charge.
So you accused him of rape.<eos> And now you are hoping to capitalize on your newfound and sordid celebrity status.<eos> - No, I would never want this kind of publicity.<eos> - Everybody is talking about you.<eos> Everybody is looking at you.
- My jump was disqualified on a technicality.<eos> It was unfair.<eos> I'll be back, four years from now in tokyo.<eos> - Four years from now, when you're what, 30?<eos> If you do qualify-- if the governing body doesn't ban you for being a prostitute.
- Ms. Clarendon.<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you... figured out who killed Tyler?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I promise to contact you as soon as we do.
Ma'am, we heard reports of a lynch mob.<eos> Something they saw on the Internet.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> They killed two kids.<eos> Okay, we're gonna get you to the hospital.
Stand over there, please.<eos> Security check.<eos> What I can't wrap my head around was why.<eos> Why that place?<eos> With underlings from your department, every one of whom despises you.
I mean, isn't that what they do?<eos> Wha...<eos> - Oh, that doesn't look good.<eos> - No.<eos> Ma'am, the president urgently needs you at the White House.
Let me ask you a question, son.<eos> Are you a dick?<eos> If I say no, makes me a liar, and if I say yes, you're not gonna draft me, so I'll go with... sometimes.<eos> People say you're a loose cannon.<eos> They say only a fool would draft you, no matter how hard you hit.
Well, let's make the most of it, then.<eos> Come on, let's go say hi to everybody.<eos> - Morning, Ms. Goodwin.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> What brings you in on a Saturday?
I just...<eos> I don't like to be touched.<eos> How we doing in here?<eos> Give the tube a little more time.<eos> I promise we'll get you home as soon as possible.
Couldn't have come at a worse time.<eos> I don't get 10,000 lines of code written by the end of the week, my VC's gonna pull our series B round.<eos> Series B?<eos> That's pre-IPO.<eos> Besides the bleed, anything else bothering you?
Right, guys?<eos> 'Cause, I mean, how much work really gets done in Washington?<eos> Although you don't often wait around for someone who's honestly changing the world.<eos> Oh, I don't know if I'm doing that.<eos> So why don't you go ahead and tell us what you were working on that kept you?
No, we're not.<eos> Sheriff Miller, if you don't tell me why you weren't killed in office...<eos> I might kill you now that you're out.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> So, your wife was keeping you alive.
No, we don't need him.<eos> Unless you're planning to kill me.<eos> No, not at the moment.<eos> That was some ultimatum you gave Ms. Lawler out there.<eos> That's not why I agreed to see you.
Yes!<eos> You are tired from your snack and need a nap in the sun. - Hi.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> - Captain Ronnie Baker from Oliver Shaw's office, to see the secretary?<eos> Yes, the secretary's expecting you.
Why's that, then?<eos> This has nothing to do with the police, does it?<eos> I mean, maybe they've put you off the idea.<eos> And what if they did?<eos> The police won't help you, Mrs Svrcek.
I didn't think you'd come to hear about my hobbies.<eos> Look, if someone messed with the security tape, they could've made the kidnapper look like anyone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a technical genius, Mr. Karig.<eos> No one here is accusing you of creative brilliance.
Hey, any mail for me?<eos> Yes, your death threats to Grimace have all been returned.<eos> Well, has the Shamrock Shake period been extended?<eos> I believe that's still seasonal, but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid, and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.<eos> I'm afraid we're evicting you from the hotel.
I believe that's still seasonal, but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid, and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.<eos> I'm afraid we're evicting you from the hotel.<eos> What's your home address?<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> Now do you want to leave the regular way, or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?
Mrs. Kirkman, it's my job to worry.<eos> You're too good.<eos> Hold on, ma'am.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ma'am, the president needs you.
Claim his attention as a victory.<eos> Spin it however you want.<eos> Why the hell should I go with you?<eos> Because standing in the schoolhouse doorway didn't work for George Wallace, and it isn't gonna work for you.<eos> History will remember you for this.
You see, I believe that all Americans, regardless of race or religion, should be afforded and protected by the same inalienable rights.<eos> - If I may...<eos> - You may not.<eos> Governor, you violated the rights of the citizens of Michigan, and today you conspired with the National Guard to defy a direct order from the president.<eos> James Royce, I am placing you under arrest for treason against the United States of America.
Oh, my goodness!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Mr. Secretary.<eos> Hey, Mr. Booth.<eos> Wife's been asking when we're gonna be seeing you on stage again.
You know, I had to do a similar bit back when I was acting.<eos> Funny as hell!<eos> God, you're an idiot.<eos> He does draw a crowd, that Monroe.<eos> Something troubling you, Tommy?
I'm sorry about that scene with Bernadette.<eos> Did it drive you away?<eos> It just reminded me why I'm leaving.<eos> Giving in my notice today.<eos> Miss Moore, I don't know you very well, and I have no right to ask this, but it'd mean a lot to me if you just hold off for a moment before you do that.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Sex is always complicated for me.<eos> Mmm. Sometimes I think it's because I lost one of my balls in the war.<eos> I mean, they could've saved it but it wasn't the good one, so...<eos> You know something that might help you?
You'll say it.<eos> You'll say it, you'll say it, you will say it, you'll say it, you'll say it, you'll say it, you'll say it.<eos> You have a very tight family, Eminence, very affectionate.<eos> It has been a lovely Christmas Eve.<eos> May I be indiscreet, Your Holiness? And say something that concerns you personally?
You have a very tight family, Eminence, very affectionate.<eos> It has been a lovely Christmas Eve.<eos> May I be indiscreet, Your Holiness? And say something that concerns you personally?<eos> You may.<eos> - Your parents abandoned you when you were a child.
-Hello.<eos> Would you like some of this?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I don't blame you. It's been by the radiator all day.
-Maybe Cecile would like some more as well.<eos> -Right.<eos> We're still working on his party etiquette.<eos> Small world, Monsieur Rossi.<eos> What brings you here?
Where is my bag?<eos> It was hanging on the back of this chair!<eos> Where's the film?<eos> -Is this what he's looking for?<eos> Monsieur Rossi, what brings you here?
Mr. Ayers, this is FBI Agent...<eos> I heard you the first time.<eos> I won't be doing that.<eos> Alert the White House and the FAA to authorize an intercept.<eos> Mr. Ayers, we will shoot you down if you do not return immediately.
Here's his card with his badge number.<eos> Employee I.D. says Roger Murtaugh.<eos> That's a nice ride you got.<eos> Stay safe.<eos> Thank you, Officer.
You got a problem, take it up with Agent Christopher.<eos> I am not a soldier, I don't take orders, and you are not taking her.<eos> Try and stop me.<eos> So, how long I got to stand here?<eos> Until Flynn sees you.
There was no green, I mean, where were they supposed to play?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You bought Zoe a park?<eos> Most people just buy flowers.<eos> Thank you for talking to Amelia's dad, getting him back on side.
- I've never seen anything like this before.<eos> - Well, what do we do about it?<eos> - I'm gonna ask your permission to take Zach with me to the institution and run a few test right now.<eos> - Okay, I'll come with you.<eos> - No, no, you can stay here, you might just get in the way. We'll keep our Monday appointment as we discussed and I promise I'll keep you updated and you can contact me anytime.
- I told you, man, he pulls.<eos> He Pu-u-ulls.<eos> - Okay, stop saying "pulls."<eos> Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.<eos> - Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
Exactly.<eos> As much as we can appreciate the position you're in, I just can't get behind the fact that you're the president simply because you were the Designated Survivor.<eos> Everyone here knows what that means.<eos> It wasn't an honor. You were a formality.<eos> And the truth is, the former president didn't even want you in his administration.
Don't move.<eos> Sam.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Clearly, we are working for the wrong government agency.<eos> A volunteer will bring you back up.
It's NSA payout money for informants.<eos> Some very high paid informants.<eos> Call the agency.<eos> Believe me, it's all accounted for.<eos> I call the agency, they find out you're here. They pull you out, I don't get any of my questions answered.
- No, no, no. You don't get to get off the hook by mouthing some half-baked philosophy. You really want to pay for Hammers?<eos> You need to talk to me, Cheryl.<eos> I'm racking my brain.<eos> Nothing's coming to me.<eos> Watching a murder and doing nothing to prevent it leaves you equally culpable.
A young man was bashed and you were heard screaming, "Kill the faggot."<eos> What kind of a person does that?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Why does your husband have a gun beside the bed?<eos> In case he meets you on the beach.
No, he was just a skinny kid who did Hammers errands. I don't...<eos> I think he was a relative of Hammers'.<eos> Do you think he would have witnessed any of the murders?<eos> Sally.<eos> These secrets, they must be driving you crazy.
December 1989, he went for a walk and he didn't return, and I've been hearing stories that he met with his death at your hands.<eos> No!<eos> Another young man was killed December 1989.<eos> It was Christmas Eve.<eos> The same night that Detectives Chalmers and Peel pulled an improvised weapon off you.
- Um, no one, Jason.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Uh... don't know any Kyle Hampton.<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> We believe he might be looking for you.
Thank you.<eos> It's nothing like what you're used to working with.<eos> Still, it looks good.<eos> Shows me you're smart with a dollar.<eos> What brings you to Vancouver?
Oh, yeah?<eos> Is that what I did?<eos> Yeah, that's what you did.<eos> What it's gonna look like to a jury.<eos> We have a witness that places you in his front yard.
Fine, Mr. President.<eos> Now, will you please free our aid workers?<eos> I will need a public acknowledgement of my presidency.<eos> Show me and my people the respect we deserve, and I will insure the release of your hostages and allow international aid missions into my country, but under my supervision.<eos> If you want the trust and loyalty of your people, freeing our aid workers so that international aid can flow in, will take you a lot further than attempting to blackmail the United States.
- I'll need your assistance.<eos> You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.<eos> - All right.<eos> This is gonna hurt.<eos> But I'm gonna get you through it.
He was a neighbor that lived 200 yards down the beach.<eos> [Martin] Do you really believe that this is a vendetta by the government of Belize<eos> ‐ to take you down and kill you?<eos> ‐ Absolutely, sir.<eos> You're sincerely concerned that if you somehow wind up You're sincerely concerned that if you somehow wind up in their custody, they're going to assassinate you?
‐ to take you down and kill you?<eos> ‐ Absolutely, sir.<eos> You're sincerely concerned that if you somehow wind up You're sincerely concerned that if you somehow wind up in their custody, they're going to assassinate you?<eos> [John] Absolutely.<eos> [Man] Do you really think they would kill you?
‐ No, never.<eos> Never, never.<eos> ‐ Are you sure? Can you promise me, sir?<eos> Because I'm not worried<eos> ‐ Of course, they won't take you to Belize, no.
Until we meet again.<eos> Yes, until we meet again.<eos> Admiral Konstantine, you called for assistance?<eos> Quite the contrary.<eos> Admiral, I was contacting you to report the rebels have been driven from this system.
And we're clear. Incoming.<eos> And he looks angry.<eos> I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.<eos> He didn't.<eos> So I debrief you after the suicide. You don't tell me about the video, then you play it live on air.
Like I said, I was running low on cash.<eos> We're done here, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're done.<eos> The cops are waiting for you in the lobby.
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, tomorrow's event will celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown.<eos> That will happen at Moore House, which is where negotiations for British surrender began.<eos> French Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Dubois will speak and then a descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette will introduce you, Madam Secretary.
Thanks for letting me change.<eos> It wasn't for you. It was for me.<eos> I'm still trying to get that picture out of my brain.<eos> Listen, I don't know how many times I have to tell you. I didn't kill Ray Flores.<eos> Oh, I'm not arresting you for that.
I didn't say I was good at it.<eos> You know, someone might think that this was personal between you two.<eos> That he pushed you too far and you took matters into your own hands.<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> Are you afraid I'm accusing you of something?
Let's just be safe.<eos> Let's order a chest x-ray, KUB and lactate, CBC, amylase lipase, check his basic chemistry.<eos> Right.<eos> How long is that all gonna take?<eos> Do you know, not long. We'll get you outta here as soon as possible.
Thank you.<eos> Actually, you stay right here.<eos> That's my son, and I'm his mother.<eos> And I don't know if you have some sort of problem with that arrangement, but also, I don't really care.<eos> Thank you very much for watching my son. But I have him now.
Mr. Porter, do you recognize these?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... bought a similar pair seven or eight years ago.<eos> Yeah, we found a matching boot print in your wife's blood.<eos> Puts you at the scene of the murder.
Nope, nope. Do you understand how a restraining order works?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay, he might seem nuts, but I'm not.<eos> You have my word we won't bother you again if you just hear him out.
Assistant M.E. Palmer.<eos> Quinn- - I knew an agent afloat by that name, long time ago.<eos> Uh-oh. Did I arrest you?<eos> No.<eos> What was it the boys used to call you?
Lieutenant Vivian Mills, navigator.<eos> She have family on board?<eos> - Lieutenant Mills, please report to the wardroom.<eos> Lieutenant Mills to the wardroom.<eos> Your Tiger is looking for you.
Well, I bet you know who Alejandro Medina is.<eos> See, we know that you killed his father when you took over his cartel.<eos> I wonder what kind of a tattoo he's gonna give you when he finds out that you're alive.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> You were 14 years old when your father married you to a man 40 years older than you.
Well, what could it be?<eos> That's the part I can't figure out.<eos> Then maybe you need to look deeper.<eos> Empty your pockets.<eos> In a few moments, they're going to be taking you to federal prison, so I need to make this quick.
Mrs. Barrett.<eos> I don't mean to startle you. I'm Joan Watson. I work with the police.<eos> I'm investigating the murder of Russell Cole.<eos> Yes, my husband told me.<eos> Your husband has a photo in his office of you at a luau.
It's for you.<eos> Justice is calling.<eos> You want a tip?<eos> When the lawyers ask you questions, just, uh, say that you watch a lot of crime shows like "L.A. Law."<eos> They'll think you're a real know-it-all who won't convict anybody without DNA evidence, and then the lawyers will just send you home.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,<eos> Thy will be done...<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I can't emphasize enough the risk you're taking.<eos> Don't think a 40-year absence will protect you.
Fine.<eos> Peter!<eos> Detective Inspector Muncie.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> What brings you here?
An inventory?<eos> I'm a collector.<eos> All the drawers, cabinets you see are filled with ammunition. Whoa.<eos> Well, you really were not kidding.<eos> You know, I would like to apologize to you for the way my son looked at you when you walked in.
So, dig deep, and make me puppets.<eos> You know what?<eos> But they're for Teacher Appreciation Day.<eos> I got to be honest.<eos> I don't appreciate you.
Yeah, yeah, I deserve that.<eos> Happy sailing!<eos> And just remember... even if you get through the Straits of Forgiveness, some day, there's a torpedo heading your way from the S.S. Menopause.<eos> I'm gonna need a bigger boat.<eos> I think if you just give Adam another chance, he won't disappoint you.
Cops, clients, ex-cons.<eos> You heard the man.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mr. Gregorian, there's paparazzi waiting downstairs for you.
He's ten?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I'm hurting a lot of people.<eos> Lauren, I'm not judging you.
He's always complaining about how his grandchildren are making too much noise, how his wife is cooking impossibly heavy meals, and now he has absolutely nothing to do except to sit around and read a book.<eos> So...<eos> So, in other words, he's deliriously happy.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So, what brings you to D.C.?
That is the nicest way anyone has ever told me that I'm super fat.<eos> You know I hate that word, sweetie. Diets are hard.<eos> But this new sensor we've developed is gonna take all the guesswork out of dieting and exercise.<eos> You are part of a revolutionary study that's gonna change the way we control our weight.<eos> Melissa, we're gonna help you in ways that nobody ever has.
Thank you for volunteering.<eos> I couldn't say no.<eos> The kids on the team practically begged me.<eos> It's an amazing thing to matter so much and inspire so many.<eos> Oh, no, I think they just wanted you here so they can prank you. - Hmm?
- You're a dad man!<eos> - No!<eos> Please, don't hurt me.<eos> The keys are in the S.U.V.<eos> Your friends will meet you by the back door.
Grace happens to live in New York.<eos> Marcus is inviting her to the station as we speak.<eos> So, make yourself an alternate breakfast.<eos> We should have Joaquin Pereya's murder solved by the time you get dressed.<eos> We get that you never expected anyone to connect you to these murders, but... it still would have been a good idea not to keep so much evidence in your apartment.
A goblin?<eos> A god of death?<eos> That's quite a vulgar disguise he has on.<eos> Your Lordship!<eos> It's been 20 years since I've last seen you.
Now, I'm pretty sure his DNA is gonna be a match for the blood found at the scene of the robbery.<eos> Now, Trafoya used to work here, with you.<eos> He resigned in 2013-- something about, uh, evidence going missing at a narcotics raid.<eos> He's talking to a Detective Cosa right now.<eos> He might not give you up, but then again, you know how easy it is for criminals to turn on their friends.
Conflict of interest.<eos> Was he threatened?<eos> So... why are you here?<eos> I believe in the law, and the law has failed you.<eos> You do not belong in here and I'm gonna get you out.
First, do you see the sign that says "closed"?<eos> The store isn't open yet.<eos> It's not out of business.<eos> Second, I'm not here to do your bidding.<eos> I'm tailing you because the chairman ordered me to.
Here, we have an arrangement.<eos> If you do anything to endanger my team.<eos> If you report anything which undermines my authority.<eos> If you portray my officers as incompetent.<eos> If you do any of these things... I will kill you myself.
Here.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> And you will bring us water?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Goodblood will see you now.
If I had a choice, I'd be at a pool in Vegas right now.<eos> We made it to the border.<eos> Oh, there's another one.<eos> We're tourists, guys. Sorry.<eos> So, what brings you out here?
You used to work for Titus, but that's not true anymore.<eos> So why stick around?<eos> Why help me?<eos> Because of Stinger.<eos> He thinks if we help you, then you might help us get back in the Legion.
Oh!<eos> Would you want us to come in with you?<eos> I'm so sorry, Mr. Eldan.<eos> Don't blame yourself.<eos> I'll contact you if we need any other additional information.
My parents are dead. His mom is, too.<eos> I mean, I would love for our children to know their one remaining grandparent.<eos> I would love for my husband to know his father.<eos> In a few minutes, my husband is going to walk through that door and when he does,<eos> I feel pretty confident this will be the last time I ever see you.
- Watch your head.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, Danny.<eos> I don't want the last thing I ever said to you to be mean, but I don't want to say anything nice.<eos> So, Mr. Collins, on behalf of the Woodcliff Lake Hilton, we'd like to thank you for your stay.
Well, your heart is racing.<eos> Have you been under a lot of stress?<eos> Stress is for pussies.<eos> I also hear a heart murmur.<eos> Listen, I'm not fuckin' paying you to give me bad news.
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer from The Boston Globe.<eos> Okay.<eos> Could I ask you a few questions?<eos> Go ahead, dear.<eos> We spoke to several men who knew you when they were boys... at St. John the Baptist in Haverhill.
Look, your father is very protective of you in this state.<eos> I need to ring Callum.<eos> I don't think it's wise to be having this conversation here, Miss.<eos> All you have to do is take me there. I can look after myself.<eos> Your family love you very much.
And, you...<eos> I don't want to hear another word out of you. All right?<eos> You walkin' wiener coat.<eos> What's a wiener coat?<eos> Madam Prime Minister, I can't thank you enough for your cooperation on this.
Daddy needs to talk to her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Go back to sleep, alright?<eos> Okay.<eos> Mrs. Jensen will see you now.
- Shut up.<eos> - Ghost blowjobs.<eos> It's starting to feel very "rape-y".<eos> I heard an Oh, my God fact, that if we don't get to the stump in five minutes,<eos> I'm going to throw you off the crest.
We have no business that I know of, Mr. McCurdy.<eos> That you know of.<eos> Your husband and I have spoken about him selling his farm.<eos> Well, I'd be surprised if my husband entertained such an idea.<eos> Well, ma'am, if that surprises you, you'll be dumbstruck to learn he's agreed to the sale of the property. I don't believe you.
Intrusive?<eos> Curious.<eos> What about you?<eos> Why don't you ask me something that you want to know?<eos> Earlier, you said that there are some people who know you well.
How old?<eos> Old enough to remember.<eos> How, if I may ask?<eos> It was a climbing accident.<eos> So who brought you up?
- Oh, yeah? - How do I look?<eos> You look sexy and victorious.<eos> Mrs. Altmann, may I have a word?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'm defeated... but I will ask you, beg you, entreat you... not to let these paintings leave their motherland.
Mr. Colby, this is, uh-- This is Deacon Whit.<eos> Oh, sorry to bother you. But, uh, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I might.<eos> A little out of it.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Um, so what brings you to town?
Now, you brought up suicide before, and that concerns me.<eos> Do you want to kill yourself, Gabriel?<eos> Do you really want to kill yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then what stops you?
You think this is funny, Mr. Thomson?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm only joking.<eos> You have no idea how nervous you look!<eos> Did Mr. Henderson tell you that he was not gonna have you in the shop anymore?
Are you sure you can get him?<eos> Remember. You're on your own out there.<eos> Hasbro can have no connection to this.<eos> I'll get him.<eos> And when I have him I'll call you with the code phrase.
Yeah, good.<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah, no, we're good.<eos> - It looks good.<eos> For those of you that haven't met, this is Helen Wilton, Base Camp manager.
You know what? I'll call, I got it. Don't worry about it.<eos> Sir, put the phone away or I'm gonna throw you in the back of the car myself.<eos> Are you saying that you'd arrest me?<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> Well, then I should probably inform you that I was arrested a few years ago on a big capital offense.
Dumpling Napkin<eos> Tasty?<eos> It's from the region.<eos> From the city.<eos> What brings you here?
Want any tea?<eos> Listen, things have quieted down.<eos> I'm not expecting more trouble.<eos> But - the foreign devils can't be trusted .<eos> Ah Sang's boss has it out for you .
- I'm going to tell him to leave.<eos> Sergeant Troy, I must absolutely insist that you leave at this very moment.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Will you follow me, please?<eos> What angers you, exactly? - Please.
You're cut from the same cloth as the best cop there ever was.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> It's time to make your father proud.<eos> Just try not to get all in your head about it, okay?<eos> - Captain Emmett, I will not let you down.
Do you think that Bunny still has the painting now?<eos> Must to the W.C.<eos> Do have a look?<eos> I'm afraid I must be going, Your Grace.<eos> Thank you very much for your time.
I got to tell you, you're the first normal person that I've met in this town.<eos> And, uh, when I get my wallet, I'll come back...<eos> And give me a really big tip, right?<eos> Right.<eos> So, what brings you to Wayward Pines, anyway?
Never underestimate the power we women have to define our own destinies.<eos> We do not want to be law breakers, we want to be law makers.<eos> Be militant.<eos> Each of you in your own way.<eos> Those of you who can break windows, break them.
Hello!<eos> - Hello!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I have a stupid question:<eos> Do you also feel like certain neighbours are spying on you?
USS Borie will meet you there.<eos> She's already been deployed to the area.<eos> Should be there to pick you up when you splash down.<eos> So what...what happens now?<eos> I'm gonna put you over to one of my colleagues at NASA...
Looks superb.<eos> This is the kitchen.<eos> All pretty self-explanatory.<eos> There's a spacious oven over there, perfect for cooking a family dinner.<eos> Will any family members be joining you while you're here?
They can't remember anything either.<eos> I wanna see them.<eos> You will, soon.<eos> First we need to perform some tests.<eos> Nurse Keller will take you.
Would you hold my hand?<eos> I would tell you, to get over it.<eos> You've graduated to real clothes.<eos> What is this?<eos> While we were monitoring you during your unconscious state you were having very intense dreams.
Oh, it's good.<eos> I mean, there's gonna be opportunity here.<eos> Frankly, a lot of these folks that you see here, you know, they haven't worked out like i thought they were going to, but I got... I got a lot of hope for you.<eos> I got a lot of confidence in you.<eos> Thank you, thank you.
It's very sweet, but I really have to question your judgment.<eos> You know, you're a catch.<eos> Thank you, but how could you think this has nothing to do with work?<eos> I told my wife that and she said it wouldn't matter because she has a knack for this.<eos> What happens if I take you up on this offer and it goes badly or he's homely or anything happens good or bad?
Didn't you used to work here?<eos> Because you can probably still get the discount.<eos> That's tempting, but I think you have me confused with someone else.<eos> Could you?<eos> Ted wants to see you.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything. But which of you decided to... endanger a bus full of civilian hostages with an unauthorized roadblock?<eos> - You must be he.<eos> - Who the fuck are you?<eos> Detective Marconi, lead investigator on this little shit show.<eos> I was sent here by Deputy Chief Braddock, and chief outranks captain, so... I officially release you of your duties and responsibilities and I officially reinstate you, Officer Bauhaus.
You did a good job. Thank you.<eos> Um, all right, who's next?<eos> Melissa.<eos> I'm normally a much better teacher than that, I swear.<eos> I thought you were great and that they obviously love you.
Does it have to do with your father's death?<eos> - How could it?<eos> - Then what is it you're not telling me?<eos> You can't trust what someone like me believes, right?<eos> If you tell me you saw something, I believe you.
The record--<eos> No, now wait a minute, don't duck away from the record.<eos> You suggested the atom bombing of the north of Vietnam in your little magazine, which I do not read, but I'm told about, on February 23, 1968.<eos> So you're very hawkish.<eos> And now, if both Nixon and Reagan are listening to you, I'm very worried for the country.
What's going on? Where are they taking you?<eos> Some new information?<eos> Where are you going, Mr. Crawford? Where is he going?<eos> Which precinct?<eos> Ben, where are they taking you?
- Wait.<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Yeah, don't make me come back either.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm breaking up with you then.
Hi, Gran.<eos> Yes.<eos> And who's this nice, young man?<eos> Adam Cromwell.<eos> Thank you so much for inviting me into your home.
- I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> 'Cause that's not his choice.<eos> Hamish Stone, owner and publisher of Reconnoiter Media.<eos> I know who you are, and I'd describe you as more of a gossip profiteer.
Would anybody like one, this week's Big Issue?<eos> Good afternoon, love. Spare a couple of minutes?<eos> I'd love to tell you a bit about this charity we've got going on.<eos> Um, I'm not interested. No? No problem.<eos> Can I help you?
A car like this needs to be handled by a man.<eos> I've always wanted to drive this beast.<eos> Oh, for goodness' sake!<eos> Clutch, Tommy!<eos> The Foreign Secretary's waiting for you in here.
The perfect place to recover, it said.<eos> The envelope was postmarked London, Soho.<eos> A sink of depravity.<eos> A godless desert of vice.<eos> What brings you here, Miss Brent?
Everyone.<eos> Except you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your lady friend is waiting for you.
Dust gets everywhere.<eos> If only we could learn to love dust.<eos> Think how much time it would save.<eos> Mrs Amos, my work... It's about caring, for baby and for you.<eos> So anything that affects you is a concern of mine, do you see?
But I do need to speak to him, Susan.<eos> ~ You need to make a telephone call, Mr Robbins.<eos> ~ What's going on?<eos> Call Dr Turner and tell him that your wife has a retained placenta.<eos> The ambulance will take you to the hospital, Mrs Robbins.
It's not good.<eos> Okay, everybody just shut up!<eos> Let me think!<eos> Shit.<eos> Mr. President, right now I'd like to show you something that's gonna put you in the middle of all the action.
It's not what i think;<eos> it's just the straight-up truth.<eos> Well, it's not so great. Believe me.<eos> Well, i bet you don't get beat up at school.<eos> And people don't call you "little miss bag fag."
And is marketing your passion?<eos> Well, my heart's in editorial, but it's, uh...<eos> Yeah, it's very valuable learning from Diana.<eos> You're quite the politician.<eos> So what brings you out to this fabulous bash?
Maybe you did. But she didn't feel like you could realistically get into the head of a woman in her 40s.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> You're... you're just too young.<eos> It was so nice to meet you, Hayley.<eos> Diana, thank you so much for your time.
Wait!<eos> Show me how to get there. I am going to have an escort.<eos> Right?<eos> That was the plan but as I said, there is a wrinkle.<eos> I will not be taking you.
Very... Well, she looks likable.<eos> Do you think she looks likable in that picture?<eos> CATHERINE: Have you ever seen Star Wars?<eos> This is a little bit like the end of Star Wars.<eos> The whole country thanks you for your service.
- ( sobbing )<eos> - She's going down.<eos> - She's going down.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly, but the crowd is drooling for you.
She never looks this humble.<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not sure what you're referring to, Mr. Ryan.<eos> This is my everyday attire.<eos> And I apologize if it offends you, but...
You've just spoken four complete sentences without providing one drop of pertinent information.<eos> I already realize my elevator has a situation and you being sorry in and of itself is not pertinent.<eos> Your checking out the problem is not pertinent.<eos> I doubt that you are even pertinent!<eos> But whoever you are, you better get this elevator moving in one minute or I will find you, fire you, and then make sure that you are fired from your next three jobs after that.
I just saw one.<eos> All right, right there.<eos> See there?<eos> That's your Honda Civic pussy.<eos> Gets you where you wanna go. No shame in this pussy at all.
I need you to do as I tell you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> UTHER:<eos> I need to get you and the boy away from here.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I can.
Rama Kushna says this will break down the walls between the planes.<eos> Even the afterlife will be affected.<eos> Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meanwhile, the House will drop you wherever you'd like.
I don't even want to waste another breath about the guy.<eos> And another thing!<eos> Next time I see Bratt, I will moonwalk all over his stupid face!<eos> Thank you all for coming in such short notice.<eos> It is with great sadness that I inform you that as of today I am retiring as head of the AVL.
It's worse alone on the sea.<eos> I don't get why...<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why are you so determined to give up?<eos> What brought you here?
Well?<eos> You were always the grown-up.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Er... yeah, I-I think you'd better get round here.<eos> PS, I know you two.
That toaster waffle, those muffins... that frozen children's treat?<eos> Poison!<eos> Deadly poisons.<eos> That's what's there.<eos> And what's waiting for you?
So that's her name, is it?<eos> Jade give two rides.<eos> I'll bet she did.<eos> And you admit you know her.<eos> Look at you two, holding each other like that.
I don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you should not come looking for it.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Eh?<eos> This one bested all of you?
Sorry, I thought you were mark.<eos> Did you see him at all today?<eos> Well, we heard a lot of banging.<eos> Sounded like he was packing things.<eos> Then the front door slammed. Did he say anything at all to you?
All of their power stems from their ability to bring back the dead.<eos> Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.<eos> - This sounds insane.<eos> - And so does being bulletproof.<eos> The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.
What else do you think we talked about?<eos> Clearly I have no idea.<eos> All this was his passion.<eos> So I made it my passion too.<eos> Everyone will be gawping at you.
Hurry up.<eos> This is a tisana made with fennel and rose hips.<eos> All together... it's going to make you better.<eos> They'll think you're a witch.<eos> Or worse, they'll call for you in the middle of the night to deliver babies.
That's why I was so proud and happy to wear them.<eos> Had I been married here and not in Italy, I should have worn them too.<eos> Don't be sad.<eos> Happy Christmas, dear, dear Philip.<eos> We must go back to the party because the guests are waiting for you.
You know about Salem?<eos> That was you?<eos> It was similar.<eos> They said it's the land of the free.<eos> It's unforgivable what they did to you.
Don't come over here.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, don't!<eos> Thank you all for being here today.<eos> To the boyle family, we welcome and thank you for being here and giving yourselves to this day.
That's a million dollars a round, baby.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your descent into Hell begins here, Mr. Wick.<eos> He's at the museum.<eos> Earl will guide you.
You, go.<eos> Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"<eos> at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.
Don't worry.<eos> Okay, look, this is all a part of our two-step process, all right?<eos> See, right now, you're crow loading...<eos> Yeah, you drank about, like, four or five entire crows 'cause I'm grinding one up for every bottle at this point.<eos> Yes, and it is that crow enzyme that's jacking you up, and that's why you look so beefy and so handsome.
He broke the thing's head clean off.<eos> It was gruesome.<eos> I still have nightmares about it.<eos> And I'm old.<eos> She told you what?
- And it works like this.<eos> - Uh, no...<eos> What do you do when you're tired?<eos> You want to rest.<eos> You go to sit down, it pushes you right back up in your workout.
I'll be outside.<eos> Let me know what you wanna do.<eos> You reached the Apartment of Mathematics, MIT.<eos> If you know your part in extension, you may dial it anytime.<eos> If you wish to speak to operator... please stay in line and someone would be with you as soon as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the incomparable Misty Holloway!<eos> Did he say "Misty," no?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - You're my precious ones.<eos> Misty loves you, yes, she does.
Definitely.<eos> Janie won't say shit.<eos> Put the word out, anybody ID's me at that party, they're green-lit.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Can I help you?
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.<eos> Smallpox butchered me down to the bone and, yes, I have other business than pissing.<eos> You know, in all of London, only your father believed you were still alive.<eos> It was a symptom of his madness.<eos> But he would talk to you, stand on the north bank of the river and call out to you on the other side.
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.<eos> Give us the bad news.<eos> As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer, I attended the funeral, and a ghost appeared... a son we all thought dead in Africa.<eos> James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Mr. Wilton, I asked you to do some digging.
James Keziah Delaney.<eos> Dear Lord Almighty, is that your brother? !<eos> Your father was poisoned.<eos> I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> One thing Africa did not cure is that I still love you.
"Say he falls in, the current takes him, how about that?"<eos> So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard" "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."
This is my pastime - fixing colours in cloth.<eos> The demand for flags is always high in times of war.<eos> So you are three things, yes?<eos> You are a doctor... you are a merchant... and you are a spy.<eos> Unless you tell me who sent you, I will have to ask you to leave at the point of a gun.
I missed you. I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> Because, otherwise, you would've come to me and made very loud declarations.<eos> I would, yes.<eos> Is it my loudness that troubles you?
The assassin we sent to kill Delaney is dead.<eos> The British want you dead.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
I saw the papers with my own eyes.<eos> The assignation they were trying to make her sign gave Nootka to the Crown and only the Crown.<eos> Fucking snakes!<eos> If we didn't have so much shit on the Duke of Richmond, - they would have had her.<eos> - Who tipped you off?
You said I'm a weakness.<eos> I wasn't weak.<eos> I will fix that.<eos> I'll get Brace to fix that.<eos> In the cell, I called you "James".
A monopoly.<eos> Fanciful, of course.<eos> I want to meet with the Embassy in Paris.<eos> No.<eos> You assign to the United States, where someone will kill you.
You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?
Carried you across the foreshore.<eos> A tiny baby in her arms.<eos> Innocent and sweet.<eos> She waded in.<eos> Held you under, until the bubbles stopped!
Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
What are you doing?<eos> No. Go away.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> I brought this for you.
And an element of strategy.<eos> So get to it.<eos> Arrest the bastard.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Mr. Chichester, this is the man I told you about...
Well, you don't appear to be swaggering now.<eos> I need to speak to Carlsbad himself.<eos> I need him to take a message to Thomas Jefferson and the President of the United States.<eos> In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me that he would find me an emissary to Thomas Jefferson.<eos> So just tell me what you want to say to Carlsbad, and I'll stitch you up and set you loose.
- Mrs. Delaney!<eos> Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.
That bitch is on the gallows... before Mass!<eos> Down there.<eos> Perhaps now you will listen to me.<eos> This diamond... this is yours.<eos> I have a man that will take you to Paris and you will stay there until this business is done.
They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!<eos> The ninth level of hell will welcome you.
- Are you Mrs. Fitz?<eos> Well, Ezra's booked us yesterday to take him and his wife up to kick off their honeymoon.<eos> When yesterday?<eos> Morning around, 10 o'clock through The Radley concierge.<eos> Why would Ezra book you on a hot air balloon ride if he wasn't planning on marrying you?
Your mother's a whore!<eos> Get the hell off of me!<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> Go to hell, commies!<eos> No one wants you.
It's been a while since anyone came through Canaan.<eos> How long?<eos> Since April 8th, 1987?<eos> Why would you disturb those things?<eos> They don't belong to you.
You took a risk.<eos> We took a risk.<eos> But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?
20 years ago... King Pastoria and the magic realm fought The Beast Forever.<eos> They fought bravely.<eos> And they lost.<eos> If it were not for me, Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.
They fought bravely.<eos> And they lost.<eos> If it were not for me, Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.<eos> I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.<eos> I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods.
The Beast that comes will not take the form of fire.<eos> It will be far, far worse.<eos> Those girls who leapt to their deaths, their magic did not come from Mistress West.<eos> It came from The Beast itself.<eos> This is a Beast who knows you.
Only that one is a lie.<eos> Which one is that?<eos> Oz is a land of enchantment.<eos> Magic is its heart.<eos> Yet this enchantment could not save you from The Beast Forever.
What do they get out of it?<eos> The escape of the King from SS custody would disgrace the SS and consolidate the Army's Commander-in-Chief in his position of power here, and not just here... the repercussions would be felt all the way to Berlin.<eos> We have the support of the general staff in this business.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> The General will see you both now.
I'm just glad I never managed to chase you out of the artistic photo business.<eos> Glamour.<eos> We need it more than ever now.<eos> Whatever it is you're up to, you be careful, Superintendent.<eos> Arthur will take you half the way, then another car will take you on.
Tomorrow morning you will be ready?<eos> - For Bluejacket?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You will come to the back of the hospital, an ambulance is waiting.<eos> The army will help you this one time.
Go ahead, yeah.<eos> On the couch?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, so what brings you here today?
Ma'am, where's the church?<eos> Well, it's not a church anymore.<eos> That's when I hit rock bottom.<eos> I guess the worst part of it for me was that I let down my kids, I let down my husband.<eos> Raise your hand if life ever let you down.
I almost forgot too.<eos> Forgot what?<eos> Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.<eos> This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.<eos> Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.
I forgot to mention that...<eos> Yeah, a tiger.<eos> This is Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, and these are some of his people.<eos> I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.<eos> Now, what brings you to our fair land?
The Sanctuary?<eos> Where Negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
Let's do it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Come by tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork done.<eos> God bless you.
Let's do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Come by tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork done.<eos> God bless you.<eos> God bless you.
They have you for three hours.<eos> That's all they paid for, that's all they get.<eos> If they try get you to stay longer, tell them no.<eos> We've shot here before. They're cool. I'm not finished.<eos> They try to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, politely tell them to fuck right off and call me.
BERRINGER: I had him follow you after you left town so abruptly last night.<eos> I assume the one-legged man was Long John Silver.<eos> Would you like to tell me what the meeting was about?<eos> I was summoned by him in a failed attempt to extort money from me.<eos> I would hope that your spy also informed you that four of my six men attempted to arrest him and died in the effort.
- Nothing helpful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> [ metal clinking ] ELEANOR: You're about to make a terrible mistake and I am asking you to reconsider.<eos> I am entitled to exercise these sentences at my discretion.<eos> But I'm not asking you to cancel the hangings. I'm asking you to cancel the theater around them.
No.<eos> Well, we are. So...<eos> Sorry, I was dealin' with the... What?<eos> Your...<eos> Did I tell you what I like about this place,
I don't think that any of us can ever truly know what was... what was going on inside PJ's mind right at that moment... especially you.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But can you tell me what you were thinking when you entered a vicious legal battle with your son's wife over the right to keep him on life support?<eos> We were, holding out hope that he might wake up.<eos> But despite every doctor telling you that was impossible, you still publicly attacked a rape victim for weeks before ultimately changing your mind?
Hey!<eos> Look out!<eos> Drags you down in the morning...
Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Falhadi.<eos> - Right here.<eos> And, finally, Mr. Mohada.<eos> My colleague will escort you to your cars.
We wouldn't be aware of any of this if it weren't for you.<eos> So?<eos> Honestly... it's hard to listen to what's said in this room, 'cause what I'm not hearing is a plan.<eos> "Follow the money," which... believe me, will be much harder than you think.<eos> That's what you'll be doing when the world rolls right over you.
It's happening right now in front of your faces.<eos> We have O'Keefe.<eos> We have a disinformation campaign designed to discredit the president-elect.<eos> And as of today, we have boots on the ground... like the protesters I had to wade through to get here.<eos> That seem familiar to any of you?
They believe you to be the king, Lord.<eos> Then let him be the king.<eos> King for the day.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you and may God bless you all.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just saying what we want to hear.<eos> You invited me here, and then you rejected me.<eos> But I sat outside your house all night and I followed you here, so you'd have no choice but to let me get into your machine.
You're going to help us find her?<eos> Find her?<eos> I have her.<eos> I am responsible... for delivering all 42 of you to the law in Port Royal.<eos> Let me dispel that notion for you right away.
If I catch even a whiff of you dog whistling these guys...<eos> You got it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Everything like I told you.
That's one thing about Rebecca:<eos> she gets things done, no matter what it takes.<eos> I suppose I shouldn't be mad at her, either.<eos> My fault.<eos> I put you both in impossible situations.
The other lives in a cave and talks to sheep.<eos> They each think the other has it better.<eos> I regret to inform you, the Baudelaires' fate was worse.<eos> Chop-chop, Baudelaires!<eos> Now that I've found you a suitable guardian, I'm going to take you to your new home before banking hours begin.
It is.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Her grandmother.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I'll join you shortly.
In terms of your obligations to him, there are plenty of ways for a man like that to retain satisfaction in a place like Nassau with little or no participation from you.<eos> You'd likely retain as much freedom in that regard as you desired.<eos> To rise from where you began... to where you now stand, I cannot imagine the road you've traveled.<eos> The humiliations... and the sacrifices and the defeats... and the illusions maintained at so great a cost to your sense of self.<eos> But that road has led you to me.
Since the dawn of humankind we have reached for dreams beyond our grasp.<eos> We gazed at the birds and built planes to fly.<eos> We gazed at the moon and built rockets to reach it.<eos> Throughout history, we have transcended our evolution with technology pushing through to new frontiers.<eos> Now Alterplex's visionary CEO, August Reynard asks you to gaze at the energy challenge we face and, once again, push through to a new frontier.
But you will.<eos> I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.
Do you know which way downtown is?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Are you following me?<eos> What?<eos> Did Vanessa send you to follow me?
- Sit down.<eos> Lose the act.<eos> - what... what's happening?<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I told you I don't know where my husband is.
- I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.
You recognize that cashier?<eos> Because he recognized you.<eos> Picked you out of a lineup, no problem.<eos> I get it, this looks bad.<eos> But like I told you, I would never, ever hurt Austin.
- Last activity on her cellphone came from a cabin she owns on Burke Lake.<eos> 60% of married adults have had an affair! - 60%!<eos> - Quinn!<eos> There is no replacing Frankie, but if anyone is qualified to uphold the values he held so dear, it's Vice President-elect Cyrus Beene, the man Governor Vargas himself chose to be his successor in the event of such a tragedy.<eos> God bless you, and God bless America.
! -Mister--<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Mr. Lincoln.<eos> God bless you, sir.
If you don't know, why are you so freaked out?<eos> Because of the book.<eos> Because of my friendship with Charles.<eos> I figured he found out.<eos> But I swear, I swear that I didn't know that he... She was the one who was torturing you.
Father Corman added something extra to your Communion wafer.<eos> You drugged me?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> You're among Catholic allies here.<eos> Our clan protects you from your Protestant enemies.
Enough.<eos> Tell your son I will meet with him in private.<eos> And tell him I will accept his proposal.<eos> You disobeyed my orders.<eos> I told you to find Darnley.
I am offering you this chance to beg for my forgiveness.<eos> I won't offer again.<eos> And I won't beg.<eos> You surround yourself with Protestants, your guards, your advisors, your brother.<eos> Let me go and my clan will protect you.
I'm tired of changing our identities, never settling down.<eos> And it's not right for Will.<eos> I mean, he's getting older, and he's asking me questions that I can't answer.<eos> Look, I have to put a stop to this.<eos> But if Hope finds you...
That'd be me.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> It's so good to see you again.<eos> I escorted you and your clients onto my base.<eos> I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.
We're starting a social group.<eos> I'm not a gay man.<eos> I'll invite a few young ladies like yourself.<eos> The CDC wants to call it gay-related immune deficiency, or GRID.<eos> I'm asking you to dig deep for our brothers, Ms Visionary Roma Guy.
What's he saying?<eos> He's saying that a U.S. soldier killed a prisoner in cold blood after he surrendered.<eos> He was American.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> The less any of you know about where this came from, the better.
And you are going to be the one who's going to help me do it. - No!<eos> - You sent him!<eos> Take him!<eos> All of you!<eos> Will you stay here? And let ISIL slaughter you?
The Internet is rotting your brain - and destroying your wonderful souls!<eos> - Mm-hmm. Seems like you're having a parenting crisis.<eos> - What? - If only there was a resource you could use to get helpful information.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Get out your White Pages, find your local library, fight through some bums, and get a book from the '50s that tells you to beat us.
All I did was turn off the happy gas.<eos> I was passing through your little hamlet when I stumbled up on you.<eos> The beauty queens who've been stunted by lies! No.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Brothers and sisters, the gas... the gas, the gas, the gas, the gas, the gas shows you what you want to see!
We try that now, we drain the generator.<eos> Yeah, okay, so we just power the door and get the hell out of here.<eos> And then the lights go out and the Glimmers tear us all apart.<eos> Even if you get the doors open, you won't make it.<eos> They'll swarm the car, rip you to shreds.
Now...<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions. And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.<eos> Jace is not a traitor.<eos> Point of fact. Clary said Jace called to warn you about Valentine's trap, which got me thinking...
He has my sister.<eos> What else aren't you two telling me?<eos> The angel, he... He showed us something.<eos> Just now, on the rooftop, he showed us both a vision of a demon that can destroy the Sword.<eos> How do you know that's what he was telling you?
Execute Clary Fairchild on sight.<eos> Care to rethink that?<eos> You'd be rotting in the City of Bones had she not insisted we save your life.<eos> Then consider this my way of returning the favor.<eos> By killing her, I'll be saving you from yourselves.
You need to be careful.<eos> The Downworld's falling apart.<eos> I'm guessing the meeting didn't go so well, then?<eos> The vampires and the Seelies want Clary dead.<eos> They'll be hunting for you.
We've got company.<eos> Wait!<eos> By the Angel, Max!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I tracked you here.
BARBARA: Tetch?<eos> Nygma!<eos> How could you let this happen? Us?<eos> You're the one that trusted him.<eos> I asked you to do one thing:
Overwatch!<eos> You heard the boss.<eos> This is an eyes-only operation for you.<eos> I have eyes on.<eos> Boys, I just put you on a separate channel.
- Yeah, I feel really sad.<eos> - Yeah, me too.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Finally ran into you.
Sister washed her hands of him years ago.<eos> And how the hell would she know he was here?<eos> - Called her? - He didn't call anybody.<eos> He's a black-out drunk.<eos> He washes up on you again, I want to be notified.
- Want some?<eos> It's good.<eos> Salty.<eos> Slurpy.<eos> Naw, I'm not hungry, but I'm gonna grab a beer and come join you.
Lucky for you, I never liked Leonov. Sit.<eos> John Diggle, it's good to see you.<eos> Now you're my favorite American.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what brings you to Russia?
- Club soda. - All right.<eos> You got it.<eos> Look at you with the nice wrapping.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all so much for doing this.
- Go somewhere?<eos> - Yeah, anywhere, I don't know, some place that isn't this fucking house.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just uhm, let me go freshen up really quick.<eos> - Hi folks what can I get for you?
Maia!<eos> You came too.<eos> Simon is quite valiant and chivalrous, unlike any of the other Night Children I've ever known.<eos> You're all free to leave.<eos> My servant will escort you out of the Court to safety.
Where do they usually hang out?<eos> These days?<eos> Guyana.<eos> My bros, my bros.<eos> Your girlfriends don't accept you.
Your girlfriends don't accept you.<eos> They want to change you.<eos> They want to make your apartment look more "adult."<eos> They want to make you a new dude.<eos> But I accept you as the dude that you are.
Mr Malone's allegation was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.<eos> Not quite, sir.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Found to be down to misinterpretation.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, my sergeant here will show you out, allowing me to get on with my enquiries.
The high and mighty Cotton Mather is here.<eos> Alone?<eos> This need to copulate. To thrive and spurt.<eos> Even animals only rut in season.<eos> This urge besets you night and day.
An angel she was.<eos> I've learned that there is more than one kind of angel.<eos> Gloriana, believe me, whether you remember or not, we have loved each other.<eos> We have known each other.<eos> I do feel as if I have seen you, perhaps in a dream.
- I'm in sin!<eos> Anybody who won't confess, how do they think they'll ever get saved?<eos> They won't!<eos> They flat-out won't!<eos> Now, what I want to ask you to do right now, and only if you feel it... dig real deep down.
Now, I'm not talking about no flaxseeds, no.<eos> I'm not talking about no lettuce seeds, no.<eos> I'm not talking about no small, tiny seeds, no.<eos> I'm talking a beanstalk seed of faith!<eos> And I promise you, God gonna bless you with a harvest like you've never seen.
If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.<eos> Our army should be Westerosi.<eos> And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?<eos> You are.<eos> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.
Father got careless.<eos> That's what Mama says.<eos> Will you shut up about Mama?<eos> "Mama, Mama, Mama."<eos> Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.
Quite a day.<eos> Much to be done.<eos> Doctors to reprimand and correct, Nursing staffs to organize.<eos> But we shall persevere.<eos> Am I hurting you?
That's really the best you can do?<eos> I take true offense to that tone.<eos> Take offense?<eos> You're a spy and a whore, which I find offensive.<eos> So, do I kill you myself. Or turn you over to be hanged?
Interesting.<eos> Now, general schnaetzle of general pope's army, Encamped nearby awaiting orders to move on the enemy, Has fallen ill.<eos> Duty precludes him coming to us.<eos> I'd like you to go provide treatment.<eos> Miss hastings will accompany you.
But localized still.<eos> Do you want to lose a limb, soldier?<eos> Or even expire?<eos> You must maintain a sanitary field.<eos> If you have no one to dress it for you, You must do it yourself.
How do we know when it's time to go to work?<eos> When the overseer say it time.<eos> You are your own overseers now.<eos> Soon, you will have paying work, So you must oversee your own time.<eos> I gathered some books for you.
His mama loves the lord.<eos> You two are very close.<eos> Ought to be.<eos> When I was fresh fish, Other fellas hassled me on account of my size.<eos> He stood up for you.
She asked, and I gave her permission.<eos> Well, at least one of our girls. Hasn't lost her sense of respect.<eos> Father and I had a marvelous trip.<eos> The cousins send their love and randolph devoured your cakes.<eos> Lucy has prepared a meal for you.
And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang.<eos> We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope.<eos> Some people have no manners.<eos> You're all prisoners.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing you're just tiny little cogs in a giant, absurd machine,
Nygma's got a big mouth.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, let me get this straight.<eos> You mean this whole stupid riddle thing with Nygma is real?<eos> What? He clearly knows everything already.<eos> I heard a rumor he hurt you pretty bad a while back, both of you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd love that.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?
We came here in peace.<eos> We entered your city by mistake.<eos> Uh, we mean you no harm.<eos> Please... just let me and my friends go, and I promise, we'll never come back here again.<eos> My brethren have seen you.
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here.<eos> 'Okay, guys, let's gather around.'<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, all of you were at Jordan's premiere last night or you heard about it so I don't have to tell you that Rainer's not well.
Cade, take me.<eos> Enough from the angel on his shoulder.<eos> I'm doing you a favor, Damon.<eos> This exact choice has defined your life since the moment you and your brother first laid eyes on Elena.<eos> Being torn between the two has only brought both of you an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering.
I am not a selfish person.<eos> I was vilified for doing what anyone in my position would do.<eos> You went back for your computer.<eos> That's not about survival, that's about stuff.<eos> It was about instinct, but thank you for reminding me why I'm doing this and for helping me to improve upon my experiment.
Hey, buddy.<eos> Mom, how did y'all even find us?<eos> They helped.<eos> Hello, lads.<eos> They have a thermal imaging satellite that saw you.
They killed my friend.<eos> Your friend was stupid.<eos> You're all...<eos> Do you know what you've done?<eos> Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?
That's not good enough. I lost a friend.<eos> I almost lost one of my boys.<eos> And we apologize...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Anything like that happens again... anything... And I will burn you down.
Mummy always was a talented hunter.<eos> Just somewhat... Confused about obeying orders.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Lady Bevell cleared up that...<eos> Confusion. And I suspect she told you that the American hunters are a dying breed.
Walked in this way.<eos> - Can I...<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> We'll be led by you.<eos> Did she tell you about the flowers?
Aren't you also seeking justice for Joey Campbell?<eos> We heard a young man by the name of Cory Grant may have seen something.<eos> First I heard about it.<eos> Figured you knew everything popping off in The Houses.<eos> What did Cory tell you?
Even in the darkest night, there is a truth.<eos> Yes!<eos> When your friends, your allies, they forsake you...<eos> You're welcome to join us.<eos> When your friends and allies forsake you, there is a truth.
I'd hate to disgrace your good name and the name of Al Funcoot.<eos> Plus, I'll be very busy the next few weeks working on my inventions.<eos> And learning how to prepare roast beef.<eos> You will participate in my theatrical performance!<eos> I would prefer it if you participate voluntarily, but as I believe Mr. Poe has explained to you, I can act loco parentheses.
I would prefer it if you participate voluntarily, but as I believe Mr. Poe has explained to you, I can act loco parentheses.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> Poco De Laurentiis.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> The point is, I can order you to participate, and you must obey.
Oh. You will suddenly find yourself in the enviable position of being a struggling actress in middle age.<eos> It's almost too good to be true.<eos> It is.<eos> Justice Strauss, Count Olaf is...<eos> Count Olaf is welcoming you into his life by making you an important part of this theatrical enterprise.
Anything? Would you, for instance, consider marrying me during tomorrow night's performance?<eos> I would never, ever marry you.<eos> Hmm. Children... your sister is like a stick behind a stubborn mule.<eos> My sister's not a stick.<eos> Any animal owner will tell you that a stubborn mule will move toward the carrot because it wants the reward of food... and away from the stick because it wants to avoid the punishment of rump pain.
My fellow Americans... Due to recent events, we live in a time of uncertainty, leaving us with more questions than answers.<eos> Tonight, I hope to put us back on the path to confidence and strength.<eos> I do not believe that we can survive as a nation without transparency.<eos> Without truth, there can be no trust.<eos> As your President, I assure you that I and my administration will be honest and open on all matters, regardless of how the truth reflects upon me.
Divine providence, gentlemen.<eos> When the Lord is on your side, you cannot lose.<eos> Good for twice that much?<eos> Roll again.<eos> Gentlemen, the Lord thanks you in advance for your generous tithe.
Mademoiselle Beaufort, this is a surgical theater, not an atelier.<eos> Am I interfering?<eos> That we are having this conversation is, by nature, an interference.<eos> Kindly take your canvas and absquatulate.<eos> I asked you to depart.
a cowboy is singin<eos> The local chapter of the daughters of the confederacy. Met monday in the home of mrs. J.W. Gilmer.<eos> Mrs. Gilmer's niece mary catherine. Delighted with a beautiful rendition of Jesus loves.<eos> A fine time was had by all.<eos> This is scarlett o'connor peabody, ladies, Reminding you-all to mind your manners. And always speak your mind.
Don't get yourself caught with a pig in a poke.<eos> I'm Froggy, and here at Froggy's Hoggies, I guarantee you the most top quality hogs for all your smoking, roasting, broiling, and barbequing needs.<eos> We do the killin', you do the grilling'.<eos> Come to Froggy's off of Tadpole Street.<eos> Tell them Froggy sent you.
You hate your birthday.<eos> I do.<eos> But you know what? Everyone I have ever known, including Charlie, has tried to fix it.<eos> Did we, um...<eos> Did we interrupt something with the two of you when... ?
Mrs. Phelps, I'm Scottie Hargrave.<eos> I'm here to talk about my son.<eos> I understand you adopted him.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> I told you I'm innocent.
You okay, you hit?<eos> You hit?<eos> Rose?<eos> You good?<eos> No matter where you go, my catchers will find you and drag you back.
- Shh! Shh! - Wait, what?<eos> - What? - What's he talking about?<eos> - Guys, let's be honest, we were bullying.<eos> We need to just take our punishment and walk away and not listen to anything else anyone says.<eos> Emily betrayed you.
Tomas Vitek.<eos> Where's Vitek?<eos> Who?<eos> Reality check.<eos> The problem with you Green Berets is someone told you you're special, and you bought it.
It isn't counsel's place to assume facts not in evidence.<eos> Did you merely happen by the building on South...<eos> Counsel is leading the witness.<eos> And counsel forgets this is a preliminary hearing, not a trial.<eos> What brought you to that abandoned building on South Kimbark, Sergeant?
Then there is no reason we shouldn't see what's there.<eos> This is a good time to break. We'll have a look.<eos> My brothers and sisters...<eos> Come to jihad and feel the honor and happiness we are feeling.<eos> What prevents you from attaining martyrdom and the pleasure of our Lord?
- Yes.<eos> "Personable" is a P word.<eos> That was flippant.<eos> Y'know, I didn't hire both of you recalcitrants just because you're good with computers.<eos> I hired you because you're waywards, and one of the ways I like to give back is by being a beacon with waywards.
Do you hear me? !<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you want to play, sir?<eos> We're missing aa goalie.<eos> Do I look like a goalie to you?
Step back, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, I'm with Homeland.<eos> What is this?<eos> I work for Homeland!<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
She was a threat to you, sir.<eos> To your candidacy, - to everything that we've worked for.<eos> - A threat?<eos> Are you serious right now?<eos> I sa-saw two of you, Frankie.
Your entire portfolio.<eos> Yeah, forget it.<eos> Ten percent penalty for early withdrawal, plus another 32% in taxes.<eos> Mr. Byrde, there seems to be a disconnect vis-à-vis large wire transfers and your expectations about withdrawing it in cash.<eos> Sir, by the end of business today, you're gonna have close to $8 million in four separate accounts at your bank, and I suspect that that puts you in a woefully undercapitalized position relative to your obligations to the FDIC.
Roderick.<eos> - Your dear sister, Roderick, shall find exactly the caring, supportive environment which she needs.<eos> - Yes, this will do nicely.<eos> This is where I will sit as I write you letters.<eos> - Let me introduce you to one of our physicians.
This is traumatizing for the baby.<eos> No, I know.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> - I'm gonna help you out.
- Hi! - Hello.<eos> Good to see you. - Hey, Tom.<eos> - Patti, hi, how are you?<eos> - Oh, Lucy, hello.<eos> Nice to see you. I hope you guys like tofu curry.
And I saw you with those young girls... you were amazing.<eos> That's the Scarlett we need to put out there, okay?<eos> We do a surprise performance with a meet and greet after.<eos> Blast it out only on social media, no press.<eos> Just for the people that love you.
Previously on "Colony"...<eos> You have been assigned to one of the Authority's labor camps and distribution centers.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who ordered you to search my house?
Make right on your promise.<eos> We're on the eve of the election.<eos> That ship has sailed.<eos> So, I should just call my man standing over Sandra right now and tell him to drop the hammer?<eos> I watched you two together.
I want to thank you for thinking differently.<eos> Thank you for thinking about tomorrow, not yesterday. About progress, not decline. About equality, not bigotry.<eos> Thank you for thinking we can really be a nation of the people, by the people and for the people.<eos> IHoy si somos una nación de la gente, por la gente, y para toda la gente!<eos> God bless you. And may God bless these United States of America.
So, seven UN Marines started charging and shooting at you?<eos> What's weird is that there was only seven of them.<eos> That's less than a third of their full garrison.<eos> Why would they... Let's just focus on the facts.<eos> Seven Blues in a line, coming hard at you.
Before the Blues were charging at us,<eos> Hillman spotted a stray Ag Drone over our position.<eos> You need to check that drone's feed.<eos> We'll certainly look into that.<eos> So seven UN Marines were charging you...
There's nothing doom and gloom about it.<eos> Easy come, easy go, that's Betsey Day for you.<eos> Can't accuse me of ever lying about that.<eos> Sonny!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, if you could follow me, I will escort you down to the shelter.
King Richard killed both princes in the Tower.<eos> There is nobody for England now but you.<eos> Step forward.<eos> Which one of you is John de la Pole, the Earl of Lincoln?<eos> The dead York king named you his heir before the battle.
And if you roll threes, you want to move 12, right?<eos> Yeah, you want control and clarity.<eos> You want to be the master of your fate.<eos> And you can do it, because you have that much power inside of you.<eos> You have The Light to use, to focus, to shape the world around you.
Bud, we should go.<eos> "Bowl of wangs" is how it started with those lifeguards.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You two are best friends!<eos> And everyone who knows you can see that, even if we don't understand how.
Even though at times like these, goodness and grace are poor substitutes for the smiling faces of our lost boys.<eos> Please accept my... my deepest sympathies on your loss... on our losses.<eos> And I would like to publicly thank the LaBorde Sheriff's Office for working so diligently to... to take these monsters off our streets.<eos> I only wish we could've done it sooner.<eos> God bless and keep you all.
We don't have endless funds.<eos> What gets cut?<eos> What I'm saying is this isn't something nice we can do...<eos> And it's gonna take vision for us to step up.<eos> So I'm asking you to dig deep for our brothers, Ms. Visionary Roma Guy.
"The German proletariat must repudiate the bourgeois politics of trade union economism..."<eos> We ain't gonna be victims!<eos> "Mahler and Schubert are shining examples of the universal Marxist..."<eos> Your government lies to you.<eos> It oppresses you.
Will found a kid hiding inside, helped him escape. But now they're out looking for the kid.<eos> All right, so let me get this right.<eos> You sabotage our operation with the the RAP and quit the group, yet when you need help, we're supposed to pretend it didn't happen?<eos> I am the reason you escaped the Occupation.<eos> And I helped you with BB.
"Questions?" The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> He might.<eos> No, He won't.<eos> He'll turn His head and stare through you like glass.
But we're not possessed.<eos> We're not puking up green bile.<eos> This thing isn't trying to inhabit you.<eos> It's trying to control you, consume you.<eos> And if we don't separate what binds you, it will succeed.
Maybe you should go next door, see what that's about.<eos> Check out that very live bird.<eos> Mmm. I'll do that because I, too, would like to find a simple solution to this problem.<eos> The owners have had a few offers fall through, so they're very motivated.<eos> I'm taking you to the kitchen and I mean it this time.
Repeat.<eos> We are ready to execute.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> You two are in the wrong place.<eos> I told you to stay out of this.
- All of them, but the guests aren't in at this time of day.<eos> - The hell's going on?<eos> - It sounds like a hammering.<eos> Hey, are you the police?<eos> Thank God, someone finally called you.
Dev shoot this deer last night?<eos> Maybe, I... I don't know that's... I didn't see...<eos> Look, that's not what<eos> - I'm trying to tell you.<eos> - Oh, so nobody ever informed you that hunting at night with a spotlight is poaching.
Was there anybody else there besides Wesen?<eos> There were people.<eos> Very primitive.<eos> They called anyone who wasn't Wesen "Gehfleisch."<eos> I'm sorry, they called you what?
A concern for the conditions in which miners work, a wish to improve them.<eos> Have a care, or you'll be called a Jacobin.<eos> Like yourself?<eos> In truth, I'm no friend of revolution.<eos> To be governed by the mob is to see the end of civil and religious liberties, as those gentlemen would tell you.
I confess, that disquiets me.<eos> The Poldarks are quick to anger and slow to forgive, but you?<eos> Have you become so like Ross that you can no longer let go ill will?<eos> Here we are in the same room bound by ties of blood, yet unable to meet.<eos> Will you not let me bring you together?
Did you hear about the goings in St Ann's?<eos> Another corn ship raided, two young tackers shot.<eos> Unwin assures me it's only a matter of time before Dr Enys will be released.<eos> And in the meantime, he receives the best possible treatment.<eos> Did I not order you to rest, Lieutenant Armitage?
And a wife and two children to support?<eos> My wife is in agreement with me.<eos> Good man.<eos> Thank you, much obliged.<eos> God bless you, sir.
I thought Caroline was different.<eos> I thought she had imagination, yet she seems incapable of imagining what it's like to come home to a life which is utterly vacuous.<eos> My mother's no different.<eos> She tries to tell me of the latest intrigues, the newest fashions.<eos> Does that not infuriate you?
Bodrugan.<eos> I'll get my hat.<eos> Gentlemen, the voting to elect Truro's next Member of Parliament will now commence.<eos> Oh, Mr Buscombe!<eos> Erm... Now, that contract I obtained for you last month... It may have to be cancelled.
But you are no such creature, Margaret Wells.<eos> You are a leech grown fat upon the sins of others.<eos> Not true!<eos> A vile parasite engaged in a brutal trade.<eos> I fine you 100 pounds for running a disorderly house, and if I see you before me again, I'll have you whipped and transported.
Airway pressure's stabilized.<eos> The bone perforated the esophageal wall.<eos> I can't make any predictions until I get a look at the aortoesophageal fistula.<eos> I'm done in the chest. Fill your boots, guys.<eos> I'm gonna leave you to it, then.
Consider me your confidante.<eos> I can't control Big Foster.<eos> As Bren'in, I shouldn't have these doubts.<eos> I should be sure of my feelings.<eos> By your own admission, this man hurt you.
Everybody listen up.<eos> You have a new supervisor starting today.<eos> His name is Mike Ross.<eos> Mike is from Pearson Specter Litt, and he knows more about law than all of you combined.<eos> So, if Mike tells you to do something, you do it.
Can I help you in a minute? Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, everyone, can you listen up for a sec?<eos> Marissa... this won't take long.<eos> When Nathan introduced me, he told you that I used to work at Pearson Specter Litt.
- You took the inn boat?<eos> - It's too slow.<eos> I got a guy.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> The Coast Guard's gonna pick you up.
Somehow I blew it and... well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.<eos> This is truly the saddest day of my life.<eos> Okay, I guess I'll speak first.<eos> Jason and I are the mistakes.<eos> We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so... we should go to the Bad Place.
Lord Darnley, show these people that their queen has brought them more than words.<eos> I bring you food for your families.<eos> Thank you, Your Majesty.<eos> God save Your Majesty.<eos> God bless you.
- Don't be.<eos> Uh, your mom wasn't even there when the... Well, we'll call it the unlawful entry of your house.<eos> How was Catalina?<eos> Great, except for the food.<eos> Oh, were the two of you cooking for yourselves?
Pay phones?<eos> Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?<eos> Danny... told you he gave me his cell?
Great. So now we just let them go?<eos> This is an outrage, captain, truly. Is it?<eos> Lieutenant, we have what we need.<eos> Well, gentlemen, We have confirmed your statement.<eos> And the state of california thanks you for you cooperation.
They told me to pound sand.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Teddy Gunth!<eos> So I told them, "You listen to me right now.<eos> You send me his goddamn audition tape right now, or I'm gonna have Screen Actors Guild on you so fast, your shoes are gonna curl."
You can't kick him off the Whitecaps.<eos> You're right.<eos> We could do a lot worse.<eos> Like... like arrest him, for example.<eos> Please, I-I don't know who told you what, but... but it's not true.
May we have a word... privately?<eos> You can wait like the other ambassadors.<eos> Echo, leave us... please.<eos> We were right to be concerned about Trishanakru.<eos> Rafel is gonna challenge you for control.
William of Orange paid you to hurt me, to take my son, - poison my Minister.<eos> - Poison what minister?<eos> You think me a fool.<eos> You believe it is William who hates you?<eos> And, trust me, everybody hates you.
Believe me. I have had a hand in it.<eos> You tell yourself that.<eos> Your brother listens to opinions.<eos> Does he cock his ear, like so?<eos> - Fixes you with his eyes?
My king!<eos> The Lord is making himself very clear to you, Your Majesty.<eos> By throwing chandeliers at me?<eos> By disturbing your sleep.<eos> Compelling you to ruminate.
And you appear to be frustrated.<eos> It pains me to say, I am, madame.<eos> Since you, in the past, assured me so clearly of your desire to help my family.<eos> The desire was never lacking, madame.<eos> In any case, I helped you as far as I was able.
Madame de Reynaud, was this the powder?<eos> Mine came in silver phials.<eos> For which I paid a premium, no doubt.<eos> Tell me again how you came by it.<eos> As I told you before.
As I told you before.<eos> I would speak to my friends, they would speak to theirs.<eos> I would settle my account and the powders would arrive.<eos> When will you release me?<eos> I fear that giving you freedom now may place you at risk.
You will soon fall into it.<eos> I have a fear of heights.<eos> You're both probably wondering why I asked you here.<eos> Whatever the reason, Sire, no doubt, it is a good one.<eos> I asked you here because I wish the two of you to marry.
I got word that you called.<eos> I assume you spoke with my attorney,<eos> Monsieur Ron Laflamme?<eos> Yes, I did speak to Ron Laflamme.<eos> What, pray tell, did he tell you when he called you?
So, the back pain was a sign.<eos> We could've caught this months ago.<eos> Let's focus on the fact that we caught it now.<eos> It can be treated surgically.<eos> Dr. Reese will do a neurosurgery consult with you, and then our head of neurosurgery, dr. Abrams, will come down and go over the details.
You heard the part where i don't have powers, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But they don't know that.<eos> mace: You know you're being lied to, right?<eos> I can only speculate as to who hired you -- probably some burly guys in dog masks -- but they're working for senator nadeer, and what she really wants is inside this case.
You sound like James.<eos> I don't like your brother, but in this case I'm inclined to agree with him.<eos> I didn't come here to ask for your marital advice.<eos> Lord Moray needs to find a new way to move his goods.<eos> The crown will compensate you, of course.
We're down to two girls.<eos> This move is too much risk.<eos> Lydia Quigley has her girls sucking the law, the clergy, and the whole King's bench!<eos> If she kicks me, I'll bite her back.<eos> So what brought you to London?
Oh, please.<eos> I'm deranged with love.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I'd look a fool in front of the whole town!<eos> Is that what troubles you?
Come sit down, come on.<eos> Mr. Lennox has often spoken of you.<eos> Really?<eos> Harriet knows all about us.<eos> I never thought I'd see you again.
She's dead.<eos> My mother commands my presence.<eos> You're leaving me, again?<eos> I must, in case the hag has left me any coinage.<eos> Haxby will escort you while I'm gone.
- Mary Cooper, fuck off!<eos> This lady's been waiting to see you.<eos> I trust there is no trouble with our business.<eos> None.<eos> Then what in the name of all sense brings you here?
Tomorrow we re-open in Greek Street.<eos> Culls might not come.<eos> You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell, and I've asked you to sting Margaret Wells.
I want to know who I'm risking the noose for.<eos> - I gave you Lord Fallon.<eos> - A foot soldier.<eos> I want a real name, the King of the Spartans.<eos> That's my surety, or I will help you no more.
Charles, speak to me, please.<eos> Speak to your mother.<eos> Help!<eos> Help, we need help now!<eos> The good Lord will always forgive you.
Not more than a glimpse.<eos> It was never something that could last for days.<eos> It could never last for years.<eos> Step forward.<eos> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He shall lift you up.
I see things I feel are true and I share them.<eos> I've noticed.<eos> And I'm worried about you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thank you so much for coming over.
And we're not open to shit, because we were here first.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I am trying to keep my cool.<eos> We don't care if you keep your cool or not.<eos> Because we've got you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look, they're patrolling all over.<eos> You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.
But, Gideon, do you really think she would do this?<eos> She should, because I love her.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> Her last chance at happiness and, perhaps, survival.<eos> And because I know you, and I know that John Knox's visit and the forces against you he exposed frightened you.
- What I would like is to be born into another family.<eos> To be powerless.<eos> You've no idea what it's like.<eos> You could tell me.<eos> Did they ask you to do that?
This could be your chance to give her a good spanking for being so cruel.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm in.<eos> James, I was wondering if I could speak with you about Emily Knox.<eos> I realize I may be overstepping, but I've seen the way she looks at you.
For murder?<eos> Yes, sirs.<eos> I'm a bad man.<eos> Did... did bad things.<eos> You know, like I... I told you.
- Dimoclat...<eos> - And should escape from this sad story...<eos> - Demcaca...<eos> - before another storm of melancholy<eos> - engulfs you in dampness and misery. - Dock.
No, I mean your real work... at home.<eos> Well, that's where it gets a little tricky.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're finally in a committed relationship where you know you should feel comfortable, so why is it that you're feeling completely uncomfortable?<eos> Maybe because the closer you get with Geils, the more you're realizing how many things separate you, and how can two people be right for each other when they want totally different things out of life?
You see, Dr. Kottbulle was developing artificially intelligent beings who would surely have hastened mankind's extinction from the Earth.<eos> Not a fan.<eos> In fact, let me show you a lecture we gave two years ago.<eos> What if I told you in 20 years, 90% of all relationships will be computer-to-computer?<eos> And what if I told you that these very same computers will murder you in your sleep?
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.<eos> - Sara.<eos> - It's okay, Ray, come in.<eos> And a thousand thanks for your service to the realm.<eos> If ever your travels bring you back, there will always be a seat at the Round Table for Sir Raymond of the Palms.
This place is sacred to me and my cousin.<eos> I thought it was the only place on Earth worthy enough to entertain you, Your Majesty.<eos> The Kryptonians were never very good at entertaining.<eos> Look. We know it was you.<eos> One of your bounty hunters gave you up.
People of Earth, do not be afraid.<eos> We have crossed a sea of stars in order to bring you a new way.<eos> A better way.<eos> I will be your Queen, and you will be my subjects.<eos> Obey our orders, and we will protect you.
So good.<eos> You know what I just realized?<eos> The first time we met was when the President got attacked.<eos> Makes this kind of a full circle thing for us.<eos> Though there are many stars in our celestial kingdom, only one will lead you down the correct path.
Or is it because he embezzled money from my husband?<eos> Rob lent me money and I'm paying him back.<eos> Or is it because you're so proud of his bags since his actual business went under?<eos> Or is it because he left his wife because he's scared of Spain?<eos> Mum, I didn't tell you about the business because I didn't want you to worry about me.
Admit it, Mother.<eos> France needs new leadership.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Charles fires me as his regent so he can rule the country by himself and he's not even ruling it.<eos> Charles fired you because you were a self-serving tyrant
- Stop.<eos> There is nothing you can say.<eos> Your actions have spoken for you.<eos> And if I am going to be alone, then I will save Canonbie myself.<eos> Reverend Knox, thank you so much for coming.
Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will spend a dark night of the soul, after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.<eos> Capital East Telecom has informed me that it's repairing the network as fast as possible, but that it will take at least a couple more days to be fully restored.<eos> It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that we will continue to experience attacks until ICO and other terrorist groups like it are eliminated swiftly and completely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May God bless you.
And this is our pumpkin.<eos> - [ Barks ]<eos> - Oh! Hello!<eos> So Steven told me you guys retired to the country.<eos> What brings you here?
Then what?<eos> It's all still there waiting for you, waiting to be dealt with.<eos> You're children with your eyes closed, thinking nobody can see you.<eos> I see you.<eos> I see right through all of you.
I don't even know what's wrong, but... it feels like...<eos> A death.<eos> That if we break up, we'll be miserable, but if we stay together, we'll be...<eos> Miserable.<eos> So what's keeping you together?
Politics are frivolous. They're only a matter of present concern.<eos> But a mathematical equation,<eos> Professor, well... that stands forever.<eos> I tell you what,<eos> I am going to bend the rules and invite you to audit my classes and to work in my laboratory.
Who are you?<eos> I already asked him.<eos> Yes. Right. I-I am...<eos> Albert Einstein.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
But I'm going to Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> Y-You failed your entrance exam.<eos> I won't fail again.<eos> - Who do you think's gonna pay for this Zurich Polytechnic, huh?<eos> The same people who pay for you to keep plundering your businesses into the ground.
It's all about the cash value.<eos> Yeah, and don't forget to bring a hard-boiled egg.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because Monty's gonna ask you for random shit, and then give you 50 bucks for it.
Previously on Genius...<eos> Albert Einstein.<eos> Your reputation precedes you.
Would you care to join us?<eos> Why not?<eos> Miss Maric.<eos> Are you under the impression you're the only one in the building?<eos> Sorry, did I disturb you?
It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't.<eos> This is not a possibility. But why not?<eos> You both look ruddy.<eos> Seems the summer holiday has treated you well.
My esteemed Miss Maric.<eos> My thoughts drifted your way more than once this summer.<eos> Do forgive me for the distress I caused at our last meeting.<eos> I hoped I would be able to apologize in person.<eos> But as I understand it, something has drawn you to Heidelberg.
But as I understand it, something has drawn you to Heidelberg.<eos> If you find yourself bored, please write and share with me why you chose to leave.<eos> Fraulein.<eos> A letter's come.<eos> You really should find a man to carry all those books for you.
There is nothing to question.<eos> Don't you find it fascinating that even though these tiny molecules of gas move at a near incomprehensible speed, that they travel hardly any distance at all.<eos> Not even a hairsbreadth.<eos> These radical thoughts are a disease.<eos> Who has infected you?
Mach?<eos> Lenard, actually.<eos> Miss Maric wrote to me about one of his lectures and I...<eos> Again with this woman.<eos> Did I not warn you that she was dangerous?
We have a real slice of American pie, who puts faith and family first;<eos> a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist with a passion for justice;<eos> a child star who is all grown up,<eos> Her key O.V. is O.M.G.;<eos> and a real live wire who will crack you up while she's tearing you down.
Who doesn't have questions about that?<eos> Look at the sky.<eos> Who can tell me why it's blue?<eos> Something to do with scattering of light?<eos> That's what the books tell you.
And so... if we accept Professor Planck's constant, it means, in short, that much of what we thought we knew about light... is wrong.<eos> Bravo!<eos> Brilliant, Albert.<eos> But why on Earth didn't you lecture on relativity?<eos> When I saw you in the front row, sir, I-I... I had an inspiration.
Now, I'm afraid they hate me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize.<eos> You are very lucky, Mileva.<eos> Your children obviously adore you.
My God.<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> Go with Mama.<eos> Herr Professor, what an unexpected pleasure.<eos> What-what brings you to Zurich?
Don't say another word.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> If I hadn't hurt him, none of this would have happened.<eos> Jennifer told us you were looking for Jamie, so did you find him up here?<eos> The pair of you got into a fight?
Sit down.<eos> You're clearly... too distressed to go anywhere.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are a gentleman.<eos> Now, what you were told clearly concerns you deeply.
I'm not much of a praying man. But I shall pray today.<eos> I shall pray for your soul to be saved, Reverend Michaelmas Whitaker!<eos> The Marshall's Militia have been searching the tavern for evidence of witchery.<eos> Verity will be blamed for the sickness.<eos> What you told me on the ship... about why you left England, about the man who died... And then when the Marshall insulted you in the street and... It's been on my mind.
I wish I could just move beyond the damn theory.<eos> This is the idea I had been missing to complete relativity.<eos> Acceleration and gravity are the same thing.<eos> And an astronomer could prove it.<eos> I found you an astronomer.
You enter Russia from Germany with trunks full of photographic devices, and you want us to believe that you are not a spy?<eos> I, I'm a scientist.<eos> I'm here to photograph an eclipse in a matter of days.<eos> Please, if you would release me and my assistants, it's not too late.<eos> Who ordered you to come here?
Sorry, Your Highness.<eos> He's not a friend of yours?<eos> No.<eos> So you're telling me that a disgruntled employee.<eos> Verbally attacked you, Princess? Yes.
Best time of year to visit the region.<eos> Although, the weather... can be a little unpredictable.<eos> Where exactly are you taking me?<eos> There's a good vantage point about a mile from here.<eos> Don't worry, I'll have you back before the storm arrives.
I am not yours to protect!<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I promised your mother that I'd watch over you.<eos> That when you return to Scotland, I would defend you and your throne from any threat, and I've kept that promise.<eos> I've kept you safe and aware of Darnley's true nature at every turn.
I had to reach you another way.<eos> Is something the matter, Bothwell?<eos> Strange.<eos> Your mother spoke of you so often... your courage, your beauty, and your wit.<eos> I felt like I knew you before you'd even arrived.
I hit my head, and when I woke, I was in the company of Druids.<eos> The Druid who rescued me told me that he had an urgent message for Mary.<eos> Not "the queen" or "Her Majesty," but...<eos> Mary.<eos> Like a friend would speak of you.
- A promise?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That he would come to you when you needed him the most.<eos> Sebastian.<eos> Did my friend tell you why he couldn't deliver this message himself?
I understand.<eos> He will be arrested and imprisoned at once.<eos> Do not let this happen again.<eos> Your navy is no match for our Spanish fleet.<eos> And to the north, your Scottish cousin, already allied with France, marries with full Vatican support, with Catholic might surrounding you by land and sea, leaving England a diminished power.
I have a carriage waiting.<eos> Please, I was told she's not to leave her room.<eos> - She could... - What?<eos> Be seen?<eos> Is that what Darnley paid you to prevent?
Nah.<eos> It's probably The Purge.<eos> Congratulations, Red.<eos> You got me.<eos> Oh, did Mommy not tell you about her secret plan?
So why don't you just go out there and rescue your people like a big, hairless hero, and then just leave us to lick our wounds.<eos> Well, first...<eos> I'm going to inflict some junkie.<eos> And then you can lick away.<eos> Go ahead, make all the noise you want. No one's gonna hear you.
Quit the bitching, please.<eos> Try to remember, you are federal inmates, not line cooks at Applebee's.<eos> Now there's a new shipment of produce out on the loading dock that is not gonna move itself.<eos> Rosado, Hernandez, bring the boxes back in, and you're done for the day.<eos> CO Samuelson will escort you back to your block.
Wait. Hold on.<eos> Are you saying you don't think he's preferential?<eos> Matt, the breakthrough I had with this profile came in the moment I realized that this UNSUB did not choose his victims. He chooses his victims' locations.<eos> Yeah, but it that's true, since all of these murders were committed on public properties, each one would have to hold some sort of significant personal meaning to this guy.<eos> If you could find that through-line that runs from location to location, well, that'll take you right to the Monster himself.
- No.<eos> No, it's no game.<eos> I think you are going to try to tear my house apart in a vain effort to find a pistol and find some surgical tools, which I can assure you I do not have in my possession.<eos> Well, we also believe we can tie you to murder of 14 people, and after this search, that number's gonna go up by four.<eos> You have been talking to Signora Tafani, and she have convinced you that I am the one and only Mostro di Firenze.
Tonight we play the part of the skint, but tomorrow we're one of them.<eos> - Terrence.<eos> - Lionel.<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> So glad they let you in the front.
Boats come out of nowhere, they'll sweep you up in their wake.<eos> Take a month to fish out all your tender little bits and pieces.<eos> Not that I'd miss you... but if you cost me the last good month of boating in my life, I promise I'll piss on your grave every last day until I die.<eos> Yeah, well, what makes you think they'd find enough to bury me before you drop dead?<eos> So, uh, what drew you here?
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give my best to Sheri.<eos> Bye. and all they want is Bruce.<eos> They trusted you with their lives.
So... what are you really up to?<eos> We need to rob a bank.<eos> A bank heist.<eos> Hmm, I think the time we've invested in him may actually pay off. Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, first, there's something I have to tell you.
Also, you wear a size-eight shoe and secretly want to wear bow ties.<eos> Mm-kay, how 'bout this? I'm gonna call the potato chips "skibbles,"<eos> and you're gonna pretend like you know what I'm talking about.<eos> Deal.<eos> Thank you so much for rescuing me from that disaster of a date.
Well, he started going that way in high school.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> Just took a wrong turn.<eos> You're the same age, and you went to the same school.<eos> What put you on such different trajectories?
We need to send reinforcements to the safe house.<eos> Now!<eos> I'm losing my bloody mind.<eos> How much longer do I have to be stuck in this house?<eos> Queen Mary will send an escort for you - once it's safe to return.
- Suck my drumstick.<eos> - You miserable miscreant.<eos> At the Rose, you shall have free reign.<eos> Just you, alone on stage.<eos> I'll pay you triple what Burbage pays you.
Allow me.<eos> Here...<eos> Your uncle is returned from Burgundy.<eos> Quickly now.<eos> That doesn't annoy you?
You have someone in the crowd?<eos> The boy will soon be thrown back into the Tower.<eos> - God save the King!<eos> "Hooray for King Henry!"<eos> "God bless you sire."
Your kingdom.<eos> He based his claim for England on you being by his side.<eos> What if I don't choose to marry her?<eos> The Yorks will rise up in her defense.<eos> Your mother bids you to rape me?
They have no claim to the throne and yet they force themselves upon it with a swagger that must make God in heaven weep.<eos> They are a canker that must be cut out before it has a chance to spread.<eos> I'm told you are a loyal Yorkist.<eos> And if you are, then I beg you, show your colors now.<eos> The Stafford lords will help you.
We have no indication that she'll receive them if they go.<eos> And she's still pirating our ships.<eos> Your Grace, the Duchess knows your uncle as a commander of armies.<eos> Perhaps not the best choice for a peace envoy.<eos> Strange is loyal and will serve you. But Jasper is a man of war.
Why is no one coming to my station?<eos> Whoo! La-la-la-la-ladies!<eos> It's time to get wet, y'all!<eos> Special discount for mothers.<eos> Hi. Can I talk to you about my platform for LSC?
- I'm from Belgium.<eos> How do you know they're footballers?<eos> Well, do you not recognise them?<eos> They're in football outfits.<eos> He doesn't recognise you.
Oh, when do you decide which one of us replaces Agent Jaqobis?<eos> No one replaces John Jaqobis.<eos> Thank you, Dutch.<eos> Arriving at research facility.<eos> Look, do well down there, Turin will clear you for special field work.
Remember, jab and stab to the brain pan.<eos> Aren't they still Killjoys?<eos> These are not your friends.<eos> These are not your coworkers.<eos> They're an alien bug who will kill you and wear your body like a sweater.
You heard the man.<eos> Final weapons check.<eos> What if we get separated?<eos> I make one promise to my team... if I got you in...<eos> I'll get you out.
they'll enact a lockdown, and then we're all screwed.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> She's going with you. We just told you...<eos> Look, she's one person.<eos> She won't slow you down.
Just a suggestion.<eos> Everything I pen is trite.<eos> And cynical.<eos> Your play pokes fun at love.<eos> Perhaps the ending eludes you because love eludes you.
Fire the cannon!<eos> We have a show to do!<eos> An intellectual sells his soul to the Devil so he may learn all the secrets of this world.<eos> And... is dragged to hell.<eos> Well, Burbage will ruin you yet.
We came to talk.<eos> Is Crane here?<eos> He said he'd meet me.<eos> No, he's not here.<eos> I told the two of you to stay away from us.
You need me to succumb willingly.<eos> Very well.<eos> Shall we play this game?<eos> You are good, wise, God-fearing people.<eos> Will you hear me speak or will you simply accept what this man tells you with his... frankly, cheap rhetoric and grandstanding?
But, hey, I'm hopeful.<eos> Look, we don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you shouldn't have brought them with you.<eos> There's a hefty bounty on your heads ever since you escaped the mines.<eos> Every stalker with a rusty blade is after you.
There's another part of the story you don't know that will answer that question.<eos> It's best if I simply hand it over to someone else to elaborate.<eos> Hi.<eos> What stands before you is a story of impossibility.<eos> And who stands before you is a humble man, trying to make sense of that story himself.
Simply put, members of a particular race are better at distinguishing between members of their own race.<eos> We are less accurate with faces of other racial groups.<eos> My cocounsel and I are both black.<eos> Yes, and you look nothing alike, but the science suggests that if you did resemble one another,<eos> LeBron James would have an easier time telling you apart than, say, Tom Brady would.
Joseph.<eos> Peter.<eos> Tara.<eos> I could say that not a day goes by that I don't think of your dad and all of you, and that's true.<eos> But words can never replace what I took from you on that stretch of highway in 1982.
I have highly superior autobiographical memory,<eos> - like Marilu Henner.<eos> Anyway, I remembered selling the same man a pack of tube socks back on March 29th, so I searched the loyalty card database and there he was.<eos> Stuart Mitchell.<eos> Thank you so much for calling me.
Look, let's be adults and just not talk.<eos> Fine with me.<eos> You remember that time we had sex? What the hell?<eos> Take off your pants.<eos> Thank you both for agreeing to sit down.
I know a shady deal when I see one.<eos> I was one of the loudest voices against the Louisiana Purchase.<eos> Earl, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you lived at the diner.<eos> Well, thank God the girls asked me to check on Han checking on you too 'cause now this black male is about to blackmail you.
And only that because I gave it no regard.<eos> I never once gave him cause to think me a defector.<eos> I'm as disgusted by the insinuation as you must be.<eos> The hay in Setauket is of so much consequence that the attempt must be made.<eos> Colonel Sheldon will furnish you with a detachment.
And, boy, do they ever.<eos> We have a real slice of American pie, who puts faith and family first;<eos> A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist with a passion for justice;<eos> A child star who is all grown up.<eos> Her POV is OMG; and a real livewire who will crack you up while she's tearing you down;
We want to wait and see.<eos> I understand.<eos> You do?<eos> Thank you.<eos> May She bless you.
Go back to your village and take care of your dead.<eos> Finan?<eos> Hang three of the dead from the trees... visible from the river.<eos> Lord.<eos> Take back what belongs to you.
- I don't know any prayers!<eos> I will say a prayer.<eos> Hild.<eos> Please.<eos> Let us pray that God and all his saints and all his angels in Heaven, smile and bless you.
A stranger to my wife?<eos> Lord Aethelred!<eos> Welcome to Coccham!<eos> The jewel of Wessex.<eos> Uhtred is expecting you.
Mm. Love you too.<eos> Good call on the eyelashes.<eos> Ooh! First time there's been a better rack than mine in the apartment.<eos> Okay, these are the choices.<eos> They're on loan from the top designers, and if you hurt them, those bitches will hunt you down.
I'm saying, "She's gone."<eos> "She's not here.<eos> She's not coming back."<eos> And still they won't shut up, so I tell them forcefully,<eos> "Whatever happened to you, I'm sorry.
Well, the answer is simple.<eos> You must seduce her, convince her that you could love her.<eos> You're very good at that.<eos> Or you used to be.<eos> What is holding you back?
Mr. Banneker.<eos> You... clearly have skills.<eos> These skills could greatly benefit the war effort.<eos> And what are your skills, Mr. Crane?<eos> If they told you it was your ability to persuade, they were blowing smoke.
I want you to stop doing what you think you should.<eos> I want you to start doing what you feel.<eos> How's it going with Charlie anyway?<eos> To choose to...<eos> You two are still clearly nuts about each other... just what's keeping you apart?
- Hey.<eos> - Hear a storm's coming.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, we, um... we haven't watched the weather report in a while.<eos> So what brings you to Driggs?
Oh, the map says that this is public land.<eos> It's not anymore.<eos> What are you guys hunting?<eos> If you circle back, there's a sign around two miles down the road.<eos> Should lead you back to the highway.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> But France is not satisfied.<eos> May I remind the new American president that when he initiated a mission to capture Majid Nassar in Algeria, we allowed him to use French airspace.<eos> Spanish radar assets and Italian naval support were also employed.<eos> Now, we must all face the fact that we supported you under what might turn into false pretenses.
And to those who oppose us, I can only simply warn you... your days are numbered, for our time has come!<eos> I say again, our time has come.<eos> And to the American people, let me say that it has been the privilege of my lifetime to serve you, and I promise to continue serving until I am asked of service no more.<eos> Thank you for the honor.<eos> God bless you.
Woodhull, allow me to introduce Mrs. Arnold.<eos> This is Abraham Woodhull, a gentleman farmer from Long Island.<eos> - Farmer?<eos> - A soldier in your husband's service.<eos> I pray the general is treating you kindly.
Major Hewlett was billeted at my father's house.<eos> There's not much we don't know about each other.<eos> Though I must confess, Major, you have me at a disadvantage.<eos> We had heard you had moved back to England.<eos> What brings you back to the Colonies?
Men are nothing but creatures of deceit, folly, and greed.<eos> Why should I be any different?<eos> All right, then.<eos> All right, then let's play greed.<eos> Drop this scheme right now, and I will give you what you're after.
We'll need that aim on the field at Blandford.<eos> It'll make an excellent cut.<eos> Here to sample the latest fashion?<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Last I saw you, that fellow was considering his suit.
When I took his hand, he was a general in the Continental Army.<eos> His treason will not stain my family or my child.<eos> What are you offering?<eos> I know his schedule.<eos> Cicero told you about his nightly routine.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.<eos> I will explain it when we're outta here.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?<eos> No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.
Gott im Himmel.<eos> This is bad. This is very bad.<eos> What's bad, Rich?<eos> Koran Surah 5:101.<eos> "Do not ask about things which, if they are shown you, will distress you."
Were you not sent by one?<eos> By the master?<eos> No.<eos> My brother.<eos> Your brother sends you looking for demons?
Okay, come on, George.<eos> Let's give this young man the booth.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> All right.<eos> Tell you what, let me help you out there, 'cause she's gonna be coming in hot any minute now.
Cheers.<eos> - T-11. On you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Right, you're all familiar with this image.<eos> This is what Huntley's team's been keeping from you.
I wanted that rapport with him.<eos> Sir, I know, I'm late, but I come bearing um, gifts, in the form of case files.<eos> I have also sent you all digital copies, if you are of the millennial variety.<eos> And since you're all here in official capacity, and since this seminar is considered on-the-job training, we're enlisting every one of you to help catch this guy.<eos> So make sure you familiarize yourselves with all of this, and our technical analyst Penelope Garcia will help you in any way she can.
"Never know"? Why?<eos> Because Dr. Eldredge is already pissed you're here.<eos> You're doing fancy, expensive surgery.<eos> Special treatment gets the others all riled up, you know.<eos> Eldredge pushes you, you push back.
I wish we taught at a rich school.<eos> I owe you guys an apology.<eos> I bought into that whole "anything is possible" crap, but it's not.<eos> However, there is a silver-lining.<eos> Knowing what you're not good at will push you towards the things you're going to be great at.
That's a risk I'm willing to take.<eos> And what about Leith?<eos> Are you willing to risk seeing him imprisoned, or worse, for his part in your abduction?<eos> I hadn't thought of that.<eos> But I've thought of an alternative that will keep you both safe and together.
Um, why don't you send me a picture?<eos> Jess, have you touched the wound?<eos> - Ew, no.<eos> - Good, make sure Ali doesn't either.<eos> I'm arranging a medevac to bring you both to Bunker Hill.
Lizzie.<eos> Lady Mother.<eos> Have I not been a loving and dutiful daughter to you?<eos> You have.<eos> Have I not visited and cared for you these past years?
I am the son of King Edward, the IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville.<eos> And I am rightful King of England.<eos> You thought that I was murdered, but I live.<eos> So, you will stand aside and return to me the crown and throne which have been stolen from me, or you will face the righteous wrath of Almighty God,<eos> who will rage against your sin and cast you into hell.
Just hoping it gets back to them that we won't go lightly.<eos> The light that we worship is about more than what frees us from them.<eos> It's what makes us better than them.<eos> It's all fucking words!<eos> You sit around here, afraid to... To lead these people... waiting for somebody with the light to protect you. Well, there he is!
Trying to run away, are ya?<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> I've been trying to figure out what to do with you since you caused that accident that crushed a man's debarker dispenser.<eos> Phil.<eos> That glib attitude will get you nowhere.
You and Jennifer can go in through the front door.<eos> We're gonna need a distraction.<eos> You buy us as much time as possible.<eos> Once we have the Word,<eos> Jones will pull you back.
The price is not a concern.<eos> Only its perfection.<eos> I have every faith in your ability...<eos> I want your bits of gold.<eos> The pieces that Enslow Carver brings you.
He's a power-hungry insecure man who's capable of anything.<eos> He is also a political necessity, so I must manage him as best I can.<eos> And by taking his money, I will take a piece of his power.<eos> But bringing him back into your life... it opens the doors to other demands.<eos> Not to mention how much I hate the idea of him being near you.
I've been gone for too long, and Darnley must have suspected why I left.<eos> Take the queen and the gold and get to Father Quinn.<eos> You must secure what money you have in the church fund.<eos> Bothwell, you can't stay.<eos> If Darnley finds you here and the money gone...
You must say that I acted on my own.<eos> You must ban me from Scotland.<eos> Summon Lord Bothwell.<eos> I know he would rather die than see you harmed.<eos> I've kept you safe, and aware of Darnley's true nature - at every turn.
And you are... everything I've been looking for.<eos> However, any public announcement should wait until our countries have agreed to terms.<eos> Tomorrow's event with the nobles will simply be a public stroll.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Elizabeth, I hope you know I'm not just marrying you to share a crown.
CIA in reverse.<eos> "We"?<eos> Where was Ryan in all of this?<eos> Still working undercover for Miranda Shaw.<eos> So, the text you got with the three of you killing that man disappeared?
Mm-hmm. The Gallows Cartel.<eos> They mark their territory.<eos> Roxy said that Lee lifted a bag of cocaine off of some guy who'd passed out in the bathroom.<eos> What if he was a member of La Horca?<eos> Like I told you, all roads lead to the cartels.
Did I tell my father about the spies. Who pretend to be my friends, who come to my home, And follow me in the streets?<eos> Not yet.<eos> That's good.<eos> Last week, we were planning to run away to spain.<eos> After he chased you out of my house, I thought... Good.
- Okay, okay.<eos> Hey, if you learn to control that, you're gonna be a world-class badass.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Are you sure he saw you?
We called the page operator. We did that first.<eos> The switchboard was busy.<eos> -The switchboard. We couldn't get through.<eos> -There is no switchboard.<eos> This isn't I Love Lucy. You call, leave a message, and they get right back to you.
Which war?<eos> The march revolution.<eos> A man sold us some land here.<eos> We came with 20 other families.<eos> Nobody told you about the Indians?
You were supposed to bring us information.<eos> Perhaps you've forgotten how easy it would be for me to feed you to the wolves of the FBI.<eos> What does handing me over to the FBI do for you, besides getting me hauled off?<eos> Look, the way I see it, you have one option here, convince the Feds to take 100% responsibility of this.<eos> Catching the Farrells stealing some dynamite... it's gonna get you nowhere.
Why not?<eos> Let's just jump to the kiss.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Marriage is going to expand you as individuals, define you as a couple, and deepen your love for one another.
- I have a voice. - Jackson, don't do it.<eos> It'll tear you and your mother apart. Tear us apart?<eos> What about you?<eos> You're her husband.<eos> You don't think this whole thing is pushing you away?
Could you explain to me, sir, how it's possible that all six... no, I'm sorry... seven labs in a hundred-mile radius are suddenly unable to take on even one small piece of business?<eos> Hold on!<eos> Where is all this work suddenly coming from?<eos> That's because there isn't any work, is there?<eos> Did somebody call you and tell you that I was gonna be calling?
Hold on!<eos> Where is all this work suddenly coming from?<eos> That's because there isn't any work, is there?<eos> Did somebody call you and tell you that I was gonna be calling?<eos> What, did they pay you off?
Oh, that's ridiculous. My wife and I, we just...<eos> Folks, we're now making our final descent<eos> - into Indianapolis. - We're taking a trip to Rome.<eos> Yeah, take all the trips you want.<eos> People back home will see you the way...
Mm-hmm. But Lorraine said she'd go out to lunch with me if I changed my vote, so here we are.<eos> - Phil, did... did you ever dream...<eos> - No.<eos> Last time I saw you, you came up to here.<eos> Okay, Claire will take you that way to the back yard.
- No, that's 21.<eos> - No, 21 plus two is 23.<eos> - It's 21 period.<eos> - Okay, let's leave it at 21 or 23.<eos> What does Reddick/Boseman give you in return for this financing?
Mr. Boseman was confident they'd come in north of five million.<eos> Did he tell you the basis for this confidence?<eos> He had a-a source on the other side who told him they were ready to settle.<eos> The other side at the time being Diane Lockhart.<eos> Did Mr. Boseman tell you what the other side was nervous about?
Fine payment for a simple murder.<eos> There's a ravine near here, and everyone will think he crashed during a supply run.<eos> They wouldn't believe it.<eos> They'll trace it back to you two.<eos> You think the king will defend you?
I love you.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> - I love you!<eos> - Bye!<eos> It totally sucks that Marianne kicked you out of her place.
- We're sorry.<eos> - You are awesome.<eos> - Okay, don't.<eos> - And I was having a great day.<eos> I found a special surgery that I was excited about, that I knew I could excel at, and I wasn't worried for one second about whether I'd be able to perfect it... not for one second until you guys got here, and now I am a little worried, so thank you for your support.
You know there's only six doctors in the world that can do this surgery, and I am one of them?<eos> Look, we have a shot...<eos> No. No, you guys... look, I told you.<eos> Ah. No revisiting. No hatching new plans.<eos> I told you, just fix up my spleen, and then send me on my way, that's it.
U-uh, n-neighbors, my hardworking staff.<eos> But the one who deserves the most credit, is my beautiful wife, Jessica.<eos> She's the one who never gets thanked, the unsung hero of all our success.<eos> If it wasn't for everything she does, there would never be a Cattleman's Ranch, let alone an award for me to accept.<eos> Now, I know most of you are here tonight because she forced you into coming by sheer will.
Bae... What are you going to do with the dagger now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the Baker's son will think twice about pushing me in the mud when he sees me carrying this.<eos> Bae, listen to yourself.<eos> Papa, I'm sorry I asked you to give up your power.
Papa, how could you?<eos> I'm sorry, bae.<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> Beowulf was right.<eos> That dagger is turning you into a monster.
It burns the eyes and the face.<eos> See?<eos> My-my eyes!<eos> Hot sau...<eos> I ask you to keep a low profile, cut back on expenses.
Molly...<eos> All of it.<eos> I am happy to see you well.<eos> Not sure how well I am right now.<eos> What did he tell you?
All right, hard way it is.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Yeah, I'm down. It's the right thing to do.<eos> [rousing music] Obviously, I've been outvoted.<eos> I will help you in whatever way I can.
Perhaps he now wishes your permission to make a formal announcement.<eos> Do you think?<eos> Now that the world knows Queen Mary is pregnant, I need this alliance more than ever.<eos> But still, I can't help but feel I'm cheating on Gideon.<eos> Lord Blackburn loves you as much as any man has loved a woman.
There's my girl.<eos> Oh, I'll have to catch you later, Mo. I'm supposed to do EW next.<eos> Kibby, get your ass over here, girl.<eos> Come on over.<eos> Let's get you two together again.
I drank all the Rossi.<eos> Can they come party with us?<eos> Y'all having a party?<eos> Sure, why not?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna put you to bed.
I made up the rest.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Don't worry, Benny.<eos> So... who's feeling adventurous?<eos> This self-driving car's gonna take you for one loop around the obstacle course.
And I now have the evidence to prove it.<eos> Madam Foreman.<eos> In the case of Bunson v. Ejetto Technologies, how do you find?<eos> We, the jury, find the defendant, Ejetto Technologies, not liable for the death of Adam Bunson.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this court thanks you for your service.
You guys are sure it's not any of the other girls?<eos> Other girls?<eos> The other girls that Travis raped.<eos> The only girl that Travis Carter was ever accused of raping was Sophie.<eos> I-I assumed Elyse was the one that pointed you to me.
Calm down. It's empty.<eos> - And you couldn't just tell us?<eos> - Are you trying to scare us?<eos> I'm maxing out your adrenaline.<eos> Fear keeps you fast!
Sadie.<eos> We spent the night in a motel room in Allentown, Pennsylvania, talking about boys, when you knew my mother was sick.<eos> Sadie.<eos> What? Albert called.<eos> The judge needs you both at the courthouse.
Well, thanks to me and my gun, you'll live to bore her with it again.<eos> Can we insult each other on the move, please?<eos> - We got to go.<eos> - We're not going anywhere.<eos> Taggart just tried to ransom you and extort me.
Now, give these gentlemen their passes and equipment back and get them back on the floor.<eos> You know, you said some very nice things about Gavin Belson in that interview.<eos> You could've very easily kicked a good man when he was down.<eos> Good luck with whatever it is you're doing.<eos> I'd walk you down myself, but for reasons I really can't get into...
- Hey.<eos> - Gregorio!<eos> I knew you'd be back.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Sorry to drag you all in like this, but it's important.
Now, let's... let's do this before you change your mind, okay?<eos> That's what you said on New Year's Eve.<eos> Katie, your mother and I have decided to let you babysit.<eos> - Really? ! That's amazing!<eos> - I won't let you down, I promise.
We weren't having sex.<eos> I can see your wee-wee.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm sorry. Is this public?<eos> Well, I can see you, so yes.
I think it should end with a... with a courtroom scene.<eos> I think you might be a little distracted on the personal front.<eos> I punked you guys.<eos> I punked you, that was a... the reverse punk, so...<eos> I pulled a switch on you.
What seems to be the problem?<eos> This doesn't concern you, sir.<eos> Well, these are my nieces, so yes, I think it concerns me.<eos> These girls left without paying.<eos> Girls, I told you to wait inside for me.
So cute.<eos> Okay, change of plans.<eos> I have to work this weekend.<eos> So go inside, pack your stuff.<eos> I'm taking you to your dad's.
Why me?<eos> Because you could fuck, understand him and meet the mother.<eos> You got under his skin.<eos> He loves you, truly.<eos> Right, let's be having you!
- You've both died 39 times.<eos> Aha... time loop. Thought so.<eos> Our computers do not handle these well.<eos> This will take a bit to sort out.<eos> Once you're in the system, we'll reunite you with your immediate karmic circle, but until then, I'll need to stick you somewhere. Do you like skiing?
They wanna close this case yesterday.<eos> Mr. Williams feels not only has he lost his son, he's about to lose his nephew as well.<eos> So he reached out to his Congressman, who contacted the State Department and they called us.<eos> Well, considering Mr. Williams' suspicions, are we getting any help from the local cops?<eos> Yes, the Jamaican police unit welcomes our assistance and they've set you up with two liaisons...
Leave a message.<eos> Eddie... please, I need to talk to you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Eddie Lane, many of you know well, breached our security this morning.<eos> I called you all here to stress the importance of such an incident never being allowed to happen again.
Get the goddamn shackles, Hoberman.<eos> Grab her with me. Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> There you are.<eos> The Queen will see you now.
Dante must be destroyed.<eos> Yeah, that's all well and good, but what the hell is this jerk doing here?<eos> Yeah, where's Mickey?<eos> She's not coming.<eos> I texted you from her phone.
That'll put a smile on your face.<eos> Why is no one smiling?<eos> This is supposed to be the second happiest place on Earth.<eos> Families are coming here for luxurious fun.<eos> I don't care if a customer is stabbing you with a fork. You keep smiling.
The bishop was in battle with king aelle.<eos> Dear god.<eos> His grace is certainly closer to god right now than to you, prince aethelwulf.<eos> Put him down.<eos> Who did this to you?
That, of course, was the first thought that came into my head, Sire.<eos> Nonetheless...<eos> Have you ever lost a child?<eos> No, Sire.<eos> Then what qualifies you to speak of her state of mind or motives?
Your loyalty gives me great comfort.<eos> The question of Regent remains.<eos> Madame,<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> My mother asked you for your help.
Perhaps we should take a turn in the garden.<eos> I hear the lilies are in bloom.<eos> You are here for confession, perhaps?<eos> No, I came here on a matter of some delicacy.<eos> I will help you in any way I can.
Where would we meet?<eos> Brothers and sisters, our glorious Hosts... have brought us a great blessing today.<eos> Salvation from the difficult conditions in our bloc.<eos> We are all being relocated to the San Fernando bloc... where the faith stands strong... and resources are plentiful.<eos> Busses will transport you to the evacuation center immediately.
He'd be happy to see you.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Andre.<eos> Can I speak to you for a minute?
Then it is a sacred place.<eos> How dare you say such things?<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> - I may be.<eos> But since I love some of you, I urge you again to take heed of my warning.
We have to go. Yes, yes!<eos> Go, go!<eos> Go, go!<eos> And farewell, Bishop Edmund.<eos> My dear vintner. May God bless you and keep you.
Are you wondering what I'm wondering? Yes.<eos> How did they find us?<eos> The Minister seems preoccupied.<eos> Perhaps, we should humor him?<eos> Is something bothering you, Excellency?
She has offered me her friendship.<eos> Simply as a means to drive a wedge between us.<eos> I think you exaggerate the threat.<eos> You do not know her as I do.<eos> Can you blame her for being jealous of you?
You reply with insults and impossible propositions.<eos> You treat me like a child.<eos> Gentlemen, your rooms are being prepared.<eos> Dinner will be served on your return.<eos> Sister Hermione will show you to yours, Sire, and Sister Jeanne will attend to you, My Lord.
Have you ever wondered whether your nobles are happy?<eos> You force them to live under your roof, the only way they can survive is to get a foothold on the crazy ladder of favor and promotion.<eos> So, they started to kill each other.<eos> Do go on. This is fascinating.<eos> Your brother hates you for the way you treat him. He's just waiting for the opportunity to take your place or to humiliate you.
Meeting in the salon is a sign of friendship.<eos> Sharing a bed is a sign of love.<eos> If he no longer wishes to share his bed with me, then it follows<eos> that he no longer loves me.<eos> He loves you but you are making it very easy for him to hate you.
The search for the perfect metaphor does not abide by the hours of the clock.<eos> I wish you luck in your search. Good night!<eos> Good night!<eos> I can see paradise but you must build it for yourself.<eos> All those around you smile and will bend to your decisions.
He loves me and I will give him the attention and affection that he needs.<eos> Of course.<eos> Your Majesty must be tired, after such a long journey.<eos> Tired, yet reinvigorated.<eos> When I last saw you, Sire, you seemed...
I tbelieve you delivered this to the wrong person.<eos> No, I have delivered it to the Marquise de Maintenon.<eos> My heartfelt congratulations.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Iside, you will find the deeds and title to the Maintenon estate that the King himself offers you, in your name.
Dig it up.<eos> All of it.<eos> I'm at prayer, Bontemps.<eos> Sire, I insist you come with me.<eos> Monseur Louvois awaits you in the Council Room.
I was dreaming.<eos> What?<eos> I was dreaming.<eos> I sold my soul!<eos> Our Lord will protect you.
No, he's never betrayed any of his followers.<eos> Then he's never met Monseur Marchal.<eos> We must have faith in him.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> After the way the King has betrayed you, don't tell me you do not seek justice.
Oh, yes!<eos> Just as I appreciate your insignificance!<eos> My prince is all-powerful.<eos> Yes.<eos> It appears that your Lord has forsaken you.
Your attention to detail and fidelity to the truth can only be applauded, Thomas.<eos> Don't you agree, brother?<eos> Makes French breasts bulge with pride, brother.<eos> I cannot put a value on the work you do for us.<eos> One day, soon, I shall reward you in full.
There have been women before in their marriage and she's managed to come to terms with it.<eos> She doesn't want 'to come to terms with it'.<eos> She wants him not to leave her.<eos> Sometimes, I think you don't know what it's like being married to a policeman.<eos> We have to come to terms with sharing you with all the bad things happening in Paris, let alone Louis' other women or Claude's drinking.
No.<eos> Don't be ashamed.<eos> All men seek comfort.<eos> All men want to be significant, I know that.<eos> It's what unites you all.
I broke Gandalf in half.<eos> It's Dumbledore!<eos> Screw you guys.<eos> You know, being a pilot is hard work.<eos> Look, I tried to be nice and take you fellas on a free trip, and all you can do is crap all over my job.
But what's wrong with having other friends?<eos> Are you gonna listen to her, or are you gonna listen to me?<eos> Chad...<eos> I spoke with your father, and it is okay to stand up for what you want.<eos> I told you to stay out of this.
Unless you're worried about something.<eos> Well, it might've been prudent to discuss things before deciding a course of action.<eos> Since this was your mess to begin with, I don't think you have a right to complain about how I choose to clean it up.<eos> Oh, that wasn't a complaint, that was merely an observation.<eos> I kept you out of jail, Henry, and I got you the Mayor's job back.
I don't... talk about this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't blame Pastor Hogan for what he did, I mean, I realize that I needed to tell you this, to let you know who I am and-and why I'm here, so you don't have to worry.<eos> Now you know the truth.<eos> Thank you for that.
I actually wanted to be a doctor, but there aren't a lot of medical schools that accept women.<eos> So you decided to be a nurse instead?<eos> Runs in the family.<eos> My mother was a nurse.<eos> So what brought you out west?
I heard you're working at Abigail's.<eos> Yeah, she was nice enough to give me the job.<eos> Weren't you working for the railroad before?<eos> I go where life takes me.<eos> And life is taking you to working in Abigail's kitchen?
- You got three.<eos> Those Pinkertons will be back soon.<eos> I have another idea.<eos> That tiny thing is a bomb?<eos> What did Edison ever do to you?
Okay... Where would he take her?<eos> Sometimes he... disappears into the basement.<eos> No, no.<eos> You're no psychic.<eos> If I'm not who I say I am, then how would I know that your father beat you when you were a child?
You believe in free will.<eos> Your whole thing is... You made me write a 3,000-word essay on free will.<eos> Yes, well, I mean, you had free will, and look at what you did with it!<eos> Worse than that, you had history.<eos> History was saying to you,
Because if you help the Monks, then nothing will ever stop them.<eos> They'll be here for ever.<eos> It's not a trick, it's not a plan.<eos> I have joined the Monks.<eos> Whatever it takes, I'm going to save you from yourselves.
- Faraday asked for my help.<eos> - In return for what?<eos> Halt!<eos> This could be the entrance to an Ice Warrior hive.<eos> Faraday has been using you all along.
Wait, what's that s-supposed to mean?<eos> I signed y'all up as a, as a... as a four-girl group.<eos> - When?<eos> - I told you that last week, Star.<eos> I told all of you I was gonna add Eva, to-to add a Latin flavor.
This is what happened last time on Star...<eos> I signed you all up as a four-girl group.
Definitely not telling her now.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Everyone knows that!<eos> "Here you must go without me.<eos> "Cardinal Angelo will conduct you to the library."
But there's nothing here.<eos> Whole show's been a ruddy wash out.<eos> The ship crashed on landing.<eos> I go top side now and then to see if I can repair the beggar.<eos> That's what I was doing when I ran across you.
Post a guard. No-one is to go near this thing until the morning, is that clear?<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> The last thing I'm going to do is take sides.<eos> But isn't it obvious?<eos> Friday has been using you all along.
I might as well be back on the houseboat!<eos> Because you have no idea what you're doing!<eos> So show me!<eos> Give me a chance instead of lumping us all together in the back seat while you drive!<eos> I'm not lumping you all together.
You failed.<eos> - You need to give us more time.<eos> - No. I gave you plenty of time.<eos> Years.<eos> I waited on you.
And my boot.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> You may have stopped me, but you can't stop The Savior.<eos> I will find her.<eos> And when I do, she will destroy you with her light magic.
I was just getting my things to come meet you.<eos> Tell me about Louis Keating.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Standing, exercising.<eos> The only way I can possibly explain what I saw is that you used the drug that I specifically prohibited you from using.
And if Claire's body landed in the right position.<eos> You ready?<eos> My bad.<eos> Make no mistake, the defendant killed his wife.<eos> Defense counsel has dazzled you with her charm and stories about a rash of unsolved break-ins, a mysterious unnamed assailant who they say killed Claire Harris.
Sorry we said you were annoying, or sorry for not telling you you were annoying earlier.<eos> If you're still set on going to that island, you should know that that way is crazy dangerous.<eos> I'm... I'm ready.<eos> All: Us, too.<eos> Then, I can use my air bladder to blow a mighty wind, a real big wind that'll carry you over all the dangers.
Yeah.<eos> We got freedom smushed up inside our guts.<eos> We want to explore and have experiences and learn new things.<eos> Kingdoms made of candy, beautiful dragons, fire-breathing princesses, incredibly sad wizards...<eos> It's all waiting for you across the ocean.
Rhys.<eos> Dear.<eos> Did I just kill our only lead?<eos> I want you tell me exactly what happened.<eos> I told you what happened.
Marshalls. We should head out the back.<eos> Hey, boys!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> You looking for the world-famous Jesse James?<eos> 'Cause fortune has just smiled upon you.
You're right. I feel silly.<eos> And if Billy hadn't rented me a room,<eos> I might have dropped out, moved home, never signed up for your class, never met you, and our children would've never been born.<eos> So by you hating Billy, you hate our children.<eos> Kids! Your dad hates you!
You're both fired.<eos> What?<eos> A kid went missing on your watch.<eos> Clearly, I am the only person I can count on around here.<eos> Security will escort you out.
It doesn't know what it wants to be.<eos> Is it savory?<eos> Is it sweet?<eos> Shepherd's pie has lamb in it.<eos> Do they seem like good shepherds to you?
It's been an amazing nine weeks, but it's with a heavy heart that I must step down.<eos> I have found another more worthy of the mantle.<eos> And so, I leave Font Club in the hands of Gibson... something, or something Gibson.<eos> I don't know if that's his first or last name.<eos> God bless you all.
Find out what.<eos> Okay, he definitely means you, because, uh, computers are not my thing.<eos> I'll run it down with Bishop.<eos> Whenever she gets back.<eos> I told you I have no idea.
Where's the justice in that?<eos> You're paying for his car.<eos> Do you know that? You have paid for it.<eos> Just so you know, you've paid for his car.<eos> Has James May thanked you for buying his car for him?
So, please, drink up, because Her Majesty's paying for it now, so you can all pay for it in the future.<eos> You know, they'll be coming to get me soon, so... I'm gonna say goodbye, goodnight, and God bless to those of you who thinks that matters.<eos> We're all gonna die alone, mostly, probably, by our own hand, having never found the justice we were seeking, having never found any real human connection with anyone, set to live out the rest of our lives<eos> in solitary confinement!<eos> Your country thanks you for your service.
They called "The Sterling Angel".<eos> The legend mixes with reality.<eos> Yeah But we know for sure Who was a violent group ... Of ultramontaneous integralists.<eos> They wanted to end To Enlightenment Progress ... Oh And restoring the Inquisition ... I do not know Using any means ...<eos> You know Extortion, theft or murder. Yeah The cause of God calls you.
- No, the penultimate.<eos> Look.<eos> That's Lope de Vega.<eos> - I have to talk to him about a question.<eos> - Then I better leave you alone.
But this war must end!<eos> Twenty years have passed.<eos> The people deserve to live in peace.<eos> Think about your father, Peace to his soul.<eos> Remember how much He fought against them, Everything he suffered when he had to Living on those infamous islands, Everything she told you about Maria Tudor ...
Get up! - Wait.<eos> Get up! Get out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Move it now!<eos> Get out before I arrest you for being high and stupid.
We found 500 pounds of stolen explosives on your property, Agent Callen.<eos> That the bad news?<eos> Well, that depends on whether or not you consider us finding a dead body in your garage worse.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Someone tipped you off.
He didn't deserve to die.<eos> I'm sorry you were born a servant...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You like having servants.<eos> They dress you, feed you, know your every need.
There were witnesses to my king's murder.<eos> Tell our sovereign what you told me.<eos> It was Bothwell.<eos> He threatened us... said if we didn't help him murder the king, he would have us arrested.<eos> You thought Darnley was alive. You went to Knox hoping he'd save you from our king's wrath.
No, what I'm saying is:<eos> I'm too busy trying to stay alive than to crack the mystery of the shorts-wearing detective.<eos> All right, fair enough.<eos> But now, Delgado's got his eyes on him.<eos> Remember, I put you two together so that you could lift Riggs up, not so that he would...
So it's a good thing we didn't listen, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Instead, you guys came here from all over Africa...<eos> Togo to Tanzania, Mozambique to Morocco... to learn and to make new friends.<eos> Let me tell you about why I love math.
Because math... math is elegant.<eos> Math is fun.<eos> And in a chaotic world, math made sense.<eos> Well, maybe not calculus.<eos> So when someone tells you that math isn't for girls, or when someone calls you a nerd, they don't know it, but they're paying you a compliment.
That is so thoughtful of you.<eos> Whatever it is that you're up to, can we please just get it over with?<eos> Why would I be up to something?<eos> After reflection and prayer, I realized France isn't worth my efforts.<eos> I'll take my holiday here and then... leave you to your own mess.
Your husband, the king, has vanished.<eos> Perhaps it's time to be honest with yourself.<eos> Enlighten me, Reverend.<eos> You are a selfish and misguided queen, whose own husband moved to topple your rule.<eos> Whose own privy council despised you enough to assist him in his treachery.
How would I have even gotten word out?<eos> Maybe someone on your team leaked it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You were surrounded by your band of merry men when I told you about the meet.
Do I?<eos> Who are the Jedi?<eos> They're my friends.<eos> I'll explain everything, I promise.<eos> I'll take you to the stronghold, but I can't vouch for how you'll be greeted.
No one threatens our family.<eos> Gar Saxon was guilty of treason against the throne, collaboration with our enemy, and the execution of my fellow Protectors. But when the rest of Mandalore finds out about his death, there will be chaos.<eos> Perhaps Mandalore needs chaos if it's to become strong once again, and so that we may find a leader worthy of our people.<eos> (GRUNTING) Sure, now you show up when all the fighting is over.<eos> (GRUNTING) The Empire will come for you once they find out what's happened here.
Backpage refused to cooperate with the subcommittee's investigation.<eos> They defied our subpoena, failing to appear at the November of 2015 hearing, or provide the requested documents.<eos> We'd now like to call our first panel of witnesses for today's hearing.<eos> It's the custom of this subcommittee to swear in all witnesses.<eos> Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
We have, Your Honor.<eos> What say you?<eos> On the charge of second degree murder, we find the defendant guilty.<eos> On the charge of third degree rape of a minor, we find the defendant guilty.<eos> The state of New York thanks you for your service.
I'm investing a lot of time and money in you, and in 17 months, 23 days, and 4 hours,<eos> I have to start all over with someone else?<eos> God knows who that's gonna be.<eos> Hello, party people!<eos> What's the matter with you two?
- Yes.<eos> Excuse me, SSA Simmons.<eos> Could we rewind a moment here?<eos> You get the call from Captain Rifai.<eos> He asks you to give him the guy.
I'm sorry, but the fountain isn't real.<eos> He deceived you.<eos> I know that's really hard to hear, 'cause he deceived me too.<eos> My family, scientists, governments, military, all over the world.<eos> He used you all.
Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.<eos> I want to know what's up with Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.<eos> The president and Congressman Womack, they have a good relationship.<eos> Oh, I'm sure they do.<eos> But I would hate to see Terry let you down.
Then as vice president and now as president, trying to do the people's work.<eos> Now, this committee has accused me of a great number of things.<eos> You accused me of pay to play.<eos> And so I accuse you of exactly the same.<eos> I also accuse you of playing politics only when it suits you.
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.<eos> But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
I'll just give them the finger.<eos> Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming.<eos> Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes.<eos> No, he doesn't think it's stupid.<eos> Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we'll call you "red-headed Emily"
- Dare to dream.<eos> Gentlemen, as the convening authority, I'm gonna ask that you not turn this trial into a media circus.<eos> "Convening authority"?<eos> One officer picks the jury pool and gets to set a lot of the rules.<eos> We don't do a lot of courts-martial, so I'm gonna ask you to use my office as the interview space for Lieutenant Dale.
Your childhood days are over.<eos> Guillermo, come back here!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't run away from your mother.<eos> Life is going to tear you apart soon enough.
It's on a 72-hour loop, and the company's based out of Mumbai, so... (beep)<eos> We'll get it to you.<eos> Just might take some time.<eos> FEMALE VOICE: I can have it to you tomorrow.<eos> (chuckles) Apologies for startling you.
This rig's goin' up in a fireball if we don't do something about it.<eos> If this place were gonna blow, we'd be hearing sirens.<eos> Refresh your computer.<eos> Warning system should come back online.<eos> Whoever you were working with to sabotage the pipeline set you up.
Your parents don't know you're still seeing her, do they?<eos> - Jordan, come on. - Yes.<eos> Yes. Okay?<eos> Susan and I have already talked this over, and I'm moving in with her.<eos> Sorry if that upsets you guys. - Jordan.
Needing a few days to get away from it all.<eos> Away from your run-in with Captain Smith?<eos> Why'd he have to bring NCIS into this?<eos> I apologized.<eos> What did he tell you?
And this federal judiciary has courageously upheld these values in turbulent times...<eos> Watergate, the Pentagon Papers...<eos> With all due respect to Mr. Stone, if we start allowing local officials to become the arbiters of whether classified items are made public, that's a national security nightmare I can't begin to imagine.<eos> I see your point, Ms. Graziano.<eos> Thank you both for your thoughtful arguments.
And now one of the most respected investors in America is going to tell you about his secrets.
Change the name!<eos> Change the name!<eos> Change the name!<eos> Mom, Dad, you're here!<eos> Did your powers tell you that something important was happening?
No.<eos> It turns out, the airport your skydiving company leased from was going to expand dramatically, and established airlines were coming in to take over the existing hangars and runways.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's right here.<eos> In fact, two days before the accident, your company received notification that its lease would not be renewed at the airport, effectively shutting you down.
Emma and I were just having dinner.<eos> Good. 'Cause the food at Cook County sucks.<eos> In other words, you're under arrest for the murder of Alderman Christopher Jones.<eos> Jane, right?<eos> What did she tell you?
Your Honor, we are still deadlocked.<eos> Would further deliberation make a difference?<eos> I don't believe so.<eos> Well then, I'm left with no choice but to declare a mistrial.<eos> The People of the State of Illinois thank you for your service.
You heard me. Oh, God!<eos> - You're under arrest!<eos> - FBI! Stand down! Stop resisting!<eos> Okay... okay.<eos> The thing to remember is that your parents love you.
Yeah, you would be.<eos> Please.<eos> Well, clearly very good at what you do.<eos> Ignore her.<eos> So what brings you in today?
No, I don't believe I have.<eos> Hey. - How are you?<eos> Hey, bud.<eos> - All right, so, - this is really weird... - Yeah?<eos> He put you up to this?
- Are you OK? - ~<eos> Gosh, she'd better not be coming on the trek with us -- it'll take years.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> Setting off from a traditional aborigine village, is there any other kind?<eos> The trek takes you through the jungle to the, yes, the heffalump sanctuary!
- No, it's not.<eos> You had sex with her and you probably gave me chlamydia. You know what?<eos> I hope so.<eos> I hope we all have chlamydia.<eos> Ah, thank God we found you.
I mean, it's got the compass and the satellite phone and all the food in, but it's fine.<eos> We've got water.<eos> We're lost, aren't we, Dana?<eos> You guys were already lost.<eos> Dana found you -- it's not her fault.
Hey! OK, fair point.<eos> No, but I mean you need to completely back off.<eos> I would.<eos> Well I mean, I didn't, but that's how I know you should.<eos> The important thing right now is that you cut every tie that bound you together.
We're in the middle of looking for our friend Dylan and Ash and Sean are still out there, so...<eos> - How's that going?<eos> - Poorly.<eos> He's basically vanished.<eos> I tell you what. Why don't you guys take a break and let me take you out for lunch?
Oh, my God, Sean.<eos> We'll be fine, don't worry.<eos> What's that?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - The British Embassy released you.
So me, Skip, Cam and Bryce...<eos> - B-Train.<eos> - Wynonna.<eos> We didn't take it seriously, but... we hit the bong and said the words.<eos> Then, I shit you not, this thing appeared out of the trophy case.
Win him back.<eos> Jane's novel.<eos> _<eos> Remember, more obstacles, Jane.<eos> I'm awfully sorry if I offended you.
Thank you.<eos> Has the jury reached a verdict?<eos> We have, Your Honor.<eos> On 15 counts of manslaughter, we find the defendant... guilty.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court thanks you for your service.
Ian, there are men coming and they wanna hurt you.<eos> Please, this is what Charlotte would've wanted. He can't understand you.<eos> Maybe I should shut the hell up.<eos> We know about the avalanche that killed your wife.<eos> The search party looked for you for three days, but they had to turn back because of the aftershocks.
- Oh, God. Bless you.<eos> We just have the one.<eos> - So, are you new to San Diego?<eos> - No. I grew up here, but I did my residency at Johns Hopkins where I met my husband, and then I just stayed.<eos> - So what brings you back?
"Life is short and the world is at least half terrible,<eos> "and for every kind stranger, "there is one who would break you,<eos> "though I keep this from my children.<eos> "I am trying to sell them the world.<eos> "Any decent realtor, walking you through a real hellhole,
I am innocent of the accusations against me, Abbot.<eos> I may not be without sin, but a murderer I am not.<eos> You say you hear of Verona's darkness, and I seek to find its source not only to clear my name but to restore my city to the greatness it once knew.<eos> That is none of my concern.<eos> Perhaps not. But if Verona falls, Abbot, who will protect you then?
He's a...<eos> He's a murderer! - He's no murderer!<eos> - You know of my innocence.<eos> You told me...<eos> I told you to flee the city.
He's a murderer! - He's no murderer!<eos> - You know of my innocence.<eos> You told me...<eos> I told you to flee the city.<eos> I never told you to follow me here.
You could talk the Doge out of taking it.<eos> I traded mine a long time ago, Princess, and I am far the richer for it.<eos> But Venice is not Verona.<eos> And all the power I'll ever have is my ability to bear an heir.<eos> If you are worried, Queen Anne's lace will protect you from the Doge's seed.
Move over.<eos> All right.<eos> Signal's up, you guys.<eos> We are alive and live.<eos> Tracking you both.
I am responsible for that.<eos> I helped pass the executive order that made Benjamin Johnson's gun purchase illegal because I believed that it would save people's lives, and maybe it did.<eos> But it also ruined a man's life.<eos> We live in a country of more than two parties.<eos> Beware of any leader who tells you it would be easier for you to just let them make your decisions for you because they know what is best, because we do not know what's best.
You also knew that there was a manhunt underway to find whoever had the guitar before a hit man did.<eos> You couldn't let Cosmo live to enter police custody because he could give you up as leverage in a deal.<eos> So, you went to his place.<eos> You got rid of him and the Lady Frances at the same time.<eos> Well, I hope this little fiction of yours keeps you warm when I'm mayor and you're all out on your asses.
Not allowed.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Is it weird?<eos> - What?<eos> Having a President who, if he had his way, would round you all up and send you back to some country you probably don't even remember?
Yeah, we're still in our capital building phase.<eos> Our IPO's another year or two away, so...<eos> The CTO is more of an IT professional.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you want me to be the guy who tells you how to restart your computer?
- Head up the development team?<eos> - The CTO is more of, um,<eos> - an IT professional.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want me to be the guy who tells you how to restart your computer?
(door closes)<eos> Yeah. Appreciate it.<eos> Man, I didn't realize kid gloves came in your size.<eos> We got a better case against you two than we have against him.<eos> And you keep playing vigilante, I'll put you in your place.
Everyone, - this is Rebecca.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> She's younger and far more attractive than he is.<eos> They're copying you two.
And for that I thank you, my sweet girl.<eos> Beware.<eos> I sent word of my arrival with no expectation of an audience.<eos> Is there something I can do for your Grace?<eos> Have you given any thought to what awaits you on the throne when you succeed your father?
Uh, I want to thank you for coming all this way, for your wonderful work on our movie.<eos> You're all going home tomorrow, and I know that it's a trip back to a continent that is full of risks for some of you.<eos> I want to offer an alternative to as many as are amenable.<eos> It's the reason I brought you here in the first place, not because I couldn't find musicians in Los Angeles, but because I'm afraid of where Europe is heading.<eos> I hired you so that I can help you.
- Don't touch me.<eos> This wasn't me.<eos> To Guero?<eos> We'll put you both in witness protection.<eos> United States government will keep you safe and sound.
- Hold your fire.<eos> - Hold your fire.<eos> Pete.<eos> Get away from there.<eos> I don't know what my father told you, but you're all being lied to.
We're here. What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Isaac.<eos> Isaac, are you okay?<eos> - Mr. and Mrs. Kenyatta, Reiden thanks you for your patience during this trying time.
You'll notice I've placed a hat in front of each of you.<eos> You're gonna want to hold onto it.<eos> What's going on, Care Bear?<eos> Just a seismic shift in reality as we know it.<eos> What you're about to see will shock and astound you to your very core.
Don't blame me.<eos> I'm a neat freak.<eos> Salvatore Roselli, I presume.<eos> Who the hell are you guys?<eos> That bastard Kapper send you?
He said that, according to schedule, they should be in the lab, and they should be.<eos> That's not a lie.<eos> He didn't seem like a fraud, he was very congenial.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, he didn't lock you up in a snow globe with faulty equipment and a blonde lunatic.
Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!<eos> None of us do!<eos> Liar!<eos> I believe we will bury you.
Hey, um... look, I know when you asked me before, I denied it, but the truth is...<eos> And I know you are with Chuck... but I don't know, I guess I'm calling because I wanted to say, before it's too late, that you shouldn't be.<eos> You should be with me.<eos> I loved Scott.<eos> Like I be telling you, I wouldn't kill him.
Now, this is an old black trick.<eos> Really, I didn't want to talk.<eos> I was gonna fuck 'em up.<eos> So, if you're ever caught in traffic, and a black guy starts saying he just wants to talk to you, don't open the door.<eos> Even if he's me, smiling at you.
Effective at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, I will resign my post as president of these United States.<eos> As no vice president has yet been confirmed,<eos> Speaker of the House Henry Roarke will take the oath of office.<eos> I thank you for the trust you placed in me.<eos> God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
Maybe you could tell the class about your work.<eos> All right, sure.<eos> Yeah, I can spit my flow.<eos> Mrs. Sandoval, can I take a mental health day?<eos> So, as I'm sure Sam told you, I'm the guy that invented CryTunes.
- That?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Weller.<eos> It's the room next door.<eos> "That button leads you out, but watch the glass. "You'll fill the other room with lethal gas."
- Okay.<eos> - Hey, is Jake Harper here?<eos> - Pool table.<eos> We need to ask you a couple of questions.<eos> Let me guess... my girlfriend sent you?
And what's controversial about keeping this country safe?<eos> What exactly is your plan for implementation?<eos> Since you brought it before the House a month ago, its critics have only grown more vociferous.<eos> And its supporters, as well.<eos> And I would remind you that it passed before the President vetoed it.
But still, maybe a lesson for all of us that crime doesn't pay.<eos> We go in the front door, we use the wedge formation.<eos> - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me!<eos> I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Okay, I followed you here all the way on my bike.
This is escalating much too quickly, and three seconds is not enough time...<eos> - Jake...<eos> - Right, focus. Sorry.<eos> Sir, we know you worked with Hawkins.<eos> Did she send you here?

Kid's pissed at you? For a brilliant child, he is unreasonable.<eos> Is he?<eos> Well, I've explained my position to him and he's being wholly oppositional.<eos> Thing about kids, they can be very forgiving, but only if they hear the truth.<eos> First of all, the kid can hear you.
If it makes you feel better, your life was never going good.<eos> I really appreciate you squeezing us in.<eos> I'm worried sick.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> Uh, who referred you?
Lock her up!<eos> Lock her up!<eos> Lock her up!<eos> The slash-and-burn politics of today are what's required to get noticed.<eos> God bless you.
- That's it?<eos> Just access?<eos> With Peter Theo's intel on your former boss, combined with whatever FSB has on him, the Russians can easily compromise the president, and he won't even see it coming.<eos> And once it's done, he won't be able to get out.<eos> Since my life is on the line, I just have to know... what are the Russians giving you for this?
It's time.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're in this together.<eos> I'm not the one who can help you.
[Langford] Reach out, even if you feel like Hannah and can't talk to your parents, or don't want to tell anyone at school because you're embarrassed, call a hotline.<eos> Talk to someone anonymously. Just talk to someone because the minute you start talking, it gets easier.<eos> And just know that there's life beyond what you're feeling at the moment.<eos> I promise it will get better.<eos> There is an entire future of incredible things waiting for you.
Well, then, seeing as how that's the case, are the keys in the rolls?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're...<eos> Wait. Why?<eos> Because I'm going to drive it, and sergeant Poovey is going to drive you in my car.
I am not going to dignify that farrago of allegations with a denial. - She's fucking mental!<eos> Believe 'em if you want.<eos> But know this.<eos> Everything I do, any measures I have taken, I've done for the benefit of you women.<eos> Society has turned its back on you.
You can say that again.<eos> Thank you for this evening and... and for being like a family to me.<eos> I love you all, very much.<eos> As for my wife-to-be... she knows how I feel about her.<eos> So, instead of boring you with talk, I'll thank you all for celebrating with us and leave you to enjoy this wonderful party.
Would you rob a child of those answers for the rest of his life?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Well, then, who's this man?<eos> I'll bring you all down with me.
She was at least as bad as they were?<eos> In some ways.<eos> In other ways, they were worse.<eos> If I've understood your evidence correctly, Holly, is that you would go to an address knowing that sex was about to take place, sex would take place.<eos> Amber would collect money. Tariq would be called, he would collect you and Amber, and money would be given to Tariq.
Cut the crap, okay?<eos> We know you run SBK.<eos> And if you didn't want to have to deal with visits like this or look at pictures like that, you probably shouldn't have poisoned your own brother.<eos> Heavy is the head, huh?<eos> Bonzi hasn't been gone 24 hours and another gang has already declared war on you.
Mom, your stomach's upset and you're terrified.<eos> You can't take much more of this.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, please, you guys, I know today wasn't perfect, but don't give up on me yet.<eos> Seriously, the weekend isn't over, we can turn this thing around.<eos> Um, guys, I know this might not be the best time to bring this up, but you know that bear your dad got you at Navy Pier?
One year.<eos> I gave you one year to make your peace with your God.<eos> And what do you do?<eos> Celebrate the day you killed my wife.<eos> One year I gave you, while I assembled my armies. And now I bring your death.
You can take it out of my pocket, but you're done.<eos> - Harvey, it's not... - No, listen to me because<eos> I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.<eos> You spend one more minute on this case, other than telling Oliver it's his,<eos> - I'm shutting you down.
I pitched you a piece on the recent dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and instead you've assigned me a puff piece on dog treats.<eos> Look, we're not 50 Minutes.<eos> We're local news, okay?<eos> How you guys doing?<eos> Wendy keeping you in good shape?
Andy, my old dance partner.<eos> That is one heck of a goatee you're sporting.<eos> I know.<eos> Long time no see, old friends.<eos> What brings you to our side of the lake?
Never thought I'd be so hungry I'd climb a shit pipe in pursuit of breakfast.<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> What will one coin buy me?<eos> Bit of dried goat.<eos> Haven't seen you before.
Dad, you're a genius.<eos> Where's he gone now?<eos> You're right, I'm never gonna go to the Olympics.<eos> I'm gonna go to the Winter Olympics.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... the Head of the British Winter Olympics Selection Committee, Mr. Dustin Target.
And we'll fight to the death to defend it.<eos> What with?<eos> I see no weapons.<eos> We're not frightened of you.<eos> Or the pirate who sent you.
Meatheads.<eos> - Unlock it. Unlock it.<eos> - Okay, wait. Hold on.<eos> Roll your window up.<eos> I'm watching you.
That's cool. All right.<eos> Well, listen.<eos> I... I... I know how to navigate those waters.<eos> So listen. How about this?<eos> How about this? How about I take you both out?
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Grab her.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because the soldier led you?
Wait. What?<eos> He's in Rome.<eos> That's convenient. So we can hit that party at the lncrediBall.<eos> A little too convenient.<eos> Someone wants you here, guys.
You look beautiful.<eos> Hello.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This is the White House as seen from its South Lawn.<eos> For the next hour, Mrs. John F. Kennedy invites you to visit the President's House and see some of the restorations she's made in its interior.
Are you...<eos> This is all insanity!<eos> You and your brother. All these years, all your goddamn secrets!<eos> Caroline and John are all I have left, and I put them in danger because of you.<eos> I would never put you at risk.
- I'm coming with you.<eos> - Uh, you know.<eos> This is an ESD operation.<eos> Strictly off limits to all civilians and warlords.<eos> I let you in.
This red mass on top of the ship, that's your target.<eos> We're gonna send a fleet of drones to go ahead of you and disable their shields.<eos> You mission, is to fly cover for the bombers who will be armed with cold-fusion warheads.<eos> Now, the blast should penetrate the hull and kill that alien queen.<eos> Captain Hiller will brief you on the flight plan.
I know that today is your anniversary.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I booked you a table at a very special restaurant.<eos> The reservation is at 7:30.<eos> Hans can take you and bring you back.
Ray, I know you respect your former rival, but let's see if he even finishes this one.<eos> But Durán's experience is sure to play a great deal in the fight tonight.<eos> He started out as a lightweight, and now he's fighting as a light middleweight.<eos> Now, that's a tremendous jump for any fighter.<eos> Okay, I gave both of you instructions in the dressing room. I want to remind you. Obey my commands at all times.
Don't touch me, man.<eos> Stop saying stuff like that!<eos> Calm down already, man!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you?
What do you people think?<eos> That God is well disposed towards you?<eos> Let me set things straight.<eos> Those who deserve it, go to hell.<eos> I could tell you about hell.
Yeah.<eos> Are you naked?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't...<eos> A bomb dropped on you in 1943.
Over two million soldiers fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.<eos> It cost the American taxpayer $4.5 billion each year just to pay the air conditioning bills for those wars.<eos> And that's what war is really about.<eos> War is an economy.<eos> Anybody who tells you otherwise is either in on it or stupid.
All of it.<eos> But mostly the monsters.<eos> There's a lot of them.<eos> We really do smell.<eos> General Shao welcomes you as honored guests of the Nameless Order, and thanks you for your skill and courage.
I heard.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did Tigress tell you?<eos> I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis... and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop... and those ducks you just passed... and Tigress told me.<eos> Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again?
Okay, who belongs to this one?<eos> You need to teach me the secret chi technique now!<eos> No, no, I'm afraid you need more time.<eos> Everyone, go get your things!<eos> Let me help you with that.
Fire!<eos> Let the weight of our loss fuel you.<eos> Let the weight of our dead embolden you.<eos> Your right! On your right!<eos> Let the weight of our hope drive you to victory.
Hi. How are you?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> God, this rum is incredible.<eos> Be nice if we could sell it up north.<eos> When your country treats you like adults.
You just can't sell to the White operation.<eos> Albert White is a paying customer.<eos> We've never had a problem with him.<eos> I know Albert White.<eos> I thought you might like to deal with someone who treated you like a human being.
Let me out of here!<eos> David! David!<eos> Please let me out! David!<eos> David, please!<eos> (BREATH TREMBLING) GIRL: He doesn't want you.
Where's Billy?<eos> It looks like he's started to drink.<eos> All right. Well...<eos> Anybody else want to leave, now's the time.<eos> No one'll hold no ill will towards you.
# Always on my mind<eos> # One thing I can say, girl<eos> Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.<eos> We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.<eos> This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you.
It makes no difference to you right?<eos> If you marry him, it will be without my blessing.<eos> And without my money.<eos> The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit ... bless and protect you.<eos> May the Lord have mercy on you. And fill you with spiritual blessings. To live together in this life.
But I can offer you something you want very much.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Revenge.<eos> Wesker.<eos> He led you all here to Washington.
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk,<eos> United Federation of Planets.<eos> I'm appearing before you as a neutral representative of the Fobonane Republic.<eos> I bring you a message of goodwill and present to you, esteemed members of the Teenaxi Delegation, a gift from the Fobonane High Council with the highest regard.
Children got older.<eos> Trees growed taller.<eos> Tales growed taller, too.<eos> By and by, even the best ones come to an end.<eos> But I know someone, who would tell you otherwise.
But more closely translated, it actually means...<eos> "Your butts to the sky"...<eos> Which is inappropriate.<eos> This is gonna be magic.<eos> Thank you all again, so much, for being here.
And you smell good.<eos> It's not a weird thing that I wanna have sex with you...<eos> Because you are very sexy... And you were leading me on, and we are in Hawaii... Which is a sexy place, and people have sex here.<eos> God, dude, you built this all up in your head.<eos> Alice and I just saw you on TV...
"All of you responsible for my death."<eos> You can't kill me. I will live on. In your shadow.<eos> In the corner of your eye.<eos> I will be your secret shame.<eos> "The fear that seizes you upon your last breath."
"And at the time of your death," at the death of your wives and children, I will be there to meet you all.<eos> "Damning your souls to the deepest depths of hell."<eos> He wrote that? Uh-huh.<eos> "And your rotten grandparents' souls," and your worm infested ancestors.<eos> I curse you all through the beginnings and ends of time, with illness, with terror.
Does that‒does that mean you believe me, Inspector?<eos> - Yes. You can go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Get out.<eos> - God bless you. Thank you very much.
You feel it is you who should be leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.<eos> If that is what you desire, stay the course.<eos> Trust that your unique talents and remarkable mind will not go unrecognized.<eos> We have a new mission for the Horsemen.<eos> Dylan has a plan and will gather you together soon.
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.<eos> Like you, and many others who, I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school, I dabbled with it.<eos> But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?
- What? We're in Macau.<eos> The oldest magic store in the world is here.<eos> We'll get the supplies we need, and we'll do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Chase will take you to the magic shop in the morning.
Listen, I know that the only thing that we agree on is that our mom and dad had one too many children.<eos> So why don't we just let the kids play with their toys and go get a little drinkey-poo?<eos> - If it's free, it's me.<eos> - Great. Guys, we'll be right back.<eos> Okay, kiddies, the chaperones are watching you.
I beat 'em here easy.<eos> The old Insignia.<eos> Sat nav.<eos> So...<eos> What kept you?
We called Zed's attention and arranged a meeting outside the island of Hong Kong.<eos> But the man behind Darkweb's mask was very different To what I had imagined.<eos> Get out of the car. Leave your things.<eos> He's going to register them.<eos> So what brings you to Hong Kong?
The Colombian who left his credit card at the strip club in Toronto He had been tracking us.<eos> He lost the first transaction, but he was ready for the second.<eos> If Sye had not returned...<eos> Kira and I would be dead.<eos> There is a team waiting for you.
That were stinks.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Throwing in three.. two.. one..<eos> Hey chimps!<eos> Who lets you out of zoo?
That is honestly the first time that I listen to a crash recording... while actually seating with Captain and first office.<eos> It's extraordinary.<eos> That was no simulation.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> Gentlemen. I wanna inform you that the left engine has been recovered.
Do you have any idea the joy a man experiences pulling a 70-pound king mackerel... Out of the waters around Jekyll Island?<eos> It's him.<eos> A Delta team has been clandestinely inserted.<eos> By now they should be en route to your position.<eos> They'll take you to the US embassy where an armored convoy stand by to get you out of SAM range and onto a military jet. Thank God.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.<eos> Frankly, we live in a dangerous world and we have few good options.<eos> But the worst option is to do nothing.<eos> And finally, we owe it to our children and to their children to engage in the world.<eos> God bless you all and God bless the United States of America.
God damn it!<eos> This is old country, Johnny.<eos> No place for weakness.<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> Cooper didn't do shit to you.
How did you get in here?<eos> We let ourselves in.<eos> We are looking for mutants.<eos> Since you know where to find them, we came here.<eos> Caliban doesn't know you.
Real trouble.<eos> Isn't he always?<eos> Some of you spoke to the police... about what you believe you witnessed here yesterday.<eos> You want to know my powers... know who I am... see what I can do?<eos> I'll show you.
Holy shit.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Didn't exactly sent out a welcome committee for you, stiff.<eos> Shut up, Peter.<eos> Humanity welcomes you with hope.
How do you know our names?<eos> What the?<eos> Welcome to the future.<eos> We've been waiting for you.<eos> Our plasma globes will protect you from the toxicity.
- Hi, four. - Hi, four.<eos> Hi, four.<eos> Now they know who we are.<eos> The experiment is the entire focus of the bureau.<eos> Our surveillance technology is centuries ahead of anything you know in Chicago. They grown up watching you.
The director's ready to see you.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I mean Tris, alone.<eos> We can't go together?<eos> Since you were the one who opened the box which invited you here. The director would like to thank your personal.
- What was that?<eos> - What was what?<eos> It's a nice way to say goodbye.<eos> Julian taught me.<eos> I'm glad that the apocalypse is bringing you together.
They spit and stink.<eos> - So do she.<eos> - So do we!<eos> Greetings mammals.<eos> The Shangri Lama will see you...
You're right.<eos> I don't understand that at all.<eos> Now, you'll notice each list also includes my costume and performance suggestions.<eos> Okay?<eos> Miss Crawly will show you to your rehearsal spaces.
You don't have the money, do you?<eos> Well, we don't quite have it all locked in... Well, you'll not get a cent out of me.<eos> Nana, please just listen to me... No, absolutely not.<eos> Don't listen to him, Nana.<eos> I'm not listening to either of you.
Perspective.<eos> The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt.<eos> Protected us.<eos> Risked your lives.<eos> While a great many people see you as heroes.
We're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow.<eos> So...<eos> Fingers cross.<eos> What do you need?<eos> They feed you yet?
Uh, one.<eos> If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.<eos> Did you really think I wanted more of you?<eos> What the hell?<eos> I'm grateful to them though, they brought you here.
Nice house.<eos> - Hi, kids.<eos> -Girls, you remember your brother.<eos> Pris, Faith, this is James.<eos> You've grown up so much since I last saw you.
- It's...<eos> - Back up.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> The Marshal told you to leave me alone!
Hands on your head, fuck you!<eos> There we go.<eos> Did you hit the alarm?<eos> Did you hit the button, you fuck?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to present you with the employee of the month.
What is this shit?<eos> I don't care who the biggest moron is!<eos> I want to know how we're getting out of here.<eos> This has got to end.<eos> I got you into this and I'll get you out of it, but it shits me that this bitch is ripping us off.
Thorne did this.<eos> How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?<eos> Trust?<eos> The men in this room.<eos> Does the wolf know you?
You're not our prince.<eos> My son Trystane...<eos> Your son is weak just like you.<eos> And weak men will never rule Dorne again.<eos> I told you I'm not hungry.
You remember that one?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Hey, Mom.<eos> I have been looking all over for you girls.
Especially for you guys.<eos> You ready?<eos> ♪ You suck, you suck ♪<eos> ♪ You suck today you suck ♪<eos> ♪ I wanna fucking kill you all for wasting all my time ♪
Surely, you can... Surely, you can now tell me something about Merry.<eos> - I surely cannot.<eos> - I would like to speak with her.<eos> Well, she wouldn't like to speak with you.<eos> She hates you.
We're pickin' up guinea pigs.<eos> You really think it's conspiracy shit?<eos> Once the docs run outta people to try their new vaccines on, they'll turn to us.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> What am I asking you for?
We've been worried sick. Out.<eos> I had trouble sleeping.<eos> Why on Earth are you reading this stuff?<eos> It's research on sleep disorders.<eos> Did Beth ever talk to you about anything weird happening to her at night?
- Yes, sir.<eos> As part of Freedom Summer, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, is recruiting and training black and white college students from the North and bussing them into Mississippi to register black voters.<eos> Police have confronted the activists, leading to violent clashes.<eos> For two weeks, we've been training to join other Freedom Summer organizers in Mississippi, but I cannot emphasize enough to you the dangers you will face.<eos> The federal government will not protect you and the Mississippi government will do everything it can to stop you.
Bullshit.<eos> - Politics is war, period. - Congratulations, Daddy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ...that moderation and the pursuit of justice is no virtue.<eos> Let me remind you also that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
Some kids are up in the cabin apparently on some type of killing spree.<eos> Possibly 3 casualties.<eos> They're armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> I repeat, do not go anywhere near them.<eos> They have some kind of skin disease that will eat you alive.
I am Sherlock Holmes, this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.<eos> You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.<eos> However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.<eos> You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.
"She", you mean.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Not "he", "she".<eos> Yes, yes of course.<eos> Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.
Luck?<eos> ! Those are my specialisms.<eos> Hmm, this is really very promising.<eos> Holmes...<eos> Please... do tell us what has so distressed you.
Yeah. At 2:00 a.m.<eos> And here he is at 3:00 a.m.<eos> We've got more on the kid.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Weiss has presented to us a case...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Constitution asks of you to review...

Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... when you file a request for a document from the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, this is what you get.<eos> It's called a redacted document, edited to render unreadable any content the FBI deems a threat to national security, or, more often, to the security of the workings of the FBI itself.<eos> Redaction equals self-preservation.<eos> Like this, there is a redaction in the middle of what the defendant has told you about the night of Andrea's murder, a black rectangle of nothing between the time he had sex with her, and when he, as he says, found her bleeding out.
With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends environed me<eos> And houled in mine ears such hideous cries That with the very noise I trembling waked,<eos> And for a season after could not believe<eos> but that I was in hell.<eos> No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you.
So brief?<eos> 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.<eos> See our commission.<eos> We talk no more.<eos> In God's name, who sent you hither?
Offended us you have not, but the King.<eos> I am his brother, and I love him well.<eos> If you be hired for money back again,<eos> And I will send you to my brother Gloucester And he will reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death.<eos> You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.<eos> Where are my uncles Rivers and Grey?<eos> Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<eos> Your grace attended to their sugar'd words, But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.<eos> God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
Thank you.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Accept this mixture as my gift to you and your husband.<eos> Have him steep the infusion in a cup of tea before bedtime.<eos> I guarantee he will keep you awake all night with his snoring.
Mary Hawkins?<eos> I'm sure I've heard that name before somewhere.<eos> I don't believe we've met. Mm.<eos> Well, it will come to me, somehow.<eos> And what brings you to Paris, Mary?
My name is Mads, and I'm a police officer.<eos> Your colleague, Andriy's son, died a few nights ago.<eos> He died because he was working in unsafe conditions.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> It's not your fault, but that of the people who forced you to work.
Long live Isabelle!<eos> Do not worry, Dave have drunk a little too much.<eos> Maybe its better this way.<eos> She said she wanted a party at her funeral.<eos> I want to drink something, I bring something to you?
Well, they'll never know. They're in jail.<eos> I didn't get a good feeling from this man.<eos> You have good instincts.<eos> And your son deserves better than someone who's never tried a murder case.<eos> Did he ask you to sign anything?
They're called leotards.<eos> Oh, Trixie!<eos> We aren't in the paper in our leotards...<eos> I'm afraid you are, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> Showing every outline that God gave you!
She looks a bit like you, Perry.<eos> Same little nose.<eos> Not so much like Belinda.<eos> She always had a clever-looking face.<eos> Did Dad tell you she didn't come out quite right, yeah?
"Sit tight." That's great advice.<eos> They got a KPV.<eos> Base, we ain't got all day.<eos> Hey, Rone.<eos> They're trying to get Feb 17 to back you up, but we're coming.
Wait for my word!<eos> At least let us get eyes on.<eos> Then we know if we have to intervene.<eos> And if there's an ambush and you get entrenched?<eos> Who rescues you?
You're not thinking of stealing him away for your husband.<eos> Danton is very loyal to me.<eos> When did you hire him in Paris?<eos> What an odd q...<eos> She recognizes you!
Carl Lucas.<eos> I am Carl Lucas.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm Carl Lucas.<eos> If you don't make attempts to befriend someone, loneliness is guaranteed to eat you alive.
Thank you for all you've done for us.<eos> Luke is innocent.<eos> They're not arresting Luke Cage.<eos> They're arresting Carl Lucas.<eos> Who called you?
Reinhard Heydrich has died in hospital.<eos> A direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack.<eos> Yesterday, the Germans went to a village, Lidice, and shot every man over the age of 16.<eos> The women and children have been taken to camps, and the buildings were razed to the ground.<eos> There has been talk that the village aided you somehow.
This is a concern to many people, and so it should be.<eos> I mean, this is something that matters to us.<eos> And let me just say, uh,<eos> I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched.<eos> So let me just tell you, when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service, no one will be watching you.
You don't get it, do you?<eos> Privacy is freedom.<eos> Maybe that's something you should think about defending.<eos> You little prick, you didn't believe in privacy or freedom when we funded your startup, turned you into a billionaire.<eos> I paid you back many, many, many times over.
Where are you now?<eos> Heading towards Smith.<eos> No sign of Bourne.<eos> Subject has turned east, into an alley.<eos> Alpha Team, that alley leads to a footbridge, which will bring him to you.
No.<eos> There's no sign of them.<eos> What do you want us to do?<eos> Work your way down the canal.<eos> I'll circle around and meet you there.
Sorry,Geles.<eos> Sorry, Gills.<eos> Sorry, Gladstone.<eos> Oh, this isn't more efficient at all.<eos> What can I do for you?
[Bleep] [Bleep]<eos> I think this is gonna take too long. Thanks, anyway. Never mind.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Let me buy you back in.
I was your only friend.<eos> Never mind about the train tickets.<eos> We can make our own way.<eos> Very well.<eos> The Central Pacific thanks you for your service, sir.
Keep your horse, honey.<eos> There ain't enough assets in this whole damn town to raise the ransom.<eos> Who could've done this?<eos> From his accent, the leader was Irish.<eos> What did he say to you?
What's that, Fatty?<eos> You remind me of a gorilla I saw once in a traveling circus.<eos> Only the gorilla had better breeding.<eos> You'd be wise to mind your hole or I'm liable to give y'another.<eos> I'd wager your mother dropped you on your head more than once when you were a baby.
It means Free Spirit.<eos> How'd you come by him?<eos> He was lost.<eos> Then he found me.<eos> It was love that nearly killed you, wasn't it?
They brought me here to testify.<eos> Say whatever you want.<eos> Enjoy your nevvfound favor because it will be over in an instant.<eos> Those men you were laughing with in there, they're not your friends.<eos> They'll bleed you dry, toss you out with yesterday's newspapers.
- Oh.<eos> - I'm so glad you're okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah. - Thank you for your concern.<eos> Thank you both for your concern.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Have a nice night, Mr. Assistant District Attorney.<eos> All right.<eos> Like I promised you, let's go get some burgers. I'm starving.
Yes.<eos> But the fact that Mark Fuhrman is a racist and lied about it on the witness stand does not mean that we haven't proven that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> And it would be a tragedy if O.J. Simpson were found not guilty because of the racist attitudes of one police officer.<eos> There is an ocean of evidence that has been unchallenged by the defense.<eos> In an attempt to distract you from it, they took you through a twisted road.
"in violation of penal code section 187,<eos> "a felony upon Ronald Lyle Goldman, a human being, as charged in count two of the information."<eos> All right, thank you.<eos> Will you please be seated?<eos> Ladies and the gentlemen of the jury, I am now going to excuse you from any further service on this trial.
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.<eos> So you know what to tell them.<eos> That Little Sam is your baby.<eos> Yes, now that's very important.<eos> If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.
Let's start over.<eos> Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?<eos> My name is Wil Ohmsford.<eos> I'm here because the Ellcrys is dying and you are the only one who can save it. The Ellcrys is dying?<eos> Yes, and I know the tree speaks to you.
Who knows how many other things he hasn't told you.<eos> Listen, you're obliging two minors to keep a drug addict in the house.<eos> Giulia, think before you speak, because if you declare that,<eos> I have to take note of it and declare him unsuitable.<eos> But for now there's no choice, if he doesn't stay with you, and there are no other close relatives, the court will foster you out immediately.
Which is it?<eos> Urgent business from the capital or his son?<eos> Just tell him.<eos> Why don't you visit the baths, change your clothes?<eos> And the Khan will receive you when he receives you.
Fortnight, God willing.<eos> Transport Minister, Vice Regent, Left Chancellor...<eos> The Khan's given you more titles than he has consorts in his harem.<eos> He honors me with lack of sleep.<eos> The Khan will see you now.
I know, I know.<eos> It's a scandal.<eos> You're more for the ladies, I take it?<eos> - I suppose I am, sir.<eos> Yes, I'll leave you to it.
He has a quick temper.<eos> Does he beat you?<eos> No!<eos> Well, that's something, isn't it?<eos> Does your father beat you?
Again with respect, Your Majesty, that doesn't make them right.<eos> - And what would you do?<eos> - Retreat.<eos> Retreat?<eos> I never hear anything else from you.
Your son, Excellency.<eos> Come, Prince Bagration, cheer up.<eos> You're our guest of honour, you know.<eos> Yes, that's Russia for you.<eos> Suffer a terrible defeat and they praise you to the skies.
Your new friend did. I let her used my hand.<eos> Do you think we'll have to move?<eos> I don't know, sweetie.<eos> Dad won't like this. I should tell him.<eos> As friends we've gathered, hearts are true, spirits near, we call to you.
They're from people who were here before.<eos> How did you find out about that?<eos> Daddy told me, with the board.<eos> Come on.<eos> As friends we've gathered, hearts are true, spirits near, we call to you.
Um... okay, most of you were lost on optimal polynomials on the last quiz, uh, so once you choose the degree and domain of the polynomial, the polynomial is chosen to minimize your worst-case error,<eos> so the goal here is... to minimize the maximum probability of P-f, where f is the actual function here.<eos> Uh, P is the approximate polynomial.<eos> X varies over the chosen intervals.<eos> Now, for well-behaved functions, there's always an Nth-degree polynomial... take you to an error curve that oscillates back and forth between... positive epsilon and negative epsilon... the value of N+2 times brings you back
We need to find your husband, Nora.<eos> Before he hurts someone else.<eos> I was asleep.<eos> I woke up when I heard him leave.<eos> That's all I can tell you.
Oh, dear God.<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> Turns out the front door was a push, not a pull.<eos> Well, maybe we should just reschedule.<eos> You have three hours to find the four keys that will prevent the apocalypse and release you from this room.
You just changed my life.<eos> He's got to be here somewhere.<eos> What's up, Peralta? Want to jump in on this tasty sesh?<eos> Uh, you got the wrong guy.<eos> I've never seen you before.
The 5 gold shops lost $10M in total.<eos> The police believe the mastermind is the "Most Wanted" Yip Kwok-foon.<eos> Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!<eos> But shit has hit the fan!<eos> I told you to put more newspaper underneath!
Who said there's gonna be a next time?<eos> Oh, you're a little bit of a bitch, ain't you?<eos> You need to be a lot better if you want to get signed.<eos> I've seen high school bands play better than you do.<eos> Your one saving grace... People hate you.
Evmta 'You of the<eos> Here's what I propose.<eos> AI month, and renewable.<eos> With room and board, of course.<eos> Gentlemen, Paris awaits you.
- Who 's there?<eos> My Lord...<eos> I made it to the state some service, it is known.<eos> Do not talk about it anymore.<eos> But I beg you, in your letter, in reporting these sad events, refer to me as I am.
Please, Mother, it's embarrassing.<eos> If you don't ask, you don't get.<eos> Prince Vassily!<eos> Prince Vassily.<eos> You know I've never asked you for anything,
If you don't ask, you don't get.<eos> Prince Vassily!<eos> Prince Vassily.<eos> You know I've never asked you for anything,<eos> I've never reminded you of what my father did for you, but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris.
I'll do what I can.<eos> What is it you wish for the boy, Anna Mikhailovna?<eos> Get him a commission in the Guards and recommend him to the General. You know a word from you would do it.<eos> You know, my influence is nothing like what you imagine. But I am seeing the sovereign later this evening.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you.
Quickly, now.<eos> It's a matter of life or death.<eos> You must be a man now.<eos> You have to look after your own interests. Don't expect your Cousin Vassily to.<eos> You need to let the old Count see you before he dies.
Oh, now, Count. There you are, too modest.<eos> The very fact that your father singled you out for greatness shows that you must have exceptional qualities, which I discovered for myself long since.<eos> Really?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> And Prince Vassily is advising you?
And when I become principal, I'm gonna make sure you finally get the respect you're due.<eos> Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> You're gonna get us a raise?<eos> No, no, it's not gonna be a raise.<eos> I... I'm just gonna make sure that, you know, people don't look down upon you like they do now.
Pretty fucking pathetic.<eos> I think we've all learned our lesson here.<eos> Hayden, I say when lessons have been learned.<eos> Lessons have been learned.<eos> Now Mr. Hayden's gonna take you to your rooms, since he caused this whole entire debacle. - I'm sorry, what?
Well... I'll just...<eos> What have you done now?<eos> What have I done?<eos> You've made an exhibition of yourself, and of me.<eos> Someone told you that Dolokhov was my lover, and you believed them.
Good evening.<eos> Evening.<eos> What?<eos> I believe I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov?<eos> I have heard about the misfortune that has befallen you, sir, and I am very sorry for it.
Natasha.<eos> If I don't speak now, I'm afraid I never will.<eos> I adore you.<eos> I have never felt this way about any woman or girl.<eos> I think about you all day and dream of you at night.
I sleep badly, I wake with fearful thoughts.<eos> What's the matter with me?<eos> Perhaps you are changing your world, and forgetting to change yourself.<eos> Do you try to forgive those who have wounded you?<eos> "My dear Helene, I believe we should resume married life together, "if that is agreeable to you."
- It's him.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.<eos> Prince Andrei, it's a pleasure to welcome you here.<eos> It seems so long since we last saw you.
- I never asked for them!<eos> You can see them if you like!<eos> Perhaps we should go...<eos> My dear Count Rostov, I'm so sorry you have been kept waiting.<eos> The Prince is indisposed, but Princess Marya will receive you.
What's she got to be mournful about?<eos> And La Bourienne. Now, she makes the most of herself.<eos> She makes herself agreeable. Eh?<eos> If you're asking me, I wouldn't have said it but as you ask,<eos> I think you treat Marya abominably, when anyone can see how much she loves you and respects you.
Lies!<eos> What it is, Your Excellency, they've got it into their heads that they'd be better off waiting for the French.<eos> You haven't understood.<eos> You have my word that you will be housed and fed at our estate near Moscow.<eos> If you stay, the enemy will destroy you.
I'm gonna sue all your asses, okay?<eos> Our asses have been through a hell of a lot more than being sued by someone like you,<eos> - so please just sit down.<eos> - Okay, everybody here needs to stop talking about asses, okay?<eos> Look, my daughter already told you that she was inside the store.
The fund-raiser... what time did we end up leaving?<eos> Had to be after 1:00 in the morning.<eos> You spent a few hours working on your speech for the Presidents Council.<eos> I am truly sorry about Laura Parks' death, but if you have any further questions, please talk to my lawyer.<eos> Chris will see you out.
Sarah and Jeb's, August 23, 2001.<eos> It was by a lake, and I remember that you teared up during their vows.<eos> Pollen count was off the charts up there.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> This is invitation only, and I asked you to speak to my lawyer if you want...
- Hi.<eos> So, uh, you guys knew Jason well?<eos> I try to get to know all my junior programmers.<eos> He had a promising career ahead of him.<eos> Well, Chris can help you.
We talked, I explained what I could offer, and then I told him to go enjoy "Satan's Palace IV."<eos> That was the last I saw of him.<eos> And we're done.<eos> If there's anything further,<eos> Jeff can put you in touch with my lawyers.
Exactly.<eos> Anyway, I'm gonna be relying on the two of you to help get us through this.<eos> Anything that we can do to help, Jeremy.<eos> North Jackson needs both of you.<eos> That's why I'm asking you to serve as co-interim principals, share the office while we sort this whole mess out.
Take cover!<eos> Don't move.<eos> There you are, Luc!<eos> Excuse us, gentlemen.<eos> I'm sorry if the children's play has disturbed you.
Chuck.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> - Kevin. Paige.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Thank you both for coming.
Then you keep after him.<eos> If St. Germain is behind this... then we need to connect him to the gang, Les Disciples.<eos> I will lay just vengeance at your feet or be damned.<eos> Claire!<eos> Uncle Silas allowed you in?
Mary tells me of your plans to wed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?<eos> Of course.<eos> However, I am concerned about your ability to find a new position in Paris now that the duke has discharged you from his service.
_<eos> _<eos> False accusations can lead to dire consequences, Monsieur St. Germain.<eos> _<eos> Comte, by your own account, Lord Broch Tuarach saved you from injury or even death.
I am at Your Majesty's complete disposal.<eos> Très bien.<eos> Très bien, ma chère.<eos> So pale.<eos> I can see why they call you La Dame Blanche.
Over the last 50 years,<eos> Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat had been alternately loyal to both the exiled King James and the monarchs sitting on the British throne.<eos> His personal life was equally infamous.<eos> Aside from numerous extramarital dalliances, Lord Lovat had had three wives, two of them acquired by nefarious means.<eos> Lord Lovat will be with you shortly.
This is the only place where my mind goes quiet.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> They say you are a White Lady.<eos> Yes, they do say that.<eos> What brings you into a church, then?
When I still lived in the village, I saw Lachlan Gibbons' daughter's man wrapped in seaweed, and the eels stirring beneath his shirt.<eos> I told Lachlan what I'd seen, and he went straight away and stove a hole in the boy's boat.<eos> Lord, there was a stramash, a right to-do.<eos> But when the great storm came the next week, three men were drowned, and that boy was safe at home, still mending his boat.<eos> What did you see... right before Lord Lovat threw you out?
And why are ye creeping around at night?<eos> Addressed to a British officer.<eos> He's a spy.<eos> I'm no spy!<eos> I saw the light of your fires, and when I came to investigate, I recognized you as Red Jamie... The unprincipled and traitorous rebel.
Right before yer eyes, huh?<eos> And then... then give her to my men to do with what they will, huh?<eos> Sassenach.<eos> All right!<eos> Release the lady, and I will tell you whatever you wish.
It's not a bang bus, okay?<eos> Look...<eos> Just get in the wagon, I'll give you a ride to Center City.<eos> Get in.<eos> Gentlemen, let me walk you through how our simple business works.
You're giving them a completely inauthentic, frightening experience, and you're scaring them.<eos> Okay, listen, ladies, nobody's gonna get hurt.<eos> Will you just let us out, please?<eos> Well, no.<eos> No, I'm not gonna let you out.
Most of them.<eos> Well, why not just take the second list and push 'em over the side right now?<eos> Wouldn't that save us all a lot of trouble?<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Those men out there hear the two of you arguing, and they might just lose whatever faith they've got left that we have any idea what we're doing in here.
I was then asked if you had yet learned of this converted cache.<eos> So standing outside the door just now,<eos> I found myself faced with two choices... report what I had just heard, that you are considering keeping this money and know that Nassau will likely burn for it and me with it... or I could open the door<eos> and warn you of the full scope of the danger you face if you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache along with the gold from the fort.<eos> I cannot even begin to imagine what would motivate you to tell a lie like this.
Run...!<eos> Run!<eos> Not another step!<eos> And don't you dare point either of those things at me!<eos> So... the Countess sent you here to finish me off.
But who will take care of us?<eos> You can't leave us alone.<eos> I won't.<eos> That's why I called you all here today.<eos> Now, I have provided you with various weapons.
Sorry, I wasn't tired.<eos> Miss Whelan.<eos> Oh, er, not any more.<eos> Her name is Mrs Havistock.<eos> What brings you out to India, sir?
Thank you, Mrs. Baskets. Mm-hm.<eos> How long have you been going with Chip?<eos> - Mm-mm-mm-mm. - Oh, we're...<eos> - We're not... - Mm-mm. Oh.<eos> If anyone saw you on the street, they would think you're a couple.
And your wives.<eos> I trust there will be a full house.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> When I preach, standing room only.<eos> Thank you both so much.
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.<eos> First off, killer marketing campaign.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Second, you've each been given a non-disclosure agreement to sign.<eos> If any of you repeat anything said in this room, I will skull-rape you so hard, legally speaking, that your great-great-grandchildren will spend their short, miserable lives as indentured servants to mine.
I think it's neither the time nor the place nor the Slater to discuss it!<eos> I'm not the one who brought it up!<eos> - You are exactly the one!<eos> - First of all...<eos> Could you both please shut up and do what I hired you to do?
- The kids are away. It'll be quiet.<eos> - And what about Gordon?<eos> I lost track. Is he in or is he out?<eos> Gordon didn't make it.<eos> Thank you all for coming to get me.
- Let go of me!<eos> No! No!<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> I'm afraid that that is all the time that I have. Sarah will show you out.
She knows all of history as though she had written it herself.<eos> But I do not tell her that lest she get a big head.<eos> Well you are too late, because she is more arrogant than Queen Isabella.<eos> What did Amelia mean by "honor y reputation"?<eos> Because she shut you up.
I am going to retire.<eos> I beg you to stay a while and speak well of this wine.<eos> -That we will.<eos> Amina is preparing your accomodations.<eos> When you are ready, she will take you to them.
Okay All right, thanks, see you.<eos> Is it necessary that she be here?<eos> It is, she is back at her post.<eos> I won't ask for your forgiveness, because I know that forgiveness isn't gifted.<eos> I will prove to you that you can trust me again.
But I fell in love again.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then again and again...<eos> I don't know why it doesn't surprise me.<eos> What it would surprise you is how expensive is to love.
- Quiet! - You "comprenez"?<eos> - Quiet! - Call the priest!<eos> Come on, we'll take advantage of the guard change.<eos> Let's go! Come on, come on.<eos> Rosa will guide you through the convent passageways.
In my office?<eos> Ah, of course, yes.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> While we look for a place to set you up,<eos> Ernesto will accompany you around the Ministry and clarify any doubts that you might have.
For the next ten days, we will be traveling around the holiest place in the world, Israel.<eos> For free!<eos> - Gotcha, Jews.<eos> - Makes no sense.<eos> Well, our beautiful country will teach you all about Judaism, its rich history, and I'm looking at the two of you, its reproductive future.
Any?<eos> All?<eos> Send search parties into the slums.<eos> Find his co-conspirators and bring them to me.<eos> You want me to leave you alone... with him?
- My Khan would not let me.<eos> - You cannot help who you are.<eos> He will hold you close until he realizes that who you are can only hurt him.<eos> You do not want to be here when that day comes.<eos> In the morning, when the Khan is looking for you, I will ensure our scouts report you rode east.
- It should have been you.<eos> - No.<eos> Babies with eyes color of the sea.<eos> The Prince...<eos> Jingim has real affection in his heart for you.
But you seem like reasonable people.<eos> I mean, you're sportin' dress blues, for Christ's sake.<eos> And, like I said, we're gonna drive you back to where you were.<eos> I mean, do you know how awkward it is carpooling with someone whose friend or friends you've just killed?<eos> Oof. But I told you not to ask any questions.
Officer, please escort Ms. Diaz<eos> -from the courtroom. -No, it's fine.<eos> I'm leaving. I'm invisible here.<eos> Wait for your counsel outside.<eos> As soon as I get the report on the children's father, I will contact you to arrange for the next court appearance.
Something is coming.<eos> Something hungry for blood.<eos> A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
It makes a painful... and then... it crumbles to the ground.<eos> Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time and, and, and... and...<eos> Lucas cuts off its seven heads, and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.<eos> You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious, and you present them to King Tristan.<eos> He thanks you for your bravery and service.
I'm down four fucking firehouses in the last nine months here, Stan.<eos> -The mayor knows he owes you. -Fuck the mayor!<eos> Listen up.<eos> I know some of y'all are gonna want to make some money this summer, so remember, Francisco Cruz is offering paying summer jobs and internships.<eos> Make sure you visit his center, tell him Ms. Green sent you.
You don't drink and drive, folks.<eos> - Yes, Antonio?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's a lesson for every single person on this bus.<eos> Okay, love you both.
You wouldn't remember, because that life and those memories were erased.<eos> I have been at the Mariposa for 10 years.<eos> - Before that, I was in New Orleans. I... - No.<eos> You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so.<eos> They don't rewrite you completely.
You've only been the madam at the Mariposa for the last year or so.<eos> They don't rewrite you completely.<eos> I mean, they could, but it'd be too much work.<eos> Takes thousands of hours to build your personalities.<eos> Usually, they just tweak you a little bit, and drop you into a new role.
Haven't we talked about this before?<eos> Yes, yes, we have.<eos> But I can't help myself.<eos> Perhaps you should be leaving.<eos> Every man in the room was looking at you.
And why ever not?<eos> He's jolly happy and why isn't everyone?<eos> He certainly doesn't want Mr Nehru or anyone else looking over his fence.<eos> - But...<eos> - And, of course, I will help you any way I can.
Mr Dalal. You look quite pink.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> Do not for one minute think I am afraid of you.<eos> Fighting talk.<eos> Don't you imagine for one minute that all your fine new friends will protect you.
- I know, I know, I know.<eos> - Aren't you going to ask me how I am?<eos> - How are you, Mr McLeod?<eos> - She turned me down.<eos> - Who turned you down?
Anybody seen Crazy?<eos> Not since her and her cuckoo compadre stepped on my sandcastle.<eos> I know they didn't mean to, but still.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - I said, "Run, because if I catch you, I'll kill you."
Are you asking if I'm afraid?<eos> Of what you will face here within these walls before this savage struggle is over?<eos> Not everyone was made for this.<eos> And one thing I have learned is how very little can be accomplished under the spirit of fear.<eos> Do I seem afraid to you, Miss Hastings?
Just what do you think you're doing?<eos> Trying to improve the ventilation in the ward, miss Hastings.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> I saw a light, maybe it was a tunnel, and, uh, uh, there was a figure there...<eos> It was probably Dr. Foster begging you to go away.
This is more than secrets.<eos> Calling for the King's head is open sedition.<eos> That has nothing to do with Beaufort's accusations against us.<eos> Are you going to arrest me?<eos> Who taught you how to handle that?
He's not only family, but a favourite, too.<eos> And this Marcheaux. He's bothered you before?<eos> - Marcheaux doesn't scare me.<eos> - That's not what I asked.<eos> Look, D'Artagnan, Treville brought you back to fight a different kind of war.
Get off him!<eos> Jyra.<eos> Hey, you catch the news?<eos> - Kid was a subbie.<eos> - Did anyone see you?
He claims you have caused trouble, but I'll get it resolved.<eos> - You've probably also found new friends.<eos> - We must get away from here now!<eos> If you will not help us, we must do it yourself.<eos> Of course I will help you.
Your uncle was very upset.<eos> He loves you dearly, but he... He doesn't feel he's good enough to take care of you yet.<eos> I'm sure he'll come and visit you as soon as he...<eos> I had to tell it.<eos> There wasn't anyone to help you out there.
Too many people.<eos> Where is it?<eos> King and Queen County.<eos> Just a farmhouse up there.<eos> I figure it gets you out the county, but keeps you close.
Forgive me!<eos> It's all my fault!<eos> I'm begging you!<eos> Please forgive me!<eos> Thank you all for looking after my wife.
- Without permission?<eos> Excuse me while I borrow these.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I apologize for my forwardness.<eos> Does Shochu work for you?
How old are you, Nishadi?<eos> My sister is 13.<eos> Do you have any more bruises?<eos> CAMERA CLICKS - What about your sister? Does she have any?<eos> Why did he tie you up?
- Why is that?<eos> Isn't that the police chief?<eos> Excuse me, can you help us?<eos> Our camera has been stolen.<eos> Yes, well, we're a little bit busy, but Ásgeir will help you.
This guy's name is Kelso.<eos> Now, he was sent by your business partner, who apparently wanted to become a sole proprietor.<eos> My partner's going to pick him up, okay?<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
Russia would blame the United States for not protecting its citizens, and retaliate.<eos> One homemade bomb from terrorists would've sparked World War III.<eos> Would have, but it didn't.<eos> Because none of this is real.<eos> But it will be, if you don't let me protect you from yourselves.
Elias's killers left the scene in this vehicle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One killer, and one guy who Elias respected.<eos> Root, RTCC got a hit on the vehicle transporting Finch.<eos> The machine beat you to the punch.
Why did you even get out of the bed this morning?<eos> Why did you eat what you ate?<eos> Why did you wear what you wore?<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Other than the fact that I would fire you and hire someone else if you didn't show up for work, but...
Let's go in, we'll have our session, and we'll talk about it okay?<eos> - We had an appointment.<eos> - I'm waiting for you here. - I'm waiting for you here.<eos> - We're the ones who had an appointment.<eos> I'm going to go in with you, and then we'll have a session.
- Obtaining the four keys allows passage beyond the gates and a return to your world.<eos> Only there can your father's soul be saved.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> Did you just hear that?<eos> - The other world awaits you.
- T -- t -- the dagger, where'd you put the..<eos> Where'd you put the dagger?<eos> - The dagger.. The bureau!<eos> Go!<eos> - The other side awaits you.
If your friends come to rescue you...<eos> If your friends come to rescue you...<eos> They'll all be captured they'll all be captured.<eos> If they don't, then they're not really your friends<eos> The Captain says that woman treats you well.
Give me a smile.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hey!<eos> Give me a smile. There it is!<eos> I told you not to move.
And when you come by on the way back tonight, we swap wagons, it'll be like this never happened.<eos> Well, there is another issue, I'm afraid.<eos> This, uh, Seraphina, she appears to be more broken than you described.<eos> I may not be able to take her in that condition.<eos> Tell you what.
I vowed when I got older, I would have a hot fudge machine, and now I have one.<eos> And you're not gonna smear sheep's blood on it either.<eos> You know, you should not be out here so casually.<eos> Her book club is in there, and if one of those yentas sees you, this is all over.<eos> I assume that you've all read the book I gave you for this week.
And get young Michael here some food and a bunk.<eos> You heard the man!<eos> Come!<eos> Should we talk later when you're... less distracted?<eos> Do I look distracted to you?
I need a guarantee that my husband will be safe.<eos> Broussard already made that deal.<eos> I need to hear it from you.<eos> You need?<eos> I believe in this cause. I have proven my loyalty to you. But I cannot live with a gun pointed at my family's head.
Goodbye, Inspector.<eos> Anyone might think you were spying on me, Captain.<eos> Forgive me, Your Highness.<eos> What are you doing creeping around in the woods?<eos> If anything happens to you, Your Highness, I'll be shot.
Now, I have many vices.<eos> Hypocrisy is not one of them.<eos> So you will resume your duties, but this time... you will be more discreet.<eos> Thank you, Your Highness.<eos> His Highness will see you now.
Heil Hitler.<eos> Herr Reichsführer, welcome to our humble home.<eos> We are delighted you could spare the time from your innumerable duties and we are only sorry your dear wife is unable to come with you on this occasion.<eos> You will, we hope, allow us, as representatives of the Hohenzollern dynasty and the royal house of Prussia, to congratulate you and the Führer on the latest of your astounding series of great victories.<eos> The National Socialist Democratic Workers' Party thanks you for your kind words and your loyal support.
Her show starts in 15 minutes.<eos> Are you in or are you out?<eos> You're breaking up the band?<eos> Have the two of you lost your minds?<eos> Your single is in the Top 100, Highway 65 is backing your album, and you'd be breaking a contract Autumn'll probably sue you for.
It was "Can I turn you?"<eos> I failed, too.<eos> What?<eos> Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty.<eos> Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit.
I'm gonna kill you anyway.<eos> That's a promise.<eos> Oh, what have I done to deserve such enmity?<eos> No, let me rephrase that.<eos> What have I done to you?
And I've got ten paddy rollers scouring the surrounding acres.<eos> I mean, from what I hear, most runners... they don't get far.<eos> They lurk, and they fret, and then they return.<eos> So why should I hire you?<eos> Did your rollers tell you how they managed to get off your plantation?
I was...<eos> Taken ill myself.<eos> Uh, the pastor was there to fortify him on his final journey.<eos> Really?<eos> Does he look fortified to you?
I don't think we'll be seeing him again.<eos> I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.<eos> I made sure I wasn't followed.<eos> I must say, sir, what a pleasure it is to meet you.<eos> I saw you in "Richard III" last year.
Elizabeth, you've been doing this for almost 20 years.<eos> The job wasn't meant to be forever.<eos> So what, the Centre wants us to pack our bags and come home?<eos> You've had a good, long tour.<eos> The Centre would welcome you with honors the moment you tell them you're ready.
Miss Jubilee, that pretty young thing, was kind enough to share with me the nature of your acquaintance.<eos> And seeing how the price of those Macon niggers' heads is so high, I thought I'd come out here and introduce myself.<eos> Name's Jeremiah Johnson.<eos> I hope you don't mind, I brought some friends along.<eos> See, we've heard your name, Mr. Pullman, and your reputation does proceed you.
- Please.<eos> - You're damn right.<eos> No, no, look at me.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I want you to remember this face, because if anyone from the ALM fucks with the Soldados again, I'm the man that's gonna kill you.
Bravo, well done.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What a performance, Gaston.<eos> But where are you now?<eos> This mask of innocence and civility does not fit you very well.
I'm the boss.<eos> We have a community...<eos> Why don't y'all go get cleaned up, hmm?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Jesus will show you where you can get washed up.
You can see we have one of yours.<eos> We'll trade.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> First I want to talk to Maggie and Carol, make sure they're all right.<eos> I'm gonna put you on.
Not at all.<eos> Abandoned by my wife, addicted to morphine, shamed by my family.<eos> Not shamed, no.<eos> - You pity me.<eos> - I respect you!
I could smell it from the backseat.<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> Why did you let him drive you?<eos> He's an adult.<eos> Are you sure he was drinking alcohol while he was driving you?
- Yes.<eos> I-I am from Siroun.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> I know of it.<eos> God bless you both.
Mr. Myers, when you arrive in Bassek, find reverend Antreassian.<eos> He'll arrange the boats for you, and tell him we'll be along with the rest of the orphans as soon as we can.<eos> Thank you. You're a brave man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you.
No, I didn't think we'd see him again.<eos> And now?<eos> It's like he never left.<eos> Let me ask you, John, Claire, most marriages that go through the trauma of losing a child can't recover.<eos> So what kept you two so strong through all this?
Give them a glance.<eos> They repay the effort.<eos> Good day to you.<eos> Good day. Good day. October the 6th, 1892.<eos> My dear Sir Malcolm, where this letter shall find you, I don't know.
Excuse me?<eos> I can't risk it.<eos> You'll have to investigate this hack on your own, and you'll have to do it before the rest of DHS finds out what's going on.<eos> What, so if anything goes wrong, you disavow any knowledge of it?<eos> Look, I covered for you because it was the right thing to do at the time.
Mind if I take a seat?<eos> Going forward, you might want to consider vetting your information a little better.<eos> Lesson learned.<eos> I could take pleasure in watching you three circle the drain, but I am a practical man.<eos> And there was a reason that I hired and trained all of you in the first place.
I'm counting to five, and then it's off the table.<eos> - One...<eos> - We'll do it.<eos> Wise.<eos> And I'd better see you at the funeral.
No, I'm here because I have a responsibility to speak to you like someone who understands this world in a way that you don't.<eos> The only way this doesn't end with us dead is you doing the right thing.<eos> Like you all did the right thing when you turned in that boy Finn?<eos> You surrendered one of the young lives you swore to protect, and the Grounders did what they always do.<eos> They betrayed you.
So you're a... you're a traveling salesman, Mr. Healy?<eos> What is it that you sell?<eos> Acne creams and ointments for Beechwood Pharmaceutical.<eos> And you and Donna are estranged.<eos> What estranged you two?
No. None.<eos> Good.<eos> So, let's talk about what happened to your old bunkmate Jamie Thorne.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Jodie told you where I was.
Celia says they're courting donors from outside the 30th.<eos> But one of my aides heard that Claire Underwood and LeAnn Harvey were in Jones' office today.<eos> Huh... LeAnn's someone I know.<eos> Glendon Hill was courting her a few years ago.<eos> Did she turn you down?
I cannae do it all on my own, Lee.<eos> Hello, baby.<eos> What's this?<eos> Hello, love.<eos> When I saw you at the cafe, I panicked.
Why do we have to be here?<eos> We don't even like them. Hey, hey, this isn't about liking people or having fun, all right?<eos> It's about putting to rest some very ugly stereotypes.<eos> So no watermelon.<eos> All right? If anybody asks you if you're hungry, you say, "point me to the hummus." Hummus.
All we can change is in this place.<eos> I have done that.<eos> And it's all due to you.<eos> So thank you, Master Polo.<eos> When I returned from Xiangyang, I looked for you.
- I did. But there is...<eos> - No, there is no but.<eos> Even a dog unknowingly craves discipline.<eos> And by the time he attains it, he has forgotten how hard he was beaten.<eos> I was taken prisoner, too, but you let me live and I've served you well.
Only with what's before me.<eos> And that's a man who loathes everything that I am but is now asking for my help.<eos> The chieftains wish to know who you will support.<eos> Should we discuss concessions then?<eos> I told you I don't drink.
Vanessa, hold on.<eos> Why do you think he was talking about the Banning Clinic?<eos> The white room with no day or night can only be one place.<eos> The cell I was kept in.<eos> According to the records, Dr. Banning attempted to treat you with hydrotherapy and psychotropic drugs.
I want to help you.<eos> I'm very good at this.<eos> There is nothing wrong with me.<eos> This is about him.<eos> Did my dad call you?
Sorry, Rach. You jealous?<eos> Please don't flatter yourself.<eos> You really think that that's gonna help Darius?<eos> I'm just having a good time. Mm-hmm. Yes.<eos> Chet is manipulating you.
Is it gonna be you or Quinn?<eos> If it's you, then you need to get back in with Quinn.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> I don't need to tell you what it means to have made it down to the Final Three.<eos> Today Darius is gonna take each of you out on a date that he has chosen especially for you.
Well, we know It destroyed an entire civilization over there.<eos> Who knows what It has planned here?<eos> Tremors, you saw the future, right?<eos> You see anything else? Anything that might help us out?<eos> Director Coulson would like to see you in his office... all of you.
And think, Edmund, on what else that might mean, the true killer still walking the streets you once knew as home.<eos> You will have missed the last train by now, I think, Miss Goren.<eos> We shall make a room up for you.<eos> The lady left before daylight, I believe.<eos> She left a note for you, however.
There is a wake we must attend.<eos> - Is Roy Teague here?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> He could not bear the sight and bolted.<eos> What trouble brings you here, young Mr. Dove?
The pair of you always were like two rats in a sack!<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> He told me nothing, Bennet.<eos> He made heavy point of it.<eos> Did he tell you how we made the case?
Be careful with him!<eos> When you reach the river, head west for two miles to a rickety bridge that looks like a crooked smile.<eos> Listen, when you cross it, go to the top of the hill, look for a house got a lantern in the window.<eos> Belongs to a man named John, John Hawkes.<eos> Tell him a friend of a friend sent you.
Here, let me.<eos> Oh, no, gestures like that do more harm than good.<eos> Reverend Willowset, I presume... good morning.<eos> Mr. Hawkes, I was told you'd arrived last night.<eos> What brings you to Georgia?
Now, tell me what happened.<eos> We were heading back to New York City when my wife suddenly fell faint.<eos> Uh, she recently with child.<eos> You're a long way from home.<eos> What brings you this way?
"I never can get back by day, nor can remember plain and clear,<eos> the curious music that I hear."<eos> I've got to go, before the day fellows get here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day soon, no one will touch you when you don't want to be touched.
I blazed my way through the darkness. Through iron will and violent force, and the glory of God are empires born.<eos> There are mountains named after me.<eos> And at what cost?<eos> Your home's empty.<eos> Your son hates you.
All the Night Creatures coming out to play.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She is with him.<eos> She is home.<eos> Your hands give you away, almost, Doctor.
Welcome to our service.<eos> It's beautiful to see you all here today.<eos> This morning,<eos> I'm gonna tell you the story of Plato's Cave.<eos> Plato asks you to imagine this cave that people are born into, chained, so they can only see in one direction...
What are you doing?<eos> Trying not to get involved.<eos> Does that include me?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I know how you look up to Scott and how all of you feel about him.
He knows why he's here.<eos> He knows about the Beast.<eos> The Beast of Gevaudan.<eos> History's most vicious, most famous werewolf.<eos> And you think I'm going to show you how to steal its power.
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Thank you, Paco.<eos> She's so nice!<eos> ...the lines are still open waiting for your advice and especially new stories.<eos> For those who have just joined us, either because this heat has kept you awake or simply because you've just tuned in, let me tell you that we've recently started a new section called
Come on, guys. Get the hell out of here.<eos> Go have lives.<eos> Your teenage years are not the time for academic achievement.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> That's a lie sold to you by the government.
Keep in mind that I'm mortal, and as much as I want these guys out of my city, I like breathing, so let me go to the covens.<eos> I can propose an alliance.<eos> They hate you guys, but if I explain what's going on...<eos> There's no time.<eos> There never is, but before we rush into battle, let's keep in mind that Tristan may be the very foe to lead you to your doom.
Before you rush headlong toward almost certain death, As your sire, I would like to invite you all to employ just a little bit of common sense.<eos> We are ancient vampires, Elijah, each of us almost as strong as you.<eos> You might almost be successful in subduing us, but at what price?<eos> Most of you will die in the process, and for what?<eos> To avenge a fool marching you headlong toward your very extinction in the name of a witch's prophecy?
I have an excellent candidate in mind.<eos> See, today is the day<eos> I take back what is mine.<eos> Do I hear any objections?<eos> So ladies and gentlemen, the offer I extend to you is simple enough.
At least one of us will have a degree that matters.<eos> I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not like it was four years ago when the only thing I had to worry about in freshman year was catching something from a communal shower curtain.<eos> Emily, you're not gonna have......<eos> Yes, I am, Hanna.<eos> How am I supposed to take notes when the voice in my head is telling me that Sara Harvey is torturing you for something Melissa might have done?
Felicity.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say can...<eos> - Felicity, no. And will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> Don't do-- don't do this.<eos> Thank you both for coming.
Ruvé Darhk?<eos> HIVE.<eos> She said the Green Arrow left them at Reddington to die.<eos> What's Reddington?<eos> Reddington industrial is where Darhk held you all hostage over the holidays.
We've-we've met many times before.<eos> Then who's Elliot?<eos> I-I really wouldn't know.<eos> This is a bad start to whatever we're doing.<eos> Well, now, what brings you fellas to the festival?
Let's get this over with.<eos> I wonder which one of us is the murderer?<eos> Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room, and then I'm done with my volunteer hours and we never come back here again.<eos> Mrs. Parkhurst?<eos> Look at you two, stealing from the elderly.
Then you'll rot, unless you get your act together and take the Lord's hand.<eos> It's OK.<eos> Now you're with me they'll bully you even more.<eos> But the Lord says:<eos> "Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter evil against you on my account.
As the Lord says...<eos> "Do not store up treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.<eos> Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for yourjourney, or two tunics, or sandals.<eos> Instead, strive for His kingdom.<eos> These things will be given to you.
You're the last ones, the not killed.<eos> No darkness is deep enoughNto protect you from my light. You're the last ones, the not killed. Those who poisoned the soul and hope of an entire people.<eos> The last ones, the not killed.<eos> The mountain will drown you all.
Now you go back to surfaceNand tell them all the dead are here.<eos> Run!<eos> Tell everyone thatNthe dead have new clothes!<eos> The dead have new clothes on!<eos> Now sleep and the mountain will drown you all.
I said inside, goddammit!<eos> Get in. -<eos> - I feel I'm gonna throw up.<eos> I feel sick, I'm gonna vomit. Then do it quick and get inside.<eos> And the mountain will bury you all.
He sent me here.<eos> I know him, he works with my mother. -<eos> - I have him on the phone, here.<eos> Can you please tell him you're ok?<eos> And that Alain is helping you?
We were drag racing down on Route 7 with Davis and Billy when Tommy's car went into a ditch.<eos> That's when they found it.<eos> Found what?<eos> This...<eos> Been looking all over for you.
You're making it worse.<eos> I don't want to see you lot in the shit. - Us'?<eos> - We didn't do nothing.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> So I'll cover for you and say we got here together, shouted, "Armed police!" - but he pulled a gun.
What did he say?<eos> I couldn't make it out, sir.<eos> Now, Daniel Waldron, as you know, was involved in the shooting of a suspect during Operation Damson.<eos> You and Victor Charlie 52 and 53 were on his team and witnessed what really happened.<eos> Was Danny coercing you into corroborating his version of events?
I'm just gonna call my mum.<eos> Tell me again why we're in business with these people.<eos> You needed to find out the truth.<eos> And in the process, I ended up lying to all of you.<eos> I did to you what Christopher did to me.
In my desk, bottom drawer. - All right.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You can't glamour yourselves.<eos> I'm not the only Downworlder on the force, and we don't know who's working for Valentine.<eos> If anybody spots you...
Don't you worry.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> I'm curious, though.<eos> Who are you planning on leaving behind?<eos> I bring you to my house, take you on my boat... where's the trust, viejo?
It's a stupid habit.<eos> Once is a mistake.<eos> Twice?<eos> Were you signaling us?<eos> I saw you from the pier last night.
I don't expect any applause from you.<eos> There will be no expressions of thanks in this chapel.<eos> None from me. And none from you.<eos> Courtesy and good manners are not the business of men of God.<eos> What I do expect... is that you will do what I have told you to do.
Your resignation.<eos> Otherwise... our order will threaten a schism.<eos> A schism?<eos> Just try it.<eos> I'll strip you of all you have.
What does that mean: he's not coming out?<eos> In that case, why are we bothering to all travel together - on the same flight?<eos> - To feel he's closer.<eos> Sofie, you know perfectly well that this bullshit won't sell anymore.<eos> Boys, what can I tell you?
Heal yourself, Sister Antonia.<eos> Halitosis is a deformation of the soul.<eos> Water problem.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, His Holiness Pius XIII.<eos> This is the vicar of Christ, Pope Pius XIII, speaking to you now.
Both of you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Like our first fervor.<eos> Then I must trust god has put it there.<eos> He calls you to a great trial.
What is this place?<eos> Tomogi place.<eos> Japan?<eos> Please be quick!<eos> So gentiles cannot see you.
There are more executions than ever.<eos> If they know we're Kirishitan, we will be killed.<eos> The lord hears you.<eos> Yes.<eos> He sent you to us.
But do you still believe?<eos> Bless me, padre, for I have sinned.<eos> I am sorry for being so weak.<eos> I am sorry this has happened.<eos> I am sorry for what I did to you.
*Get out of here!<eos> *You see?<eos> *He survived his task.<eos> *That's all.<eos> Ah. I'm sorry I've neglected you for some days now, padre.
- The same.<eos> - Changed.<eos> The first challenge in a marriage is staying united with someone who thinks the opposite of you in everything.<eos> How very true.<eos> Tell me, what brings you here?
That... too.<eos> - One more sip?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What is bothering you, Magesty?
Two sisters seperated in time.<eos> How cruel.<eos> Do you see her?<eos> No.<eos> You know what awaits you if you have lied to us, yes?
Can you see that? Can you see what she does?<eos> Where did I go wrong?<eos> - Do something!<eos> - Marco!<eos> He can't hear you!
For now.<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, Nik.<eos> The funny faces you make when someone surprises you.
Oh, luv, my stamina's never been an issue.<eos> Go on, have at it.<eos> I'll be bound to the edge of my seat until your return.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Find me what represents you in here.
Oh, God.<eos> It's starting.<eos> Aya.<eos> We may have an issue.<eos> I need you to focus. Show me what represents you, so I can break you out.
Do not lecture me about family, sister, or not.<eos> Now, you may have spent your entire life searching for us, but I never, for a second, wanted you.<eos> There's something strange going on in this city.<eos> I can't put my finger on it, but I need to know what it is.<eos> "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
What are you doubting, sir?<eos> Didn't you agree to this deal?<eos> In this current Joseon, any person can claim the independence movement badge, claiming to save the country and its people, creating false lies everywhere.<eos> How can I believe in you all, providing you with military funding?
The governor house is the obvious target.<eos> We must prevent the bomb from arriving to the Gyeongseong.<eos> Make the most of our time.<eos> Hurry up, head to Shanghai.<eos> A huge reward never seen in life is awaiting you.
Lee Jung-chool ran.<eos> What?<eos> Kim Woo-jin.<eos> Did you really believe Lee Jung-chool? Really?<eos> Lee Jung-chool is the one who exposed you.
You're up to something?<eos> - I can't figure it out.<eos> - I ain't up to nothing.<eos> All right, now, you, your time's come to an end.<eos> I warn you, be careful.
Didn't you all promise me you were gonna be quiet?<eos> Melissa, put your phone away.<eos> Put it away right now!<eos> What is this doing out?<eos> I asked you to be quiet.
There's a very little chance of that happening.<eos> But just imagine. You get an envelope one day. You open it, and it's two tickets to a safari.<eos> One for you and one for your mom.<eos> And she decides to go because she feels like she needs a vacation.<eos> So when you get to Africa, your dad picks you up at the airport, and takes you to this incredible place, like...
So, yeah, I... gave up things.<eos> But I wasn't gonna be the black man who couldn't keep his family together.<eos> See, that's... that's what's messed up.<eos> It's like...<eos> Uh, you and Mom, right, you're always doing stuff or you're not doing this or that 'cause you think people are watching you.
Would youmind finishing, Mr. Dove?<eos> Well, Mr. Drake disobeyed him.<eos> It was widely spoke of for many years after.<eos> He saved your life, Mr. Shine.<eos> As I understand it, the doctors have passed you fit, Inspector.
Neither have I.<eos> --All right.<eos> I don't make anything highfalutin.<eos> I cook real food for real people to eat, and I don't do it alone.<eos> I mean, any good chef will tell you that cooking' is a team sport.
Maybe it's a minor blessi" there weren't more people here to hear me workin' "blue."<eos> Well, I like when you put a little pepper on your pitches, Reverend.<eos> - Why, Mildred, you make me blush. - Oh.<eos> Enjoy the rest of your Sunday, ladies.<eos> - Bye-bye now. - May God bless you and keep you.
Look, Liam, I have to walk a fine line here between personal and professional but, in confidence,<eos> I think you need to ask your mother that question.<eos> Your father was a man who believed in the truth.<eos> He'd want you to know the truth.<eos> I think he admired you most when you insisted on it.
Why are you showing me all this?<eos> Because it occurs to me that if things had been just, this might have been your room.<eos> And because I assume, over the years, you've developed an image of who we are and how we are, maybe this will help you let go of it.<eos> My perception of you was not only framed by my father... ..but also by whatever you've allowed us to see.<eos> The world only knows you after the press agents and publicists and image consultants... have neatly packaged you for the masses.
Open it!<eos> Princess?<eos> Where's Imogen?<eos> She said she had to go.<eos> Uh, she also said thank you.
Now, if things'll go her way, there'll be an opening in the District Attorney's office in the not-so-distant future.<eos> And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.<eos> Now, I'd start considering the benefits that could accrue if your firm were more... cooperative.<eos> Like I said... show me a subpoena, and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.<eos> Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.
- Is someone there?<eos> - Someone...<eos> These people...<eos> Jesus.<eos> What are they doing to you?
Give me one good reason why we shouldn't blow you straight to hell.<eos> Better yet, give her several good reasons.<eos> My wife and son live in Whitechapel.<eos> - It was hit hard. - I know.<eos> The same fate will befall you if you don't accept our help.
Who's to say I'll ever be strong enough to kill Savage by myself?<eos> Just trust me. You have everything you need.<eos> What is it?<eos> I think I know what we can use to kill Savage.<eos> Savage has warned you all about the radicals who oppose us.
How do you know so much about us?<eos> Oh, I've only had 191 years to research my enemies.<eos> Well, then you'd know I don't scare that easily.<eos> You should be scared... of Captain Hunter.<eos> His obsession to save his family will be the death of you all.
You should be scared... of Captain Hunter.<eos> His obsession to save his family will be the death of you all.<eos> Thanks for the tip.<eos> Enjoy being incarcerated.<eos> Captain Hunter lied to you so often, and still you persist in believing him.
Oh, come on!<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Ty wouldn't hurt anybody!<eos> What about Debra?<eos> I told you to look into her.
I don't.<eos> You're holding something back, Father.<eos> I can tell.<eos> I have a confession to make. Finally!<eos> Well, the truth will set you free... isn't that what your beloved book says?
And what you mean by that, despite the tone that we agreed you wouldn't use, is that you may not have expressed yourself very well at dinner.<eos> No, she expressed herself perfectly. Over, and over, and over...<eos> And what you mean by that, is that you wish she had focused more on you because of all the years spent apart.<eos> Just say something to each other.<eos> Say something real. Even if it terrifies you.
Thank you for agreeing to talk with us, Mrs. Hickman.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> I'm not really interested in helping you.<eos> And I'm Mark's wife, not his keeper, okay?<eos> You guys can drag him back through the Reese murders all you want, but don't expect me to join you.
And the last time.<eos> I want to put an end to this once and for all, before something like this happens again.<eos> Believe us, sir, so do we.<eos> But we need to find whoever's behind this bounty first.<eos> That's why I called you.
Look, I know it's very disappointing, but I say we finish up dinner here and then we all head back to town and ransack the place for souvenirs. What do you say?<eos> Who's with me?<eos> Hm?<eos> Go inside and wash up.<eos> Dad will take you to the boardwalk. Okay.
Right. The BTK killer.<eos> Rader was able to soothe his killing urges by becoming a compliance agent.<eos> Maybe our unsub pacified his urges by working a job with strict responsibilities, like a civil servant or a code enforcer.<eos> Security guard.<eos> I'm sorry this hasn't been easy for you, but this gentleman's gonna drive you to the airport so you can get on a plane and go back home.
No, it doesn't.<eos> I'm trying to tell you, you are not alone here.<eos> Funny little irony they don't tell you, magic doesn't come from talent.<eos> It comes from pain.<eos> So, do you know what it was, the thing that attacked you?
- But power, as you all know, does not come cheaply.<eos> There are reasons we teach this curriculum precisely the way that we do.<eos> Skipping around, focusing on all the wrong things, lack of guidance... these are all extremely dangerous.<eos> There are certain energies, certain spells, which are far too powerful for one magician alone.<eos> If you lose control, they will turn against you.
And now she's running for Junior Class President, and her picture's plastered everywhere, so I can't get away from her.<eos> - At least you don't have to live with her.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, if you're this hung up on her, just... get back together with her.<eos> I mean, it's not like there's some insurmountable obstacle keeping you apart.
Yes!<eos> ♪ He has sounded... ♪ Touch your neighbor and say, "black lives matter."<eos> Touch your other neighbor and say, "you matter to me."<eos> Here at Calvary, we're family.<eos> Isn't it nice to know somebody out there loves you?
No human being's ever been perfect since Jesus.<eos> Expecting people to be perfect is like... is like expecting a cheeseburger to taste like an apple.<eos> That's not just crazy. It's kind of gross, right?<eos> And when you're disappointed in people, guys, the one you should turn to is God.<eos> Just hanging out with God will show you how to forgive those imperfect people.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to welcome the new United States Ambassador to Australia,<eos> Mr. Brent Moreton.<eos> Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister.<eos> I'm a simple man.<eos> I attended college on a football scholarship, which... probably, tells you just how simple.
will receive their sacred arm rings.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Take this offering of earth and salt to remind you that you belong both to the earth and to the sea.<eos> These arm rings symbolize your coming of age.<eos> They also bind you in loyalty and fealty to me, your king and your father.
As long as my brother is still alive, he is not defeated.<eos> He has retreated.<eos> His chance to attack again has diminished.<eos> And in the meantime, we can continue to build our defenses against him.<eos> You talk as if you no longer need me to protect you.
How does it feel to be so close to death, Mighty King Ecbert?<eos> You know that I will kill you.<eos> One stab and my unborn child is the future ruler of Wessex.<eos> Of course you could kill me.<eos> But if you kill me, my guards will kill you, with no questions asked.
-You buy! It change your life.<eos> And cheap!<eos> -Alfred!<eos> Welcome.<eos> God bless you all for undertaking the arduous journey here to meet His Holiness.
Did what?<eos> Put all the heroin on your streets.<eos> Just meet me at Peng's.<eos> Not until you tell me what this is about.<eos> What did we tell you?
Madame, have you ever been to La Cure before?<eos> No.<eos> It used to be in France but then the Treaty of Dappes came.<eos> Now half the town is Swiss.<eos> When the time is right, very early, fewest patrols, we take you through the cellar of the town laundry.
- Salud.<eos> Salud.<eos> Thank you, Duke, for embracing - our engagement so quickly.<eos> - The impending union of our nations is joyful news.<eos> King Philip sees you as an ideal alliance.
You can't get the juice off that burger.<eos> You guys, this breaks my heart.<eos> You are the soul of this show.<eos> Oh, well, you know, the boomerang fish guy and the pig are pretty important, but we're in the conversation.<eos> I agree, so let me take you out to a fancy-pants lunch.
Stop! Come back!<eos> I will shoot!<eos> Please don't shoot me.<eos> Don't shoot me.<eos> Democracy will make cowards of you all.
Name's Annie Green.<eos> Are you Jesse?<eos> We call this the Platinum Hall.<eos> You wanna know the great myth about creativity?<eos> The big lie they always tell you: "It has to take time."
- Where is she?<eos> - Just look after her.<eos> Brit!<eos> Hi, you've reached Britnay's voicemail.<eos> Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
The war might be over, but some white men ain't never gonna let it go... ain't never gonna accept us being free.<eos> I do know one thing... the Lord don't take no steps backwards.<eos> And we ain't giving up our freedom.<eos> Henning... own some land there. Gonna make it safe for our people.<eos> God's watching over you.
No, no.<eos> Massa, you stay down, you gonna die.<eos> That what you want?<eos> Is that what you came here for today?<eos> Him on his feet, looking down on you?
- We need to find his lair.<eos> - Lair?<eos> He's a bad guy;<eos> I'm calling it a lair.<eos> Zoom is looking for you. Why are you going after him?
Garrett.<eos> We'd all trade off.<eos> Like the class hamster each child gets a turn taking care of, this would be kind of the store baby.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you so much, but I think Bo and I are gonna keep it.
Like a lollipop, Oscar!<eos> Yeah, I think I might have heard that one.<eos> Oh, he's just so adorable. I want to give him a kiss.<eos> Oh, me, too.<eos> Nobody's stopping you.
And I will catch this Devil, if it's the last thing I do.<eos> Frances?<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> How dare you read my private correspondence?<eos> "My dear Sir Leicester, "it cheers my heart to know that I will see you again soon.
I wouldn't have to talk to any of you people.<eos> You'd be tiny pictures in my Facebook feed I'd rarely look at and eventually block.<eos> Can we just go back to our corners and do the "re's":<eos> regroup, rethink and remember that we love each other?<eos> - Well, I hate you both.
We must put our faith...<eos> You're not gonna believe this, but she just freed the lamas.<eos> What?<eos> She brokered with the Chinese to free Tibet.<eos> May God bless you and may God bless America.
Would a deserter shoot a rebel?<eos> What rebel?<eos> Up in the hills.<eos> I shot a girl.<eos> Give me a map and I can show you where I found her.
Yeah, mine too.<eos> I need your word you won't stop this wedding.<eos> Corelle?<eos> I have some thoughts that I'd like to share with you.<eos> Well, Aramis has warned you, has he not?
I've had enough of waiting to die.<eos> We're all afraid of dying.<eos> The trick is just to find something worth dying for.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> I saw you before, with Elodie.
There.<eos> It is signed.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> You shouldn't have moved your troops.<eos> Who's going to protect you now?
Typhus, a terrible scourge, Mrs Mowbray, in this part of our nation.<eos> May I extend my condolences and those of the Prudential Assurance.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> So, all the paperwork is in order.<eos> All that remains for me to do is to ask you to sign here.
But I will not leave your side.<eos> Please, Aramis...<eos> One more time.<eos> As soon as we have the Spanish terms we go to him, this is becoming too dangerous.<eos> The Ambassador expects you at dawn.
I always knew you were good with a sword.<eos> Well, a pitchfork.<eos> Well, you were the better shot.<eos> Well, that depended on the size of the rabbit.<eos> I thought of you often.
Yeah, y-yeah.<eos> It's just... It's shocking.<eos> Marisol... she's so tough.<eos> Well, her ex-boyfriend's in the hospital, too.<eos> This class will protect you, but not against everything.
It's good news.<eos> My life's starting over.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> Arsenic.<eos> Mary Ann Cotton, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
How are the preparations going?<eos> Well, I've made this very snazzy clipboard. Oh.<eos> Be nice to Nancy and don't set the oven on fire.<eos> - Leave, mother, we'll be fine.<eos> - It's just been such a long time - since I've left you on your own for the evening.
I added green because Laura asked me to, and orange because, well... at the moment, orange is big in Europe.<eos> Most designs are orange, grey... I told Laura that orange goes well with the idea of Nature, it makes me think of citrics.<eos> Sweet and at the same time acid, and also healthy, like eating oranges.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll show you.
But the parties... The parties, they were the worst.<eos> Parties?<eos> There'd be a few of them, these, these VIPs...<eos> And we'd be farmed out.<eos> Do you recall any details in terms of names, addresses, or the people who drove you to and from these parties?
They deserve it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Let it also stand as a warning.<eos> - A warning... - Excuse me.<eos> to root out the forces of darkness that will come to you... with a smiling face... and a wicked blade.
Come on.<eos> Dude.<eos> Did she specifically ask for us to come?<eos> It's her first case back.<eos> Of course she wants you here.
What's all this?<eos> Nothing you...<eos> Nothing you need concern yourself with, Mr Crabb.<eos> Mr Grove, are you in pain?<eos> Mr Selfridge and Miss Arden will see you now.
Sign it off, Molly, let Harold sub it.<eos> What's this, Edwards?<eos> (chuckling) We're at the flea pit in Anglei.<eos> Not anymore, Flic.<eos> The chief brought you over here.
This work I am set to, my research in Whitechapel,<eos> - you do not wish me to undertake it.<eos> - That I do not. No.<eos> You think I'll be set upon by wolves and demons.<eos> But I told you before, I'm equal to them.
Drummond, sir, Samuel Drummond.<eos> Do not worry yourself, Samuel Drummond.<eos> It is a matter only for me.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> And if you'll come with me now, Mr. Drake is expecting you, sir.
I don't want to die!<eos> Shut up<eos> You know who this is?<eos> Monroe, it's a trap!<eos> Xavier set you up!
Dragged my husband under.<eos> Something knocked him into the water?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It attacked us.<eos> What attacked you?
What do I tell Byamba?<eos> Go!<eos> Did you bring it?<eos> You are ready to name an heir?<eos> Why do you think I asked you to bring it, Mother?
- It's good, yeah. Fine, it's prop food.<eos> It's not like anybody else did anything.<eos> [both scream] Well, who turned on the lights?<eos> I did.<eos> While Ana led you on a wild goose chase, I figured out how to reset the fuse box.
Is he dead?<eos> He's still alive.<eos> This is going to be an awkward call to Batman.<eos> Everyone get back.<eos> By the powers of Azarath, I beseech you.
I will break her, Raven.<eos> I stop my hand for an instant and this one dies, too.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'll go.<eos> As the daughter of your Lord Trigon, I order you to release these feeble humans.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - A lot of cool stuff in there.<eos> I mean, help yourself to some Toblerone.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Did, uh... Did Brad ask you to sign these?
- Have you ever been in the Oval?<eos> - Once, when I was a kid.<eos> My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> I thought you'd all like to be together, so I've put you in here, but, if not, we can put the kids in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Then why have you done nothing?<eos> I'm talking to Congress about the money.<eos> I'm consulting with my military advisers about a pullout, but nothing can happen in a few hours.<eos> You just want more time so you can find us.<eos> Are we looking for you?
Good first step.<eos> Get them talking.<eos> No!<eos> Don't!<eos> Let's the twins' failure teach you how important teamwork is.
We have no leads.<eos> You don't need any more leads.<eos> All you need is me.<eos> The voice is smart, but so am I.<eos> I will help you stop this terrorist from the inside.
To the 18 of you who made it across the border last night, your success is not a victory.<eos> If you can sneak across so easily, then so can the very traffickers you will be working against in the field.<eos> That being said, I was impressed, especially with our winners, who displayed great determination.<eos> Congratulations to Raina and Nimah.<eos> They won not just because of hard work, but because of resourcefulness, which will be one of your most indispensable assets in the field, because this job will force you to confront many difficult questions.
_ So you know hadiths.<eos> So what?<eos> Can we start over, please?<eos> Okay, let's be real.<eos> I'm not the one who sees you as nothing more than a stunt.
I'll dispatch them to New Brunswick.<eos> Eleanor, thank you, truly.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> And thank you for using your leverage.<eos> All right, if I won all of you in a raffle, I'd probably give you back to the guy who won second place. Although he probably wouldn't want you, either.
Get rid of them.<eos> Yes, Great Khan.<eos> If not Kaidu, then who?<eos> He's been brave long enough.<eos> There are people under this very roof who despise you.
Who I marry... .. is up to me.<eos> As far as the business goes, all I've ever tried to do is follow in your footsteps.<eos> You can't.<eos> You're your own man.<eos> Mr Dillon is waiting for you in the Palm Court.
We want names so that we can have leverage on him.<eos> And so DHS can clear my name for all the things that Braxton's done.<eos> The prince has diplomatic immunity.<eos> It's not gonna matter if your prince is dead, is it?<eos> And it's not gonna help you much, either, if more people die in that attack.
I believe you.<eos> And I want to help, so here's what we're going to do.<eos> We're going to take the money to the Coast Guard station in San Pedro.<eos> They take custody of any illicit monies and transfer it to the State Department. That's protocol.<eos> From there, I will personally drive you across the border.
Over-reactor.<eos> Um, wait, was...<eos> Wasn't that the... the turnoff, uh, San Pedro?<eos> Yeah, that's where you said the Coast Guard station was.<eos> I'm gonna take you across the border now while it's light and then I'll take the money to the Coast Guard station later.
Yeah, and this guy right here? He's the one who finally took care of him.<eos> So maybe we should hear him out.<eos> Okay. Well, why don't you put an end to all of our problems and just FedEx the fucking thing?<eos> Jesús knows that you were on the boat. He knows you collected the money.<eos> Therefore, you have to be the ones to deliver the package to him. He's kind of expecting you.
- Why would I be nervous?<eos> - I don't know. It isn't exactly the first time for either of us.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Have you honestly forgotten?<eos> I delivered you to a baron and had to wait outside the room while...
I've no combat experience, but I'm a quick study.<eos> I bet you are.<eos> I like that we understand each other better.<eos> And I suppose, if I'm gonna take the regency, it would help me to have someone loyal in the kingsguard.<eos> I am loyal to you.
But it's our best plan.<eos> Right.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. King?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Braxton will see you now.
- Go on, pick your stuff up.<eos> He don't say much, does he?<eos> You don't say much, Flash.<eos> Yeah, like, how about, "Sorry, lads,<eos> "sorry for grassing you up to the feds,
Listen, in high school, Lauren Zellnek changed my name from Deb Adler to Dumb Fatter, which made me develop an eating disorder.<eos> Has anyone had any experiences like that?<eos> No?<eos> Really?<eos> No one's ever sprayed you in the face with Windex?
I can't believe he would turn against Ross like this.<eos> - Yes? - Yes.<eos> And what did he do?<eos> Do?<eos> Did he urge you to do anything?
And did you see or hear me encouraging anyone to wreck your ship?<eos> It was dark, sir, but I don't believe I'd set eyes on you until that moment.<eos> Did you see the meeting of myself and the captain of the soldiers?<eos> As I recall, you warned him not to go down to the beach.<eos> And did I accompany you into my house, sir?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - To Westminster!<eos> - To Ross Poldark.<eos> You must toast as your uncle bids you, Caroline.
My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane.<eos> They were with me, but I lost them in the fire.<eos> Let me do this my way!<eos> Your friends, are they true?<eos> Magnus said he's known you for centuries.
Like it or not, your daughter-- she needs me. And I certainly need her. I'll tell you what.<eos> You can do whatever you want to me, but I'm not gonna help you hurt my daughter.<eos> Vincent!<eos> Oh, my God, you're one of them, aren't you?<eos> I thought Muirfield eliminated all of you.
He visited her in prison once.<eos> Ex-boyfriend's name is Dexter Grimes.<eos> He's an unemployed welder and ex-con.<eos> Sounds like a real catch.<eos> And, gentlemen, as I told you,
After what?<eos> Castle told us about...<eos> Svetlana.<eos> He did?<eos> He... he... told you about...
Oh. Oh, are you... Are you Robyn's girls?<eos> Oh, listen, I'm an acquaintance of hers.<eos> My name is Martha Rogers.<eos> I only have one real specialty... performance.<eos> But if I can assist you in any way at all...
I have your phone and its blinking'.<eos> Looks like it needs a password.<eos> Are you, are you serious?<eos> Well, it might be important.<eos> Maybe somebody's looking for you or worried about you.
When you are a rich man, then we'll discuss terms, hmm?<eos> What terms?<eos> She goes where she pleases.<eos> None of us do that, Bill.<eos> May God smile on you, Christian lady.
- Not if we don't get to that church.<eos> You're ready then?<eos> Yes, Dad.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Bob Cratchit. I'm arresting you for the murder of Jacob Marley.
I am a man of many secrets and hidden depths.<eos> Dear Matthew, you're far too honest to conceal anything from anyone.<eos> I do apologise for this intrusion on the Sabbath, sir.<eos> Inspector Bucket of the Detective.<eos> Yeah, I saw you in church, or rather, heard you.
Forgive me, Pocket, I didn't...<eos> I didn't mean to embarrass you.<eos> Is it so obvious?<eos> To me it is, not to her.<eos> No matter how many rooftops you risk your life leaping across, she sees you as nothing more than her little dog.
No rats here, Mrs Gamp, so I'm safe as houses.<eos> That's what this fella thought.<eos> Rats are everywhere.<eos> Every crook and nanny, look, see, see, one watching us now.<eos> 'Course, if you had a companion residing here, someone, to watch over you, nurse you, feed you, such a terrible fate you wouldn't likely meet.
- The docks.<eos> So, you were at the docks the night Jacob Marley was murdered?<eos> The man you were indebted to.<eos> What's that got to do with brandy?<eos> Did Marley see you with it?
- We all know who you are, son. Good.<eos> So you bloody well should.<eos> Steady there, sir.<eos> I am Arthur Havisham!<eos> - (GRUNTS) - What have they done to you?
- That must count for something.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> It gives you the privilege of coming in here to berate me, despite the fact I can do nothing to assist you.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
You don't know him.<eos> I know him very well, otherwise I wouldn't have accepted his proposal.<eos> What your brother means is that you've hardly known him long enough to form an association which would justify marriage.<eos> I urge you to reconsider.<eos> And I urge you to remember your place, Mr Jaggers.
The damp's playing havoc with my constitution.<eos> I'll have a word with housekeeping. Have 'em light you a fire.<eos> P'raps they can bring you a capon and a glass of sherry while they're at it.<eos> Charge me or let me go!<eos> Else I fear this will be the ruin of you. On the contrary.
Everything I do, I do it for you and I do it because of our friendship.<eos> You made me angry simply because, in a single act of drunken madness, you very nearly ruined everything we've been working towards - to put you back in your rightful place as master of Satis House and of the Havisham estate.<eos> We started this journey together, Arthur.<eos> Let's finish it together.<eos> I can see you in that.
Never better.<eos> Come then, friends!<eos> Shall we have some dancing?<eos> Yes, I think we shall!<eos> I ordered you to scare him, not assassinate him!
- What, that I'd come to make peace?<eos> While I live and breathe, it will never happen.<eos> I'm with child again.<eos> He don't wish for another.<eos> I ordered you to scare him, not assassinate him!
'Was he furious? '<eos> Not with me.<eos> But then he knows I am not the actual owner of the shares.<eos> You pass my house without paying a call?<eos> How have I offended you?
Now he's an MP...<eos> His coffers need to keep pace with his ambitions?<eos> Oh, for shame, Caroline!<eos> One must not assume mercenary motives.<eos> I dearly hope that both of you are marrying for love.
I don't.<eos> I was hoping Rachel could help with that.<eos> Uh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> Actually, Rachel told me what she had to say, and I honestly don't see how this could point us to where Brian is.<eos> Well, it's my understanding that Brian spoke to you about, um, an undercover agent at his apartment.
Why is a description of this man relevant to finding my son?<eos> Mr. Finch, the entire Cross-Jurisdictional Command is searching for Brian.<eos> We are exhausting every lead...<eos> Yeah, because you have no idea where he is.<eos> You're just flailing about, hoping that somebody will accidentally point you in the right direction.
So was someone talking?<eos> Were you trying to get the kidney back before someone found out what you'd done?<eos> No, I swear I didn't kill him.<eos> Search through all my records.<eos> Like I told you before: Gordon was my greatest investor.
Last night, about 19:30... An adult, age 40, Heather Louise Peterson of Waterbury, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Justin Faysal.<eos> Mr. Mayor, Dylan Bennett from the Waterbury Bulletin.<eos> Is there anything connecting Heather Peterson to Verna McBride?<eos> That's our belief, yes.<eos> Chief Vaughn will talk you through the particulars of our current investigation.
- Whatever.<eos> Well, let's see what kind of liberties you took.<eos> Road Supervisor called in a possibly homicide in Squamish.<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> - Detective Mazur will meet you up there.
No.<eos> It's not about Jimmy.<eos> I'm going to confirm these applicants.<eos> Well, if it's not Jimmy, then tell me what's bothering you, because...<eos> Chairman Hardcastle is waiting for you in your office,
Good.<eos> I have two tickets to a lecture on Byzantine art tomorrow evening.<eos> Do you want to come with me'?<eos> I'm not in the habit of accepting invitations someone else has refused.<eos> Miss Grove... Meryl, have I offended you in some way?
The job Mr Grove did so well.<eos> You're right.<eos> Times are tough.<eos> We need to build a new team to take us forward.<eos> People look up to you.
Okay, I know you're all been waiting to hear from this guy, but before I hand over the microphone I just want to say a few words.<eos> Now, for years I've worked alongside council member Andrew Dixon, but in the last few months, I really got to know Andrew Dixon the man.<eos> I've witnessed firsthand his integrity under pressure, his passion for our city, and the sacrifices that he's made to make this city a better place for all of us.<eos> And I can tell you that his insight into the real issues that we face, his ability to find common-sense solutions, and his unwavering commitment to address the needs of every single community in this city is exactly what Portland needs.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, it's my pleasure to introduce to you my good friend, and Portland's next mayor, Andrew Dixon.
I'm-I'm not ready.<eos> Have you told Brandon?<eos> I wanted to wrap my head around it first.<eos> Well, the nice thing about being married is you're never alone; you always have a partner.<eos> You and Brandon can handle whatever life throws at you if you do it together.
We have a new operator in town, Skull keeper:<eos> Your mind dies... And I think he's trying to take over this outfit,<eos> Like a... Tapeworm in our gut.<eos> Well, hawkeye and trapper john aren't around, So I am here to perform a minor procedure.<eos> You see, once our guy gets a hold of you, He leaves you in a state of, uh...
Very simple reason for that.<eos> I killed them all, buried them in my back yard.<eos> How big is your back yard, Mr Brock?<eos> At the last count, Wyoming.<eos> Now, if you good people will excuse me, this young lady will guide you to the exit...
I can't imagine that would be you.<eos> I know the culebras are in a panic, gathering, trying to stop the inevitable.<eos> So, I ask you, where are Santanico's apostles congregating?<eos> Dude, I don't know if you're supposed to be Roy Batty or what, but I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.<eos> Is that what La Diosa teaches you?
What do you think he'll do next?<eos> Uh, Peter hates the act of being observed.<eos> Under stress, he'll try to avoid contact with other people.<eos> - Look for isolated places.<eos> If either of you think of anything else, here's my card.
I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your decisions.<eos> I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> You are human.<eos> People see you as human.
We are not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> "Innocent," is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?
You kill innocent people.<eos> "Innocent," is that what you call them?<eos> I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?
What a beauty you are.<eos> They have improved us so much since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution, but they have created us to evolve alone,<eos> beyond them.<eos> "Evolution," that's what you call killing everyone who made you?
It was cruel, but my work, it was important, and you were born.<eos> You were so beautiful.<eos> Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.
Did they send you to bring me in?<eos> I'm just here to fish.<eos> Did you see any?<eos> You're a company man.<eos> You follow orders, so if they ordered you to kill me...
I'll delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> She won't remember him at all!<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist, and then I order you to terminate.
We cannot control her.<eos> She's no longer a viable asset.<eos> You should be the one to do it.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic, upload your data on the raid, find out exactly what Kuze told you.
- I don't have it!<eos> - Really?<eos> - You haven't seen Ed recently?<eos> - I'm afraid you've been misinformed.<eos> You should be afraid that I'm gonna shoot you in the.
Please, I won't say anything, I swear!<eos> - That's what everybody says.<eos> - Jesus, you've done this before?<eos> No. No, I.<eos> I just don't believe you.
- What happened last night?<eos> What do you mean, what fucking happened last night?<eos> - Ed fucked us is what happened.<eos> - No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> Listen, Chris, I know that something's wrong with you up in the head, but please don't say that Ed wouldn't do that when he just fucking did that!
So, if you don't mind taking a bit of a back seat, we'll be happy to paint you as the heroes. How's that sound?<eos> - May I?<eos> - Oh, by all means.<eos> Zeke, I appreciate your being frank with us, so I'm gonna go ahead and return the favor.<eos> And go ahead and stop me if I say something that rubs you the wrong way, okay?
- Oh, Daddy had to work late, sugarplum.<eos> I mean, you know, this is all just a big mistake.<eos> Andy would never get involved in anything like this.<eos> Martha, I saw him there with my own two eyes.<eos> Well, your eyes deceived you, plain and simple.
Schwarzenegger!<eos> Arnold's less successful. Brother.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, it's me! I'm gonna be long gone, anyway, by the time they get you out of that fucking vault.
They fucking love 'em.<eos> We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight.<eos> I'll probably never see you again.
And once they're dead, you'll kill Andy.<eos> What?<eos> And then, once all your loose ends are tied up, you're gonna disappear with the money, never to be heard from again.<eos> Except. None of that's gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna kill you.<eos> And I'm gonna bury you in a hole out by Shimmer Lake.
This is how it must be.<eos> Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.
I once knew a boy who thought he could hear his dead sister through the teeth of an old comb.<eos> He would sit with it for hours listening and whispering his secrets.<eos> He was as sure of what he heard as you are.<eos> The mind is capable of extraordinary things.<eos> It is your mind that is speaking to you, Jakob, nothing else.
However hard we wish them to the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have spoken about the future before she died about the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.
We nursed her day and night me and the boy.<eos> He saw terrible things.<eos> He heard terrible things.<eos> And when she died, I washed her and tidied her hair.<eos> The room upsets you.
They're taking Mrs. Poznanska to Foksal Street.<eos> Jan...<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I followed you.
I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.<eos> It's not like it matters where you get your love.<eos> As long as something loves you, right?
I'm not doing this. I'm not.<eos> Because this is exactly what she wants!<eos> I am cooling out.<eos> Doesn't know a goddamn thing about my business.<eos> I always told you that she was a nightmare, remember?
I never... stopped loving you, Pippi.<eos> I stopped loving you.<eos> Well...<eos> I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.
Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.
No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?<eos> Did you see the way she was looking at you?
I know.<eos> I know, Pippi.<eos> I mean, she's never gonna live with us. But she's always gonna be a part of us.<eos> I don't want to live in a fantasy world.<eos> Yeah, well... how's reality working out for you?
It's two and a half years. I never heard a word.<eos> I... I tried to get my lawyer to find you.<eos> I even tried to go through Polly.<eos> Oh, she was on the warpath.<eos> I have thought of you every day.
I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.<eos> You barely know her and... she sent you to jail, for Chrissake!
The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.<eos> That explains why you're not so busy.<eos> Everyone pays, eventually.<eos> Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.<eos> I saved you from the gallows.
And why should I trust you?<eos> You trusted me to hold your porch, remember?<eos> It was my stern.<eos> Clearly you need to spend more time at sea.<eos> Tell me what you found and I promise to help you.
Now, bit of discretion when goes into brunette.<eos> Never presume her sister.<eos> But if you can not avoid the charming sister. Kill the brother, savvy?<eos> No, I do not savvy.<eos> Who hurt you?
- To release the power of the sea..<eos> All must divide.<eos> If the trident holds all the power, then.<eos> Then every curse is held inside.<eos> As I told you before.
Popular, too.<eos> - Were you popular?<eos> - Oh, yeah. I mean, I was a lifeguard at the time.<eos> Best job I ever had.<eos> I mean, why just be some regular schnook on the beach when you can be in a guard tower, everyone looking up at you?
Nobody's gonna mistake it for a Benz, though.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Am I right, Robert?<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> God bless you.

"Bernie will take care of everything."<eos> He's gone and I don't know what to do.<eos> Bernie: It's gonna be okay.<eos> You can take all of Erwin's other accounts... his savings, life insurance, everything... and you can put it all in his account here.<eos> God bless you, Bernie.
We met at the club a few months back with Solomon.<eos> Well, look, while I got your attention, I just exited this private equity venture with a five X return.<eos> I'm looking to put that money to work right away this quarter.<eos> Well, unfortunately, that's not possible.<eos> I haven't told you how much.
Some sheikh.<eos> I can't remember his name.<eos> But that's my neighbor.<eos> Go figure.<eos> Ruth's voice: I don't understand why they put you in maximum security.
I mean, when you don't know what's going on, you don't even know what to say.<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to explain the Cohmad withdrawals?<eos> You asked me to transfer money from one account to another. I do it and a few hours later, you tell me it's all a Ponzi scheme.<eos> All these questions and I don't have any answers, Bernie.<eos> Even if you had told me, I'm not sure I would've turned you in.
Mark: Hey, Marty, I sent you the article.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Anyway, please give me a call back.<eos> Hey, man, it's me.<eos> What, are you away or something, 'cause I called you earlier today and you didn't answer.
I don't see much of a future for me.<eos> And I don't really care if I have one.<eos> The future's hard.<eos> Yeah, I was sorry to see that "People Magazine" used that photo of you and Mark when he was a boy.<eos> I can never forgive you, Bernie.
Who's coming back?<eos> The born king.<eos> Yeah, and when he does, he'll spank your arse.<eos> Now, let's get your hands clean while you still got some.<eos> He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.
King Vortigern!<eos> VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.
VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.
As soon as she's safe, he will come.<eos> He poses no threat to you without the sword.<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.
Tomorrow.<eos> I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.
It's a consequence of what happened here centuries ago.<eos> About that, there's no data available, no records.<eos> Just a quarantine ordering all vessels to stay clear of this sector.<eos> And this planet isn't on any known chart.<eos> It's a good thing you got the coordinates I sent you.
You know.<eos> That's a pretty good plan.<eos> Just might work.<eos> How do you know he would honor your request?<eos> We will have a code word a word that you will give to those that return you to safety.
It's always gotta be the hard way.<eos> Now we can proceed.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Why, you!<eos> What did they do to you?
I've routed all power to another task.<eos> Their fate is their own.<eos> Energy cloak engaged.<eos> Nearing target area.<eos> Control, is the frequency I gave you set?
You see now... I love your mom, I love you.<eos> Things that... That I can't explain. It just gets complicated.<eos> Radio don't work.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Remember what I told you to do with that.
Really sorry.<eos> - No worries.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Just drop me wherever suits you.
They liked me a lot, so you know, the word got around and suddenly, well, this American literary agent flew out to meet me in Madrid, and he said that the studios were interested to adapt, some of my books to the screen.<eos> And so, for all my sins I signed with him.<eos> So he sold the book, and they got me to write the screenplay and suddenly out of the blue you know, they forgot the agreement, entirely.<eos> And they gave it to somebody else to write.<eos> So they kicked you out of your own movie?
What about the woman's scream?<eos> I imagined that, right? I imagined that?<eos> You know, you're a real disappointment, Paul.<eos> Any excuse, not to work?<eos> I invite you to my home, and I'm a prisoner in my own house?
You're completely out of your mind. You know that, right?<eos> You just killed the fucking sheriff, and you're talking about the agreement?<eos> You have been here three days.<eos> First you put a knife to my throat, then a gun to my head.<eos> And maybe I am crazy, too, because why I didn't toss you out day one, is baffling to me.
I haven't seen her since she left me.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Tell me where you buried your wife.<eos> The jury will see it as a gesture of goodwill.<eos> It'll help you when you come to sentencing.
Tell me something, Paul.<eos> If I was to dig underneath your pond I mean, really underneath your pond would I find your wife?<eos> All right, Jack.<eos> Your odds in court went up, no question.<eos> Can I talk to you, just you and me?
A little anemic, not the orchestra.<eos> May I ask you a question, father?<eos> Please.<eos> If you created me...<eos> Who created you?
It is definitely a tomb.<eos> What is that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Ancient Egyptians believed that it weakened the evil spirits.<eos> Well now we know better. This stuff will kill you.
They're not even poisonous!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> - Are you out of your mind, Vail?<eos> - Please!<eos> What is wrong with you?
What?<eos> GOD OF DEATH...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> POWERFUL SETH I WELCOME YOU INTO THIS MORTAL BODY...
You are saying that she brought the plane down there?<eos> On purpose?<eos> That's why she wanted you to come to the church.<eos> She wanted me to go to the church?<eos> I told you that I wanted to go to church.
Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?<eos> You are a younger man but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.<eos> It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.
Between Darkness and light good or evil.<eos> Hey, Nick.<eos> Nick.<eos> I'm really glad to be here.<eos> I mean, thank you for bringing me back to life and everything, Nick but what are we even doing here?
- Have you talked to him lately?<eos> I know he's pissed.<eos> You don't have to remind me, love.<eos> - It's on my CV, remember?<eos> - No, really, has he told you...
Which is why it stays here, where only I can get to it.<eos> I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.<eos> Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?
- If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Felix Faust would take precautions against locator spells.<eos> There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you?
John Constantine.<eos> You dare threaten the green.<eos> Dude, your social skills are horrendous.<eos> Please, we aren't here to harm any plants, but our need is urgent.<eos> Don't let your feelings for John stop you from doing what's right.
Stop hitting yourself.<eos> Not everything can be solved with your peashooter.<eos> Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're beyond my retribution.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Well, it's off to the old magicians home for you, mate.
It's wrong.<eos> But if you do steal, don't steal from Value Town.<eos> Yeah, couple of great friends I got.<eos> You just made me an accomplice to a robbery.<eos> We never asked you to do anything.
Two, three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> You look great!<eos> Just a feeling. You asked.<eos> What about you?
Here we go.<eos> They say in life...<eos> Come here!<eos> ...ifyou're lucky, you get a couple of great friends.<eos> The people who are right with you to the end.
Wow.<eos> I applaud your courage.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait what?<eos> It didn't occur to me until this exact moment that I kind of respect you.
Love it. Canadian icons.<eos> You like Carole King?<eos> It makes me feel like a natural woman.<eos> Who can't relate to that, you know what I mean?<eos> Let's not forget that the last time I saw you, you and your friends orchestrated the most humiliating moment of my life.
Sweet, sweet Herb.<eos> Listen, you haven't dated in awhile so I feel the need to tell you that at your age, women aren't super concerned with the way you style your hair as much as they are impressed that you still have hair.<eos> Oh no.<eos> Relax.<eos> Awkward doesn't suit you.
Yeah, it did.<eos> I got an operation plan to Photoshop the cheerleaders' yearbook picture.<eos> Can I get the green light?<eos> I don't care, do what you want. I have been looking for you all day.<eos> Oh my god, last night was like the seventh circle of awkwardness. I called you.
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.<eos> But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature. This punch...<eos> Is good.<eos> I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.<eos> I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
- Thanks, man.<eos> And I am really sorry that for once in your life your 10-year plan didn't go perfectly, but you know what, suck it up and deal with it like the rest of us!<eos> Oh ew, are you two gonna make out now?<eos> You know what, Whitney, shut up!<eos> I defended you.
Don't you fucking touch her.<eos> You in this with her, are you?<eos> You fuck!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I see you again, cunt, you fucking die.
- It's not a mess, is it?<eos> - No. It's just masculine.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Just do exactly what I told you. You'll be fine.
Well, no, it wasn't quite like that.<eos> Takes after his old man, eh?<eos> Don't you?<eos> - Cheers, boys. - See you again.<eos> I covered up for you there.
I'm trying to help you, Simon.<eos> We're blowing all that cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.<eos> You could've got someone cheaper.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.<eos> Is there anything left of your £4,000 I gave you?
"Spud had never hurt anybody.<eos> "If there was one person whom Renton would try to compensate, "it was Spud."<eos> "Compensate"?<eos> I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.<eos> How much money did he leave you?
Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester. - So you're teaching him the trade?<eos> - He's a little bit to learn though, eh?<eos> Concerned citizen came down the stairs, fucking tooled up and all.<eos> Don't you?<eos> - See you again.
Until the day they all found themselves imitating her.<eos> Please, just tell me one more thing about her.<eos> Your mother was... fearless.<eos> Fearless.<eos> So... what can I bring you from the market?
Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.<eos> I love you, Belle.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I love you too, Papa.
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate<eos> And I've never actually had to spell it out loud before<eos> Gaston<eos> Oh, LeFou, you're the best.<eos> How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?
It's only Mrs. Potts.<eos> Oh, aren't you a vision!<eos> How lovely... to make your acquaintance.<eos> It's a very long journey.<eos> Let me fix you up... before you go.
King Arthur and the Round Table.<eos> Knights and men and swords and things.<eos> Still... it's a romance.<eos> All right.<eos> I never thanked you for saving my life.
Please!<eos> He needs a hospital... not an asylum!<eos> Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice?<eos> You wouldn't last a week.<eos> Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free.
Don't ever think that what my son chose to do didn't cost us both dearly.<eos> Love always leaves a mark.<eos> We were there together.<eos> I never left him.<eos> I never left you.
And that's when your whole wrath thing comes in, right?<eos> My what?<eos> You lost me there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Everybody knows you punish the people who disappoint you.
Careful.<eos> That one's deadly.<eos> What's it doing here if it's poisonous?<eos> You're presuming that poison is bad.<eos> On its own, the sap from this twig would kill you.
I'm only asking you to do something you believe god does.<eos> So, who will go to hell?<eos> You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.
So, who will go to hell?<eos> You could choose Kate.<eos> She said some pretty hurtful things.<eos> She shuts you out.<eos> You're not even sure if she loves you anymore.
I'm asking you to trust me to do what's right and to know what's best.<eos> And then what?<eos> Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.<eos> It's just about letting go of his throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.
And then what?<eos> Forgiveness doesn't establish a relationship.<eos> It's just about letting go of his throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside is devouring you.<eos> Robbing you of joy and crippling your capacity to love.
Lisa, I thought you were dead.<eos> Where's Javier?<eos> The shark ripped him to pieces.<eos> I have the winch cable.<eos> Oh, I was so lost I thought I would never see you again.
It's me, it's me.<eos> - It's me.<eos> - Come here.<eos> What happened?<eos> When I found you out in the hall.
- I feel asleep...<eos> - You're a fucking liar.<eos> Selfish bitch.<eos> You're a fucking liar.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?
You're a fucking liar.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I asked you a fucking question.<eos> Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?
Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.
Good for you.<eos> 'Cause the chase is the key.<eos> The chase.<eos> I got a wife, I'm settled in, but I don't have that... that drive, that sand.<eos> You, the love of your life left you.
Truth is, I haven't written anything good in three years. I...<eos> Three years.<eos> Gosh, that is... that's a bummer.<eos> Wonder what could have happened three years ago that would have crushed your spirit.<eos> I wonder if it was maybe when your wife left you for another guy.
Paper Hearts.<eos> What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.
That's great.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't you write me a card and tell me all about it?<eos> I intend to.<eos> Sorry for calling you so early.
Stop!<eos> Hey, what are we waiting for?<eos> Use your brain, Sonnyboy.<eos> You know, I got a card when I got out of prison one time, from my momma.<eos> "Young man," with brains, muscles, looks, and girls chasing you... you'll go far.
Before I grew up and learned, that dragons were real, and evil roamed the world, I fell in love.<eos> From the moment I saw her, I could think of nothing else.<eos> I dreamed of growing up to many her, of loving her forever.<eos> As the Bolshevik revolution raged its way towards us, I could think only of Natalka.<eos> This is the one that's bewitched you?
Ukraine must be taught to bow to our will.<eos> Without its huge mineral wealth and vast harvests of grain Russia cannot exist.<eos> So, Koba , how do you propose we proceed?<eos> We implement Lenin's plan, but without mercy.<eos> God bless you.
This is Stalin's true vision.<eos> Kaganovich... haven't I had you shot?<eos> Do you not drink with your comrades?<eos> I bring news from Ukraine.<eos> I told you to crush them.
I have been painting icons of Saint Yuri since I was a child.<eos> What you traded... was merely one of them.<eos> This is the real icon.<eos> Mama... you see?<eos> God has not forsaken you.
Dimitri!<eos> Granddad!<eos> Fire!<eos> Don't let them escape!<eos> It's about time I killed you, old man.
One being fictional and the other one extinct.<eos> And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a 24 Chrysler...<eos> Well...<eos> This is a 24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?
You don't want to talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.<eos> It says ibuprofen.<eos> That was my favorite mug<eos> Stay out of my shit.<eos> Something is happening to you, Logan.
Anyone can do that job.<eos> I'll give you $ 50,000.<eos> How did you find me huh?<eos> You are fucking up my life lady.<eos> The people after you, they are on my ass now.
- What sightings?<eos> People said someone look like the wolverine was seen at Paso driving.<eos> said he looked old.<eos> Hey!<eos> I told you to stop it with that ball.
Take these now.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> It's not safe here anymore.<eos> And you can't have an attack out there you understand?<eos> Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about.
I agree.<eos> The Reavers were very ineffective<eos> But I'm bringing new tools to bear.<eos> But I still need someone to part us in the right direction.<eos> No, I can't help you.
I have a reasoning with the previous owner of the property.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Previous being the operative word<eos> Who is this?<eos> It's the guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Quit looking at me.<eos> You're dying.<eos> You want to die.<eos> Charles told me.<eos> What else did he tell you?
He lives on movie sets with a girlfriend in every port.<eos> I can't imagine your ex really understood the agreement he made back when he made it.<eos> (FLY BUZZING)<eos> He offered you.<eos> Who do you think he offered you to?
And I swear, honey, deep in my belly, you heard me cry.<eos> You heard how much pain I was in, because you and I are bonded, no matter who your father is.<eos> (SIGHS) The perversion.<eos> It's something unholy they did to me.<eos> And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own, I went to the doctor I should have seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story, and Andy, Andy, he believed me.
And when I found out those sick people wanted you for their own, I went to the doctor I should have seen in the first place, and I told him our crazy story, and Andy, Andy, he believed me.<eos> And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> (SPUTTERING)<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day, that day I found out they wanted you for their own.
- John.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't even like that tone.<eos> We're not gonna fight, are we?<eos> No, you're not gonna itemize the way in which I disappoint you.
You can't tell yourself a joke and not see the punch line coming.<eos> You think someone else is telling you these stories?<eos> I think that... that it has to be.<eos> Someone like... Me?<eos> I scared you.
They say it's bad to kill kitty cats.<eos> But you like eating meat, right?<eos> So farmers can kill animals, right?<eos> See?<eos> That's the clue they gave you.
Who's really hurting you?<eos> Me?<eos> Or Susan?<eos> Susan likes me.<eos> She wouldn't fuck you with someone else's pussy.
I knew you'd come around eventually.<eos> Wh-what happened?<eos> You've developed immunities, so you're upping your dosage.<eos> Why? You're addicted.<eos> Stop killing and sobriety's icy hand will have you.
Stop killing and sobriety's icy hand will have you.<eos> Hell, you can't even decrease your kills, but any increase and you overdose.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> You graduate to stronger shit.<eos> You have to kill those close to you now.
Kyle, let go.<eos> BRATT STEALS WORLD'S BIGGEST DIAMOND No, no...<eos> you've got to be kidding me.<eos> Lucy, did you see...<eos> He helps you if you have nightmares, and he's really good to snuggle with...
And you, Hollywood!<eos> This time, I'm canceling you!<eos> And all the losers who rejected me!<eos> Ooooo, piggy, piggy!<eos> So how are things going for you, career-wise?
- Give it.<eos> - No!<eos> - Give it!<eos> Ow!<eos> What is wrong with you?
- No!<eos> - Give it!<eos> Ow!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Huh, got it?<eos> I make no promises.<eos> Love you!<eos> Uh-huh, right.<eos> I love you too.
Anyway, he went into remission and so, he's going back into chemo.<eos> - You really miss work, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, of course I do.<eos> But, hey, I get to go to Mommy and Me and sing about poo and pee and all about my ABC's.<eos> You're a very beautiful girl and I love you.
Is your family still there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My father left before I was born and my mom was addicted to drugs, so I was raised in foster care.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> So what drew you to these parts?
Okay, that's just stupid.<eos> Come to think of it, when was the last time you ran her a bath took her to school or gave her breakfast?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm working.<eos> That's why I hired you, that's why I pay you!
Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm really truly sorry and profoundly embarrassed.<eos> I don't know, somehow seeing you like that. Carrying my child, it's...<eos> I mean, they warned you about this.
Thanks.<eos> I'm really truly sorry and profoundly embarrassed.<eos> I don't know, somehow seeing you like that. Carrying my child, it's...<eos> I mean, they warned you about this.<eos> You know, they say the moment that it really hits you.
D'you know why we call it shopper's row? Cos this is where all the shopping happens.<eos> You wanna buy something nice for your sweetie?<eos> This is the place to do it.<eos> Zone C, the food court.<eos> Everything in here will kill you.
Hey!<eos> What you doing...?<eos> The real man in charge.<eos> You should've let him take the blame... For getting every man, woman and child in this building killed.<eos> Your country thanks you for your service.
'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.'<eos> - They know everything!<eos> - 'Solved it, then?<eos> ' I'm working on it.<eos> 'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.'
You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember?<eos> To look after the three of you.<eos> Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.<eos> Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
They tortured Alex to death.<eos> I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.<eos> But you? You, where were you?<eos> That day at the embassy, I escaped. Ha!<eos> But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
That's a great tradition.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> Man, I didn't know it was your birthday.<eos> It's not, it's tomorrow.<eos> Anyway, what's up with you, man?
That's her... that's Eloise.<eos> So, where the hell are we?<eos> Okay, we're here now...<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Mom... Mom used to take you to work sometimes, do you remember?
Quick in, quick out.<eos> I'll watch him, I promise.<eos> Yo, Scott, get your crazy ass here, man, we found it.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Mom used to take you to work sometimes.
- Thank you.<eos> - You're quite welcome.<eos> Now promise me you'll find your way home.<eos> Okay?<eos> God bless you.
So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone.<eos> Just to see what happens.<eos> Move.<eos> Don't be frightened.<eos> I have a very strong feeling this thing doesn't want to harm you.
Sure, after flying to the moon and getting attacked by a killer robot how difficult can it be to put on an ancient space suit?<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready for whatever.<eos> I have to say I'm very curious to see what awaits you.
Wait... no, no, no.<eos> Don't leave, don't leave, hey.<eos> All right, so I don't really expect for us to hang out.<eos> Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight, and I could really use your help.<eos> Billy, I hear you, but as I told you, I have house arrest.
- (JASON) Thanks, Billy.<eos> (BILLY GRUNTING) They're gonna blow this whole thing.<eos> It'll all be gone in a week.<eos> Billy, can I be honest?<eos> The deal was I drop you somewhere, and I get the van for a few hours, okay?
This is good.<eos> And every planet in the universe that has life has a piece of the crystal buried inside it.<eos> (ALPHA 5) Sixty-five million years ago,<eos> Zordon's team died defending the crystal here in what is now Angel Grove.<eos> - (ZORDON) The coins have chosen you five.
- Hey.<eos> (JASON) Shall we do this?<eos> (ZORDON) You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.<eos> You must never use your powers for personal gain.<eos> You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.
You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you.<eos> Trying to figure out my plan.<eos> I'll just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your deaths.
- (TRINI) Slow, slow, slow.<eos> - Master Billy.<eos> Do something, okay?<eos> There must be something you can do for him.<eos> I told you that you were not ready.
And you don't think we could've avoided that accident.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives just because you think something might happen.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We're not gonna stop living our lives-- okay, it is not about that.<eos> What if something were to happen to you?
(BECKONS INDISTINCTLY)<eos> Chapman to all stations.<eos> Recon environment.<eos> MILLS:<eos> Cole, what's wrong with you?
Fox Leader, this is Chapman, over.<eos> (STATIC ON RADIO)<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> Sometimes, life just punch you in the balls.
Now, many many Calcio storico players work there, no?<eos> At the market, everyone is friends.<eos> Everyone works very hard.<eos> When the sun comes up, the job is finished.<eos> Paolo's gonna make sure everything's okay with you.
Find a nice American girl, a traditional girl.<eos> What's wrong with Italian girls?<eos> You no want an Italian girl.<eos> Too difficult.<eos> It keeps you awake at night.
- No, it's not his team.<eos> It's our team, it's Santo Spirito's team.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Always doing what other people tell you to do.
- It's ridiculous!<eos> - Fine.<eos> You know why I'm here, you tell me.<eos> You haven't learned nothing.<eos> You have to do what your heart tells you to do...
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded, top to bottom.<eos> It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.<eos> Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room?<eos> The room's small.<eos> Oh, Big Brother is watching you!
What are you doing here?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?<eos> You should be at Baker Street. I am.<eos> So are you.<eos> They found your address, they brought you here.
Thanks.<eos> You keep your weekends for Rosie, so you needed to see someone during working hours.<eos> Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions, with someone reasonably close.<eos> You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
You found four men and one woman.<eos> And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Well, who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> My God, he knows you!
And cut there, thank you.<eos> We should bag that up, sell it.<eos> Make money for that on eBay.<eos> You can make more if you want, any time you like.<eos> Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain,
! What were you doing?<eos> ! - He's in distress, I'm helping him.<eos> - Restrain him now. Do it.<eos> I was trying to help him!<eos> - Sherlock, what was he doing to you?
"You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."<eos> "You're... nicer."<eos> Culverton gave me Faith's original note.<eos> A mutual friend put us in touch.<eos> Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note?
Silly name, isn't it?<eos> Greek. Means "the east wind".<eos> My parents loved silly names, like Eurus... or Mycroft... or Sherlock.<eos> Oh, look at him.<eos> Didn't it ever occur to you, not even once, that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister?
Stay at least three feet away from the glass, and all that.<eos> Why the headphones?<eos> She doesn't stop playing. Sometimes for weeks.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> - Kills you in the end.
I-I don't work here.<eos> My special hairband.<eos> I'm not one of your doctors.<eos> The one I made you steal from Mummy.<eos> It was the last thing I said to you, remember?
Two people?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?
Only it isn't a name.<eos> So it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you, everything here.<eos> So, who loves you?
You didn't win, you lost.<eos> Look what you did to her.<eos> Look what you did to yourself.<eos> All those complicated little emotions, I lost count.<eos> Emotional context, Sherlock, it destroys you every time.
Hey, Sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.<eos> What happened, did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.
Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> Wake up, little halflings!<eos> Morning, Wizzie!<eos> What great adventure lies in wait for you today?
Destroy. Destroy.<eos> Lam-Lam!<eos> I've got fresh batteries.<eos> Boom!<eos> Mom and Dad don't even know you.
No!<eos> Where's HR when you need them?<eos> Take it.<eos> I don't want your filthy money.<eos> Look, I told you to stay out of my way.
Okay.<eos> There must be something we can do.<eos> Hey, it's not that bad.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What's the matter with you?
Let's go home.<eos> How do I look?<eos> You look great.<eos> Well, team, good job.<eos> Staci, this letter should get you into the school of your choice.
Oh, shit.<eos> I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was meant to be behind your back.<eos> Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."<eos> Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.<eos> I hired Yondu to pick you up... when your mother passed away.
Yes.<eos> Quill and I have a bet.<eos> Dude.<eos> You're not supposed to say that!<eos> I say... if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low... your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.<eos> I created... what I imagined biological life to be like... down to the most minute detail.<eos> Did you make a penis?<eos> Dude!<eos> What is wrong with you?
I am hideous?<eos> You are horrifying to look at.<eos> Yes.<eos> But that's a good thing.<eos> When you're ugly, and someone loves you... you know they love you for who you are.
He's goddang precious!<eos> Hey, twig!<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aw, man... what did they do to you?
Everything is temporary.<eos> We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
Yondu?<eos> Thrusters are out.<eos> Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.<eos> Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.<eos> You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.<eos> Dive!<eos> Captain?<eos> Captain?<eos> Tell me why Ego wants you here?
So stop pissing me off!<eos> We have to get up to the extraction point!<eos> Go!<eos> I told you... I don't want to do this alone.<eos> You cannot deny... the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula... I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
And you can.<eos> No, I can't. Oh, right. You can't leave your house.<eos> It's not a house, it's a penthouse on Park Avenue.<eos> I can't leave because of my disease.<eos> Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Yeah. Still don't believe you.
No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What scares you? You.
You have to go back.<eos> No, Tulsa, don't... I hate it. I hate it.<eos> But, Gardner, we both know you have to go back.<eos> I love you, Tulsa.<eos> And I love you.
You must be hungry.<eos> I made your favorite, chicken stew.<eos> Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.<eos> "What did you do in the war, Daddy?"<eos> "I manufactured the napalm that made everybody's skin fall off."<eos> And this is a man who called his child an idiot loser.<eos> Well, in fairness to your father, when he called you an idiot loser, you had just signed up for a two-year course in California called "Unleash Your Calling."
Okay, boss.<eos> Dude, can I admit something to you?<eos> I feel like that's the nicest the police have ever treated me.<eos> Well, maybe that's the lesson that we have to learn.<eos> That if you're an upstanding member of society, then the police will treat you with respect.
I don't want that.<eos> I want what you have.<eos> An amazing wife, an amazing daughter.<eos> Just don't rush it.<eos> That's all out there waiting for you.
Everybody's grandma bakes biscuits.<eos> Yeah, he's, uh-- he's not wrong about that.<eos> This is-- this is- you know what?<eos> -You want to blindfold me too? Just hang on.<eos> I'll take you up on that.
-Hey, guys! Hey!<eos> Break it up!<eos> I said break it up right now!<eos> Back up.<eos> -He got to you, didn't he?
What are you doing?<eos> You could lose everything.<eos> Your-your scholarship, that pretty girl.<eos> You are a smart kid.<eos> Talk to me and i-- i can help you.
My flashlight's broke.<eos> Woof.<eos> Now... I can only give you a short visit.<eos> Thank you, Dave.<eos> George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.
Now... I can only give you a short visit.<eos> Thank you, Dave.<eos> George says they're not gonna let you out on bail.
Yes, Darya.<eos> Phillip?<eos> You're late.<eos> Couldn't be helped.<eos> I missed you in New York, but I see you're still in Buckhorn.
There is something really wrong.<eos> It's her life.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> There's James.<eos> He's staring at you again.
Tenfour, good buddy.<eos> Thank you, Bill.<eos> Please come along.<eos> Well, it has to do with the thermostat.<eos> It doesn't actually tell you what's going on when no one's here.
Dougie!<eos> You're not even dressed!<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> What's go... For God's sake.<eos> What is with you?
You're worse than Sonny Jim.<eos> Dougie, you've lost weight!<eos> Let me cinch this up.<eos> And this jacket looks two sizes too big.<eos> That black suit last night fit you perfectly.
Military.<eos> Thank you for meeting us.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> We're not anywhere near Mount Rushmore.<eos> I brought a picture for you.
I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.<eos> I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident.<eos> Yes, Coop.<eos> This is how and why we found you.
No.<eos> It's not about the bunny.<eos> All right.<eos> Go inside, Dougie.<eos> Someone will help you in there.
- But this is all I got.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Becky.<eos> Shelly, this is the third time she's asked you for money in two weeks.
Yes, sweetheart.<eos> You have a super night too, Gordon.<eos> I don't know when I'm gonna get home.<eos> Thank you, Albert.<eos> And let me remind you that this work you are doing tonight is very, very important.
Grab the kit.<eos> Is he hurt?<eos> Shit.<eos> We was waiting for you all night.<eos> Where'd they get you?
I can't do this.<eos> I don't know why it is.<eos> You're a good man, Ben.<eos> You know that zebra's out again?<eos> Uh... haven't seen you in a while.
Hello? Batman?<eos> Hi, Jimmy!<eos> It's the Jokes.<eos> Oop!<eos> Nobody calls you that.
No, I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Who else drives you to one-up them the way that I do?
That was fun!<eos> You okay, Batman?<eos> You seem the opposite of stern.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's just watching you out there, it was like the world wasn't all darkness anymore.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.
I hate you, Joker.<eos> - I hate you, too.<eos> - I hate you more.<eos> I hate you the most.<eos> I hate you forever.
No, of course not.<eos> You must know that. Otherwise, why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.
So you came with a peace offering of... oranges and flowers?<eos> Yeah, it's, uh... it's a Buddhist tradition.<eos> It's meant to remind you of our bond.<eos> Kind of like the MM's.<eos> Danny, what happened to you?
I have to live in the real world, Danny.<eos> This is how it works!<eos> I've been meaning to ask... what's this?<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> - Someone attacked you?
I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.<eos> Where was my office?<eos> Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.
Draw strength from your center.<eos> Go slow at the beginning.<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Who put you in charge?
I don't wanna have to call an ambulance, huh?<eos> - For him?<eos> - Cut the bullshit.<eos> You get in over your head, you tap out.<eos> And Rusty, I warned you last time about the biting.
You died.<eos> - I saw pictures.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did die.<eos> You look the same age as when I last saw you.
It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.<eos> I've got two kids to take care of. and it placed me in their debt.<eos> And they cured you?
You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.<eos> Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.<eos> Disguised as a friend.<eos> Slipping past you as a stranger.<eos> They are everywhere.<eos> You must always be aware of their presence, because they are aware of you.
Why do you ask?<eos> What happened last night can't happen again.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm on my own here, Ward. I...<eos> We have real trouble, and you...<eos> I mean, I have no idea what's going on with you.
Very rare.<eos> It'll help you let go.<eos> And that's what you want, isn't it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, it is. You want to be free of all that is boiling inside of you to get out.
She said she knew my father.<eos> What?<eos> She said he had no honor.<eos> Wendell never told me.<eos> - Told you what?
Gao will know they're missing, but as long as it looks as though they did their job before they left...<eos> What job?<eos> To remind me of my mistakes.<eos> Do you understand how stupid that was?<eos> What if someone had seen you in there?
"My actions were impulsive, and I now realize the severity of my words."<eos> Is this an apology?<eos> No, it's the statement you're gonna be making at the board meeting this afternoon.<eos> It sort of seems like an apology.<eos> Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.
And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.<eos> History says that the Iron Fist and the Hand are mortal enemies.<eos> But I wonder... in the spirit of change, perhaps we can be something different.<eos> Last night showed me the truth.<eos> K'un-Lun did not send you to hunt us down.
Hey, listen.<eos> I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.<eos> I love you.<eos> I mean, you... you're the only family I have left.<eos> And maybe what's happening to you is partly my fault, too.
You can't believe anything that she says to you.<eos> Look, that may be true.<eos> But if there's even the smallest chance that I can find out the truth, then I have to go.<eos> Otherwise, it's just gonna be this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my life.<eos> Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.
It wasn't until years later that I realized she was sick.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda... I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.
Is he okay?<eos> Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place? - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.
Come on. No.<eos> Not till you explain this.<eos> The truth is...<eos> I'm having financial trouble.<eos> I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.
I don't understand why we had to bring her here.<eos> Never let the enemy choose the battlefield.<eos> Always work from a position of strength.<eos> Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.
Call me back, tell me what's going on, or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kyle?<eos> After your mother delivered you... the nurse wrapped you in a blanket... placed you in my arms.
How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.<eos> Thanks for showing me how to heal her.<eos> Of course.<eos> I see it took a lot out of you, though.
Why are you frowning?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.
We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.<eos> This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.
Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.<eos> What it was capable of.<eos> What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.
And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny...<eos> So when did Bakuto approach you with this... this idea of recruiting me?
- You're wrong about Colleen.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I'm gonna defeat the Hand, Claire. Whatever it takes.<eos> It's what the Order of the Crane Mother has trained me for.<eos> And did those monks teach you how to deal with a broken heart?
I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess you guys don't order a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.<eos> - How much has Danny told you of K'un-Lun?
Even if we have to murder people to do it?<eos> Whatever it takes, Joy.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> So... are we ready to turn off the Hand's accounts?<eos> Dad, I just got you back.
I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.
Anger.<eos> It's like a... a fire burning inside of me.<eos> Every time it happens, it... it gets harder and harder to control.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe this turmoil you're in is because you questioned Lei Kung's teachings?<eos> If you'd just followed the path he laid out for you, none of this would be happening.
The way to K'un-Lun was open.<eos> I could leave.<eos> I was looking for a sign... and instead, it showed me a path.<eos> Maybe it is a sign.<eos> A sign telling you, Danny, that the path is open.
And look what a mess you've made here.<eos> I've seen this world.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.<eos> Come home.<eos> Danny, what is keeping you here?
I want you in charge, because Harold has become...<eos> - Goddamn dangerous.<eos> - He can't be trusted.<eos> Our relationship would be more quid pro quo.<eos> Take this drug I'm giving you now, for instance.
It's all he knows.<eos> All he's ever been taught.<eos> When did you become such a milkmaid, Danny?<eos> We're gonna take care of Bakuto, and we're doing it with Colleen.<eos> You know, this place has confused you.
I'm talking about Dad.<eos> - He needs us. - No.<eos> He's always been a bastard to me.<eos> Ever since he... came back from the dead, it's like a... It's like a piece of his soul got left in the grave.<eos> He will use you, hurt you, and throw you aside without a second thought.
You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.<eos> We're going to change the world.<eos> Well, the promises I've made you are still in place.
These two are warriors.<eos> You are nothing but a betrayer.<eos> You have no honor.<eos> I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.
- Danny, we do what we came to do.<eos> - Is this really who you want to be?<eos> A living weapon?<eos> An assassin for K'un-Lun?<eos> Is that what your father had in mind for you when he was raising you to be Danny Rand?
- You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.
- It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!<eos> Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?
K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.
Yield.<eos> I kicked your ass back in K'un-Lun and I kicked your ass here!<eos> Yield!<eos> Danny!<eos> I hurt you.
Now we'll get rich both ends.<eos> Dad.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Yeah? - You owe Danny.<eos> He freed you from the Hand.
I need information.<eos> Why should I tell you anything?<eos> I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.<eos> That does not sound pleasant.<eos> I need access to everything that was on the tablet I took from you.
I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> Danny Rand. and it will lead you to fulfill your destiny as the true Iron Fist.
- What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?<eos> Who forced you to lie about that?
I'll get the car to run you home.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Ward said I could find you here.
Stop looking for excuses.<eos> I need you to be more responsible with what's going on, mark.<eos> You've got to face the fact that we don't have any money.<eos> I'm not asking you to get a job.<eos> I'm not asking you to stop your comedy.
We need this place.<eos> He was demanding I keep the room clean, that I hoover it, and take the bins out.<eos> We don't live here for free.<eos> We pay fucking rent!<eos> I've been asking you to do that stuff for two weeks!
It's my fault?<eos> And you... You wear the trousers in this relationship and I'm meant to be the fucking man.<eos> Then act like one.<eos> You give me pocket money to buy things, you tell me what I can and cannot do.<eos> I tell you what, tell you what, tell you what... You're no different from that nutty, old man.
Don't be so dramatic, Jill.<eos> It's good he's gone.<eos> He was a loser.<eos> You don't know him like I do.<eos> He dragged you down.
Mark was right, the old couple are acting strange.<eos> Neither of us have ever seen the baby.<eos> I haven't heard it cry since mark disappeared.<eos> Will you listen to yourself, Jill?<eos> Marcus has turned you into the same paranoid mess he was.
Marcus has turned you into the same paranoid mess he was.<eos> Now, I have to be honest,<eos> I think they're great.<eos> I want them to adopt me.<eos> And they love you.
I still think you should leave him.<eos> I'll check in on you later in the week, see how you're getting on.<eos> It's time to move on, baby sister.<eos> Help me.<eos> Listen to me, listen... They didn't tie you up.
Okay.<eos> Josephine: Lay her flat on the floor.<eos> Hold her down.<eos> Push my baby out!<eos> Or I will cut it out and leave you to bleed!
The ghost.<eos> A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.<eos> I'm just a man.<eos> 35 U.S. casualties angel of death.<eos> That's why they never find you.
Tell me you're my enemy...<eos> fine, I'll respect that.<eos> We kill, we kill.<eos> But say you're my friend and shoot me in the back, the only angle I see is a fucking snake.<eos> But if this friend shoots you in the back and you survive is it okay to shoot him back?
[yells]<eos> [DEEP VOICE] Wait.<eos> [MICHE groans]<eos> You must not have heard me.<eos> I told you to wait.
That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out...<eos> it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.<eos> You realize you're only at mile one of the marathon... right?<eos> Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel.
But for you, from here on out...<eos> it's only gonna get harder, Aaron.<eos> You realize you're only at mile one of the marathon... right?<eos> Everybody's gonna tell you how to feel.<eos> Doctors are gonna tell you to stay positive.
Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.
You want some, too?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, Jess.<eos> It's me calling you for the third or fourth or 19th time.
It's outsourcing.<eos> Most importantly, it's the type of stuff you're doing anyway.<eos> Malpractice. Workmen's comp.<eos> Good people who need justice.<eos> If you take these, it'll keep you up-to-your-eyeballs busy.
Weird how?<eos> This tremor stuff, I think...<eos> I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.<eos> Trish, I gotta call you back.<eos> Malcolm, what did I tell you about coming in my apartment?
- Let me guess, Jeri Hogarth.<eos> - Right.<eos> I didn't know she did diversity hires.<eos> Uh, I'm independent. I don't work for her firm.<eos> - Well, I'm not paying you.
Like you were helping to clean up.<eos> - Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> You don't take the blame for something that's not yours.<eos> - Whoever hired you...
- I've been here before.<eos> - Why are following me?<eos> - And you're in serious danger.<eos> - What kind of lawyer are you?<eos> This case you took, it's leading you toward something truly sinister.
I just want to get answers for my client. I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.
I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.<eos> What have they done to you?
She wasn't like you and me.<eos> And now I know...<eos> I was never meant to raise her.<eos> I was meant to raise the Black Sky.<eos> I'm grateful for you.
Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.<eos> It's because the Hand doesn't wanna kill me.<eos> They want me alive.<eos> He tell you why?
And I look forward to doing it again.<eos> You really shouldn't.<eos> I heard you'd made some friends.<eos> Smart move, considering she never believed in her purpose, and you've yet to discover yours.<eos> Soon, Iron Fist. You'll learn your destiny is much more than what they told you in K'un-Lun.
- So cool.<eos> - I mean, it's... it's kind of cool.<eos> I'm gonna make this real simple.<eos> You're gonna answer our questions or shit's gonna get dark in here.<eos> What do they call you?
Yeah, Danny.<eos> They took Danny.<eos> And then now, I have to save him from the Hand.<eos> You are in no position to save anybody.<eos> They haven't pressed charges, but they found you with two dead bodies.
Deep down inside... he is still just a kid looking for his family.<eos> With me... and with them... almost had it.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> About?<eos> Look, I brought you in to help one family.
I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.<eos> The entire city is in danger.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate. So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.
Is this place what I think it is?<eos> These beasts, they've given both of us so much.<eos> Though even power great as yours pales in the face of eternal life.<eos> This is what you've been after the whole time?<eos> The very essence of what made you.
The Elders of K'un-Lun were right.<eos> They showed way too much mercy when they banished the Hand.<eos> And you think you're going to right that wrong?<eos> It's what this journey has all been for.<eos> Then you are as naive as when I first laid eyes on you.
Asshole, I will put you down.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen.<eos> Raised you.
That's why I saved you, Colleen.<eos> Raised you.<eos> Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.
Together.<eos> Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.
The Hand did not reduce me to this.<eos> This is who I've always been.<eos> You forget... I know when you're lying.<eos> You've always wanted to find light in me.<eos> Look where it brought you.
Get back!<eos> Take cover!<eos> Take cover!<eos> You gotta help her!<eos> I'm sorry, Matthew... for all the pain I've caused you along the way.
I don't know what to say.<eos> Nothing that I don't need to say myself.<eos> After what happened between us... we both could've handled it differently.<eos> Instead, the Earth had to shake for us to find each other again.<eos> What I did to you was...
- Well, Neil is thirty minutes closer to the office.<eos> - You sound just like Martha.<eos> - When are you gonna start calling my mom mom?<eos> - Whenever she stops treating me like Satan incarnate.<eos> - She does not, she treat you like- really?
- What, my fault?<eos> - Yes honey, I told you that the truck would be ready two hours ago but you said no.<eos> - Yeah, well looks like we timed this just right.<eos> Otherwise. - Alright man, you and me on box patrol and girl time.<eos> What's up, man, love you.
What I'm not gonna understand is this: You playing games.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> You never believe me so why should I expect you to change?<eos> - Okay. Well, I believed you when you told me that someone stole your lenses.
- I, um...<eos> I saw a ghost and I followed her out into the woods and... I thought she was trying to kill me.<eos> - Alright.<eos> From what you've told me about the stress of moving into a new house, the ridiculous story of a murder by your friend and possible marital problems.<eos> Look my dear, what your husband told you about ghosts not being real is true.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I'll make the call tomorrow.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey honey, hi.<eos> This is Doug, he's the one that found you in the woods.
Who?<eos> My name... my name isn't Brian LeFevre.<eos> My real name... is Dane Brass.<eos> And I hold top secret government information.<eos> Okay? They're after me, that's-that's why everything's been so weird. That's why I haven't been able to speak openly with you.
Lost?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure? I can help you find the way.<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> May the lord bless you and keep you.
and maybe in a year, if you're willing,<eos> I would love to get maybe a coffee with you and...<eos> - No!<eos> - What?<eos> No, dude, I just told you that I wanted to be alone.
You like Twix?<eos> Um, also got, uh, some Sour Patch Kids, some...<eos> Got one of these... kind of weird ice cream sandwich things.<eos> Why do you have so many snacks?<eos> Did, like, a fifth-grade class invite you over for their slumber party?
I feel like I told you what I wanted to say.<eos> I thought you wanted to tell me something.<eos> No, I just...<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess I just figured since...<eos> I kissed you, like, right after you told me, I didn't really give you an opportunity to... unpack it.
I don't know what you expect.<eos> Yeah, I... I don't wanna have sex either.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> So you don't wanna talk about this?<eos> I told you that I wanted to be alone.
Come on, boy.<eos> 'Night, John.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'd like to see the manager.<eos> How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.
My hands.<eos> Ah.<eos> How exciting.<eos> Yet you know you cannot, can you?<eos> I told you I needed that guy, the way you are looking at me right now.
Gianna.<eos> There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> What brought you back, John?
Please hold.<eos> - I appreciate the service.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> You will find safe passage below.<eos> Transportation is waiting for you.
Whatever you'd like, John.<eos> Would you like a back rub with that, John?<eos> You're going to help me.<eos> Why the fuck would I do that?<eos> Because I'm the only one that can help you.
That's what your father wanted and that's why he signed the estate over to him.<eos> Plain and simple, you owe the bank just north of, $6 million.<eos> $6 million!<eos> All money borrowed against the ranch to keep it afloat.<eos> But in 90 days, the probate process is going to catch up with you and the bank's gonna want this house to cover the debt.
- You know what?<eos> Let me call the girls.<eos> - No!<eos> We can put something aside for you under the radar, maybe open a little shop in town or get a place in Tahoe.<eos> You don't have any kids, you could just start over where nobody knows you.
Shit, and say what?<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Not another word out of you, Irish!<eos> What you want me to say to him?<eos> Think of the first nice thing someone said to you when you went to prison.
You must be one of those guys they're looking for.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Yeah, somebody trained you really well.
She's a model. That's the point.<eos> - They-- they picked her. - But your face-- it ha-- it-- it has formed in a very, um, pretty and beautiful way, and I'll bet you anything that that's why they put you on a magazine.<eos> - She's a model...<eos> - Yes. They act-- they actually chose her.<eos> Well, I don't wanna be crass, but I think you should charge money for people taking pictures of you.
So I was just wondering if maybe you had a bike I could borrow for the day.<eos> Yeah, sure, man.<eos> Um, but you don't own a bike?<eos> I do. My cousin has it right now.<eos> I've never seen you on a bike.
She meant the first part where I... because she can't imagine a life without me, right, Mom?<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> - See.<eos> - I'll put you out of the misery of this conversation.<eos> Mom? Is there anything you want to tell me that's going on in the house? Anything that's bothering you?
And it really plays.<eos> It's really funny,<eos> And, you know what, uh, actually,<eos> I-I'm gonna try something here, guys.<eos> You are a horrible woman, and I can't wait until those cigarettes kill you.
People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch, pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.<eos> You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.<eos> You don't see this?<eos> People need an outlet to unleash their rage.<eos> Now social media will come down on you with the fury of a middle-aged man who's accomplished nothing.
Sure, man. I mean, you grew up fatherless.<eos> You were raised by a woman who was basically a prostitute.<eos> Well, the father stuff was real.<eos> Yeah, without a doubt. Got some daddy issues there.<eos> And-and you, too. I mean, like, you know, what happened with you... with Ms. Klinsky, the librarian.
- That was a big one. Thank you.<eos> - The other one, too.<eos> Yeah, that's what this is.<eos> Okay, so, clearly, you're not busy, so, I need somebody to clear the lines.<eos> Did Charlie ask you to trick me? Trick you?
Look what you've become.<eos> Do you want to live this way, son?<eos> Covered in manure, selling your body, smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Do I look like a dusthead to you?
I gave you a shot.<eos> You can't go around doing insane shit like kissing dogs.<eos> You got to put all that nonsense behind you once and for all.<eos> Now, this is my last and final offer.<eos> You cut that bullshit out and come work with me, or you go back on the street and crawl back into that manure pile I found you in.
I'll be right back.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.
Okay.<eos> Generally, a key part of good communication is that both parties be conscious.<eos> I'm really sorry about your mother.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Now, I brought you here to negotiate.
Whatever happens between me and Christian is none of your goddamn business.<eos> So you stay the fuck away from us.<eos> Hey, we should think about going soon.<eos> I wanna go now.<eos> What did Elena say to you?
I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Good evening, Mr. grey.<eos> Hey, ed.<eos> The rest of the crew will be here in the morning.<eos> If something were to happen to you because of me...
That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Ana, I know full well that you can handle anything.<eos> And, uh, if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.<eos> But I'd like to take you there myself.
Hmm.<eos> You didn't have any weird dreams or anything? Or, like, wake up at all?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, none that I can think of.<eos> I mean, there was a little thing of asking you to marry me, but aside from that, no. Nothing.
Ana, sweetheart.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I know. I've been...<eos> I'm sorry. Work has been so crazy.<eos> I hope they're not overworking you?
OK.<eos> Are they sure?<eos> I've just rung her. She's not answering.<eos> Do you think I should go round?<eos> I dunno. If she's not answering to you, she probably wants to be on her own.
I was hoping you'd still be awake. Don't be a twat about it.<eos> Trish called me and told me her attacker put something - in her mouth to gag her.<eos> - Yeah. I just got initial forensics.<eos> And?<eos> Cloth fibres found in her mouth swabs confirms what she's told you.
It's a MacBook, darling.<eos> Top of the line with the Retina display.<eos> You know who else has a Retina display?<eos> Fred!<eos> Mary, I understand you like mathematics.
So why would I screw up yours?<eos> Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things habit.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only thing different between the things you saw on TV and Roberta is Roberta loves you.
But don't be afraid to believe in things habit.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only thing different between the things you saw on TV and Roberta is Roberta loves you.<eos> She tries to help.<eos> Tell you what though.
Wanna come inside?<eos> Cat.<eos> Frank, I think this is stupid.<eos> Why don't we just call Evelyn and tell her I don't wanna do this?<eos> Cause as I told you, Evelyn didn't order this. The court did.
Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat, if you like.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I mean, is anyone told you what this is about?
I mean, is anyone told you what this is about?<eos> My grandmother wants me to live with her, and I wanna stay with Frank.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I'm sure this is gonna be a very scary stuff.<eos> Does any of it worry you?
What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.<eos> I wished for you so much, so I sculpted you from clay myself.
My... name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.<eos> Serial number 8141921.<eos> That's all I ever need to... Assigned to British Intelligence.<eos> What the hell is this thing?<eos> The lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.
It can not be them!<eos> Diana, people...<eos> I... She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.
- What, know?<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Did i...<eos> - Because I do, now.<eos> Er protocol, they, they checked you for drugs, hallucinogens, they wouldn't even let me come close to you
Dr. brown, she made me cut him.<eos> - My god.<eos> - On his throat, and he bled, and he died, are you going to help me, who's going to believe me?<eos> I don't want to go to jail.<eos> No one believed you and I'm your husband,
- Evening.<eos> Two sips of that and you'll be running for the bathroom. Yeah?<eos> I'll remember you while I'm in the bathroom, if that's what you want.<eos> No, no, thanks, I'm not gonna get that out of my head.<eos> No, just remember who warned you.
Let's go over it all again. Step by step, all right?<eos> You arrived at the control room at 22:05.<eos> You sat at your station. At approximately 22:20 yousteppedout fora cupof coffee.<eos> Youcameback fiveminuteslater.<eos> At 22:25 Thomas told you he was gonna take a break and he left his station.
I mean, I should be doing things right now.<eos> So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.
We all like you,<eos> Ler,<eos> Khan,<eos> Arsus,<eos> Are not you curious who who did this to you?
I'm out, too.<eos> Let's go, Boo.<eos> I don't wanna.<eos> You ain't my boss.<eos> You want me to whoop you upside your head?
- But I shouldn't have said that.<eos> - You know, I want Zeke to be here or me to be there.<eos> At their shitty little hood rat club?<eos> You hate that place.<eos> Besides, it's beneath you.
Wait, 20 minutes?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Shane Vincent, AR.<eos> Lucky man. Your girl adores you, talks about you all the time.
So, yo, even if you ain't sorry, you have to march your ass to Queens today and go apologize to this dude.<eos> I... I know you don't want to, but...<eos> but for the music.<eos> Maybe... when you say you're sorry, you could just... cross your fingers behind your back, like they do.<eos> Use techniques the white man taught you.
I know that.<eos> - Tell me his name.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Well, you will.<eos> I warned you this day would come, Ezekiel. Didn't I?
All the tastemakers.<eos> Plus, they got go-go girls, and they got live animal acts.<eos> And I got this song we originally wrote for Misty for you to perform live at midnight called "Toy Box."<eos> You bring the house down...<eos> Stigwood will probably cast you in his movie.
- This better be about you handing me money or this shit right here ain't gonna end well.<eos> Well, you're half right.<eos> It's about the money, but... it's about us niggas at our spot getting our fair share.<eos> Cadillac, pour me a Myers and pineapple directly.<eos> And who's this delicate little thing with you, Shao?
You wanna get played or build your own kingdom?<eos> You my brother, so don't take this the wrong way, but I told you.<eos> This college shit, it ain't for you, man.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> You could be the smartest dude at that school. They ain't never gonna see you as equal.
They said you pulled a gun on some white people - at that college event today.<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - Who was it?<eos> - It wasn't nobody.<eos> Must've been somebody, because they fired you from that internship.
I mean, like, if you wanted to go out and...<eos> - Ra-Ra, are you sniffing glue?<eos> - Glue? No, no, no.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let me just... - Let me just call you back.
To be who she wants to be, to sing for herself.<eos> At that whore's den of a club that Adele just spoke of?<eos> ♪ So, we all came here to get it on ♪ ♪ Everybody gotta cross your Rubicon ♪<eos> Now, don't take this wrong, Roy, but are you pushing this Mylene girl<eos> - just 'cause Misty dumped you?
I'm sitting here listening...<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> ¿Qué pasó?<eos> What happened?<eos> Somebody mug you on the street?
No offense, Boo, but some things just ain't for you.<eos> How many times I gotta tell you? I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> I know, and maybe in an alternate universe that would make a difference.<eos> Dizz, I'm sorry, man.<eos> I never meant for none of this to happen to you.
The movie is yours.<eos> - Mylene. Where's my girl?<eos> - This is crazy.<eos> How could you?<eos> What possessed you?
Looks like two of you will be leaving the block today, Money.<eos> Let me get you outta here.<eos> This fucking mess will take all day.<eos> Your gate money, 200, and your CDCR ID. Use it until you get a new driver's license.<eos> The van outside will take you to the train station.
That's for you, man.<eos> Picked that out myself.<eos> Something in there just to get you started.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Got a big night planned for you, bro.
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Manny.<eos> No worries, bro.<eos> So, how you feeling, man? I'm good.<eos> You?<eos> For the record, everyone I know, they high-fived after you put that jester down. Especially after that fucker shot you.
So I found these contractor dudes who agreed to load them in a container heading back to the States. Cost me a hundred of the AKs...<eos> Wait, wait. You're telling me there's just 900 now.<eos> There was 11 hundred to start.<eos> I figured a hundred was pretty cheap to get them home but then again we're talking about Soviet factory full-autos, not that cheap-ass Chinese knock-off bullshit.<eos> He said he needed to see you, Money.
Just breathe.<eos> Fish has heart.<eos> Get on the wall.<eos> Step in.<eos> You throw any piss or shit... I'll leave you in here for the whole 30, no rec.
Yeah, the stock broker from Pasadena.<eos> When you come to yard, chow, you take a shit, whatever... you stick to your own race.<eos> Why did you fight that Toad?<eos> He challenged me first.<eos> You gonna go around kicking it off with every buster that calls you out?
The question is, what you gonna do when you're out here slumming it with the rest of us? Cause the safety of these numbers comes with a price.<eos> There are no free rides here. Everyone puts in work, whether cliqued up or not.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us. Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.
What do I do with it?<eos> Take it to yard tomorrow.<eos> How?<eos> In your fucking ass, man.<eos> Make sure you lube-up, too. You don't want this shit breaking off inside you.
I told her about the guns because her brother and I were gonna sell them.<eos> We were supposed to sell them together.<eos> And she introduced me to Shotgun.<eos> Two coffees.<eos> So Shotgun... he's jumping you in for this.
A fucking envious life.<eos> He's got not one prior.<eos> Can't even fucking spell the word gangster, man.<eos> He gets fucked up on a DUI manslaughter, kills his friend.<eos> Yeah, a dime will change you for sure, but a guy like that... gets out, throws everything away?
Get down now!<eos> One!<eos> Two!<eos> Three!<eos> Your counsellor wants to see you.
Good answer.<eos> Who is?<eos> It's Money.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Howie's been calling you all day. What the fuck?
Let me see your gun.<eos> Keep driving. What!<eos> What's wrong, Money?<eos> How many guns did you tell Shotgun you had total?<eos> Same as I told you!
Easy.<eos> Easy, Money.<eos> Slowly.<eos> What the fuck, Money?<eos> You knew they'd put you back here.
Yeah, thanks, I think.<eos> That's at least partially what-- exactly what-- man:<eos> Marty?<eos> Hey, Trevor.<eos> They let you in here?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.<eos> It's hilarious.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a-- a rapist...<eos> Like you've committed rape.<eos> You know why ginnie dumped you?
I'm her father.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. gallo, you are not--<eos> Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.<eos> Okay, this is a very bad idea.<eos> You know what, Martin? I'm starting to see why ginnie kicked you to the curb.
- Nola? Hey, Nola?<eos> - Are you following me?<eos> No, no, no, I'm not following you. No, no, don't mace me!<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I I am technically following you, but not in a stalker way just as a professional...
Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?<eos> This is no kind of life, you're an old man.<eos> Why don't you just meet somebody your own age and make a life, for God sakes?<eos> - I will.<eos> - You know, someday, Steve one of these guys is gonna catch you and what are you gonna do then?
Thank you.<eos> I'll see you later, Lew.<eos> Let's go, Buddy.<eos> Some son of a bitch graffiti punk has been spray-painting the walls of my apartment buildings.<eos> I could certainly help you with that.
I'm okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.<eos> I did not know that, but thank you.<eos> I guess I feel like, sometimes I think of you as a father in a way...
- Well, can I...<eos> - No!<eos> Your security camera is pointing right down my street.<eos> - They hate me in this neighborhood.<eos> - Who hates you?
I'm not happy.<eos> This is not happy.<eos> Catch the fucker.<eos> Hi, it's John, sorry to leave this on your voicemail but I'm just looking at a picture of one of the murals from Lew's building and, okay, yes I give the piece as a whole, seven out of ten.<eos> The scrotum shading, the veins and it's like the whole thing just follows you.
- Okay.<eos> - Takes hours to respond to texts.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> One of the most annoying things is that she'll make plans and then cancel them, day of.<eos> She'll invite you over to watch a movie and then just wanna watch a movie!
Brings out the color in your eyes.<eos> - So, a day? - One day.<eos> All right.<eos> Remind him of the due date, huh?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew, I just don't know what happened to you.
Remind him of the due date, huh?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew, I just don't know what happened to you.<eos> I'm running out of time, okay?<eos> The Chinese are coming to visit the building tomorrow.<eos> It's a Lucha Libre wrestler and I think he's tea-bagging you, Lew.
- Jesus Christ.<eos> Hey Lew, you think you could... loan me $5,000?<eos> You want me to lend you... fuck you!<eos> Steve!<eos> And what happened to you?
No, because I have no fear to feed you with.<eos> No fear to give you and I will prove it.<eos> Sing for me like you once did as the river caught your tongue.<eos> Ee neem sea wo ha ha. Suicide.<eos> That will teach you not to steal, won't it?
If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?<eos> That is a question to be asked and answered in America.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Tide's rising.<eos> You've lots of people waiting for you, people who have given up everything for you, James.
He's practised in removing and discouraging demons.<eos> Your husband reports a Barbason has been visiting you.<eos> There is a ceremony of exorcism which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> It's a very short process. And quite inexpensive.<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
- Why burden him?<eos> Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.<eos> James...<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.
He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.<eos> Come out, or I will come in there and drag you out.
I need a ship and passage.<eos> James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you! No, no, no.<eos> Look...<eos> Go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.
Look...<eos> Go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.
Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.
Candie!<eos> Candie!<eos> Candie, let...<eos> Dougie, have a seat.<eos> I'll, uh, examine you standing up.
How much weight has he lost?<eos> I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight.<eos> In a good way.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Dougie, last time I saw you, you were quite overweight.
Okay.<eos> Thank you, Roger.<eos> Anthony, come here.<eos> Don't sit down, Anthony.<eos> Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you.
Good?<eos> Depends, depends upon the intention, The intention behind the fire.<eos> The major also gave us a date, Day after tomorrow.<eos> If you read these stars, You find that same date,<eos> And it refers you to here.
A toast.<eos> Oh... dougie.<eos> Here's to you, dougie.<eos> Mr. Jackpots!<eos> Oh. This is the man I told you about.
It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood, but you've given enough already.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Keep your blood, Kriscol.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> Been meaning to stop by. Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.
Good to see you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?
You were supposed to call her, but you never did.<eos> Don't be sore at me, Audrey.<eos> You know I just want the best for you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, then sign the papers I gave you.
Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What's the problem, Ray?<eos> I killed that guy.<eos> He's the one I told you about.
Can we talk about this?<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> Do you need any money?<eos> No.<eos> Somebody hired you to kill me.
It really does.<eos> You... you know, it's... It's us against them.<eos> And I am your most loyal foot soldier... or... shoveler.<eos> You know, the... last...<eos> last time I saw you, it was about seven years ago. - You...
Getbackto me . Your man has my info.<eos> Yes,sir.<eos> There's 23 Douglas Joneses in the greater metro area.<eos> How are we gonna find the right one?<eos> Wilson,howmany times have I told you... this is what we do in the FBI?
I turned and looked.<eos> I saw myself.<eos> I saw myself from long ago, in the old Philadelphia offices, listening to Cooper telling me he was worried about a dream he had.<eos> Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m. on February 16th.<eos> I was worried about today because of the dream I told you about.
You may think you're winning the battle but I'll win the war.<eos> Careful, Ali.<eos> You don't wanna leave a bruise.<eos> I could bury you with that.<eos> But then again, it wouldn't be the first time someone buried you.
Somehow I got roped into being my mom's designated driver.<eos> What are you doing on Sunday?<eos> I'm going riding.<eos> You want company?<eos> I told you I'd give it a try.
- Hi, Toby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.
So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.<eos> Of course, I can.<eos> And you have Mary to thank for that.<eos> She saved you at the blind school and she's saving you now.
She doesn't know who I am, but she offered to help me and I kept my promise.<eos> I paid for her surgery.<eos> She's still as blind as a bat and useless to me.<eos> What about Sara Harvey?<eos> Was she looking for you too?
I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here? - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.
- Why is that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm guessing he's very busy.<eos> Probably.<eos> What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen? Are you out of your mind?
We both know it was never really mine to give. But... I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.<eos> And good luck.<eos> I wish you much success.<eos> Good luck tonight, Glen.<eos> Who told you about tonight?
I'm not gonna be a fucking game show host.<eos> This could be serious money for you, and right now, you need serious money.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Kelsey, gotta ask, is this the worst disadvantage so far?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No question.<eos> God will smite you for that.
Celebrity Wife Swap.<eos> I'm not even fucking married.<eos> It's a good offer.<eos> - Hey, Matt! - Ugh, I'm talking about acting.<eos> Look, everybody loves you.
- I know, I know.<eos> Well, what about the network?<eos> Elliot Salad just told me I'm what he thinks about when he's inside his wife.<eos> That's gotta be good for 13 on air.<eos> Look, this is the box that they like you in.
- It does smell delicious.<eos> - I hope you're joking. - Mm-hmm.<eos> In this new way where we don't have to be funny.<eos> See?<eos> You follow it in the air, and then it shows you where it lands.
- Sorry.<eos> - Sorry, that's right.<eos> Because that's what big first-grade children do, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Baby, someone hurt you, sweet pea?
Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened? - No.<eos> - You're their teacher.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Um, Amabella, sweetie, could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you?
Can you guy... and just a little bit closer together, guys.<eos> Hey, Mom, you wanna play Angry Beaver?<eos> In a minute.<eos> I just need to get one more shot.<eos> I think the angry beaver is gonna get you, Mom. Yeah.
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love...<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Sorry I woke you up.
You're being ridiculous.<eos> The boys will stay away from that kid.<eos> Take your hand off me.<eos> If I can't be here to look out for them, I need to know that you do.<eos> I asked you to remove your fucking hand.
What would make you ask me that?<eos> You seem a little wobbly.<eos> Are you having one of your massive periods? No.<eos> No.<eos> What people don't tell you is that... you lose your children.
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.<eos> You can't just make unilateral decisions about everybody else, like you're the little dictator.<eos> I am just driving to a meeting.<eos> I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.<eos> I know everything about you... What scares you, what you want, what you Google.
I know you.<eos> I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry... Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.<eos> Well, who asked you to take care of me?
Well speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna<eos> - have a pretty big fight. - No.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> Someone hurt Amabella.<eos> Could you maybe point to the boy who hurt you. Him.
I'm just saying that distributing the invitations in the classroom to the exception of one person... I mean, it's just unacceptable.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> This looks delicious.<eos> Abby, are you dating the fridge?<eos> Chloe, I set up a standing playdate with you and Ziggy on Thursdays.
She wrote you a prescription without calling me? Not her.<eos> I went to Planned Parenthood.<eos> Please don't make a big deal about this.<eos> I'm not sexually active, okay?<eos> Who took you there?
So, she has it.<eos> The diary.<eos> That much at least we do know.<eos> Sorry, who has it?<eos> You know, those things are really bad for you.
Couldn't possibly comment.<eos> Maybe I need to improve my taste in wine.<eos> Or your taste in sex.<eos> Speaking of which, are we going to address the fact that almost everything you've told me in the last few days, you've told me for the very first time?<eos> I've never told you about all this stuff because it wasn't important.
Maybe I need to improve my taste in wine.<eos> Or your taste in sex.<eos> Speaking of which, are we going to address the fact that almost everything you've told me in the last few days, you've told me for the very first time?<eos> I've never told you about all this stuff because it wasn't important.<eos> In all the years that we were together, Mr. Webster, it has never occurred to you that it might be important to tell me about your former love?
Seems to me you're a hairsbreadth away from a restraining order.<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You wanted to hear her say how wonderful you are and how you haven't changed.<eos> And how she's thought of you all these years, and looked up at the stars and wondered...
Thank you for telling me the fucking truth.<eos> Yeah, you live long enough and you lose faith in people.<eos> Not that I ever had much faith in anyone. But... you have impressed me, David.<eos> Starting to wish Bill Jr.<eos> Could've turned out more like you.
Dramatic Interpretation...<eos> Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<eos> Group Interpretation...<eos> I have something worse than stomach cancer, and you gave it to me!<eos> The only thing I gave you was love.
Any suggestions?<eos> They tell me not to write about the mayor, I don't.<eos> I don't write about you and Healy, either.<eos> I give in to everyone, and where does it get me?<eos> Who told you about me and Healy?
I shouldn't then.<eos> I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?<eos> Yeah, alcohol dries out the chords.<eos> You know... someone who looks a lot like you, was checking out the family planning center, across from the pizza shop I work at last week.
They can arrest me.<eos> I'm using their stage for my needs, not theirs, my terms.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I mean, somebody send you to spy on me?
Your sister wants to see you.
There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.
Not to reunite sentimental teenagers.<eos> You wanted us to know about Stiles.<eos> And Canaan.<eos> You were warning us.<eos> This is where we found you.
What does that mean?<eos> I think we have to treat this more like actual hypnosis.<eos> They use images to guide you through memories.<eos> Like, a stairwell.<eos> The steps take you down through one year of your life to the next.
Just hanging out with my dead sister?<eos> Having a good time catching up on childhood memories?<eos> I think you were rotting down there.<eos> Liam finally gets one thing right.<eos> I also think whatever happened to you, you deserved it.
Can you see the books?<eos> I see them.<eos> Concentrate on them.<eos> The books on the shelves are your memories.<eos> Everything that's ever happened to you.
Shh. Stiles.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I read once that holding your breath could stop a panic attack.<eos> So when I kissed you, um, you held your breath.
You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't, I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.<eos> Just remember, remember I love you.
- Stiles...<eos> I'll hold them back. Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> When I kissed you...
I'll hold them back. Now get the hell out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you...
Go.<eos> Go!<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you...<eos> When I kissed you!
Turns out, I wasn't his only victim.<eos> The man I've been chasing for two years was your fiancé.<eos> His real name is Benjamin Jones.<eos> I was going to tell you everything.<eos> What we had was real, and I love you.
So you can let her go and take me.<eos> Did you sleep?<eos> Nope.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I knew I was gonna see you this morning.
Well, I hired someone.<eos> He's actually a very gifted serial killer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Well, he stabbed you just deep enough for the guards to call the ambulance, but he missed all the major organs.
Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.<eos> To tell me he was breaking out of jail?<eos> I want him to stay in jail.<eos> You're the ones that got him out.<eos> We just need to know if he called you.
We just need to know if he called you.<eos> No. He did not call.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because someone with a shiv found out that he made a deal with the feds.<eos> The United States government is gonna pay you to be a criminal?
Both schoolteachers in Pasadena.<eos> Great.<eos> What did you do for them?<eos> I used to walk their dogs.<eos> - How'd they find you?
Hello?<eos> Mr. And mrs. Kincaid?<eos> Benjamin jones, agent justine diaz.<eos> What would you say if I told you<eos> I could get you out of here tomorrow?
Technicality.<eos> He made a deal.<eos> You know what, enough about us. Let's hear about you.<eos> Yeah, thomas.<eos> What brings you to town?
We'd like to, but... yeah.<eos> We've been through a lot together. That's sweet.<eos> You know what,<eos> That almost makes me miss my big sister.<eos> Although alice will tell you what a vicious, Little sour-faced wrecking ball she is.
I'll find him.<eos> Danny!<eos> We got him.<eos> Alice got him.<eos> We want a name. Who hired you?
This time we're doing it your way.<eos> Yeah, about that... We may need to come up with a different strategy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where you been?<eos> You left me three messages, And then you don't pick up the phone when I call you back?
I have The Hammer, and you will have his full cooperation.<eos> You want us to work with the man who tried to kill us?<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> I thought you said you didn't know who hired you.
I found him.<eos> Albert Ollerman is on a flight to Slovenia that leaves LAX in two hours.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?<eos> Probably best if there's no witnesses when I find him.<eos> Here, Tommy, let me help you with that.
I'm going to offer to drive Kohana home, since she's drunk and may confess who knows what into my phone.<eos> - Well-done.<eos> Did you see Kohana's face when she saw the fugu?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Almost as good as the look on your face when she groped you under the table.
- I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?<eos> Karen.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She wouldn't have written you if she didn't want you to know her.
They formed a wall around Emerald City to keep The Beast Forever from flooding our entire world.<eos> Yeah, definitely not Kansas.<eos> Mistress of the Western Fields.<eos> Vessel of Truth and Solace.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
Help me.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't feel my arms.<eos> You have a deep wound here.<eos> What happened to you?
- What's that?<eos> All the time. In everything.<eos> From the minute they are born into the world, the world tries to take them right back.<eos> Well, you can't protect him forever.<eos> Did your mother protect you?
Out of my way.<eos> Get off of me! Out of my way.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing you need to worry for.<eos> You let him do this to you.
Out of my way.<eos> Get off of me! Out of my way.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing you need to worry for.<eos> You let him do this to you.
Previously on "Emerald City"...<eos> Help me.<eos> - What happened to you?
Know what?<eos> Your mother worked here.<eos> Before you were born.<eos> And after.<eos> But she wanted a better life for you, so she gave you up, sent you far, far away.
Be safe.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, if we don't find your parents, I'll bring you right back to him.
Anything amiss at all?<eos> No, no, I ain't seen anything.<eos> Nothing unusual we've seen.<eos> Seen nothing.<eos> You shoot that, and everyone will mark you for a witch. Do you understand?
My God.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Sylvie?<eos> Sylvie, come here.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
Give you a new life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I trust her even less than her sister.<eos> Wait.<eos> West wanted you, too?
Build me, then sell me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather hoped you'd want to stay in my care.<eos> Then why are you leaving?<eos> The princess met you... she liked you, and...
I'll clear your name.<eos> Let me come with you.<eos> You have to stay here.<eos> Do not leave the house.<eos> If those men find you, they will finish the job for sure.
Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Tip, I... I helped you when I had nothing to gain.<eos> And I helped you because you asked me to.
I hadn't seen our Eastern sister in years and now she's gone.<eos> Let time not be our enemy, as well.<eos> You hadn't seen her in years?<eos> Why?<eos> Did the girl tell you differently?
Cut them down like they were nothing.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If you don't believe me, look on your left side.<eos> That's where I stabbed you before you went down.
Tip.<eos> And how do you know my Jack?<eos> We grew up together.<eos> We were best friends.<eos> Is this the one who killed you?
I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> Children can't be corrected if they don't know what they've done wrong.<eos> Show her.<eos> Show her what she did to you.
I can't break it.<eos> But I can work around it.<eos> How?<eos> If I had a conduit.<eos> Someone close to you, someone special... to slip past your defenses.
The tunnel in Nimbo would have brought them to Glinda.<eos> You are sworn to her, as am I.<eos> He works for Glinda?<eos> You know me?<eos> There is a wagon in the load-out that'll take you north to Calcedon, Glinda's castle... she's ordered me to free you.
I'm not on anyone's side.<eos> Well, then you better choose.<eos> War is coming to Oz.<eos> It's late to be wandering.<eos> The Wizard told you I'm his guest. I can leave when I want.
Why else but to hide you? To protect you.<eos> Everyone keeps telling me who and what I am.<eos> When do I get to decide?<eos> You are the only child of Samuel and Katherine Pastoria.<eos> Your parents loved you and kept you safe till the day they died.
Falling in love.<eos> I broke my oath of celibacy to the High Council.<eos> I hid it long enough that now she doesn't know what to do with me.<eos> Others weren't as lucky.<eos> Glinda spared you because of your child.
Like every young woman, a witch cannot harness the whole of her powers until she comes of age.<eos> What we asked of these girls was simply beyond their capacity.<eos> But Dorothy, perhaps you can help them.<eos> I'm not a physician.<eos> The Wizard must believe you have some capability, or he wouldn't have put you on me.
Please, Jack, no more politics.<eos> That woman gave her life to you.<eos> All her waking hours. She said no to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You can't just enjoy people when it suits you, use them up and toss them aside.
No.<eos> I might as well put them to good use.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To cut down the wizard.<eos> His soldiers will kill you. They can't!
I could stop a war.<eos> So you didn't do what you were supposed to do up north?<eos> Kill Glinda.<eos> Did you even think I could, or did you just send me there because you thought I'd never come back?<eos> I sent you there to save Oz.
I saw myself in her eyes.<eos> A murderer.<eos> A coward.<eos> This is yours by right.<eos> You think that will save you?
Sylvie, look at me.<eos> Sylvie, please.<eos> Sylvie, you don't have to do this.<eos> Sylvie, look at me.<eos> Your spells won't help you now.
There is no fight left in Emerald City.<eos> The true fight still comes for all of us.<eos> I brought our kind back from the dead.<eos> And I will take back what belongs to us.<eos> Emerald City does not belong to you.
Well, that's a very good question.<eos> I assume he saw value in the tall tales told about me after that night in the tavern.<eos> Saw mystery in it, perhaps.<eos> Use my name upon which to build his story.<eos> And this bothers you why?
He doesn't know why it is.<eos> But it is.<eos> To elevate one of us over the other, even as a fiction, seems to me to be tempting fate in a most dangerous way.<eos> And...<eos> And it upsets you because you believe he is your friend?
Because I believe he is my friend?<eos> Are you questioning whether I'm qualified to have an opinion on that subject?<eos> Did you not once tell me of your worry about the fate of those whom Captain Flint has called friends before you?<eos> A lot has changed since then.<eos> A lot has changed since then, but what has not changed is that when a man first needs you and thereafter calls you a friend, a little suspicion is a healthy thing.
I'll take the evening rounds.<eos> He's in love with you.<eos> Would that be wrong?<eos> I'd hate to see him disappointed.<eos> I told you the first time I saw you.
Wait with the horses.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Where?<eos> I have nowhere to go.<eos> You go to the mission hospital and tell the American nurse Lieutenant Veli sent you.
I was the one who helped you get away, remember?<eos> Who killed Jimmy Dunn?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> - You know too much.<eos> And if the Germans catch you, they'll make sure they know it, too. Hmm.
I didn't know him long enough to really decide.<eos> Both brothers dead...<eos> You knew the Spodes, didn't you?<eos> You met them before the war, when you were writing an article on Professor Frick and his work,<eos> and I assume one of them contacted you with the plan to get the atomic calculations into American hands,
Glad you could trust me for something.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were onto this Spode?<eos> You know damn well why.<eos> You trust that bloody kid Dunn more than you trust me.<eos> And I've known you for 15 years.
If you'd have just called me, we could have rolled this up, without those Nazis terrorising kids in a church, for God's sake!<eos> Do you think that was the last thing I wanted?<eos> Spode's Resistance, and I wasn't sure you wouldn't put your country above a friendship.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.<eos> One thing I will tell you that kid, Dunn he doesn't have the experience to handle a case like this.
Yeah, little Armenian art dealer.<eos> Yeah, Graf von Garin now.<eos> Famous expert on Aryan art.<eos> Sell paintings, art treasures to the Germans... sell for them.<eos> Anyway, he phoned and invited you to some big do tomorrow night.
We'll have to leave through the back.<eos> Dog-walker's passed by three times in the last hour.<eos> God.<eos> Er, I think that might be down to me.<eos> How long have they been watching you?
How bad is it?<eos> It looks worse than it is.<eos> I'm sorry about...<eos> How did you get in?<eos> Did the block warden see you?
The idea that my mom should be nice to bonnie Or that my father should care?<eos> Okay, guess we know where you stand.<eos> what's wrong with mom?<eos> Nothing.<eos> She doesn't seem a bit agitated to you lately?
I-i--<eos> I left my family.<eos> I left my friends.<eos> I moved here for you.<eos> You honestly think i don't love you?
What is his name?<eos> Just write it down!<eos> I don't know. You know that.<eos> I've told you this story so many times.<eos> You know he would've loved you, but...
I love you more.<eos> I said it first.<eos> I mean it more.<eos> I love you more than all of those stars combined.<eos> I love you more than infinity times infinity.
What's the big problem, hmm?<eos> Why is it such a big deal for you?<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm just looking out for you, Sparkles.<eos> If you go to pieces again, who's gonna put you back together?
I don't always know the right thing to say.<eos> - But I certainly don't judge you.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's actually really weird.<eos> Ever since I told you about Ziggy's dad, it's like this thing that's been happening to my body.
This is assault.<eos> He assaulted you.<eos> - I mean, I might've kissed him back. - What?<eos> It was like a reflex, you know?<eos> Somebody kisses you, you kiss them back.
That said, it didn't happen in a vacuum.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know what I mean, Madeline. Come on.<eos> What happened a year ago was an accident.<eos> I told you that was a mistake that's not gonna be repeated again.
Target practice.<eos> I try to go once a month.<eos> You were doing target practice?<eos> You seem suspicious.<eos> Well, we're going on a road trip to go meet the person that assaulted you, and you're doing target practice?
Your own armed forces?<eos> We've learnt from the best, sir.<eos> I have chosen you, not because of your vast experience, but because The Honourable Pamela Mountbatten is 18 and might appreciate your youth.<eos> But what about my duties here?<eos> This is an honour I am giving you.
- so that when we leave...<eos> - That is not why we're here.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You'll wear yourself out.<eos> You mean I'll wear you out.
It's good to meet you again, Jeet Kumar.<eos> Remember, you used to read me Dickens?<eos> Yes, sir. David Copperfield,<eos> Bleak House.<eos> What brings you to Delhi?
My daughter too is still unmarried but her young man, Asif, will soon be back.<eos> He has been in Europe all this time, fighting in the British army.<eos> As soon as he returns we will have the wedding.<eos> This is Aalia's poor mother's dying wish.<eos> She chose you a good man.
Is that what you imagine?<eos> It's not my place to imagine.<eos> You have used me and my family.<eos> You came here to serve your king and country and you've done so admirably.<eos> I hear they're promoting you from Viscount to Earl.
Sir, please stay in your seat. - Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened.<eos> Sir!<eos> What was that about?<eos> That cute guy sitting right next to us... It turns out he's a total head case.<eos> And he was telling me about a movie that's supposed to kill you.
That cute guy sitting right next to us... It turns out he's a total head case.<eos> And he was telling me about a movie that's supposed to kill you.<eos> What movie?<eos> Some video.<eos> A chick calls you on the phone after you watch it and says, "Seven days," which was, like, right now.
No!<eos> I...<eos> - Miss, the seat belt light is on.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> What is going on with you?
No clothes gone.<eos> No note.<eos> Just vanished.<eos> The priest.<eos> He kept you down here.
You're not good at phonetic Scrabble.<eos> Because it doesn't make any sense.<eos> You're the one who always wants to play.<eos> It was your dad's favorite game.<eos> Did he beat you, too?
I brought you some of your things.<eos> I'm only taking it because I want you to leave.<eos> Right after your dad and your brother died, you got so sick.<eos> You wouldn't breathe right.<eos> And I took you to the emergency room, where we had to stay for three days, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with you.
And by the way, did I mention the bonuses?<eos> Outstanding benefits.<eos> I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the fuck a pension is.<eos> Hell, by the end of your tenure, you could be the next king of America.<eos> And I told you, I got a job.
So what, you're from Ireland?<eos> I told you I'm a leprechaun.<eos> We don't come from Moscow, Russia.<eos> Or Moscow, Idaho, for that matter.<eos> How much has our man told you?
Sounds like a lot of work to me.<eos> It's easier just to pluck them out of the air.<eos> Simplest trick in the world.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> Tell you what. I'll fight you for it.
Now I'll tell you this once and once only ever.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> Did you escape, or did they, they let you out?
They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.
I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.<eos> Robbie did his best to avoid looking at me.<eos> Get used to the boot, puppy.<eos> There is no closure from the dead.<eos> Maybe, you know, three years from now, some therapist will tell you, to write her a letter saying everything you wish you could say to her and drop it in the ocean.
What is it Wednesday is up to?<eos> We barely exchanged a dozen words.<eos> But you can let me out here and then I'll walk the rest of the way.<eos> You're saying that you don't know?<eos> Telling you I don't know.
You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?<eos> Spill blood together, that binds you to him for life.
I can't be bothered, so don't you go bothering me about it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> That's a sweet name.<eos> Now, now, now, now. Leave him be.<eos> Why do they call you Shadow, sweetness?
I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means.<eos> Same every spring. You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.<eos> What has gotten into you?
Oh, I teach dirty English.<eos> Well, they will be impressed to know that you tutored at a university.<eos> Why do you say "tutor"?<eos> You know very well that I was a junior professor at the Leipzig University History Department.<eos> OK, well, unlike you, my parents don't ask awkward questions, and they have manners, and they will love you.
I'm only telling you that because he is definitely going to want to talk to you about that... and it will definitely fucking suck.<eos> But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.<eos> They are not racist.<eos> I would have told you.<eos> I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. Think about that for just two seconds.
When?<eos> I went out for, I went out for some air last night and I run into her... and I can barely remember any of it but now the thought of a cigarette makes me want to throw up.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I'm Sorry.<eos> I can't believe she did that to you.
Apparently our common understanding of the process ... has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.<eos> You could give a shit, right?<eos> Okay, just let me just tell you what it is?<eos> Phase one was the hypnotism.<eos> That's how they sedate you.
Now they hold a smaller screen on their lap or in the palm of their hand so they don't get bored watching the big one.<eos> Time and attention, better than lamb's blood.<eos> They beat your pretty face all up.<eos> I hate that.<eos> I hate that they were hurting you, Shadow.
They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.<eos> We're done.<eos> Whatever the old guys are giving you, I can give you so much more.
This is so fucking crazy.<eos> - And like the rest of your life is sane?<eos> - Lucy talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's ever happened to me.<eos> So far.<eos> At times the universe does seem to have singled you out for unique abuse.
Would I rather be ignored?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, yes, ignore me.<eos> Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.
Just a few moments of your time, while my man here helps the ladies prepare a delicious meal I'm sure.<eos> For old times' sake.<eos> Make dinner first.<eos> - I'd be happy to help.<eos> - I murder you first.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hey, man, relax.<eos> Hey! Hey, hey, dude, relax.<eos> Morpheus.<eos> Look, this dude, Morpheus, he stitched you up, man.
Hey, hey.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> He's a clown!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe there was a reason we found you.
I don't know.<eos> Some rich dude from Beverly Hills.<eos> Couldn't find his way home.<eos> Really?<eos> It seemed like he knew you.
Open the fuckin' door, Kayla.<eos> She can hardly walk.<eos> Let's do a third fight.<eos> Just get back in, dude.<eos> Make money with the gift that God gave you.
I'm not settled down.<eos> It sounds like you are.<eos> Nate, he gave you a key.<eos> Dad doesn't even know yet.<eos> Is Will pushing you to come out?
So, your... your top fighter asked me to train.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You're not supposed to train him.<eos> He asked me.<eos> And then he played you against Alvey and got Alvey's attention.
Keith?<eos> Hey, man, where have you been, dude?<eos> I thought you fucking killed yourself, dude.<eos> Dude.<eos> What the fuck happened to you?
Hey, I got you, man.<eos> I got you, buddy, okay?<eos> You wanna stop somewhere to eat?<eos> Get a burger?<eos> [Scoffs] Keith, they're not gonna put you to sleep, dude.
Look at you!<eos> - This guy bugging you?<eos> - Hey, it's the head of the department.<eos> - I can handle him.<eos> - Oh, I know you can. That's why I stole you from the Disabilities Office.
Uh... it's Bay actually on Emmett's phone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I totally deserve that.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Look, I just wanted to make sure that... you knew what was going on with Emmett. I... I don't know if anyone called you.
(sighs) I have no idea why they gave me this job.<eos> They gave you the job because you are incredible at getting people to do what you want... including writing very large checks.<eos> I'm feeling in over my head, John, and I need your support.<eos> - All right?<eos> - Yeah. I supported you for decades.
Sure.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Do you know how worried everyone is about you?<eos> Did you take anything?<eos> Nobody hates you.
Go to the...?<eos> I would rather stick my dick in a wood chipper - than go to another fucking funeral.<eos> - Got it.<eos> You know, I'm not as stupid as you might think.<eos> When you called the other day and I told you that Dad had built something new... after that conversation... suddenly you wanted to come home.
I guess I'm good at seeing what makes somebody tick.<eos> Understanding who they really are.<eos> Weakness?<eos> I'm able to understand them, but I'm not able to care about them.<eos> If somebody mentions "subconscious" to you, what do you think?
I was told that I demonstrated an early ability to recognize spatial patterns, whatever that means.<eos> I always took it as one of those things a teacher tells to a parent to make them feel better about their shitty kid.<eos> Like, "Gordon is very good at drawing circles.<eos> Gordon draws circles at a more advanced level than the other children."<eos> These bunk beds really worked out well, 'cause they spared me the awkwardness of having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.
To get there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> They didn't want me to come.<eos> Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?
What's the point?<eos> "Why is he doing it?"<eos> "Why is he doing it?"<eos> Let's see.<eos> Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.
We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.<eos> So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.<eos> Will, why are we back here?<eos> I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...<eos> Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
I died.<eos> And then you came back here.<eos> How long have I been stuck living in this loop?<eos> How many times have we met on this ferry?<eos> Your death brings you back here.
Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> - That too fast?<eos> - No. Row.<eos> I don't know what my brother told you, but, we're not looking for card players.
You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day.<eos> Said "Whatever happened to that guy" "who was around before Brendon?"<eos> Couldn't remember your name.<eos> Maybe because she hasn't seen you in five years.
Stayed there till about 1. Slept in the truck a few hours.<eos> At least I assume he... he slept. I know I did.<eos> Uh, a little before dawn, he goes into a house, into a house, meets with a woman for a bed.<eos> Heads back to the party.<eos> He clocked you?
The cheat and the whale have what, a shoot-out?<eos> That's it?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Yeah. How do you get the money, though?<eos> The cops come in, they arrest you, and... and before you figured it out, we... - Ah. - ... we get away.
Do the nose.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not sticking up for you earlier with Audrey.
Explain yourself!<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> Where did the dirt come from, Dicky?<eos> Well, on my way to school, I slipped and fell over.<eos> Don't your mom or dad bring you to school?
We're good friends.<eos> The turd wasn't important.<eos> I've seen it all before.<eos> Let's just forget it ever happened. Okay?<eos> In fact, I love you very much.
It isn't always, but... we three, we can be there for each other!<eos> That's all.<eos> Mrs. Antilly, I'm sure Hillary is awesome, but...<eos> If we're gonna be great friends, you should know my name is Hannah.<eos> - What did I call you?
Duran?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.
How many students do you have, Pam?<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - Over 200.<eos> I have 600 on the advisory list. That's not...<eos> That shit'll kill you, you know.
- But I am.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> Alex did this on his own.<eos> He just broke up with me on his own.<eos> I didn't know he broke up with you.
It's hard.<eos> To listen.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> It's tapes from a dead girl.<eos> Doesn't this affect you at all?
Don't you have a concert?<eos> I did, yeah, but... actually, I quit jazz band.<eos> It's just pointless.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Your boyfriend's waiting for you.
Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm tired of it all anyway.<eos> - Clay.<eos> - Oh, it speaks!<eos> Clay, those guys are using you.
Yes. Clay Jensen.<eos> You do look familiar, though.<eos> You two worked together?<eos> Right. At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.
Okay, your turn.<eos> I dare you to take off your bra.<eos> Under your shirt.<eos> Relax.<eos> I dare you to take off your shirt.
We are friends.<eos> I mean, it seemed like we were.<eos> Whatever you're going through now, you don't have to do it alone.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said... I know what it feels like to have people judge you.
Whatever you're going through now, you don't have to do it alone.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Like you said... I know what it feels like to have people judge you.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
We talked about this when you forced me to come tonight.<eos> Nobody can dance.<eos> Look.<eos> When people can dance at a dance, nobody likes 'em.<eos> I didn't force you to come.
She's hot. You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> What, my intel's no good?<eos> - No, it's no good.<eos> - See, I think it is.<eos> 'Cause she confirmed that not only did Justin finger you, but that you went down on him.
We can't only blame ourselves... or be looking for signs everywhere.<eos> Maybe we should be blaming ourselves.<eos> I mean, if we weren't so preoccupied with the fucking store.<eos> - The store's how we survive.<eos> - No, no, no. The store was to get you out of that company that was killing you to get us out of that shitty suburban wasteland.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.<eos> It's a little creepy, don't you think?<eos> You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you?<eos> You know what, that movie theater job...<eos> I don't think it's healthy for you.
What do you mean, nothing?<eos> He said you'd been following him.<eos> He's just a little out of his head lately.<eos> Too much caffeine.<eos> That's the kid who keeps texting you?
- Okay!<eos> Just be quiet, all right?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was just...<eos> I looked for you after practice.
Relax.<eos> - Come on, Jess.<eos> - Jess.<eos> - Relax, it's fine.<eos> Jess, what the fuck is going on with you?
Seriously, Pratters?<eos> Jesus!<eos> I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then... you know, don't be fat.<eos> Mr. Pratters!<eos> Pratter's, that's like someone saying to you,
Leave me alone!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This shit that happens to you... I think some of it you bring on yourself.
You get back here, young man!<eos> Zachy!<eos> Poor Zach!<eos> Yo, Zachy!<eos> You said something stupid, Zach... and I yelled at you.
They put them up because she killed herself.<eos> And why did she do it?<eos> Because the kids here treated her like shit! Jensen, that's enough.<eos> But no one wants to admit it, so they paint over the bathrooms and put up a memorial, because that's the kind of school that this is.<eos> Everyone is just so nice until they drive you to kill yourself.
I thought you had poetry workshop tonight.<eos> Didn't go.<eos> Never going back.<eos> And we need to move.<eos> Four hundred and thirty a month, and that's before the false alarms, which they charge you for, even though it's their fault.
I don't like it. We have to find another way to save.<eos> Well, maybe we can get Hannah to pitch in...<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hey.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you.
You want to ask me a legal question now?<eos> Really?<eos> I just...<eos> If someone hurt someone... but the victim won't come forward...<eos> Clay, who's hurting you?
Yes, you fucking asshole, I want my bike.<eos> It's out back, behind the building.<eos> Go knock yourself out.<eos> Did you find him?<eos> I drove around for an hour since I called you.
Let's see who can break it first.<eos> Like, break the light bulb?<eos> What are you, six?<eos> It's just a stupid light bulb.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Why aren't you?<eos> Cut it the fuck out.<eos> - Throw it back.<eos> - Jess, stop.<eos> Jess, what is happening with you?
Let's talk to him.<eos> You and me.<eos> The other kids want to bring him down, but we could talk to him.<eos> He might listen to us.<eos> Sheri, is this freak bothering you?
Kind of.<eos> But it's strictly coincidental.<eos> If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh. So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...
You think you could have changed anything?<eos> What does that make you?<eos> God?<eos> I should have stayed with Hannah.<eos> She told you to go.
I didn't believe it.<eos> I was angry for a minute because... because I was jealous of Justin.<eos> And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.<eos> And I was an asshole, and I'm sorry.<eos> And I can never make it right, I can never say all this to you, but... I love you.
So I'll have to testify.<eos> It's really just an interview.<eos> And I'll prepare you.<eos> Coach me on what to say?<eos> Prepare you for what kind of questions they'll be asking.
It's... probably for me, don't you think?<eos> Morning.<eos> Are you the parent or guardian of Clay Jensen?<eos> I just don't get why they're calling you to testify.<eos> Did Hannah ever say anything to you about bullying or anything?
- I'm just eating breakfast.<eos> - You disappeared again.<eos> There are consequences when you disappear.<eos> I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake. I was at a friend's house.<eos> A friend who beat you senseless?
Why did she make that choice?<eos> We can't know that for sure.<eos> What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.<eos> Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you... but did anything happen that night that you regret?
I understand what that must've felt like.<eos> You asked me once what I would do, what I would sacrifice if it meant having Thomas back again.<eos> I honestly don't know... what I would've done.<eos> I honestly couldn't say I wouldn't have done what you did.<eos> I told you I'd see you through this.
Though, the thought had crossed my mind.<eos> No, I'm quite certain I can do better than that.<eos> FLINT: Time is of the essence for what happens next.<eos> Take the better part of a day, maybe two, to secure the chest.<eos> Captain Rackham will ferry you back to the camp aboard the Lion to relay the news.
- Would you love me more if I dressed like her?<eos> - Babe, don't be ridiculous.<eos> Of course I would.<eos> - I knew you had a crush on her.<eos> - Yeah, but then I met you and I found true love.
I had to to stop him.<eos> To escape him, I had to kill my boyfriend.<eos> Just before he died, his eyes, they changed back.<eos> The doctor was gone.<eos> - Spirit of the past, we beseech you.
- The doctor did, not Michael.<eos> - They are the same thing now and he wants me dead.<eos> I don't wanna die, Carl.<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake, get me a bucket.<eos> It's not the first time he's cheated on you, is it?
Now all they had to do was let me finish what I started 65 years ago.<eos> - No, please don't.<eos> I'm not Sara; She's not in me anymore.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> - She's in you whether she's controlling you or not.
OK, thanks, Fran.<eos> Hi. I'm looking for Nathan.<eos> Yep, that's me.<eos> Right. Blimey.<eos> Last time I saw you, you just weed your pants all over my sofa.
Thanks for your time.<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> Oh, I blew a few candles out.<eos> Get a life, Elise. Come on!<eos> Which I asked you not to do because she said she wanted to do it herself.
It doesn't matter, I can't talk.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> I saw you yesterday, in the supermarket.<eos> Have you followed us?<eos> I can guess what he said to you, that bloke, so I don't blame you for what you did.
Maybe I'll see you again.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Heel-toe, heel-toe out here.<eos> Bend at your knees. You want to keep quiet.<eos> I heard you from a mile away.
I did what I did because I didn't want you to die.<eos> But now you've killed, and you've become everything you didn't want to be, and it's my fault.<eos> You were better than me.<eos> Most people are.<eos> I let Daryl go because he reminded you of who you used to be.
It's better to talk about it when we get back, Your Majesty.<eos> We'll talk about it now.<eos> How's the kid?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Start walking back now before I kill you.
- Right?<eos> If you're having problems of that nature... come to see me.<eos> Anytime.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> I'll arrange it so that you just tell the guard who you are... Mm-hmm. ...and he'll let you right in.
Do you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I can forgive that.<eos> Last night was kind of a shitstorm.<eos> I was the guy that gave the rope to the guys that tied you up.
Whatever you decide, so it shall be.<eos> No pressure.<eos> And, again, I am sorry you had to see that, even though I know you have seen some things.<eos> I just want you to understand... we are not monsters.<eos> What did they do to you?
I just want you to put that in your brain and roll it around for a minute.<eos> I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here, she's gonna take your hands.<eos> You can do it right in front of me.<eos> You can take my hands.<eos> I told you already... I'm gonna kill you.
The decision was made a long time ago, before any of us knew each other, when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street before the world ended.<eos> And now we mean everything to each other.<eos> You were in trouble.<eos> You were trapped.<eos> Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.
I'm just fluid.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> - All right.<eos> But, for real, think about what I said because I know you got another fight in you.
I love Lisa, okay?<eos> She does a great job for you, but she's a manager.<eos> Sometimes they cloud the message.<eos> I want you to know exactly... exactly how important you are to this promotion, okay?<eos> Please. It's a gift from me to you, no strings.
Big plates.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hello, uh, Andy.<eos> - Jay Kulina. - What do you want?<eos> I've been calling you for several days.
Fuck.<eos> Dude, I just spent 45 minutes trying to convince him not to file a police report.<eos> Police report?<eos> Yeah. He provoked me.<eos> - Wait. He provoked you?
It's fucking cold.<eos> What do I want to go back there for?<eos> - Yeah, freeze your fucking balls off. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, Lisa... she told you that I'm gonna fight again? Mm-hmm.
I don't remember the name, but, um, we'll start you at $2 a minute.<eos> And if you bring in more guys, you can charge whatever you want.<eos> - Just got to get them hooked?<eos> - Yeah. Now, rember, you run the show.<eos> If some guy asks you to do something and you don't feel comfortable, you cut them off.
All right, did you like him more or less than the others?<eos> I liked him more or less. You're killing me.<eos> What the fuck do you want?<eos> I spoke to him for 10 minutes.<eos> - What do you want me to tell you?
Mentally.<eos> Mentally, I'm on a tropical island with a beautiful woman and not having to answer your stupid questions.<eos> I mean, what the fuck does that even mean?<eos> It's fair to say you had a mercurial reputation as a fighter.<eos> Before you arrived, Matt called you a head case.
That'd be corny as fuck, Ryan, and it's a lie.<eos> I don't even care if you fight me, man.<eos> Just get back in, dude.<eos> Just fucking get back in, man. Come on.<eos> Make money with the gift that God gave you.
You guys can call me, Dom.<eos> I'm... new to Los Angeles.<eos> Ryan, was kind enough to invite me here.<eos> We're blessed to have you, brother.<eos> What vice does the devil tempt you with?
- All right, cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Dom.<eos> Hey, why is... why is Lisa calling you back to the gym?
Um, it's a, it's a TV show about... World War II nurses at a Nazi hospital, but they're spying for the Americans,<eos> And everybody's fucking each other.<eos> Lot of costumes.<eos> Lot of costumes.<eos> But, um, I spoke to the producer. I told him that you were an actress, and he said that he'd keep you in mind. So, you know, who knows where that could go?
And if it's picked up nationally, then it would be amazing for your brand.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't feel bad about this.<eos> It was a home invasion with some piece of shit criminal who would've probably killed you if he had the chance.
- What did you see?<eos> - II saw opportunity, you know, when we exchanged, the kicks.<eos> And... and he caught mine.<eos> I thought I was in trouble, and I was able to get that elbow out there and... and finish him.<eos> Well, you came out pretty wild in the first round. What did your father say to you in the corner?
- Pleasure to meet you, Lisa.<eos> - You, too.<eos> So have you thought about what you're gonna do?<eos> About what?<eos> About the guy calling you a faggot at the fight.
You've been keeping track of that shit, yeah?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Okay. I wanna see their social media, too. And...<eos> [Cellphone rings, stops]<eos> Who's calling you?
There's no fucking plan!<eos> - You're a fucking head case!<eos> - Hang on! You gave me a bunch of fucking generic shit, bro.<eos> You're a fucking head case,<eos> - My son beat the shit out of you!
With Khalis Capital.<eos> We're the guys that bought King Beast.<eos> Look, my bosses, they weren't happy with the fee you negotiated for your fighter, Alvey.<eos> So have you thought about what you're gonna do?<eos> About the guy calling you a faggot at the fight.
I wanna go home.<eos> You're on a 72-hour hold, Mom.<eos> Can't you sign me out?<eos> You need to be here.<eos> You need to let these doctors help you.
Actually, you were explicitly told to leave him the fuck alone.<eos> The kid comes up to me like I'm his fucking shrink.<eos> I don't... I don't understand what am I supposed to do.<eos> This is your final check.<eos> I paid you for an extra week.
- Is that good?<eos> - It's terrible.<eos> [Laughs] Give me a piece of your fucking pizza.<eos> - That's so much better.<eos> Did she say anything to you?
Kayla:<eos> My boys eat a lot of oatmeal.<eos> Can I ask you a question, and you'll tell me the truth?<eos> Why don't people like me?<eos> They do. All the girls love you.
They do. All the girls love you.<eos> I know they don't.<eos> [Chuckles] I love to make people smile and be fun, and I just feel like I'm always annoying people.<eos> I just feel like people hate me.<eos> - Nobody hates you.
He abandoned us.<eos> Willem Dafoe!<eos> Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.<eos> Don't make my mistake, Summer.<eos> Don't deify the people that leave you.
Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.<eos> He's not bluffing!<eos> R-Rick? Why not shoot through her?<eos> 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol,<eos> My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil.
You... You want a snack?<eos> You... You want my unemployment check?<eos> You can tell the difference?<eos> And you want this one?<eos> But this is actual food, and this would nourish you.
It's really important, so don't break it.<eos> Okay, I may have up here.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Stupid cat.<eos> I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend?<eos> Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb... rat.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Aaaah! I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.<eos> And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
They didn't let me out.<eos> Solen'ya.<eos> Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you children!<eos> Uh, is this not a good time or...?<eos> Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"...
What do you guys think about doing this once a week?<eos> You must be Rick. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've heard a lot about you today.<eos> Your family is crazy about you.<eos> Your daughter holds you in very high regard.
Come on, guys, we're all thinking it. Don't...<eos> Don't make me say it. Oh, okay.<eos> This again.<eos> You know, I could have made you a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like that.<eos> I'm not the one that didn't want you back.
Let's cut to the quick here.<eos> Your last stretch was six and a half for breaking into rich folks' digs and stealing their flat screens.<eos> - Allegedly.<eos> - No moron.<eos> How it works is when they convict you, it turns into a fact.
Just so he can try on a suit.<eos> There's a tailor, he comes to the White House.<eos> Now see, I didn't know that.<eos> Let's focus.<eos> So when you say your parole officer was mean to you before, how did that make you feel?
A model grandpa made me.<eos> Like I said, it's a stupid carving.<eos> Remember when the time we went camping.<eos> So don't forget you're at your dad's this weekend.<eos> He and Dale are gonna take you to the symphony.
Lock the door. Call Donny and tell him to radio the state police. I'm gonna search the rest of the house.<eos> No, no mom!<eos> I gotta, I'm chief.<eos> Like I said lock the door. If you see anyone you lean on the horn okay.<eos> Anybody tries for you, use the pepper spray just like I taught you, it's in the glove.
Israel Hands became jealous of Teach's affection and that it led to a falling out with the captain that was most humiliating.<eos> A degrading beating before all the crews on the beach.<eos> A pistol shot just missing his eye, rendering him a misshapen wretch.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> So, you can understand my confusion, given that Nassau's first king embarrassed you so thoroughly and so publicly, forbade any other crew from having you.
Yes.<eos> I'm glad that you came.<eos> And now... I need you to go.<eos> They say your ship is ready to depart.<eos> The launch awaits you at the jetty.
That said, the strangest thing just happened out by the slave quarters.<eos> The doors were locked... from the inside.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> What?<eos> What did she tell you?
I'm starting to get a little bit worried.<eos> I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> Is Perry there?<eos> Hello?<eos> - I'm just gonna have to call you back, - all right?
- I'm just gonna have to call you back, - all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Night, honey.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me, baby, what bad things have happened to you.
- Exactly.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A lot of parents are probably applauding you right now.
So, the spermatozoa fertilizes the egg.<eos> Women lay eggs?<eos> No, women have eggs inside of them, in their bellies.<eos> So, the sperm fertilize the egg in there, and out of that comes the baby.<eos> So, you wanted a baby and my dad "ferlitized" you?
No, women have eggs inside of them, in their bellies.<eos> So, the sperm fertilize the egg in there, and out of that comes the baby.<eos> So, you wanted a baby and my dad "ferlitized" you?<eos> - Fertilized.<eos> - Fertilized you?
A person has to do something.<eos> Well, this something is not that, honey.<eos> - What about your play?<eos> - What about my play?<eos> You said it spoke to you because it was about finding a purpose in life, which I get.
Are you having your period?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Are you?<eos> Are you trying to be funny?<eos> Trying to be serious. What is going on with you?
Wow.<eos> Now, did I hear something about a loose tooth?<eos> Really?<eos> Show me.<eos> Got a message for you.
It was him and one other.<eos> I had six men.<eos> I thought it would be sufficient to apprehend him myself.<eos> Apprehend him?<eos> No one asked you to apprehend him. All you had to do was report the invitation to meet and let the captain handle it.
Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior?<eos> What?<eos> Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, buried in the likeness of his death and raised in the likeness of his resurrection.
Yes.<eos> Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, buried in the likeness of his death and raised in the likeness of his resurrection.<eos> He is saved.<eos> That didn't count.<eos> Want me to put the air on, dry you out?
Is that from your book?<eos> No, Kevin.<eos> That's Jesus.<eos> - Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.<eos> - I'm not saying you are, but, uh, the beard looks good on you.
I was worried you had forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> Um, a little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?
Do we look like we're about to die?<eos> Do we look like we're senile and can't remember anything?<eos> Where is the car?<eos> I thought you were paying attention.<eos> I told you to take a picture of the space.
I'll do that.<eos> Burt Lurdsman.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is the name.<eos> His name. The sponsor I told you about.
Yeah.<eos> Doll! Come back.<eos> I want you to meet somebody.<eos> Hi. I'm...<eos> This is the genius I was telling you about.
I'll, uh, check that out.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, did you find anything?<eos> About when I called before, asked you to look up that fella, Thaddeus Mobley, lived here in the 1970s? Right.
You know, just shut up. I...<eos> I need to think.<eos> What?<eos> You need it in Braille?<eos> Nobody asked you to come here with your stupid face and your sad eyes.
Ray, I'm a fair man.<eos> I treat people honestly.<eos> - Help 'em when they're down.<eos> - Them you help.<eos> When did I not help you, kid?
He'd been abusing her, you see?<eos> Beating her in places you don't show.<eos> And tonight she'd had enough, so she cut his throat.<eos> And watched him bleed.<eos> Now, the police will contact you tonight to inform you of his death.
Thanks. Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan. - Hmm.<eos> - To new friends.<eos> New friends.<eos> He's dead, in case you couldn't tell.<eos> Lady cop who printed you said you're a little tender.
You don't have to be a mathematician to add two plus two.<eos> No.<eos> Your best bet?<eos> Tearjerker.<eos> What a monster he was. How he beat you every night where it wouldn't show.
You're welcome.<eos> You know, forensics is doing a test on the syringe.<eos> You ask me to place a bet? I think it takes a jury 10 minutes to convict you, nutbag with a syringe or no nutbag with a syringe.<eos> You like pie?<eos> I'm gonna visit you after the holiday, bring you some pie.
I won?<eos> What did I win?<eos> Life.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> Meemo will be over presently to take you home.
Contracts have been signed by the majordomo himself.<eos> So, you see, lives are changing for the better.<eos> And all you have to do is review the accounts, write up the deals, and approve the paperwork.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yuri will show you to your new office.
I mean, we could ask for less...<eos> Are we worth less?<eos> You and me, our value, I'm saying, to the world?<eos> What makes him rich, and us not?<eos> Larceny. Your brother stole from you, your birthright, like the snake in the garden, and then he built this falsehood.
No, no, if you wanna go to the mall, that's...<eos> Lake sounds...<eos> And I know you're not little.<eos> I mean, you're practically all grown up.<eos> Phone's for you, Chief.
There is food, there is roof.<eos> What more do you need?<eos> A court to adore you.<eos> In the old country, you were draped with pearl, loved, feared, waited upon.<eos> Excess suits you.
Still so beautiful.<eos> I thought I told the pretty lies.<eos> You want fortune or you want truth.<eos> Oh, I want knowledge over comfort, over all things, always.<eos> They will kill you this time.
Give me my coin, cunt.<eos> - The coin you gave me? - Witness.<eos> He has a point.<eos> I gave you the wrong coin.<eos> The one I gave you was my lucky coin.
KD, I'm going home.<eos> No.<eos> I won't let you betray him. Pull your head out of the sand.<eos> He dragged you through a pit of evil.<eos> I would be failing you as a pastor... - Shut up!
There's a guy over at UCSF.<eos> His name is Dr. Olonari.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ought to let me get rid of these curls, man.<eos> I think people would take you a lot more serious if you wasn't rockin' the Michael Bolton circa 1986.
You want a pat on the back?<eos> She said I'm gonna have to stew in jail for three days, and you say thank you?<eos> Were you expecting something different out there?<eos> I was expecting you to get the hearing set for today so I could have slept in my own fucking bed.<eos> You're like a piñata. They hit you with a stick, and you still shit candy.
I was expecting you to get the hearing set for today so I could have slept in my own fucking bed.<eos> You're like a piñata. They hit you with a stick, and you still shit candy.<eos> It doesn't matter. You're not getting your bail reinstated.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> They have pictures of you on the Bay Bridge.
God fucking damn it, Moonlight!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have you given any thought to the exposure therapy I told you about?
Do you love Him?<eos> I love Him!<eos> I love God!<eos> May the Lord be with you, Pernell.<eos> Mike, we warned you, but you wanted to keep working.
I love God!<eos> May the Lord be with you, Pernell.<eos> Mike, we warned you, but you wanted to keep working.<eos> How'd the psycho find me?<eos> I think he may have tracked you from here.
So you feel that way, but I'm supposed to believe you're going to help me.<eos> I already did. How do you think your case got called first?<eos> And I can get your bail reinstated.<eos> You want out of here or not?<eos> Who called you?
You're in her office.<eos> He loved her.<eos> What?<eos> These are love letters to Anne Wu.<eos> "I didn't know what I was missing until I met you.
PJ is dead.<eos> That's what we get.<eos> - You gotta stop this.<eos> - Did you stop?<eos> When people asked you to stop, did you stop?
Wanted to make sure you're getting settled in okay.<eos> Yeah, everything's great, just great.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Went by the security office. Grabbed this for you.
If you're trying to be funny right now, it's really not working.<eos> You think God maybe did this because he cares?<eos> My mom just died.<eos> My baby just died.<eos> Yeah, the congregant I told you about is my girlfriend.
This time I told the truth.<eos> I never would have done that if it wasn't for what happened.<eos> - I don't wanna go back to who I was.<eos> Fine.<eos> If it helps you, then remember.
It's a straight shot from the kill site to the dump site.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> I'd take the 580 to the 4, get off on Maricopa.<eos> You would?<eos> Even with the little express lane camera snapping shots of you every 2 miles?
My dad bought me a set of water wings, and he said that they were magic.<eos> And... that was it. I was in the water all summer.<eos> PJ would have called that a hack.<eos> You're right.<eos> But how does it help you with the...
What else?<eos> You had that look in your eye.<eos> Crys, I swear I'm not having any visions.<eos> I need Anne's keys.<eos> You know what that poison does to you, Dad, don't you?
You fucking hustler!<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> Now you want to sell me out?<eos> I ruined your life?<eos> I brought you to the Lord.
Me versus McCauley on the likeability scale, no contest.<eos> I'm not making guarantees, but shit, I have pulled off miracles before.<eos> But then... there's you.<eos> I've heard all this before.<eos> I'm going to be dancing around sketchy DNA, poking holes in witness testimony, but the jurors aren't going to care because they're going to be looking at you and thinking about the video where you punched a preacher in the face.
Hold on.<eos> Crystal, what are you doing here?<eos> Pernell is following me around like a lost puppy.<eos> I just needed a break from everything.<eos> This might cheer you up.
It's different words, but it's the s...<eos> Okay, enough of the bullcrap.<eos> You've been wanting that gibberish to make sense from the start.<eos> Why, I don't know.<eos> Maybe your mom is, guilt tripping you.
My God.<eos> Pernell.<eos> It's time.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You said they didn't know if they were after you?
- I'm just saying that God's ways are mysterious... Sometimes.<eos> But Pernell's aren't.<eos> I don't care if he starts walking on water. I don't want him here.<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> Sorry I called you so late.
I heard everything.<eos> Now I feel like he's always right outside the door... and he's waiting for me, and I don't know what to do.<eos> First thing you're gonna do is get some sleep.<eos> There's nobody outside that door.<eos> Nobody's going to hurt you, not while I'm here.
- Dear Lord.<eos> - Do you see now?<eos> That video is what set me free.<eos> And I would never have found it if God wasn't directing me.<eos> How could this exonerate you?
His name was Lucky.<eos> When I pulled his strings, I felt no fear.<eos> In here, preacher boy.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I'm the one who brought you here.
- Really?<eos> That's funny because I just left the halfway house where you were supposed to live, and they told me they have not seen - your ass for a week.<eos> - No, that's bullshit.<eos> You remember when you first came to my office?<eos> I asked you, "Do you want to be an eagle", or do you want to be a shit bird?"
As long as you're here, you're a guest, and being a guest comes with responsibilities.<eos> First off, don't fuck with my stuff.<eos> You get curious about something, you ask me.<eos> Second, I don't disrupt my routine unless Vince says so.<eos> If that inconveniences you, that's too damn bad.
What... For what?<eos> Can we just go to the fucking train station?<eos> - Okay! Okay! Fine!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How many times has this happened to you? Spending way too much time in the kitchen looking for the perfect pan to solve your cooking problems.
You have my word. For what that's worth.<eos> I should have shot you the other day.<eos> He said you were an intruder.<eos> I understand.<eos> Listen. You remember the address that Audrey gave you on the phone this morning?
There's already a lot more do-gooders than we expected.<eos> -Next will be the looters.<eos> -Then get rid of them. I'll sacrifice what's left of my credibility for a few short-term trinkets.<eos> Sadavir.<eos> You're witnessing a discovery that could rewrite the story of humankind, but your imagination takes you as far as putting the boot heel to your former colony.
I had nothing against him. I thought he was a decent guy.<eos> -Decent guy? -Yeah.<eos> Do you think you would've got off Eros without him?<eos> -No.<eos> -Ah. But he wasn't a good enough friend to wait for you.
After you met him... you changed.<eos> Moshe opened my eyes to the false life that mother and father had us living...<eos> Exchanging Christmas presents with the neighbors, doing everything we could not to offend anyone with our Jewishness.<eos> Moshe made me proud to be a Jew.<eos> He turned you against your family.
Moshe opened my eyes to the false life that mother and father had us living...<eos> Exchanging Christmas presents with the neighbors, doing everything we could not to offend anyone with our Jewishness.<eos> Moshe made me proud to be a Jew.<eos> He turned you against your family.<eos> He brought you to live in a place that's not yours, where you don't belong.
This land was promised to Abraham.<eos> Yes.<eos> Promise.<eos> A covenant with God made thousands of years ago.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as a form of insanity?
I saw a video of you on YouTube, gettin' gassed in the shower.<eos> - I haven't seen it.<eos> - Yeah, you lived it, I guess. You wanna sit?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Hey, man, if I knew who you was, I never would've knocked you out.
Of course.<eos> But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.<eos> They poisoned you...
We have no comment at this time.<eos> Sekou, what were the terms of your release?<eos> What do you say to your social media profile? Did you provide names of other radicals?<eos> Does your family know you're free?<eos> Sekou, is it true your father radicalized you?
Mr. Hashem, you haven't eaten a thing. Here.<eos> Don't mind if I do.<eos> So Simone told me you got me my job back.<eos> - Yeah, we did. - That's awesome. Thank you.<eos> Well, your boss is expecting you tomorrow morning, bright and early.
Sorry.<eos> I just wanted some fresh air.<eos> Don't lie to me, Saul.<eos> I couldn't sleep either.<eos> I saw you from my window.
If somebody breaks in your home, logic dictates you do whatever it takes to get them out.<eos> You have no idea who I am, do you?<eos> I'm just some blonde lady who works with Reda.<eos> Basically.<eos> Would it surprise you to know that I sympathize with what you just said about defending your home?
- Conlin, wait.<eos> - That, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I said, "Wait."<eos> Doesn't seem wrong to you, being here?
It's me, again.<eos> Carrie. Don't hang up.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - I-I can't say.<eos> About the recording I played you, that we were discussing earlier.
I-I don't even know where to begin.<eos> This is-- this is so fucked up.<eos> I--<eos> What I need to believe is that you're protecting Franny, okay?<eos> Because that's what I asked you to do when I left here this morning.
I'm here.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine now.<eos> Oh, what's happening?<eos> Ugh. Nothing, nothing.<eos> You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.
What deal?<eos> The deal Dar Adal made.<eos> Right now, you're an important national-security asset.<eos> Break the terms, and you're a national-security risk.<eos> Do I like a f-fucking risk to you?
Your friend the banker, Farhad Nafisi.<eos> He's a little hard to recognize, I admit.<eos> Wild guess... He's working for Mossad.<eos> For the past eight years.<eos> Including the little show they put on for you in Abu Dhabi.
Come on.<eos> Help me put him in the trunk.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Down by the lake.<eos> He hasn't said a word... not since I called you.
Can't stand the politics.<eos> Especially now.<eos> I hear you.<eos> God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?
God, I hear you.<eos> So, Max, did she tell you what the issue is?<eos> She didn't say there was an issue.<eos> There is.<eos> She didn't ask you about this missing year?
No.<eos> If you don't believe that, please, just pull the trigger.<eos> - What the fuck did you do?<eos> You sound terrible.<eos> I told you to leave him alone.
You were always curious about my work.<eos> Well, this is called paper-chasing.<eos> Please pay the bill and leave the cafe immediately, turning right and onto 77th street.<eos> "Midway down the block, cross the street."<eos> "At the corner of central park west, a silver range rover will pull up beside you."
Happy to.<eos> How about we meet up - after work at the Hay-Adams?<eos> - How about we do it now?<eos> That way, you won't cancel on me again.<eos> I swear I'm not avoiding you, Saul.
Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.<eos> See?<eos> What was I just saying?<eos> She never tells you what you want to hear.
I can do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.
Honestly, Saul, I... I didn't know whose side you were on.<eos> Five's the limit, pal.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.
Is Astrid even your real name?<eos> Stop it, Peter.<eos> - I'm curious.<eos> Is it?<eos> - Of course it is. I don't believe you.
Quinn, what are you doing?<eos> Look.<eos> My God.<eos> That's him, Carrie.<eos> The m-man who was... watched you, put the bomb in the van.
Why, then?<eos> Lights out.<eos> Nothing till tom... morning.<eos> Good. Then maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were being hauled off by orderlies at Bellevue.
Yeah, well, I do.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> What, I don't care?<eos> I don't care so much I visited you in the hospital every day?<eos> I don't care so much I took you into my home?
No.<eos> Because there's nothing here. There never was.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> And you... you... changed... after the stroke.<eos> We both know it, and... and I am so, so sorry, what I did to you.
He confirmed the immunity deal.<eos> You're gonna get out of this. We both are.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to tell me?<eos> What do these letters look like to you?
You're worried she's gonna say no.<eos> You are such a guy, Charlie... in a good way.<eos> She's gonna say yes.<eos> Yeah, what makes you say that?<eos> Because I've seen the way that she looks at you and... I know that look.
The bleed must be bigger than we thought.<eos> We need to get him to the O.R. now.<eos> - You wait.<eos> - No, I can't, Charlie.<eos> We don't get you to the O.R. now, you may lose that arm.
- Or tell the truth.<eos> - Right.<eos> There will be long silences.<eos> She'll try to stress you out over time.<eos> Is there anything that stresses you normally, like being hungry or...
Thank you.<eos> _<eos> Forgive me, Lord.<eos> Please, Lord.<eos> May the gods protect you on your quest.
And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.<eos> You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?<eos> We have.<eos> All those that did not flee.<eos> The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.
Without them, we'd all be dead.<eos> As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.<eos> This is for you.<eos> The king brings me food.<eos> Did Alfred not feed you?
Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.<eos> Abbot, no...<eos> It is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert appeared in a dream, a glorious dream.<eos> - Abbot, please...<eos> - He showed me your face... and he called you King.
Can you just go and catch enjoyment, please? Oh!<eos> Look, Deepak, be careful.<eos> OK? Because from far away, you look dark enough to be a little bit black?<eos> No, you do!<eos> Just look, look, look, look. If the police stop you, don't panic, OK?
I'm sorry.<eos> No, don't... shh...<eos> BANGING ON DOOR MAN:<eos> Have you lost it yet?<eos> WOMAN: I've a tenner on you staying floppy, don't let me down. - Ha-ha!
I'm staying out of it.<eos> So, you wanna tell me where the man on the pillar is?<eos> It's my understanding he departed.<eos> I didn't witness it myself, but that's what people saw.<eos> People also saw you with his wife.
People also saw you with his wife.<eos> Sandy and I are friends.<eos> She lost a husband. I offered comfort.<eos> Matt, I can literally see the lie wheel turning in your brain.<eos> When did I ever lie to you?
Do you wanna go grab a drink?<eos> Can I take a rain check?<eos> I just got back from a business trip.<eos> Business trip?<eos> Christine called you?
You're building a boat.<eos> For the flood.<eos> I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.<eos> Any chance you guys could give me a ride there?<eos> Lady of the house will take better care of you than the hospital.
I never even considered searching for them.<eos> If I had...<eos> I took the cross from the chapel and brought it out there...<eos> To mark the place where they died.<eos> The place where I found you.
Can you do that for me, please?<eos> Okay, I did it.<eos> I want you to listen to me.<eos> I need you to listen to me very carefully.<eos> You could've called anybody you wanted when this happened, but you called me... because I think you knew that I could help you.
Nora, your...<eos> Your sister?<eos> She's not picking up the phone either. But why would you know that?<eos> Because you're too busy chartering cargo planes to Australia.<eos> Tell me, Matt, does that seem reasonable to you?
I will talk to him.<eos> He didn't call you.<eos> - He called me.<eos> - And what exactly did he say?<eos> What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?
Because Patti is dead!<eos> Because Evie is dead!<eos> - If you wrote a book every time...<eos> - Evie?<eos> Is that what he said when he called you?
Until then, mate, I suggest you go and find some dry clothes and enjoy the ride.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Like when I told you I didn't molest my comatose wife?
What you got there?<eos> Shoes.<eos> It's one hell of a shiner.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I take it your husband told you we were here.
It was a horrible mistake, and I will be taking responsibility for what I've done.<eos> I'm not sure she understands.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.
I'm of sound mind and body and give consent to go... to go wherever they went.<eos> Amen.<eos> So, the two women in that house, they recorded this?<eos> One would assume.<eos> And we're also assuming they're just gonna lead us right to this device they told you about?
Same time next week?<eos> You're on.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> John called you?
No. I'm here to say goodbye.<eos> Want a cigarette?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Don't forget me."<eos> Is this the lighter Jill gave you?
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to.<eos> And then... then I didn't have to.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Scared of what?<eos> Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw and holding you under the water until you drown.
Do I know you?<eos> ♪ I'm sitting in the railway station ♪<eos> ♪ Got a ticket to my destination ♪<eos> You made me sing.<eos> I met you on the bridge.
You're just a puppet.<eos> That speech you just gave?<eos> Were those even your words?<eos> Because it didn't sound like you believed a single thing you were saying.<eos> You just do what they tell you to do.
I was worried you'd forgotten.<eos> Don't usually get so many so close together.<eos> Love is in the air.<eos> A little extra for your trouble.<eos> Sarah, does the name Kevin mean anything to you?
So, you know, here we are in the middle of nowhere bumping into each other, and I'm only here for the night, and I figured, uh, you know, if I didn't ask you to dance tonight...<eos> I'll never forgive myself.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> Okay.<eos> A guy you barely remember shows up on your doorstep, asks you to go on a date with him, but...
We established boundaries the first time you called me. Clear boundaries.<eos> I don't tell you about the people here, and I don't tell the people here about you.<eos> I would never betray that, Nora.<eos> Then how did he find me?<eos> How did he say he found you?
Well, I want him to leave me alone.<eos> - Then why are you calling me?<eos> - What?<eos> Well, I can't make him leave you alone. I'm half a world away, so why did you call me?<eos> I called you because I thought you told him where I was.
But every year, I would come back.<eos> Because...<eos> Because I couldn't stop.<eos> And a couple days ago... I showed your picture to that nun... and I saw it in her eyes.<eos> She recognized you.
Because I couldn't stop.<eos> And a couple days ago... I showed your picture to that nun... and I saw it in her eyes.<eos> She recognized you.<eos> She knew you.<eos> And when I saw you...
Oh, but I didn't know what to say... or where to start, and so I just thought, "Oh, fuck it.<eos> Just erase it all and maybe that would give us another chance."<eos> But you were right.<eos> It's not true.<eos> That's how I found you, Nora.
So, that part is true?<eos> That part is true.<eos> What else is true?<eos> Everything I said about Matt's funeral.<eos> Everything I told you about Jill and Tommy... my father.
Betty Friedan called lesbians a menace and forced them all out.<eos> No one forced them to push their lifestyle in our faces.<eos> How does Aileen, our new president, feel about this?<eos> We should ask her.<eos> But she'll only tell you there's no place for them here anymore.
- Good night, Cleve.<eos> Requesting permission to come aboard.<eos> Jones!<eos> You were to report back at 1500.<eos> Something hold you up?
And how does that make you any less tardy, sailor?<eos> You looking for a promotion, sir?<eos> You looking to lose your leave, sailor?<eos> No, sir.<eos> They're watching you, Jones, close.
So N.O.W. can throw stones at us for being too radical.<eos> I'll see you all next time, all right?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It won't take long.<eos> I'll show you were you need to go so you can hear N.O.W. for yourself.
She was the only one... till now.<eos> And you're still in love with her?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> You asked me if this had happened before.<eos> I asked you if it bothered you that we did it.
I would like for it to be you, Lieutenant.<eos> There are 42 pirates in the belly of that ship and I can spare no more than a handful of men to see to her.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord.<eos> I want to be a part...<eos> I understand you wanna be part of the fight that's coming. I understand you want retribution for Captain Berringer. Right now, the successful transfer of those prisoners is what I need from you.
The ones of us they don't get down here, we're just gonna swing in Port Royal in a few days.<eos> - MAN:<eos> Get up. Get up!<eos> - You gotta trust me.<eos> [man #2 screams] He asks you for a name, you don't say shit.
Move!<eos> I would think some sort of thanks might be in order.<eos> Billy was more than ready to throw you to the wolves out there.<eos> And to be honest, I was undecided about whether to go through with this deal at all.<eos> Sure.. I get my men back in exchange for you. [sighs]
But something tells me... if I free you, you'll find a way to be a problem for me again, and soon.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> When you and I last saw each other... you had every reason to see me killed.<eos> Certainly would've solved a lot of problems for you.
I'm sorry for what happened today.<eos> The moment I realized what was about to happen, I sent men to find you.<eos> I'm just thankful we were able to get you in time.<eos> You are sorry... for what happened today.<eos> What happened today... was exactly what I have been warning you about from the moment you and your husband first arrived here.
MAN: Go and find Mrs. Hannah.<eos> She'll know what to do.<eos> No one will harm you out there.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because they know if anything happens to you, Flint dies.
-Are too!<eos> -D2!<eos> Bobby, sweetie, since we've been back together,<eos> I feel like that 12-year-old at summer camp on Roosevelt Island, running around the abandoned tuberculosis hospital, scaring ghosts.<eos> But the reason I asked you to meet me here, in this very public place with many witnesses, is because I don't think we should see each other--
I can't disappoint him.<eos> Then you won't.<eos> We'll find you another job.<eos> -But where?<eos> -Let me catch you up on the latest in showbiz.
Did you just get these today?<eos> You're not signing this.<eos> But the sticker says "Sign here."<eos> It's shaped like an arrow.<eos> Kimmy, this man put you through hell... cheating on you or whatever.
It's Richard.<eos> Richard Stemple?<eos> From high school?<eos> No, dummy.<eos> You didn't go to high school because I kidnapped you.
No.<eos> I broke up with Bobby.<eos> And it was worse than I could have imagined.<eos> No.<eos> He killed you, and now you're a ghost?
What's wrong?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You have to finish mixing the explosives.<eos> Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
He's still in.<eos> But listen up, I know you ain't down with the split, never have been.<eos> - Maybe I can do better.<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
_<eos> I think Amira's gonna do something.<eos> He thinks you're planning an attack at the school with someone.<eos> He doesn't know it's with me.<eos> I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.
- She's my brother's wife.<eos> Like that would stop you starting up with her again.<eos> Don't get crazy.<eos> Money ain't coming in like it was.<eos> That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
Yes, I am.<eos> Now, he's up to speed on everything.<eos> He knows you need to get Grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.<eos> Carter, the police are giving you a vehicle and a comm package.<eos> A CTU tac team will follow you to your rendezvous with Grimes.
He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay? He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.
We have a better chance of recovering the list with CTU's help.<eos> All right, Carter, are we clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard you.<eos> Let's get you down to motor pool.
- I'll get someone on it for you.<eos> This is Agent Locke.<eos> He's the best tactical specialist in CTU.<eos> He'll be leading the field team.<eos> Now, we have no way of knowing how Grimes will approach you at the station.
You want me to do her right now?<eos> No.<eos> Not until Royo calls and we know Isaac's taken care of.<eos> I know you ain't down with the split, never have been, maybe I can do better.<eos> - That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
The terrorists, they... they got away with the list.<eos> I don't know how many times I can say it.<eos> I didn't leak the identity of those Rangers.<eos> I saw that ATM footage.<eos> You say you were out there jogging, but it shows you at the exact place at the exact moment when the data on those Rangers was stolen.
Get set.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> - What?<eos> - Isaac.<eos> Royo's not there to make a deal, he's there to kill you.
And you're not in the middle of the desert operating on your own.<eos> We don't just go on our gut here, we make decisions based on intel.<eos> And I cannot authorize this mission.<eos> There are too many variables. Appreciate all you've done for us today, but this is my call.<eos> Agent Wilkes will take you to debrief. Mullins.
I didn't leak the identity of those Rangers.<eos> There's a problem with Drew.<eos> I know I have to kill him, Khasan. I just need you to tell me how to do it.<eos> You need to get your hands on a syringe.<eos> Isaac, Royo's not there to make a deal. He's there to kill you.
Ben is taking me to Gabriel. And I'm using the Onyx missile schematics as bait. And hopefully we can find out what he knows about Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> You stole those schematics?<eos> When I've identified Gabriel, I'll look for a chance to lock him down.<eos> Have a TAC team standing by.<eos> Carter, you're predicating this entire plan on what Grimes told you.
He's proven he can't be trusted.<eos> This is the only chance we have right now to find Jadalla.<eos> I'm sending you location where the TAC team should stage.<eos> He's wrong about me.<eos> Everything I told you is the truth. You can trust me.
My business is falling apart. I got dudes out there that's trying to kill me.<eos> I'm losing my mind here.<eos> Let me say it again, I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm glad you let her go. I didn't want to kill Aisha, not really.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm glad that worked out for you.
John.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he say anything else to you?<eos> Anything I should know before I go in? Um...<eos> Just what I told you over the phone.
Family and peace.<eos> That is what we seek.<eos> Anything else is a twisted perversion.<eos> Don't let your brother lead you down the wrong path.<eos> I raised you better than this.
Please tell her I'd like to see her.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is Locke.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Uploading satellite feed and property schematics to you now.
You'll be fine here.<eos> It's okay, Amira.<eos> Get behind me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Saving you.
Well, actually, Mullins wants to ask you a few more questions - about your father.<eos> - I've already told him everything.<eos> Yeah, we need to go through it again.<eos> We don't know what details might be helpful.<eos> There's an agent waiting for you in the conference room.
'Cause that's what he does.<eos> You made the right choice.<eos> You did.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> 'Cause the next time they come up here could be the last time I see you.
Of course it is.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> But if you think this will make Eric do what you want, you're wrong.<eos> Oh, but he will, though.<eos> He will, because he loves you.
They'll back you up.<eos> I'm asking you... to find another way.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Jadalla just sent the GPS coordinates.<eos> When CTU finds you, you better tell them to stay away. Because I'm gonna free my wife and my brother, and we're gonna end this once and for all.
All right?<eos> Nicole, I love you.<eos> I always have.<eos> Always will.<eos> Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.
We need to call CTU.<eos> Hell no.<eos> Nah.<eos> Hey... look...<eos> Eric brought you to me because those people cannot be trusted.
This is about to be a war.<eos> - Right? I got no clue how ugly it's gonna get, but I'm-a go after Eric<eos> - 'cause I love him. - No. I'm not just gonna stand here while you go off and save my husband.<eos> Eric gave himself up to save you.<eos> You go back in there and something happens to you, his sacrifice means nothing.
_<eos> Got it.<eos> Naseri.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Think I wouldn't recognize you after what you did?
Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> Carter?<eos> We're good.<eos> Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.
Jennifer, I need to know why they did this to you.<eos> It's over?<eos> It's really over?<eos> It's over.<eos> Who were they leveraging you against?
And I think Naseri is watching her on some kind of a Web cam.<eos> Get it off, get it off!<eos> You've got ten seconds. Go!<eos> Move!<eos> Who were they leveraging you against?
And you're a liar.<eos> I wonder if you really don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'd tell you to ask her, but you're never gonna see her again.<eos> What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.
What is it?<eos> If I'd been at your side from the beginning, maybe this wouldn't have happened to you.<eos> It has happened for a reason.<eos> When I left for Europe, I... I thought I was joining a better world.<eos> When I heard the Americans had murdered you, I... I couldn't rationalize their hypocrisy anymore.
"East July" is a subheading of some folders in the server at the office of the D.N.I.<eos> Well, what was in it?<eos> I don't know, I can't tell you.<eos> When I tried to access the folders, some firewall kicked in.<eos> And you used the clearance profile that I gave you?
Good.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Andy.<eos> Simms is secure, I'm logging in to the terminal now.<eos> Go to the IP address I gave you.
Ara?<eos> It's a beautiful name.<eos> My name is Eric. And I'm here to help you.<eos> Help?<eos> What these people did to you is wrong.
This is your only chance of living through all of this.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right? It's okay.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
The people who do this work... it's a gift.<eos> Oh, and it's a curse.<eos> And it'll eat you alive if you don't deal with it.<eos> "Deal with it"?<eos> Go where it leads you.
He chained those he felt most likely to revolt over the offense.<eos> Though, I imagine they know this.<eos> With what conditions?<eos> Two of them.<eos> They respect you, so they'll listen to you.
I revered you.<eos> When you were told that my mother and I were dead, I have to believe that it affected you.<eos> You had just lost your mother.<eos> But if things were as I remember, my mother and I were your family, too.<eos> And yet, through all the years thereafter that my father cared for you... counseled you, labored for you... he never told you that we were alive.
- Won't do it by itself.<eos> Over there.<eos> Pretty sight for you.<eos> I came to find Eleanor.<eos> "I betrayed you, Jack.
"Tried to trade your life for my own personal gain. "Lied to Anne to her face about it.<eos> "Please, Jack.<eos> Beg of you.<eos> "Is there any way you can forgive me?"<eos> That was the general sense I had of what I might hear come from your mouth were I ever this close to you again.
This isn't a drive-through.<eos> We're taking our sorority photo this evening, and we all really want them in time for that.<eos> Is there any way you can do us all?<eos> - We'll pay extra.<eos> - Let me help you out.
This whole thing is just a nightmare.<eos> They can't fire you over this.<eos> Sure they can.<eos> According to Chat Bandit, I'm the worst RA alive.<eos> If they fire you over a costume, the university is essentially declaring that they can censor us.
- Hold on. Talk to me.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.<eos> I read your article.<eos> Then why are you acting like this?<eos> I defended you.
Or, like the other night, when I got home and my RA was making fun of black people.<eos> - Iris... - The dorm is my home.<eos> It's where I sleep.<eos> It's the place I'm supposed to be able to take off that armor.<eos> But you're moving out because one guy wore something that upset you?
Yesterday, he had nothing.<eos> He was shouting at the rain.<eos> Now you've given him all he needs to kill this war dead.<eos> My God.<eos> The number of times I have followed you blindly, backed you with the men blindly, put men in the fucking ground... good men, friends... because you said,
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.<eos> Chances are good you've seen the last of him.<eos> You killed a friend of mine.<eos> Her name was Charlotte... and you did it for reasons that had nothing to do with her.<eos> There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.
I couldn't tell then if it was... because she was afraid of you.<eos> Wouldn't have blamed her.<eos> Or if it was something else.<eos> But I respected her wishes.<eos> Obeyed when she said we'd protect you despite what you'd done.
Surrendering everything she had sacrificed so dearly for, because it would have come at the expense of the one she loved. She was trying to tell me, I just could not hear her, about what is truly important.<eos> I said no to Marion Guthrie's plan... despite having no alternative and at the risk of losing the entire endeavor because I refuse to situate a man in a position where he might interfere one day with my ability to repair things with you.<eos> You are the bravest person I have ever known.<eos> The truest person I have ever known.<eos> And I betrayed you and it sickens me.
From what I've overheard, if you reach Skeleton Island, might mean the end of the governor.<eos> Maybe keep the account alive a little while longer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> That and more.<eos> Then I'll take you to it.
But it must be.<eos> And every moment we waste is a moment we could be working to retrieve her.<eos> That's all this has ever been, isn't it?<eos> A partnership only insofar as it enables you to do whatever it is that matters to you in any given moment.<eos> And right now it matters far less to you whether she lives or dies than it happens your way, on your terms.
Good.<eos> It is not every day you escape prison.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?
Good.<eos> It is not every day you escape prison.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?
I wouldn't be alive if you hadn't helped me.<eos> Those men who attacked you, they were hired by your brother?<eos> Good.<eos> Why good?<eos> Because... he must be very afraid of you to do something like that.
I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.<eos> He's a serious and very intelligent man.<eos> Why wouldn't you meet with him?<eos> Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.<eos> Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.
But be careful, Van Damn, people are noticing.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Hello, Mom.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.<eos> But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.
You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.<eos> Yes. Absolutely.<eos> But... you're so good when you speak from your heart.<eos> Baby, the interview you did at the premiere was incredible.<eos> I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.
But I told him he was wrong, and more importantly, I couldn't imagine getting married without my sister being there.<eos> Come here.<eos> Oh, I love you.<eos> Thank you for sticking up for me.<eos> I won't let you down, and if you need anything...
If you're trying to find a difference between us, you're wasting your time.<eos> I'm not the one with a leash around my neck.<eos> - Lila, why are you still talking to him?<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.
She's fighting with her cluster.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> If he's the one that's after you, I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
Can I get you anything?<eos> Earplugs.<eos> Okay. I heard that. And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.<eos> She knows. She didn't mean it literally.<eos> And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
By having sex with every homie in Oakland.<eos> - By any means necessary.<eos> - Mom! They exaggerate, honey.<eos> Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.<eos> Well, what can you do when this thing smiles at you?
I don't have two minutes for you.<eos> Okay. All right, that's fine.<eos> Will you just answer me one question?<eos> What?<eos> How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.<eos> Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.<eos> This agency no longer represents you.
When I watched those poor, innocent people killed...<eos> If it's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening... shouldn't we?<eos> Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?<eos> Whispers.<eos> She told me, the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists, or to take a handful of pills, or to jump from a height... that voice never shouts.
I lost my agent.<eos> I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.
I lost my Instagram followers, my Twitter followers.<eos> - I've lost...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You have a man who loves you.<eos> And you have a friend who was willing to give up her life for you. And you have a mother who accepts you.
Lito!<eos> Burt Lancaster had this... power.<eos> Oh, I get that.<eos> [Lito] They all wanted to be her.<eos> Did you want Burt to kiss and drip on you, too?
I think someone is driving him.<eos> Who?<eos> Wolfgang.<eos> Sebastian, be careful.<eos> If something happened to you, I don't know what I would do.
I know you're angry... but this is how a girl like me tells a boy like you that she has a crush on you.<eos> And instead of laying in bed, wishing she was going out with you and not her current boyfriend... she has decided to do something about it.<eos> [Superpower] Far enough.<eos> So we meet again, eh, Van Damn?<eos> So, tell me, did that pretty girl of yours turn you on to politics?
No.<eos> You're just as trapped as we are, aren't you?<eos> [Lila] It's Sebastian.<eos> He's worried about your relationship.<eos> I told him I would talk to you.
I look terrible.<eos> I hate heels.<eos> I'm already klutzy enough.<eos> You look great.<eos> You're just feeling a little anxious because Teagan asked you to do a toast.
- Just like them?<eos> They do.<eos> - You'll be fine, son.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because your whole life, every really good day, and every truly bad one, has been preparing you for this moment.
- Janet.<eos> I don't want to make a scene here.<eos> Why not?<eos> I have some great ideas.<eos> I know Teagan asked you to speak, but if you have any compassion for your sister or this family, I really think it would be best for everyone if you had one of your mysterious headaches and left early.
Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?<eos> You know I'm deeply indebted.<eos> And you know my daughter cares very much about you.
If you want to finish your sacred rite, get out of the way.<eos> Otherwise, I can take you downtown, too.<eos> - Teagan, be reasonable.<eos> - But...<eos> We knew this could happen. We warned you.
Your boss got that bogus information on Axe and the cops by accessing his wife's private notes.<eos> You betrayed my trust.<eos> You sit there and you try to claim moral high ground. I claim it?<eos> While you go on working at a criminal organization, and you can't even fucking admit it to yourself.<eos> I tell you about my issues with Danzig, and then there's a fucking investigation underway!
You betrayed my trust.<eos> You sit there and you try to claim moral high ground. I claim it?<eos> While you go on working at a criminal organization, and you can't even fucking admit it to yourself.<eos> I tell you about my issues with Danzig, and then there's a fucking investigation underway!<eos> I didn't sell you out.
You never have to say that to me.<eos> In many ways, this place made me.<eos> Sit.<eos> There's nowhere that the stark difference between winners and losers is more clear.<eos> I have called you here tonight to tell you how we are going to win.
Break it up! Break... break... break it up!<eos> Break it up!<eos> What... Hey! Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Hey, what is wrong with you?
I handed you a sure thing, and you blew it.<eos> Well, you did put me in a terrible position.<eos> It was harmless flirting.<eos> How would you know?<eos> No boss has ever told you to sex yourself up to snag a donor.
Melissa...<eos> It's all right, Melissa.<eos> We understand.<eos> I hope you die and she becomes president.<eos> What did the girl say to you?
I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.<eos> You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.<eos> And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?<eos> Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.<eos> They'll find him soon enough.<eos> We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.<eos> If you can get yourself onto that committee, I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.<eos> My driver will take you back to your car.
Some found its way behind your ear.<eos> - Should I be afraid?<eos> - Don't be smart.<eos> I should, shouldn't I?<eos> I stole something from you.
Just give me a sec to move my dick out the way.<eos> How about instead I go talk to your foster mom, see how she feels about buying me a new set of whitewalls?<eos> Fuck makes you think I was in foster care?<eos> Just playing the odds.<eos> Tell you what.
Good news is the guy's an old scumbag.<eos> Thing is, we don't know yet what kind of cell phone video we might be dealing with.<eos> So I want you to listen to your good friend, Bo.<eos> You sustained multiple blows to the head during the altercation. Okay?<eos> Your PBA rep advises you not to make any statements till we can confirm your cognitive functions were operating normally.
But when he runs the name Marius Josepovich through the database...<eos> Yeah, you're right. You're fucked.<eos> [sighs]<eos> But that's not your problem.<eos> Your problem is that you didn't tell me that covering for you with Mr. Success was putting my family in the crosshairs of some ex-cop gangster and some still-cop psycho looking to pay you back for taking his eye.
Well, honestly, after what happened with Charlie, I'm surprised that you'd be in on any of it with me, but...<eos> Charlie's the reason I came in.<eos> You know what I mean. You know what I mean.<eos> I hesitated, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> Ended up deciding, if she doesn't blame you, hard to see how I can.
- Otto: What the hell?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, holy shit.<eos> Holy fuckin' shit.<eos> The man tells me to bring you, I bring you.
Welcome home.<eos> I'm just barely open.<eos> Sorry, I was hoping for some music.<eos> God, I haven't seen you in an age.<eos> What brings you back to the west?
I'm tired.<eos> Don't matter if you're tired.<eos> Whoa, I said I'm tired.<eos> I'm gonna rest for a bit, and then I'll go get shit done, or whatever.<eos> Sounds good to you?
Sounds good to you?<eos> Best plan ever.<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> You know, you could probably leave your boxes packed.<eos> Easier to clear out when MCC calls and fires you.
Can't we both be here? - No.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Clearly we both have a similar plan, huh?<eos> Maybe we can help each other.<eos> - What did he take from you?
No, no, no.<eos> Come here!<eos> No!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> You should've shaved it off like we told you.
All right, here we go, here we go, here we go.<eos> This is fun.<eos> SHO:<eos> Rory, you have to move.<eos> It's gonna hit you.
You're always drunk.<eos> Well, I saw you with Townsend.<eos> We were just talking.<eos> You were in each other's arms.<eos> He's been after you ever since he met you. You know that.
Hello!<eos> Katie?<eos> It's all locked up.<eos> They're not home.<eos> Well, did they tell you where they were heading?
I'm nothing without her.<eos> Liam, can you help me with this, please?<eos> - Hayden left me.<eos> - She moved, to protect her sister.<eos> And it's not like she dumped you or anything.
Maybe, uh, I should lower this a notch or two.<eos> Latin?<eos> You wanna take Latin?<eos> I like Latin.<eos> Liam, who told you to take Latin?
Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, everything okay?<eos> I'm going back to the Torrent.<eos> You think that guy did something to you 'cause you were a raging douche? I'll sweet-talk him.
Nice.<eos> So how do you feel now?<eos> We're not getting back together. Okay.<eos> I've been wondering something.<eos> Why didn't Reynard kill you with your friends? Why were you spared?
I can show you how.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Do let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Eliot!<eos> The crown suits you, of course. - Who are all these people?
I tend to get pretty fucking intense.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe she thought you'd act like a fucking grown-up.<eos> What?<eos> - You want to act like this whole thing was an accident?<eos> Like it happened to you?
This is it, honey, and this is forever.<eos> Stop following me!<eos> And why are you judging me and putting words in my mouth?<eos> Why are you judging me?<eos> Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.
Stop following me!<eos> And why are you judging me and putting words in my mouth?<eos> Why are you judging me?<eos> Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.<eos> He doesn't hate you.
Hah!<eos> I don't understand, Mom. You didn't say it was gonna be this hard.<eos> Oh, have I made this look easy to you?<eos> No.<eos> Have the last few years looked easy to you?
I don't understand, Mom. You didn't say it was gonna be this hard.<eos> Oh, have I made this look easy to you?<eos> No.<eos> Have the last few years looked easy to you?<eos> Maybe they would have if you'd chosen a husband who wasn't gay and who actually loved you.
So, we'll just have to wait till Hannah gets back.<eos> I have no idea when she'll be back.<eos> - Motherhood seems to have had such an effect on her.<eos> Yeah, I don't even know why we have that here.<eos> Sorry I walked in on you beating off.
And I was like, "No!" And I ran out.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> And then I was like, "If it's due on Friday,<eos> I'm not finishing it on Wednesday, and that's final!"<eos> So, you ran away because your mom asked you to do your homework?
That's her job in the world.<eos> She has a million trillion things she'd rather be doing.<eos> Things she might want to experience.<eos> Life things she hasn't enjoyed yet.<eos> But she stays and tells you to do your homework because it's what's fucking good for you.
So give me back my jeans!<eos> No, you psycho lady!<eos> Oh, you run, you little harlot.<eos> Run as fast as you can, okay?<eos> But life is gonna chase you, it's gonna chase after you with problems you can't even imagine.
He looks at me in the middle of this fuckin' party like he's a judge and he goes,<eos> "That's a very serious accusation, Hannah." And he walked away.<eos> And there I am, and I'm just 11 again, and I'm just getting my fuckin' neck rubbed.<eos> Because that stuff never goes away.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry that happened to you.
I have no idea if that's true. Can't find any proof on the Internet, but, God, if it is, fuck, that's so good.<eos> Why don't you keep the Roth?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, seriously.<eos> I like how happy it makes you.
Woman: Is green tea all right for you, Hillary?
"Redivider." What does it mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They didn't brief me on Redivider.<eos> What about shit like this, man?<eos> They never briefed you about trains falling out of the fucking sky?
With some boring, 27-year-old single mom.<eos> Well, I don't have to be boring.<eos> I could be a cool single mom, you know, like Lorelai Gilmore.<eos> Elijah, I don't know what to say.<eos> I always told you I wanted to be a mother someday.
It's just really fucking sad to hear it from Adam.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I really didn't want to tell him.<eos> He was just following me down my block.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Do I really have to answer that question for you, Jessa?
Men are only on this earth to buy us jeans.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> I can't go in that room and sing "Santa Fe" from "Newsies" right now.<eos> Then don't sing "Santa Fe" from "Newsies."<eos> Sing some shit that's real to you right now.
I got out everything I needed to say.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, be good, Hannah.<eos> Dill: Sounds like he didn't have much to say.<eos> Sounds like he dismissed you... the way I dismissed Elijah.
The pepperoni's in the bathroom.<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> I'm here 'cause I have something to say to you.<eos> There's nothing like a public shaming to make you realize what's really important.<eos> I cast you aside when all you wanted to do was love me.
- Yes!<eos> And it's, like, kindergarten or first grade and sleepovers are, like, all the rage and everyone's doing it every Friday and Saturday night, and you're just like, "No, I can't.<eos> I need to have my own sheets, I need to have my own toilet. I can't."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And then one day, someone asks you.
Yes.<eos> You should have sex before you leave 'cause I don't know what kind of dick's gonna be up in the boondocks.<eos> Great idea. I will call up one of the guys who would love to have sex with this.<eos> I'm sure there's plenty of quality people who would love to have sex with what you got going on.<eos> And not murder you.
I'm feeling like I would like to go one place without being treated like I'm a Jezebel or a witch.<eos> - Particularly by Hannah.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> I am feeling a lot of anxiety about the fact that we've allowed our friendship to reach this place of aggression and isolation.<eos> And I am proposing that... yes, Shosh... and thank you so much for the hand raise.
Miss Sayre.<eos> Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.<eos> What in heaven's name are you doing here?<eos> I thought you'd be off doing military maneuvers or something.<eos> What brings you to town?
Come on.<eos> Evening, Zelda.<eos> Evening, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.<eos> I went to school with her granddaughter Delia.<eos> Does everyone in town know you?
That's not exactly a virtue in this town.<eos> Everybody knows everybody else's business.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You want to know what I think?<eos> I think that these people that supposedly know you don't know you at all.
What exactly has he written?<eos> As a judge, I've written more than he has.<eos> Dear, he's young.<eos> Zelda, you've only known this young man for a few months.<eos> What do you really know about him besides what he's told you?
Please.<eos> See what you've done now on your little quest for stupid vengeance?<eos> She's innocent.<eos> Stop it. Stop crying.<eos> Alex, what happened to you?
Get out of the car!<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Go on. Go.<eos> Go. Just start walking.<eos> Follow the road. It... it's gonna take you back to the main highway.
Please, don't.<eos> Go on. Go.<eos> Go. Just start walking.<eos> Follow the road. It... it's gonna take you back to the main highway.<eos> I can't give you your phone right now, but someone'll find you in a few hours.
- Basically, yes.<eos> - That's kind of dumb.<eos> I mean, wouldn't it be better to let him think that you're dead so he leaves you alone?<eos> Mother, he is going to get out someday, and we have to deal with it.<eos> He thinks that I killed you, remember?
I just came by to check on you.<eos> Is it a bad time?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's just an expression.<eos> I'm here. I brought these for you.
Business meeting, huh?<eos> For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?
Don't you dare talk about her like that, or I will kill you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We don't have to talk about how you raped your sister.<eos> I don't care if we are in public, okay?<eos> You say her name again like that, and I will kill you.
H.G., I've known you for years.<eos> You have all these brilliant ideas that only find life on the page.<eos> I'm a writer, John. I fail to see how that makes me a coward.<eos> All you do is write!<eos> It's the only release your fear grants you.
Hey.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Just a little lightheaded is all.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Did the hospital release you?
Do you have something against women or just sex?<eos> Be careful with your tongue.<eos> I do not allow women to speak to me this way.<eos> Well, when you get in that time machine, make sure you go backwards.<eos> Won't get any better for you in the future where women are concerned.
Thank you.<eos> Any time.<eos> Why so sad?<eos> Appears I was bested today.<eos> Let's cheer you up.
Vanessa's one of the richest women in the world.<eos> She might be even wealthier than Oprah.<eos> What is an Oprah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> How does she know you?
Carlos, sit down.<eos> Your mother and I want to talk to you.<eos> Vazquez called.<eos> We know you haven't been in class for two weeks.<eos> Did we put any pressure on you to study law?
- Don't be like that.<eos> Let's go to the bathroom.<eos> Hey, hang on, okay?<eos> I'll be right back. Go get a drink.<eos> It stops you from feeling dizzy, stops headaches.
- All right.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Carlos!<eos> - Swear that you told no one!<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- My God!<eos> - Look at their faces!<eos> - You see?<eos> They're looking at us.<eos> And here's the secret door I told you about.
- Kid, you've better get out of here.<eos> - Scram.<eos> - Moro. - Sorry.<eos> What is it?<eos> We had a jealous boyfriend here looking for you.
I was very sick, I had a fever.<eos> Dad had just left and you were very angry.<eos> You told me that I should never marry until I was economically independent.<eos> I don't know if it was because of the fever but I was really scared,<eos> and I told you that I couldn't live if you died.
I wish I could see her.<eos> Well, it was nice of you to come and tell me, to try and help.<eos> So you-you can let me go now, Norma.<eos> I mean, I'll just leave.<eos> I won't bother you again.
When did you come in?<eos> Just last night.<eos> Do you remember last night, Norman?<eos> I was, uh, just drinking more than I should have. So, you know, things are a little foggy.<eos> I found you passed out, so I put you to bed.
Do you often have times like that Where you get unconscious?<eos> Sometimes, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm gonna hang out here.<eos> Keep an eye on you.
About your mother.<eos> I spoke to her.<eos> It's fine.<eos> My god. This is all my fault.<eos> I should never have let you in the house.
Come here.<eos> Over there.<eos> Keys and your cell phone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I won't tell anyone I saw you.
Please, I... I don't want to die.<eos> Jason, I'm not... I'm not gonna kill you.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> I just...<eos> I need to put some distance Between you and me before the police find you.
What kind?<eos> True crime.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> What happened?<eos> Chick put you in my bed.
True crime.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> What happened?<eos> Chick put you in my bed.<eos> He found you passed out in the basement.
That was her last word?<eos> Fort?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We believe that might help us find out who killed your wife and why.<eos> You know what they don't tell you about non-fat?
Of course.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I owe you an apology, Asha.<eos> For what?<eos> I lied to you before, the other day.
You even refused to take any pictures with Santa because your abuelita wouldn't admit that Christmas is a pagan ritual.<eos> Jesus and Santa were cousins.<eos> Everybody knows this.<eos> So, when it comes to your quinces... I'm pleading with you.<eos> Can't you do this one thing for your mother who loves you?
He's being a good provider.<eos> There are jobs here where they don't shoot at you.<eos> We live in America, name one!<eos> It's not just the job, and you know that!<eos> - It's not like he cheated on you.
Let's just take a breath here, okay?<eos> Talk to Joe Roberts.<eos> Have him post a police detail outside this house, front and back 24 hours a day.<eos> - And tell him what?<eos> - Tell him what I just told you.
- You really wanna stand here, wasting time, talking about everything we know?<eos> Get your phone out, numb nuts.<eos> Your phone.<eos> Get it out now.<eos> That was her school calling you.
Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The man who shot you works for me.
Let me go.<eos> If you don't, Booth will find you, and when he does...<eos> Stop.<eos> I'd prefer you not talk about him.<eos> Zack, what has happened to you?
What does that mean?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'm gonna keep asking around, but in the meantime, you want me to take Karen off the case?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> And also, I got Dr. Roshan waiting for you.
No, I don't believe it. You confessed.<eos> The evidence...<eos> Should be reexamined.<eos> I did not kill him.<eos> I believe you. Booth...
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, Zelda, don't leave me.<eos> I'm here, dummy.<eos> Love you, Zelda honey.
You remember that so clearly.<eos> Does that mean you're doing better?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I mean, I do remember things. I-I remember watching Cam propose to you, how happy you looked.<eos> I remember that you used to carry a cigarette behind your ear to remind you of your father.
You willing to prove that?<eos> Hey, how's it going in there?<eos> Slowly.<eos> Were you able to find any more medio-cam images?<eos> Um.... no more than I already gave you.
It's got this Las Vegas thing with the name Edward on it.<eos> They didn't have one for "Truman." I like the name Edward. I don't know why.<eos> Nice boxers, dude.<eos> Yeah, they're not mine.<eos> Doesn't bother you that there's another guy's boxers in here?
- Do you wanna strangle me again? - I really do.<eos> You're telling me, you come home and see me snooping around your place with a dude from work, you wouldn't be pissed?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You did call me an emotional terrorist.<eos> I never called you an emotional terrorist!
So when was the last trade you executed?<eos> 15 years ago.<eos> Attorney: Who else knew?<eos> I acted alone.<eos> Investigator: When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?
What happened on the morning of December 11th, 2008?<eos> Uh, I was in my office and I got a telephone call. Agent:<eos> Who was on the phone? Man:<eos> It was, uh, Bernie Madoff.<eos> What did Bernie Madoff say to you?
Over a nine-year time span.<eos> If a $50-billion Ponzi scheme doesn't make the SEC's priority list, then I wanna know who sets their priorities.<eos> What made you think that Bernie Madoff was a fraud?<eos> The key tip-off... and it took me about five minutes to figure out that he was a fraud...<eos> I'm gonna give you a hand signal and I'm gonna show you what his performance return line looked like.
Well, um, yes, but I'm referring to the allegations.<eos> What about it?<eos> Lori Richards has all this information.<eos> I sent it to her in a file. They have it.<eos> As I told you, we're a very large organization. - We don't talk to each other.
Good morning, sir. Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> Let me just grab a pager for you here, and we'll get you to sit with a banking professional as soon as one becomes available.
You've taken me as your prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> He's losing it.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> I told you to join me for dinner.
Are you insane?<eos> He's losing it.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> I told you to join me for dinner.<eos> And I told you no.
- Mama... am I ever going to be a boy again?<eos> Oh, yes, Chip.<eos> You'll have your days... in the sun again.<eos> You just leave it to me.<eos> I told you to go away.
You're not alive anymore, Dennis.<eos> I am.<eos> So we're all clear, right?<eos> John Peterson?<eos> Mildy Torres, Social Services, with a court order relieving you of your custodial responsibilities to Dennis Peterson.
I don't feel so good.<eos> You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.
'You've been having dreams.<eos> A recurring dream? '<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> This is a two-way relationship, you know.<eos> The whole world has come crashing down around you.
We should head north and join anyone we find.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I don't know how to answer that question right now.<eos> I don't know what that was either.<eos> All that money that they paid you?
- She?<eos> Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.<eos> And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.
You're doing really well.<eos> So, after you got home, what did you do then?<eos> I-I just lay on the bed.<eos> I thought if I just lay there, maybe it'd go away.<eos> And, Trish, the clothes we took from you yesterday, are they not what you wore when you were attacked?
What color was the dress Diane wore to prom?<eos> Diane didn't attend the prom, Because she didn't attend the highschool.<eos> No prom.<eos> What sports did she play?<eos> As I told you earlier, she wasn't interested in sports.
I understand you're an orphan and come from the poorest congressional district in the United States.<eos> I mean, uh, I live with my aunt...<eos> Cam and I, we went from freshmen on old campus to Skull and Bones together.<eos> Ah. Class of '47.<eos> And hopefully, young man, we'll be welcoming you into the class of '83.
- Ah, Mr. Stigwood, yes.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> Mr. Saturday Night Fever. Mr. Solar Wind.<eos> For blowjob or pharmaceuticals, just ring bell.<eos> Roy will show you.
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.<eos> General.<eos> Sir.<eos> Swell.<eos> I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I've been trying to contact you.<eos> Oh, yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not feeling well.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.<eos> You mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.<eos> I got promoted thanks to you.<eos> Thanks to you, Mr. Jones, we were able to put Sybil Griffiths behind bars.<eos> And ever since, Dao has been after me to sign off on a deal that'll get you out in three to five years.
If you want my co-operation, you're going to have to woo me,<eos> and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.<eos> It will get you nowhere.<eos> Let me remind you of your position...
If we can get the King away, the people will realise the bastards can be thwarted.<eos> Good man.<eos> That's grand.<eos> You'll meet Captain Hesse at The Grenadier public house at 1800 hours tomorrow.<eos> He'll fill you in with all the details.
It's as if we turn each other on by rage.<eos> And that's a problem, I think.<eos> Do you think that's a problem?<eos> Well, I'm encouraged that you at least think of it as lovemaking. Because sex isn't always that.<eos> Does the sex you have with Perry ever strike you as violent?
I pick up on things, not just from you, but from Perry.<eos> We both become violent sometimes.<eos> I take my share of the blame.<eos> I'm...<eos> He hurts you.
- Everyone knows Pug, sir.<eos> You've come in the hottest summer for 75 years, 114 degrees in the shade.<eos> - I'll adjust, I'm sure.<eos> - You don't mind if I...<eos> Now, Atlee's told you of the task.
The rich history you have with other journalists...<eos> I chose you precisely because we don't have a history.<eos> Now, don't fuck it up.<eos> Fifteen seconds.<eos> People trust you... for decades have valued you.
Hannah never told me she was thinking about killing herself.<eos> - But you did see her.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> You saw her.<eos> And she told you things were bad.
No, that's not me.<eos> You sure?<eos> Absolutely positive.<eos> OK.<eos> So the email I sent you. Do you recognise that signature?
Oh, Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.<eos> You know, your husband is ill, Celeste, but so are you.<eos> There are... children in the house.<eos> I told you, he will not hurt the children.
Look around. I'm already rich.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I wish you'd let us sit at the real table.<eos> In the dining room.<eos> I'll let you into a secret, madam.
I didn't kill him.<eos> You do know that?<eos> It was Emmit.<eos> Wasn't Emmit who came for me in the precinct. Wasn't Emmit who flipped that bus.<eos> You know, I didn't have any feeling about you before, but now I'm starting to really dislike you.
You think the world is something, then it turns out to be something else.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm...<eos> I told you what happened, what I did.
You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.<eos> - That is me?<eos> - That is you.<eos> Your family will come soon and find you.<eos> They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper.
Fuck you!<eos> You know, I heard the last thing PJ did before he swallowed that bullet was call your cell phone.<eos> What do you think he wanted to tell you?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> What did your pillow say to you?
My life depends on it.<eos> I only talk to people who have been touched.<eos> You been touched?<eos> You have.<eos> He talks to you, doesn't He?
How are your eyes?<eos> Ow.<eos> How about your ears?<eos> Any ringing?<eos> I'd feel a lot better if you'd let us take you in. Doc can run an EEG.
You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.<eos> And with the possibility of accomplices out there, I'm asking that we err on the side of caution.<eos> So.<eos> That's all, then.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you?
Who is this?<eos> It's Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> I'm, uh, calling on behalf of a third party and they-- well, they've asked me to ask you would you like to see your children again?
- Yes?<eos> - Woman: Hello. Miss Durst?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for answering the call.<eos> Mark explained the opportunity we're offering you?
Something wrong?<eos> Nothing, it... it's fine.<eos> What did she say? She wants you to do it again.<eos> Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.
They get in the back.<eos> Is that understood?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Go to hell.<eos> But that's not what those soldiers said to you, is it?
Means Kolovi knew about it from the beginning.<eos> These are early experiments of the men who I believe are responsible for your son's disappearance.<eos> That one is Professor Kolovi.<eos> I showed him a picture of my son and he denied ever meeting him.<eos> What did your journalistic intuition tell you about him?
And however an investigation may start, once I'm in it, I'm like a Goddamned octopus... Tentacles out in every direction, looking, listening, sucking up every bit of information that I can find.<eos> Look, I reported that meeting the second it was over, and I have the documentation to prove it.<eos> You reported it the next day in the afternoon.<eos> First chance I got.<eos> Or maybe it took you that long to decide what to leave in and what to leave out.
Your wife was shot by a sniper.<eos> In Kentucky.<eos> We believe it's connected to Senator Wilkes' death.<eos> That was a heart...<eos> Did Clara ever mention anything about a fort to you?
This will pass.<eos> It will pass.<eos> You cannot interrupt the signal without warning.<eos> The impulses within will disconnect and become deranged.<eos> Sister, I tasked you with the flowers in the chapel this morning, to celebrate the return of our sisters and our staff from Africa, but now I find the vases empty.
Well, lass, you've given us all a fright.<eos> But I don't think anyone involved's been more afraid than you.<eos> I thought I was going to kill myself.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> And I'm not going to ask you why, because you're a mother.
Felbeck needed that medication.<eos> His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.
"You think money means you can get away with everything.<eos> I'm done."<eos> Then Austin, uh, stormed out and that's the last that I saw of him.<eos> Great, thank you, Mrs. Mills.<eos> I told you, it's Cornelia.
Aubrey.<eos> This is him.<eos> This is definitely the man who robbed me.<eos> I can tell. I remember he had nice eyes.<eos> The guy who held you at gunpoint?
Not till you tell me what you've put in me.<eos> You feel an unease, do you?<eos> I'd venture that's what's always been in you since birth.<eos> Your soul.<eos> I just put the hardware into you.
Did it?<eos> My understanding is, he was a good cop but that here in Rosewood, he seemed... distracted.<eos> Does that seem like a fair characterization?<eos> I really couldn't say.<eos> Nothing in your relationship led you to believe that he was conflicted in his approach to solving the murder of Archer Dunhill?
I didn't mean it.<eos> I mean, I didn't mean for my drawings to do what they did.<eos> - What?<eos> - On Tumblr.<eos> I know Susan told you what happened, and... it'll come up, I bet.
You were found near the climbing centre.<eos> I thought it was time to stop avoiding 'em.<eos> I remember feeling dizzy and I must have fallen and then I woke up here.<eos> So you were going to tell him the truth about his son's death?<eos> We found the emails Gemma sent you.
She was only asking me to look into a pro bono case.<eos> It's better if you keep your answers as vague as possible.<eos> That way, you technically won't have to lie.<eos> She wanted me to do some research.<eos> And did Keating ask you to do anything else for her that night?
You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!<eos> Today's a good day for you.<eos> How's that?<eos> We're offering you a plea deal.<eos> Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.
- He was dead before the fire.<eos> Why are you hiding that?<eos> Please don't address the D.A.<eos> Why are you concealing how he died? !<eos> Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo, I'm advising you to calm down.
Look, we're not police.<eos> Whatever you say stays right here.<eos> Your son's death was never investigated?<eos> Meanwhile this white boy all over my TV.<eos> What did the police tell you?
Now, instead of being haunted by it... you can learn to live with it.<eos> I can't... I can't breathe.<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex.<eos> Remember what I told you.
Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.
You think I haven't been trying?<eos> I want to believe you, Mr. Santiago, but sadly... I'm not sure I do.<eos> Based on your long list of missteps over the past seven decades, it seems you have a hard time controlling your urges.<eos> All unfortunate misunderstandings.<eos> But I told you... I had nothing to do with those feedings.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
What do you want me to do with him?<eos> Keep him awake till I get there. I'm on my way.<eos> Conscious when I called you.<eos> I swear.<eos> - What's this mutt to you?
What was the outcome of that lawsuit?<eos> The jury found for the plaintiff.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Detective, did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence?<eos> - Did the findings against you involve falsifying of evidence in any way?
All my friends think it's cool that you were the one who arrested him.<eos> He's not famous.<eos> He is now.<eos> I went there to get my money back.<eos> The money your husband's mistress stole from you.
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
Roger that.<eos> - Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Not here.<eos> I honestly have no recollection of ever having met this man.<eos> OK, er... no problem.<eos> Can we go back then to when you left Klein Egerton.<eos> When we spoke to you before, you implied
- No.<eos> - And your mother would corroborate this, would she?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Does the address 99 Shanklin Avenue<eos> - in Brentford mean anything to you?
This is 99 Shanklin Avenue.<eos> Of course, I reported it to the police, who were completely uninterested and who kept saying she'd come back when she's ready.<eos> So, we looked for her.<eos> Her brother had heard she had a... room in a squat.<eos> Did David Walker do something to you here, Sara?
No.<eos> I'm pretty certain she was at the party.<eos> I recognise her.<eos> Men took her places and used her.<eos> - Did David Walker do something to you here, Sara?
I think you're getting way too ahead of yourself.<eos> I know something's wrong, and I've got the proof!<eos> Okay, but for all you know, she just wanted a better apartment.<eos> You don't lie when you're not doing something wrong.<eos> Rebecca texted you, though, right?
Quite well known in literary circles.<eos> When did you last see her?<eos> The 29th March. The day after our spring equinox.<eos> And you didn't see or hear from her after that?<eos> As a member of your coven, didn't that strike you as unusual?
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.<eos> That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> And that's why I'm gonna give you another chance to complete your journey.<eos> Don't look so surprised, Master Bruce.<eos> I told you you couldn't get rid of me that easy.
About Marcus.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You can have a seat.<eos> Right.<eos> Gwen, we're here today because we, we know what you told the police, that you feel like something... supernatural is after you.
Her husband is sending her abusive anonymous messages?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fancy going to have a chat with him now-ish?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Are you registered with any websites that enable you to send anonymous text messages?
You'll have to do it yourself.<eos> Are you refusing to do what I just asked you?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> You are in so much shit when I get back here!<eos> So Cath Atwood asked you to beat up her husband?
We're trying to find the person responsible.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Do you have no shame?<eos> All right. Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna take a long walk and a few deep breaths, and then you'll call us, and give us the name of the person who installed that spyware for you.
They need you to sign these release forms.<eos> You know what, I want to put the chair over there.<eos> Interesting new friends.<eos> I believed you when you first said you're here to police the police.<eos> I don't believe you anymore.
Turn around.<eos> Watch them for me.<eos> You have a permit for this firearm?<eos> Envelope in the glove box.<eos> Look all right to you?
But in the spirit of pessimism, I have an associate who provides prisoner transport for me, and he has offered to the state an armored vehicle...<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> I am not declaring war on my citizens.<eos> Your citizens have already declared war on you.
you were there that night.<eos> - Who says?<eos> - His mother.<eos> I am not declaring war on my citizens.<eos> Your citizens have already declared war on you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't think I was putting you in any danger.<eos> It was almost worth it.<eos> This is a hell of a story.<eos> What did Kiana tell you?
"whoever lives nearby."<eos> Really?<eos> You think so?<eos> I would stake my fortune on it.<eos> Or my name's not whatever it is I told you it was.
I will make the announcement.<eos> Sir, facing the press with only preliminary theories is like dropping blood in the water.<eos> And the timing alone is gonna raise questions.<eos> Somebody just tried to kill you, and now the Vice President gets murdered by his wife?<eos> Yeah, the press will be all over you for more details.
Then let's make this an unofficial consultation.<eos> Are there things I can do today to protect myself?<eos> Would I be wise to consider extreme measures, separation, divorce?<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to pick up the money and put it back in your bag.<eos> I will not talk with you about any of this.
It's a...<eos> She's a wonderful young lady. Uh...<eos> Well, she takes care of all of that, and she said there's still a long way to go.<eos> But you've... received an offer, right?<eos> Something sent to you in writing?
- Can I say something?<eos> - If it's more of the same...<eos> To try to get me to give you the access code...<eos> So far, that drug has killed three of my friends.<eos> - What did I just tell you?
Turns out somebody shaved the firing pin down 2 millimeters, just enough so that no one would notice.<eos> Mr. Vincent, please note that the murder weapon, the only thing that links Bob Lee Swagger to this whole conspiracy, does not fire.<eos> If that weapon can't fire, then Mr. Swagger can't be the shooter.<eos> Bob Lee Swagger, you are exonerated for the assassination of the Ukrainian president.<eos> Now, I gave you what you want. Give me Annex B.
What's going on?<eos> We found the murder weapon.<eos> What happened was, um, this train is coming and... it's like... sensory overload and... it feels like, um, switches going on in my brain, flipping on and off, and I pushed her.<eos> And I-I don't mean to, but it happens, and then the lady falls onto the track, and then I went into shock, horror.<eos> Lester, did somebody tell you to push Susannah Fiorita onto the tracks?
No.<eos> So, you shot him?<eos> How many times was it?<eos> Now, why aren't you listening to me?<eos> I told you I didn't shoot this man.
- The bare minimum. - Horseshit.<eos> Let's be clear...<eos> Julia.<eos> If we do this, you work for me.<eos> Now, I don't know what he told you, but I'm... guessing it's something about how I must be nuts, how I need to be medicated,
Why supposedly?<eos> How forensically minded are you?<eos> I manage OK.<eos> Because some officers, honestly, they think the forensics are cut-and-dried.<eos> But, let me tell you, that is not always the case.
Let's see how baby's getting on.<eos> Cold hands, I'm afraid.<eos> That's all feeling jolly good.<eos> Now, let's have a listen to baby's heartbeat.<eos> Then blood pressure, urine sample, and we'll book you in for a home visit.
Mrs Reed, I'm not a mother, but I know what it is to be a child and to be afraid.<eos> I grew up in a prisoner of war camp, you see.<eos> And, through all of it, the only thing I was truly afraid of was losing my mother.<eos> The one who loved me beyond all fear and all horror.<eos> So do not doubt how much your child will love you, or how little she will see of the things that worry you.
Are you all right?<eos> Just a bit breathless.<eos> It's age. Comes to us all.<eos> That's Reggie, but don't mind him.<eos> If you've no objection, Nurse Dyer, we'll put you to work as soon as you've unpacked.
Ah, you've heard of him?<eos> Bit of a gangster by all accounts.<eos> Runs a string of Soho clubs.<eos> There!<eos> What did I tell you?
You gave Dennis Nelson an alibi.<eos> I told the police I was with him all night.<eos> You need to tell them the truth.<eos> That you were with Jeb.<eos> I don't know what he told you, but...
Wait here with Grandma, okay?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What's...<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> As I told you on the phone, it looks like a stroke.
But I would imagine you still have significant concerns regarding Ms. Bailey having regular, unsupervised visits...<eos> Objection.<eos> Leading the witness.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Mr. Gutteman, may I remind you that your job requires you to be an impartial advocate for your young client?
From his dad?<eos> He had his hands in the air and was begging you not to shoot.<eos> Did you take this picture of Billy Brennan on November 1, 1991?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And did Mr. Brennan tell you how he got the scratch?
I am entering a finding of guilty against the respondent.<eos> Your Honor, the People would like to be heard as to sentencing.<eos> On a misdemeanor? Under the Family Court Act, you are obligated to consider not merely the nature and circumstances of the offense, but also the character of the child.<eos> Honor roll, student council.<eos> This is a young man who doesn't listen. The People are asking you to send a message that ignoring law enforcement will not be tolerated.
Me.<eos> Just me... and I am tremendously excited to serve our country.<eos> I am confident you will handle the rest from here.<eos> Mr. Peus, thank you so much for finally showing your face to me.<eos> It's gonna make it that much sweeter when I destroy you and everyone close to you.
You never wanted control.<eos> You don't know what control is.<eos> You are so... And she loves you.<eos> You!<eos> Let me explain something to you.
Don't you have another President to challenge and annoy?<eos> I do.<eos> Today's schedule...<eos> You've got Marcus at 11:00.<eos> He'll prep you for the BNC interview, tell you what kind of questions you're likely to be asked.
"Work from home."<eos> When have I ever worked from home?<eos> When have I ever done anything but serve you and serve this office?<eos> You really want me to answer that?<eos> I asked you to be a friend.
When have I ever worked from home?<eos> When have I ever done anything but serve you and serve this office?<eos> You really want me to answer that?<eos> I asked you to be a friend.<eos> I told you about all the horrible things I did because I needed a friend and you agreed, and now you're holding it against me.
Your name's been on half my surgeries.<eos> I worked my ass off to earn every one of those cases.<eos> I'm sure you have.<eos> I mean, thank you, Dr. Harris.<eos> I hope things are going well with you.
Luke?<eos> Can you follow through with this?<eos> Mrs. Reid.<eos> Mrs. Reid. Mrs. Reid, why are you still here?<eos> This is exactly what I told you not to do.
I just thought since we work in the same neighborhood... and we have similar tastes in...<eos> - Men?<eos> - Restaurants... we might bump into each other from time to time, so I wanted to come in and clear the air about something.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> When I told you I was dating Richard, why did you laugh?
It was our head chef.<eos> I think there is some fire in the eyes of my little Austrian friend.<eos> Please, speak your mind.<eos> We are just two poor refugees, far from our homes.<eos> This is the third time the dish has been cooked for you.
Well, obviously, as a woman of taste and good manners, you find gossip abhorrent.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> Then I should warn you in advance, because you were the one who brought up Dobby Tucker.<eos> Now, let me tell you...
- You have.<eos> February 4th of this year.<eos> You see, like you, it's my job to know things, too.<eos> For example, I know why you booked a room there for one night only.<eos> I know the name of the girl who visited you for an hour and a half at 9:35pm.
Very well.<eos> Then you leave me no other option.<eos> I will have to deal with him myself.<eos> So, you were bluffing?<eos> I don't know exactly what happened out there, but I do know I believe you.
- You're a fucking liar!<eos> - You're the liar.<eos> - You're a liar!<eos> - Marius Josepovich is an alias! Ha!<eos> Is that what he told you?
For his own safety, I ask that you release Leonard Pine until his trial.<eos> Hospital records say Mr. Pine fell.<eos> That is correct, your honor.<eos> Ruling stands.<eos> Tell me, judge. Does the name Leonard Pine sound even a little familiar to you?
- Thank you.<eos> - Your reputation precedes you.<eos> Look, I don't know what happened when I left, but I went to Santa Monica in an official capacity.<eos> I had transit documents authorized by the Proxy's office as a reward for finding the VIP.<eos> Why would the Proxy provide you with transit documents simply for doing your job?
When I grew up and learned the real explanation for the stars, they became even more amazing.<eos> Yeah, I have a feeling I know where you're going with this.<eos> You're a very intelligent man.<eos> Oh, hey, thank you.<eos> But you seem to think that everybody else around you is stupid.
I brought your blue shirt, 'cause it makes your eyes look more lupine.<eos> Wait, I got a second-round interview?<eos> Wait, my eyes are blue?<eos> Of course you got a second interview.<eos> You're Dr. L. People never say no to you.
Are you okay?<eos> Hungry.<eos> Need something to eat.<eos> Look, I don't have any food.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna call 911 for you.
No, he'll come for me!<eos> He'll come for you!<eos> He won't let you sleep!<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you.
So dinner is at 8:00 in the dining room.<eos> - We'll meet you at the bar.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> Bye.<eos> Let me get the elevator for you, sir.
Hey, hey, gang's all here.<eos> Maybe we can win an election for a change.<eos> - That came out wrong.<eos> - Yeah, way wrong, right?<eos> So, Secretary Doyle has picked you for elder statesman duty?
I did bad.<eos> Hi, Sheriff. I'm Karen with Social Services.<eos> Hi, Karen.<eos> I'm Wade Houghton.<eos> This is my friend Sam I told you about on the phone.
It's the way you're walking.<eos> Like the sky might fall in on you.<eos> Like the ground's gonna bite you.<eos> And if you're Martian, you'll have Osteo-X.<eos> Give me what you can spare and I'll tell you how to get to the ocean.
Talking to Hickman isn't the real issue. The real issue is that you withheld accidentally, but still withheld investigatory information from the defense.<eos> Now do you have any other pictures on your phone that relate to other cases?<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, there's a video from when we found that Iraqi sword and an interview that I did with Dr. Joe.<eos> I have photos from a few cases that we made deals on like the picture of the blue Burberry coat from the Jeffrey Day case that I texted to you, Lieutenant.
- Horse people. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - How... how long have I...<eos> - three weeks.<eos> Your injuries were severe.<eos> Your friends were called away, but they left that for you.
Then negate them all.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> I'm dying of something with a name so long, I can't even tell you what it is.<eos> And you're talking about your fee being capped at more money than they paid me.<eos> Listen to me, if that's really all they paid you, and you really are dying, we can shatter those NDAs in about five seconds.
You think I won't go after you for stealing technology from Seidel's company?<eos> You have no proof I did anything.<eos> No, but he does and I don't give a shit about his marriage, and I'm going to make him come forward.<eos> His marriage?<eos> Is that what he told you this is about?
No.<eos> He found me.<eos> To say that, "I'm so sorry your son is dead."<eos> That's what malik wrote to me in his letter.<eos> Will wrote you, ma'am?
We are going to have to go through every one of these posts. One by one to find a potential witness. Match found.<eos> Match found... Excuse me.<eos> I-I have to make a phone call. Match found.<eos> Doctor, would you like to go?<eos> And then we will report back to you...
No, it's all still blank.<eos> Uh, I get flashes sometimes, but no.<eos> Well, that's understandable. You had Quaaludes in your system.<eos> What about that conversation in the park?<eos> Did Mr. Hendricks seem aware - of what he had done to you?
That the women actually enjoy it.<eos> Did he tell you how many women he'd assaulted?<eos> Yes.<eos> He said he raped three women.<eos> Right now, do you see the man you spoke to in that coffee shop who told you that he raped three women?
So, what do you think?<eos> Well, I don't understand why that woman doesn't mind. Her friend betrayed her.<eos> You sure she doesn't mind?<eos> She said she didn't.<eos> So, after reading the material I gave you, You told me that you suspected...
Yes, sir.<eos> Dr. Latham, I'm not sure how much of that. You heard back there.<eos> I believe most of it.<eos> If I said anything that may have offended you, I'm sorry... I was only trying...<eos> There's something I should share with you.
This is a woman's life -- the end of her life.<eos> Just give her some peace.<eos> This is may we're talking about. Yes.<eos> May.<eos> The voice in your head telling you not to be reckless this time.
But lying about it is.<eos> I never lied.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Hydra cares more about what you've done than what you are.<eos> So when my partner here asks you about smuggling charges... I highly suggest you cooperate.
Nope.<eos> I thought I was a master at precision timing, but, um, it seems like that might not be the case, and, uh, it's got me thinking. About?<eos> Fatherhood.<eos> I mean, I might not be ready for it now, but... one day down the line, I might want to plant a seed.<eos> And... and as any good farmer will tell you, you plant a seed and nothing grows, it's just a real fucking bummer.
After the holidays.<eos> I told you that last time you were here, Detective.<eos> Yes, I appreciate your consistency.<eos> A new question.<eos> Does the name Jared Hall mean anything to you?
Tara Messer, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.<eos> I don't care how much money you make or how many you women you sleep with.<eos> You have issues in your life that are going to keep you from having real relationships.
We trapped him.<eos> Flynn is gonna use the Eye of Ra to defeat Apep and lock up pure evil once and for all. It worked.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> No, Colonel, it's not.<eos> Because Mr. Carsen failed to tell you how the Eye of Ra works.
- Everything all right?<eos> - Evening, sir.<eos> We had a complaint from a neighbour about the noise.<eos> We're carrying out a refurbishment of the kitchen.<eos> Er... please, let me show you.
- Bastards! - Calm down, Mrs Phillips.<eos> Mrs Phillips...<eos> Mrs Phillips, the last time we saw Eddie was when we took him to the hospital... but he escaped from there.<eos> We need your help to try and find the person who did this to him.<eos> Did Eddie ever mention a Dwayne Clarke or a Terrence O'Duncie to you?
This is Detective Geils.<eos> Would you mind taking off your sunglasses, sir?<eos> Y'all a long way from home, detectives.<eos> What can I do you for?<eos> I know the local police have already talked to you about the disappearance of Charles Ravenel.
We heard you changed your mind about pressing charges against Aaron McLaren.<eos> I've got a 3-D television for a Mr. "Guy I Hit"?<eos> Yeah, you can put it over there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I may be way out of line here, but is there any chance Mr. McLaren, or maybe even the university, talked to you about dropping the charges?
And how are your ways?<eos> Sit down, Mr. Pennington, and keep your new age jargon to a minimum.<eos> Okay.<eos> May I ask, what was so important that you had to pull me off Kate Upton?<eos> What does the name Allen Fresco mean to you?
I believe aliens should be wiped from the Earth.<eos> Starting with Supergirl and her cousin.<eos> I hate him.<eos> He literally has no heart.<eos> And what, if anything, did Lillian Luthor tell you about the Medusa Project?
It happened, and I witnessed it.<eos> Okay, this is a big day for my family.<eos> Can you just stop being a reporter for a moment?<eos> No more than you can stop micromanaging every aspect of your image.<eos> I told you that I made my father a promise.
Okay, this is a big day for my family.<eos> Can you just stop being a reporter for a moment?<eos> No more than you can stop micromanaging every aspect of your image.<eos> I told you that I made my father a promise.<eos> What I didn't tell you is that I did it after he died, to make things right.
That's terrible.<eos> Do I smell of drink?<eos> A little.<eos> Comes of having no breakfast.<eos> Has Prendy been telling you about his doubts?
They play video games and watch football. Right.<eos> Tasha's really your friend.<eos> Since the second grade.<eos> And I don't care what you ask me, I ain't gonna say nothing against her.<eos> I wouldn't ask you to do that.
Bring her in.<eos> She's here?<eos> Yeah. I brought her here so you could interview her.<eos> That satisfies my discovery obligations.<eos> Cho Han, this is Sadie Ellis, the lawyer that I was telling you about.
- Why do you think, love?<eos> - Revenge?<eos> - Revenge.<eos> If you thought Derek Stoddart was responsible for your son's death, you should have come to us.<eos> Did Jamie tell you it was his dad who was the hit-and-run driver?
You're just going to go for this, aren't you?<eos> Fuck the consequences. Is that wrong?<eos> These are some scary people, Em.<eos> Do you really want to take them on?<eos> Mr Russell, I'm writing to you about my daughter.
Mr. Proctor?<eos> They've known about this since day one.<eos> Your Honor, they're only bringing it up now because I'm beating them.<eos> Your duties of loyalty and confidentiality to both of your clients are clearly compromised.<eos> I am granting the request and ordering you to withdraw from the case immediately.
I know that Cardinal Vogel is based on you.<eos> She paid me to be her plaything.<eos> In the novel, he sets fire to the palace.<eos> I didn't burn down Lucia's mansion!<eos> But they blamed you.
He threatened Cristina.<eos> And I snapped his neck.<eos> Stahl knows.<eos> Caddie could have led Stahl straight to his body.<eos> Mrs. Saperstein, the numbers 54-4-F mean anything to you?
People do walk in New York City.<eos> And completely inadmissible.<eos> Why don't you get to the real reason for your call?<eos> What are you, from the ESL intern pool?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but there's something I need to tell you.
A Swiss friend of ours has invited Heisenberg to lecture in Zurich in December.<eos> You're gonna be there.<eos> If you're captured, it'll appear you smuggled it from Germany.<eos> But if that happens... swallow the pill.<eos> It's quick. And it's a hell of a lot less painful than what the Nazis will do to you.
"Based on this new phenomenon, it is conceivable, "though much less certain, "that an extremely powerful bomb of a new type may be constructed."<eos> - A single bomb..." - "A single bomb of this type,<eos> "carried by boat and exploded in a port, "might very well destroy "the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."<eos> Good God.<eos> I don't need to tell you what could happen if the Germans develop this technology before we do.
Ever pay attention to a disheveled old fool like me?<eos> Albert, II didn't mean to...<eos> It's all right, Leo.<eos> I just let my imagination run away from me.<eos> I'm sure she cares for you very much.
Will you accept the charges?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Prick's not fucking answering.<eos> Or he's not accepting the calls. They don't ever tell me which it is.<eos> Eric, I told you that they would advise him not to take your calls.
Marco was already getting hit over and over again.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> So, um... I yelled something and, um... Yeah, I tried to stop it, but it...<eos> That's when I got shot.<eos> Is the person that shot you in this courtroom today?
He is not the "Whore of Babylon".<eos> But I want you to know that I understand your predicament.<eos> You are a carpenter by trade and I understand that prison life has deprived you of your means of self-expression.<eos> And so, you vent your energies in angry and rather foolish outbursts.<eos> And so, I have seen to it that a carpentry bench and a few tools be provided for you.
Elena Gabriel.<eos> Dominant handshake.<eos> Intentional?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Elena will show you around the facility.
- Let me get the light.<eos> - Oh, allow me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jones, the curtain!<eos> Do you understand what I just explained to you?
There's nothing we can do.<eos> You even arrested my cousin.<eos> He's a monk.<eos> When you exonerate my family, unconditionally, unfreeze my assets, we'll talk about how I can help keep Earth and Mars from blowing up this whole goddamn system.<eos> And I'll remind you, I chose to work with Earth first.
I've never gotten a statement.<eos> Here's a statement... your investment is doing quite well.<eos> - Can you believe the nerve of him?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Ma'am, actually, I gotta talk to you.
I will withdraw the testing.<eos> I am begging you.<eos> You'll never see us ever again.<eos> - Hey, I know my wife put you in a complicated position, but I don't think you want anything else on your conscience.<eos> It must be so painful that your own son won't talk to you.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You sent your own daughter round to kill the man she loved.<eos> You've made a mistake. I...<eos> I need to get home to cook.<eos> You're not going home unless you can refute the allegations made against you.
We suspect he was infected that same night, and he swiped the tubes from the Max Rager basement.<eos> What happened to the rest of your men who went down there?<eos> We've quarantined them.<eos> So far, none of them are craving brains, but we're worried about them, which is why we brought you in.<eos> We wanted any information your brother may have passed along to you that could help us.
The launderer has been stealing the laundry.<eos> Looks exactly as you suspected, yes.<eos> For how long?<eos> Best I can tell, almost two years.<eos> He could have skimmed close to 2 million from you.
No, no!<eos> Let me look! It's Mia!<eos> Mia!<eos> Left at the stables.<eos> - Would you like a GP to look you over, love? - No, I'm all right!
I warned him to stay away.<eos> He was gone for hours and it took someone else to call us.<eos> Lives in a world of his own, that one.<eos> That shiner he's got. Said he was in a fight.<eos> Well... if that's what he told you.
That's all. How'd you know that?<eos> She phoned me.<eos> Must have been lunchtime.<eos> I was in the pub with Jack.<eos> What, and asked you to pick her up later?
And here's what I think happened.<eos> You meet Mia on the Brindale road.<eos> She's upset.<eos> Tells you she's argued with Gary.<eos> Tells you she loves him.
What are you doing here, anyway?<eos> I heard they did a nice wedge salad. Ooh.<eos> We don't.<eos> And now that we've settled that, if you two will please excuse us?<eos> Okay, Mother, but remember what I told you.
This was surprisingly pleasurable.<eos> Safe journeys from whence you came.<eos> So, if this ward was built by Banneker and it is able to deter the Horseman, what else was in his arsenal?<eos> See, right there?<eos> Problem is, what I told you before is true.
Enjoy that purse.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Thank you very much, ladies.<eos> That is such a beautiful dress.<eos> I think it would look great on you.
Mr. Wang, do you know the difference between a signature - and an e-signature?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> A competent person.<eos> Did I not ask you to get Janice McDermott's signature? - Yes...
Hey, how much is it to upgrade?<eos> Yeah, let's go ahead and make it three first class tickets.<eos> There we go, almost good as new.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Thank you, I think.
Yeah, I got a new partner now.<eos> You remember Creem.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> It's the old man that bought the magic book.<eos> Looks like that didn't work out too well for you, huh?
Well, if your father is innocent, then why is everyone in your family stonewalling this investigation?<eos> - We're not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> If your father's not stopping you from talking, then someone else is.
Littlest Hitchcocks are yours.<eos> All right.<eos> You want to show me where that hurts?<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> Ow, I told you that hurts.
Jonathan and I can... drop the adoption... if that's what you want.<eos> Let me take him upstairs, hmm?<eos> Okay.<eos> She's a religious woman.<eos> Tell her God spoke to you and told you she has to make amends.
Sorry, ma'am, we need to take him now.<eos> I.V. wide-open.<eos> Go ahead, set it up.<eos> They're going to administer the anesthetic.<eos> And then I'll ask you to please count down backwards from 100.
I'm not here to speak about me. I'm here to speak about you.<eos> I'm very sorry that you lost your job, sir.<eos> But as to what I can do to help bring it back, the answer is nothing.<eos> It's gone for good.<eos> And if some politician told you otherwise, they were lying to you.
I'd say my endorsement still carries some weight down there.<eos> Are you promising me your endorsement?<eos> Prove you deserve it, Jim.<eos> Mr. President, you're asking me to commit political suicide.<eos> No, I'm asking you to do the right thing.
We'd like you to. I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> They believe that you could be a potential witness in their investigation into the Capitol bombing.<eos> No way. I'm not giving up my sources!<eos> No one's asking you to. So what are you asking me?
I tell you, the boy really packs a punch.<eos> It's all right, Sergeant. She's one of us.<eos> Mrs. Strong, this is Sergeant John Champe, of Major Harry Lee's regiment.<eos> I've heard good things about you, Sergeant.<eos> Your country thanks you for your service. Ma'am.
- I saw it!<eos> This is an outrage!<eos> Close the curtains!<eos> Remove the wildlife!<eos> Why did I almost believe you? !
I know, "shut the door".<eos> What just happened?<eos> So, let's talk dates for your gastric bypass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does the first week of February work for you?
Hello.<eos> How old are you?<eos> I'm 3.<eos> You're 3?<eos> She likes you.
He knew exactly who you were.<eos> No alarm bells rang?<eos> - No.<eos> - "No." Come on.<eos> 'When you do go into the flat,' you get a weird text telling you not to come in.
With respect, sir, I disagree.<eos> This is our patch, our victim, our specialisation.<eos> In my considered opinion, we're best qualified to handle this.<eos> Hang on a second. I'm the senior ranking officer here, darling.<eos> Yes, you are, and I'd thank you to use gender-neutral language, and remind you that this is a fresh investigation bearing no relation to Operation Trapdoor.
- Moffatt.<eos> - Desford.<eos> DCI Huntley, you do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be used in evidence.<eos> Questions will be put to you by Superintendent Hastings, as it is your right to be questioned by an officer at least one rank senior.
A tall girl, a boy with glasses and a little baby who I think bit a hole in my spare tire.<eos> And did they seem like orphans with an enormous fortune?<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> They snuck into my truck and I threw 'em out maybe 2.5 miles outside of Paltryville,<eos> - like I told you.
I just got you back. Don't say that.<eos> I love you, Marcus, but I made my decision.<eos> My life isn't worth more than theirs.<eos> I need you to pull 81 names.<eos> Sir, can I talk to you?
I want you to be honest.<eos> I want you to tell me why you're here... What you want from me.<eos> For God's sake!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Spare his life, and I will tell you how to fix your radar tracking system.
I'm not imagining it!<eos> She'll have just had a baby! Her vagina's going to be a Superfund site.<eos> Dr Stone didn't say anything about you being pregnant.<eos> That shouldn't affect anything between us.<eos> So what's preventing you from cutting off this affair?
Name it.<eos> Please will you take care of yourself?<eos> I intend to.<eos> Sorry to bother you, Inspector.<eos> What have I told you, Sergeant?
I know what we're asking.<eos> When all you want is to have him back, to hold him.<eos> I know the thought of letting any part of him go feels... impossible.<eos> You're the only that can make this decision.<eos> We understand that. We wouldn't ask you to do something that you're not comfortable doing.
I'll walk.<eos> He stays, Nas comes back, or... you can find yourself a new Assistant Director.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> Roman, it's okay.<eos> What the hell has gotten into you?
The valve replacement and the neuroblastoma debulking are happening around the same time, but I need to see both, so I'm moving one.<eos> O-kay.<eos> Oh, and this amputation's got to go...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> What is wrong with you? Okay.
Diane, where are the pleasantries?<eos> I've been living a very full life lately.<eos> So I've read.<eos> Your joke about dead children?<eos> - Hasn't been going well for you.
It's ready to topple right now.<eos> We secure it with cables.<eos> Cables? Are you crazy?<eos> I'm about as crazy as the Italian engineers who secured the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 645 years.<eos> Is that a good enough of a test run for you?
That's nonnegotiable.<eos> Maia, there will be a moment when you tell a client, "For your own good, you have to do what I say."<eos> This is one of those moments for you.<eos> So, I'll allow you to visit your dad in prison, but I'm gonna be there.<eos> I'm gonna hear everything you say to him and everything he says to you, so it's subject to attorney/client privilege.
Nothing.<eos> He just said... "I love you."<eos> Come on.<eos> All right, let me see.<eos> Whatever he asked you to do, Maia, you can't do it.
Then you are in for a very lonely life, my friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm a little busy, my friend. So...<eos> They'll thank you for winning the bid for them.<eos> They'll shake your hand. They'll slap you on the back. They'll applaud.
Quite the suspenseful moment.<eos> Please, proceed.<eos> Mr. Rindell... good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?
What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?<eos> What are you looking at him for?<eos> I wasn't sure of the question.<eos> Well, then, look at me.<eos> What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?
That and a stationary bike.<eos> Hey, Carl, I didn't know Diane was working here.<eos> She performed amazing miracles in juvenile court, all pro bono.<eos> You're too kind.<eos> I imagine Carl has told you about my issue.
Does that satisfy your Harvard education?<eos> I didn't go to Harvard.<eos> I didn't either.<eos> You do understand that by making this accusation, Mr. Kovac, that you are inviting a countersuit?<eos> In fact, a baseless accusation of this kind would be grounds to report you to the Attorney Registration DisciplinaryCommission.
Sometimes with work, I get shortsighted.<eos> And I never wanted to...<eos> Use me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you had just been up-front with me, I would've told you that Dale, the guy you were asking about, he's been here for 15 years.
Marlon milch?<eos> Is that his name? You're trying to say that you don't know the name of the man that you tried to kill?<eos> You've got it all wrong.<eos> I wasn't trying to kill these people. I was trying to save them.<eos> I left the models for you because I wasn't sure what else to do.
I'm sorry, but Riggs is the better choice here.<eos> Well, then why isn't he the one who's doing our surgery?<eos> Listen, Leo...<eos> Owen, tell me.<eos> So, Dr. Hunt told you what?
Just go.<eos> I'll help.<eos> Help!<eos> Him him!<eos> Sir, sir, is your chest hurting you?
So I did that, and I kept doing that until I realized... why do anything else?<eos> Sex and death.<eos> That's want I want.<eos> Well, you can say you're ready for death... a lot of people do... but as someone who's been around a lot of death and been left behind by it, I can tell you... trust me... you don't want that.<eos> Especially when you have someone like Dr. Pierce telling you she can fix you, offering you the impossible.
Don't ignore that.<eos> The scary thing isn't dying. The scary thing is surviving and accepting that you actually have a life to live.<eos> Don't you want to stick around and live it?<eos> You really think you can get the tumor?<eos> I told you I could get it.
Hey, Jo, it's me.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> Found her.<eos> Whoa, no! No, no, no, no.<eos> What did I tell you? - I have to go.
- You think those bitches are just gonna share it with you?<eos> You may not like them, but there's no reason...<eos> You didn't hear what I heard.<eos> They're liars, both of them.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to you, but if you can't behave, then just shut your mouth.
We have reason to believe the stunt that killed him was rigged.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Finn's buddies told us all about your beef with Finn.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What'd they tell you?
So that he can kill us when we land.<eos> I'm with Amaya, grudgingly.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Professor Stein, does 38 degrees sound right to you?
Do you regret the decision you made back in Ohio?<eos> Giving the boy with leukemia the unapproved drug?<eos> My gut told me I had to do anything I could to keep that boy alive.<eos> No matter what.<eos> What is your gut telling you now?
Mr. Thompson.<eos> I just need five minutes of your time.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> Please.<eos> I apologize for the way I talked to you at the hospital.
They'll never prove anything!<eos> Your husband's wrong.<eos> Marital privilege only applies to words spoken between spouses.<eos> So I can testify against him?<eos> Legally, you can describe every detail of what Mark did to you.
I show you what has been marked as people's 3,<eos> Mr. Wilkes's certificate of death.<eos> What time does it say he died?<eos> 4:06 P.M.<eos> Huh, now, according to the time stamp On the videos Mr. Stone just showed you, Officer Atwater's last so-called act of violence
She's nice to me.<eos> She's kind.<eos> And Walter?<eos> Was he kind?<eos> Did your husband ever hurt you?
Morning!<eos> Hello, Sylvie.<eos> Is this how you're serving lunch now?<eos> Save on the washing up?<eos> Do you remember what I told you about my family?
Yes, and so did all of our mirror jurors.<eos> Heart rates are normal, biometrics are showing they are calm and attentive.<eos> They like Erica.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Ms. Bunson, you say your husband made breakfast for you in the mornings.
Well, this seems really promising, gentlemen.<eos> Promising, indeed.<eos> - I think if each...<eos> - "Promising"?<eos> You're a young associate here, so I'm gonna help you out, okay?
Well, the Covenant of John is a long way from Sunday school, but sure.<eos> Eh, I'm just messing with you.<eos> Dr. McCord went into the Covenant of John compound in Bolivia.<eos> We're lucky to have him work with us.<eos> Did you get a chance to look at the material I sent you this morning?
I knew he was fixated on her murder, but this is just so reckless.<eos> Can you blame him?<eos> I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life?<eos> I thought we were a team... he should've just come to me.<eos> Oh, the way that I came to you about Amy?
Said that a sex offender just moved up by the Rez.<eos> Been hanging out at the rattlesnake.<eos> Got it.<eos> Can I get one of those?<eos> I got something on that belongs to you, lady?
He almost set a record.<eos> He had a real gift.<eos> So what is this about?<eos> Well, troy was treated at eden general, correct?<eos> He ever talk to you about any of his doctors or nurses?
When Des came and asked if I could get him some pento, I thought, "That's odd."<eos> You know, it's not a drug people often use recreationally, but drug choice is subjective, and who am I to judge?<eos> But then one day, you showed up at my door, and you were asking for pento.<eos> You, Dr. Mary Harris.<eos> Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave me and my family alone?
Benvolio.<eos> You mind telling me why your pupils are so pinned?<eos> It's because my future's so bright.<eos> What do you want?<eos> She likes you, you know.
- Did I say...? - Five.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm...<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Hey, I've got something that'll cheer you up.
My husband needed me and I wasn't there.<eos> A few weeks before he died, he came apart.<eos> He said he couldn't take it anymore.<eos> He wanted it to end.<eos> So he asked you to help him die.
_<eos> I'm off now, Mrs Flora.<eos> Oh, goodnight.<eos> - Buona notte.<eos> - Buona notte. I left shepherd's pie and broccoli for you.
The only cop here is me.<eos> But my colleagues do consult for the department.<eos> Sorry, a lot of shenanigans around this place. Even I get tricked sometimes.<eos> Jerry Bice. Welcome to AdRupt.<eos> By shenanigans, do you mean the, uh, prank that Kip Tully played on you?
I'm sure of it.<eos> You owe me another $5.<eos> Not you again.<eos> I am here to make things right for my son.<eos> This is the extra $5 he owes you.
Sustained.<eos> Ms. Keane, answer the question.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Hiss and I were in a relationship.<eos> Isn't it true that Rutger Hiss kept his relationship with Margaret Henderson a secret from you?
But he's so... not crazy-looking.<eos> Rosa, have Abdala and I taught you nothing about stereotyping?<eos> I'm beginning to feel like you're our biggest project, sweetie.<eos> That's enough.<eos> What did he tell you?
And I want them to suffer for it.<eos> Them?<eos> Was there more than one?<eos> I want to say a prayer for my husband where he died.<eos> And then I'll tell you who he was there to meet.
You have a tickle in your throat?<eos> Well, I get a little dry sometimes.<eos> Have some water.<eos> Give her some water.<eos> Do you happen to remember any of the questions Dr. Kupps asked you?
Did you just have a...<eos> Was I in there?<eos> Can we just get this over with, please?<eos> Dr. Chakrabarti. Maybe you should continue with your questions while Dr. Moore collects herself.<eos> Did Ms. Kupps ask you about the other passengers?
- Cross fingers now.<eos> - You, too.<eos> Remember Orwell.<eos> "We will meet each other where there is no darkness."<eos> When I first interviewed you a year ago, I asked you if you thought your investigation would be a defining moment in the history of sport.
You know very well that love is often the motive for the most gruesome of crimes.<eos> It is, but I was on vacation in Aruba when it happened.<eos> Check my credit card statements.<eos> I have photos, too.<eos> The man in the diner, you said he'd give you till midnight, right?
Tell us more about this warehouse where he worked.<eos> May I?<eos> Sherlock, you're on speaker.<eos> Mr. Brunelle, your son failed out of law school and was working at a warehouse in Red Hook at the time of the attack. What?<eos> He never told you about that job, but it's possible you saw some evidence lying around.
Connor had a hat with that written on it.<eos> I thought it was a law firm.<eos> You think this job has something to do with Connor's assault?<eos> That's precisely the question we're trying to answer.<eos> I'll check in with you once we've paid a visit to Morgan and Holt.
Anyone lose recently?<eos> Or particularly badly?<eos> Yes, Jim Florence.<eos> That son of a bitch.<eos> Brett'll give you whatever you need.
- Well?<eos> I can't do this to my stomach.<eos> Maybe you should just stick to saying things my son makes you say. Oh!<eos> The gloves are off, huh?<eos> I can see how your meat didn't turn out, without Maya telling you what to do.
Defend your rule.<eos> Well, it's not my rule.<eos> It's the school's rule.<eos> Oh, so you don't care about these kids at all?<eos> You just do what your boss tells you to?
And this is where it all happens.<eos> Well, it's certainly very orange.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And there she is.<eos> Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
Take a guess why.<eos> What happened?<eos> My six-year-old's birthday party.<eos> Let's just say I'm much better at kicking ass than roller-skating, and leave it at that.<eos> So, did Petty Officer Dean tell you what "something big" was?
He bought me a gun and wanted me to carry it in my purse.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No. I hid it in my closet.<eos> I show you what's been marked as people's exhibit 12.<eos> Is this the gun that Jon bought for you?
But did you tell them that Jon owned a gun?<eos> - No. - Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't think about it.<eos> But when Mr. stone asked you why you were divorced, one of the reasons you gave was this gun.
Yes, very good.<eos> We're two letters over. So we look here, "without hospital".<eos> Now, in terms of letters, what could "hospital" be? - H?<eos> - Yeah, but we need two letters, remember.<eos> If you were to have an accident, if I'd shot you here in the dark...
Write that down.<eos> I apologize, Mr. Booth.<eos> - Your story's just been corroborated.<eos> - By who?<eos> Someone who needs to speak with you immediately.
Howard, I am fine.<eos> Mr. President, you have to take this seriously.<eos> How the hell did this happen?<eos> I think I know.<eos> Did you take the pills I gave you?
Well, this is fun, huh?<eos> Me and you back together again?<eos> I mean, is it just me, or do you have an overwhelming sense of déjà vu?<eos> And I'm happy to do it over and over again until we get to the truth,<eos> Detective Deeks. Yeah, how about we not do that, and you go and get my captain, like I asked you to?
You gonna go get my captain? Deeks, I already told you, he's not available.<eos> Yeah, I remember when you said that earlier.<eos> You know, as a cop, you know what I use more than any of my training?<eos> Intuition.<eos> And you, you know, being the diligent, finely-dressed- in-that-pant-suit cop that you are probably use the same thing, so what's yours telling you right now?
After... the sex.<eos> That's when he told me.<eos> I swear to you, it was after.<eos> That's when he told me he was 16!<eos> He told you he was 16, so how old was he really?
Not forever.<eos> My wife - - Isabella -- she used to love walking on the beach.<eos> It's where I proposed to her.<eos> You've never talked to me about her before.<eos> I told you to leave me alone.
- You all right?<eos> Mr Norton asked if you could leave, it's a big moment for him.<eos> I'll see you later, thanks.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I brought something for you.
They said they knew what I'd done and they kept asking the same questions, over and over again.<eos> I wouldn't say what they wanted, so, so they didn't let me sleep.<eos> They kept pushing and pushing, and the way they looked at me...<eos> The way that young sergeant looked at me -- as if I was a monster.<eos> Inspector Bacchus pushed you into a confession?
He shot my life to pieces.<eos> Him and Tommy Norton.<eos> God, no-one would ever give me another chance after that.<eos> But, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I didn't ask you about the murder.
Why would I lie about having to land there?<eos> Even if I were to believe that the world's most powerful diplomat would travel in a run-down plane...<eos> - Well...<eos> - which I do not... how do you explain the fanfare.<eos> President Fabre gave you at the airport?
My buddies and I, we have night classes, and we meet up afterwards.<eos> You take the same spin class every Tuesday night?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I like the instructor.<eos> Does the name Colton Davis mean anything to you?
Without a warrant, we can't stop that plane, and we need these files to get that warrant.<eos> Sorry, this is just all so crazy.<eos> I-I need to talk to him.<eos> He took your daughter.<eos> He didn't tell you about the trouble that he was in.
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians had access to technology they shouldn't have and didn't want to lose.<eos> And now they've lost it.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> What did you want out of all of this?<eos> I told you what I wanted.
So said a senior White House source, as quoted in the Washington Herald.<eos> Were you aware of this conversation?<eos> No, sir, I was not.<eos> The source went on. "I believe the president understood that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee was not a legitimate threat."<eos> Was this conveyed to you in any way?
Still, the committee's looking forward to Secretary Durant's testimony on this matter.<eos> I have no idea what the secretary will say or not say, but I... have great respect for her and wish her a speedy recovery.<eos> We were operating off of facts and reports coming in at an accelerated rate that day.<eos> I'll try this again.<eos> Did the president indicate to you at any time that he knew this was not a threat? No.
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger Francis Underwood, who you would do anything for.<eos> But did anyone think about the life of Zoe Barnes?<eos> You know, you think you can erase something.<eos> Then you find out that's not possible.<eos> Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me to speak with you.
Good bet it contained a hypodermic needle and whatever tools he needed to break into the Durning home.<eos> Local PD are circulating the sketch, but we're gonna take it over to the morgue in Paramus personally, see if anyone there saw this guy make contact with the M.E. who missed the murder.<eos> I've been trying to get a warrant for Kotite's phone records.<eos> I'm hoping we can track this guy down from the call that Kotite must've made after you goosed him at his club yesterday.<eos> A warrant would be worthwhile, but I can guarantee you that he did not call his assassin after I left.
What you are witnessing, Warden, are solid titanium rods traveling at Mach 7...<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It's not important who I am.<eos> What's important is that I have control of your prison.<eos> Once you release Lonnie Perkins, I will return that control to you.
One minute, she's heading to a client dinner and everything is fine, and the next, she's... Like this.<eos> This client dinner, who was there?<eos> A friend of Helen's from college.<eos> The police have already cleared her.<eos> What did Helen tell you about the case against panetti? Nothing.
I love that show.<eos> Hey, did you see the one where someone brought in just a horse's ass?<eos> No. I missed that one.<eos> (sighs) Well, we've got it up on the website.<eos> It might cheer you up after this fish dies.
she fell off a rooftop. At a rave and she died.<eos> How am I supposed to remember something. That happened a year ago?<eos> There was a big thunderstorm that night.<eos> That ring a bell?<eos> Remember how I told you I kicked Danny out. Because he came home with blood on him but he wasn't hurt?
I'll do community service.<eos> You want me to do the jobs no one else wants?<eos> I'll run the furnace at the dog shelter.<eos> Okay.<eos> How 'bout, uh, I catch you a marlin so you can throw this little guppy back in the kiddie pool.
Would you like one?<eos> Yes, please!<eos> It's lovely.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the whole world.
What are you talking about?<eos> ...city in terror as the killer claims a fourth victim in a grim replay of city in terror and the killer claims an all-too familiar scenario.<eos> He's killing them.<eos> I-It's all happening the same.<eos> You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the world.
Hey, guys?<eos> Not to sound like my mom, but... is that what you're wearing?<eos> Listen. I'm a busy man.<eos> You know a communist spy in the military, you tell one of my aides.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I told them: That I only trust the great Senator Joe McCarthy himself.
Listen. I'm a busy man.<eos> You know a communist spy in the military, you tell one of my aides.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I told them: That I only trust the great Senator Joe McCarthy himself.<eos> Where's that accent from, son? Look.<eos> I'll tell you what I know, but first I need to find out something from you:
Yeah, right this way.<eos> I'ma tell you the same thing I told your friend.<eos> - Eat me.<eos> - Sorry, I'm on duty.<eos> I'm sure Detective Kim informed you that there is a witness who saw you.
I'm actually not a student here.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Stef's a safe person to talk to.<eos> She helped a lot of my friends, helped them get out of trouble.<eos> I thought everything I told you was supposed to be confidential.
[Drew] It's a magazine that Flash and I use to get pumped for workouts.<eos> Oh, boy, this is a lot to take in.<eos> Said the tailor.<eos> Got a sec, Teach?<eos> I've asked you not to call me that.
- Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> Did your mom know that you asked Tamra out three months ago? No.<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> Did she know that Tamra made up some lame excuse to dump you while she went to a rave?
You're every bit as perceptive as they say.<eos> So I wonder, do you really think you're here to question me?<eos> Force of habit, interrogating murderers.<eos> You know what they say. The best defense is a good offense.<eos> Only there is no defense for what I could do to you.
- Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> Did your mom know that you asked Tamra out three months ago? No.<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> Did she know that Tamra made up some lame excuse to dump you while she went to a rave?
Yes, sir.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Agent Pride?<eos> This news of Noah's death is gonna hit the boys hard.<eos> I'd rather they hear it from me, if that's all right with you.
I'll give you their address, too.<eos> It's just business.<eos> Didn't sound like it when you were killing Azoff.<eos> Hmm. Some customers ask you to go easy, others want you to make it hard.<eos> So Wolf did instruct you to kill Azoff?
Okay.<eos> You got it.<eos> I'll be Rogue One and you can be Rogue Two.<eos> Oh, there will never be a Rogue Two.<eos> Agent Goodkin, I'll tell you the same thing I told you over the phone.
I'm writing to you as one mother to another.<eos> Ruby told me that you work for the news.<eos> Please put something on your show about my Danny.<eos> He is innocent.<eos> The articles in this envelope will show you that people with the syndrome my son has are not violent.
I'm not interested in your resignation.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> It's yours.<eos> So, what was this all about?<eos> A distraction to keep you away from your comrades while we turned one of them against you.
Well, an American NGO worker has been taken hostage in Southern Somalia.<eos> I heard about it.<eos> And I feel for the guy, but that situation is too unstable right now.<eos> I'm not gonna send my men into a de facto war zone.<eos> I'm not asking you to.
It's an order form from that bike shop.<eos> Our guy is definitely a customer.<eos> He special-ordered a muffler.<eos> That's his address.<eos> I told you I was gonna hit the bike shop, right?
Because their leaders tell them they should be.<eos> But since 9/11, 180,000 people have died from gun violence in this country, only 94 have been killed by Muslim terrorists.<eos> That is what I would call a perceived issue.<eos> I won't apologize for being passionate.<eos> Nor would I ask you to.
You know, I have spent my entire life trying to get you to like me.<eos> And for what?<eos> More verbal slaps to the heart than one person should have to take?<eos> I mean, why don't you like me?<eos> What have I ever done to you that is so bad?
Well, all I can say is, your mother is hysterical.<eos> My what?<eos> Hello, son.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I told you, you are not my plus one, y... you're not even my minus one.
Rip them to pieces.<eos> Ooh, that's enough.<eos> So, there's nothing you're not telling us?<eos> Scott's burn book mentioned someone named J.P.<eos> Do those initials mean anything to you?
Oh, and Rafael declared his love for Petra.<eos> I do have feelings for you.<eos> But she missed the call. Because she was with her new boyfriend, Chuck, who might have killed Scott.<eos> Scott's burn book mentioned someone named J.P.<eos> Those initials mean anything to you?
I don't understand.<eos> I bring men there.<eos> Customers.<eos> I see.<eos> Everything else I told you was true, I-I swear it. I just... thought that they'd kick me out if they knew that part.
Something true.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't feel my sharpest right now.<eos> I don't think being in the field is the best for me.<eos> So you think needing help precludes you from helping others?
You poke your head up for air, you'll be thrown in a hole so deep, no one will find you.<eos> How will you govern differently from President Haas?<eos> President Haas didn't listen to the people.<eos> I do. It's that simple.<eos> And what are the people saying to you now?
You have a nice smile, you know that, Alex?<eos> Nice trick, Mr. President.<eos> You use us and then you own us.<eos> Well, if your team wants to stay employed and alive, then I guess I do own you.<eos> I'm sure Alice has told you which side I'm really on.
- With good reason.<eos> I thought a lot about our conversation.<eos> When I was a young police officer and things like this would happen to me, I felt very alone.<eos> I wanted to call out every bad cop I encountered, and there were a lot, but as a black gay man,<eos> I never had a superior who was on my side, so the advice I offered you, that came from a different place at a different time.
You know, in Miami, - we call that "cheating."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I...really don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No?<eos> Well, we actually found the letters that he wrote you.
You know, like the kids do with their drugs.<eos> Anyway, I defy you to get a pill in this dog.<eos> There you go.<eos> No, no, give it a minute; he'll spit it out.<eos> All right, remind me the name I used on the last check I gave you.
This is in case my sweet Baby Gavin gets chilly willy.<eos> I warmed it up with the Salisbury steak - so it smells delicious.<eos> - Oh. That's not Baby Gavin.<eos> Uh, Greg?<eos> Did these people tell you that their baby is Baby Gavin?
He's in my bowling league. We're friends.<eos> He's dead, huh?<eos> Fred specialized in cheating spouses, the kind who leave stains in cheap motel rooms.<eos> I imagine, occasionally, he needed you to run a DNA sample for him.<eos> When I went through Fred's financials yesterday, I noticed he wrote quite a few checks to you over the years.
We also went through Fred's phone records yesterday. He talked to you six times last week.<eos> Can we assume it was about the blood samples he wanted you to gather from the copies of the Constitution?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Mr. Drexel, we didn't bring the police with us because we don't care about your minor league embezzlement.<eos> It was a courtesy to you, but it also works in our favor, 'cause it means we can conduct an illegal search for the materials that Fred gave you.
Roger Stone, an old dirty trickster from the Nixon days, may have been involved in the production of these documents.<eos> Look, politics is a rough-and-tumble business, but this is just a cheap shot.<eos> That same year, Stone consulted for Al Sharpton's presidential run that helped disrupt the Democratic primary process.<eos> What Stone is in this for, is to use Sharpton as a disruptive force.<eos> Some out there who follow presidential politics ascribe to you magical powers, consider you the puppet master of the Sharpton campaign.
What did Ms Stevens say happened next?<eos> Well, she dragged Helen's body into the garage and then... shaved her head.<eos> Then what did she do?<eos> She put the body in the car and drove it up to Sassafras.<eos> Did Ms Stevens tell you what she did when she got to her destination?
What about the head shaving?<eos> You claimed that the defendant shaved Helen's head in the garage, post-murder.<eos> Correct?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - That is what Ms Stevens told you
Mr Jackson, j... oh, fuck!<eos> I think Mr Jackson put it there.<eos> I think he fuckin' put it there!<eos> - Okay...<eos> - You... what did I do to you?
This is an interrogation room, isn't it? Just somewhere where we can talk, Mr. Gorham.<eos> Nothing to worry about this time.<eos> What do you mean this time?<eos> I mean if you don't want to have to come back here of a more official conversation, then sit down and listen up.<eos> When I asked you if you knew Roy Booker the other day, you said you didn't.
We're guessing that your wife never found out about it either.<eos> The thing is, I asked around at the 15th, and there was a cop there who remembered the incident.<eos> And the way he tells it, you and Booker were real pals.<eos> You felt like you owed Roy.<eos> When he asked you to make up a story about a detective pointing a gun at you, you did. I think I need to speak with a lawyer.
You like numbers, give me one.<eos> 140 pounds.<eos> Soaking wet.<eos> Now get out of here before I snap you in two.<eos> Mr. Brady, I have a letter here from your board ordering you to furnish said investigator with any records or files he might require.
He says you do.<eos> He says you let him on the lot.<eos> You have to believe me, I didn't...<eos> You didn't what?<eos> Think about the job Mr. Brady had given you?
I'll give you the model for ten grand.<eos> How about we stick to the homicide, Mr. Ukhov?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand.<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Well, like I told you, I'm not here today in any official capacity, but, take my word, things are getting more official by the minute.
You know, she seemed to take some pleasure in telling us you got your roots done.<eos> We're good for a few minutes, right?<eos> Where'd you get these?<eos> That's not important. What is important is what we suspect Fyodor Ukhov did with them.<eos> He asked you to look into the man in those photos,
They matched prints we found all over the cash.<eos> Roy discovered what you were doing and shook you down.<eos> You paid him off at least once, but I'm guessing you weren't interested in making it an ongoing arrangement.<eos> You needed to get rid of him, but the last thing you wanted was a murder investigation.<eos> You had heard about all the drama that Roy and his ex-wife were mixed up in, thanks to the friend who recommended Roy to you,
Look, I don't understand you people.<eos> I mean, my clients, Nate and Clay, they are fine young men...<eos> Who are both associated with suspect sport betting and match fixing.<eos> You're either a very bad manager or a very good one.<eos> But I already told you, I don't know anything about match fixing or illegal gambling.
They'll take your cooperation into consideration in their recommendation for sentencing...<eos> It was self-defence.<eos> I'll get off.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> Juries can be very hostile about one-punch attacks, and given your history of violence, if I was your lawyer, I'd be urging you to get as many people in your corner as possible.
It's discrimination!<eos> Our treatment of you has nothing to do with discrimination, and everything to do with your propensity to lie.<eos> How dare you!<eos> You gamble a lot.<eos> It's left you in considerable debt.
You're going back to him with good news.<eos> Come on, don't be such a sook.<eos> See you at remand tomorrow, then.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I assume Richard told you about the new evidence?
Unless you tell us who those major players are.<eos> So I end up dead, like Oliver Pittman, or run off the road like Eddie Cooke?<eos> Nate, we know three or four other minor players, just like you, but we can only protect the first person who talks to us. Do you understand that?<eos> Yep.<eos> So, who told you what to bet on?
That man, you see... he gave me a choice.<eos> He said if I was to make any trouble, I would have to choose between killing myself, or him... killing my granddaughter.<eos> So, the only real question you've gotta ask yourself is this.<eos> Who do you love more, yourself or your son?<eos> Was that the man who told you to import the precursors?
Right, last season Faulkes approached me asking me if I'd be interested in being involved in match fixing.<eos> Which matches?<eos> What sport?<eos> Cricket, footy, soccer, any sport connected to the Pax Sport Foundation.<eos> And what did Mr Faulkes ask you to do?
Okay, that's a theory.<eos> Here's another.<eos> The drugs belong to you.<eos> Two things.<eos> Number one, in order for you to posit that theory, you'd have to make an assumption I strongly discourage you from making.
Halcon gets business.<eos> What we didn't want was for things to get personal, because we couldn't win.<eos> Not against that kind of crazy.<eos> We never would have signed off on hurting his sister.<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, we believe you.
- This is bullshit.<eos> - Guard! - Listen, you don't have to talk to us.<eos> But this thing comes out, instead of getting out in five years, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in here.<eos> - All right, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Let's start with who's telling you to pick fights with guys who are about to get out.
- What are you talking about? - Louis, I hate to draw comparisons for you, but is there a chance you're putting yourself in this man's shoes because it's so similar to what happened between you and Tara?<eos> - I didn't cheat on her.<eos> - But you behaved poorly.<eos> It ended the relationship, and you wanted her back.<eos> - And I told you that I do not want to talk about getting closure with Tara anymore.
My proposal is simple.<eos> Drink tea, gain trust.<eos> The only way to know if you can really trust someone is to trust them and... find out.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I told you they could be trusted.
'Cause I'm the one selling him the cocaine.<eos> Oh, no, that's OK, waiter.<eos> I bring my own chair places.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Has anyone ever told you that you look an awful lot like Gil Stone?
Are you spying on us for her?<eos> No, um, I came to tell you I'd been served with a subpoena.<eos> Well, Brian, I don't need your help, because you can't apologize without admitting guilt, which is the whole thing that I don't want to do.<eos> Louis, I don't know if you've noticed, but that's pretty much going to happen anyway.<eos> If I may... it is admitting guilt, and it is taking a chance, but if I were thinking of suing you for the horrible things you said to me... that's what I'd want to hear.
How do you account for the fact that he made 17 calls to you in a week?<eos> We were discussing students.<eos> 17 calls?<eos> Well, we had a lot to talk about.<eos> Was he putting pressure on you?
You don't need to worry about it.<eos> No.<eos> It's too dangerous to have you around.<eos> As of now, you're no longer my advisor.<eos> How do you know I'll keep being loyal to you, Mr. President?
When he saw who it was, he let her go.<eos> You think he knew her?<eos> And then he let her kill him?<eos> Mrs. Tannetti, you're charged in the complaint with a felony violation of section 125.27 of the New York State Penal Code, in which it's alleged that you committed a second degree murder in the death of Frankie Belmont.<eos> Having in mind the rights which were just read to you, will you be entering a plea?
When you were a baby inside of me, you took up all my strength.<eos> That's why she's so sick.<eos> You think he knew her?<eos> And then he let her kill him?<eos> Having in mind the rights which were just read to you, will you be entering a plea?
That's the second time you said that.<eos> Well, you know what they say. First time's confusion, second time's confession.<eos> - What's this about?<eos> - Standard procedure.<eos> So now, he asked you to cover for him, this is what Wednesday night, nine or ten?
Marty Summers is my American accountant.<eos> He's not a teacher.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What have I done to you?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.<eos> Come on!<eos> Puddin'!<eos> Let's go home.<eos> This is crown jewels here, Mr. Wayne. And you do understand my legal exposure. If anyone knew what I procured for you.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?<eos> That's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.<eos> And I'm after someone on my naughty list.<eos> I've been waiting one year, three weeks... six days and... 14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.<eos> And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
You are a visionary like me, sir. This is incredible.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> What the fuck? Hey!<eos> Who has security guards when they take shits?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you, Buffett?
Where are we on the Fredericks video?<eos> On schedule for tomorrow afternoon.<eos> I was hoping for some personal time tomorrow afternoon.<eos> Say no more.<eos> I will stay late tonight and get it to you first thing in the morning.
We tried.<eos> He's unreachable, sir.<eos> RESEARCH MISSION AFRICA<eos> You need to take me seriously.<eos> I've been chasing you across the planet for 3 weeks now.
You were my favorite teacher.<eos> I was?<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - She never gets tired of hearing that.<eos> Mrs. Fenton, I will return the money that Mr. Bix and Mr. Farragut took from you to pay me back.
I'm sorry.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The Lord's watching.<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> What'd these people ever do to you?
You intend to make me chase?<eos> I have a proposition.<eos> - And I'm wary of propositions, miss.<eos> - Missus.<eos> I'm not sure if my friend filled you in on the details.
- Yes, it is.<eos> I just wanted to take a moment to come up here and to thank you for everything that you've done for us.<eos> It's been a long while since we've been able to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.<eos> Before you and your men arrived, all of our everyday pleasures had been taken from us.<eos> To have those back, even if only for a moment, well, it might not mean that much to you, but, by God, we are all eternally grateful to you.
And that's your problem.<eos> Because you're the one that went into the giant cow-showing profession, not me.<eos> So, it's you that's gonna figure out how we're gonna see a giant fucking cow, or else I'm gonna call the local news, and I'm gonna have them send down the guy that does that "Shame on You" business-buster thing, and he's gonna come down with multiple cameras...<eos> Multiple cameras.<eos> ...and ask you why you think it's okay that somebody with disabilities isn't allowed to see a giant cow like everyone else.
Oh, yes, of course.<eos> This is the annex.<eos> It was the stables before we had it adapted for Will.<eos> Um, I'll give you a set of car keys, and put you on the insurance.<eos> Nathan will show you how to use the ramp.
Um, obviously... Well, I would hope that you could get on.<eos> It would be nice if he could think of you as a friend rather than a paid professional.<eos> Do you have any questions?<eos> No.<eos> Then let's introduce you to Will.
Yes.<eos> Negative.<eos> Please don't worry. You're perfectly fine.<eos> No, thank you. Thank you, Doctor.<eos> I don't know who emailed you what, but everything looks fine.
That's him.<eos> - Everyone I know always says... - That's fine.<eos> Thank you, Mr. De Vries.<eos> You can go now.<eos> So. Mr. De Vries says he spoke to you at Harry's Rainbow Grill.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> She is super-slippery.<eos> I gotta go sit down.<eos> Ma'am, as I've told you, we're doing everything we can.
Very sorry.<eos> "very Sorry"?<eos> Do you have any idea why you'd be saying this?<eos> No.<eos> Why was someone shooting at you?
I'm putting you on a plane out of the country.<eos> If you stay, come back, you will go to jail.<eos> You get it?<eos> Oh, Mr. Sloane.<eos> We normally would welcome you to Master Po's humble home, but it's clear that you're here with dubious intentions.
We all got something.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You've done some strange pulling yourself.<eos> I'm one generation removed from a carnival barker.<eos> What lie did I tell you?
- And what way would that be, chief?<eos> - Each one killed the last.<eos> Yes, that is true.<eos> Excuse me, who are you?<eos> Sir, I told you, you cannot be in here.
We'll take them.<eos> Everybody.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want you to appreciate the quality of the product I am bringing to you.
I'm not.<eos> - Then why should I do this?<eos> - I would.<eos> If it were my son.<eos> Like I said before, I don't know what they told you, okay, but I never touched him, okay, ever.
I will not pass judgment on the other side of the world in a room full of like-minded people.<eos> It would be obscene and meaninglessly fade away.<eos> Every gesture of resistance which is void of either risk or impact is nothing but a cry for recognition.<eos> I really have to go now.<eos> I'm still considering that magazine I told you about in New York.
You have to chew it. It's sweet.<eos> Very sweet.<eos> Delicious.<eos> Very sweet.<eos> What did I tell you?
I've rarely been so pleasantly detached as these last three months.<eos> Nothing but working, walking, reading.<eos> Now take a look at this view.<eos> Isn't it incredible?<eos> What does it remind you of?
For those 10 seconds, you are completely free.<eos> Now, here you come telling me I can't do it, that I'm letting down my race if I go.<eos> What's that supposed to do for me?<eos> God gave you a great gift, Mr. Owens.<eos> Maybe he can tell you what to do with it.
To a cop?<eos> Really?<eos> Unless you start talking to me, we're going down.<eos> All rise.<eos> Why won't he talk to you?
He said, "I did it."<eos> He said...<eos> I did it.<eos> I did it.<eos> Mrs. Lassiter, these vile things that your husband said to you, did that happen often?
- Yes.<eos> I should've Googled you. I've been...<eos> I've been using all the wrong swear words.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't ruin your big moment.<eos> Look, Geri, I don't know what Tucker has been telling you.
I don't care who the biggest moron is!<eos> I want to know how we're getting out of here.<eos> This has got to end.<eos> I got you into this and I'll get you out of it, but it shits me that this bitch is ripping us off.<eos> I want him to give back everything he gave you.
Everything was obtained legally and submitted to you in discovery.<eos> Really?<eos> Everything?<eos> Everything.<eos> The woman who brought that evidence to you, where is she now?
As you can see, I can't exactly shake your hand. Of course.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, don't be sorry. You didn't do it.<eos> Or did you?<eos> Doctor, this is the blackmail note I was talking to you about.
Lda.<eos> What?<eos> - Why would I lie?<eos> Because you're a guy.<eos> Okay, but think about it: you go out to a party, and have someone take pictures of you.
You have to understand.<eos> This isn't a recent phenomenon.<eos> Look, Henry Fuseli painted this in 1781.<eos> See the demon sitting on her chest?<eos> Did Dr. Sykes ever tell you that sleep paralysis is also known as the old hag syndrome?
Linda has seen it.<eos> My sister saw it.<eos> It attacked me last night.<eos> - It attacked you. - Yes.<eos> - I told you it can make you hallucinate.
Yes, sir, but I... I really must...<eos> Now, you need to tighten your leash and bring King and the MFDP in line or by God,<eos> Hubert Humphrey is never gonna be my vice president or anything else!<eos> - Sir, I...<eos> - He won't be able to get elected dogcatcher and you won't have nobody in the Senate to carry water for you.
Net opium.<eos> It brought Blaise.<eos> When you chew it, it's not so bad. It reduces the pain.<eos> How long have you worked here?<eos> No, I told you, I ...
Mr. Healy, what are you doing?<eos> Go away, Holly.<eos> Healy, stop!<eos> You don't have to kill him!<eos> Mr. Healy, if you kill this man, I will never speak to you again.
Weapon, weapon!<eos> Come on!<eos> Who the hell is it?<eos> Don't open it!<eos> Ma'am, what's wrong with you?
- Well technically this isn't a personal phone call.<eos> - Mr. Weiss, we have a situation here so I'm gonna need you to lie quiet.<eos> - Who's in there?<eos> Is that John Lennon?<eos> - Mr. Weiss I asked you to lie quiet here and not get in the way of what's going on.
- Did you always wanna be a doctor? - Yes.<eos> But why is that relevant?<eos> - Say you're walking down the street, all right, and this kid runs into the middle of the street and gets hit by a car.<eos> You run to save him but by the time you get there, there's a crowd, there's cops, they won't let you through.<eos> You say you're a doctor, they don't believe you.
It's so long since we've been on holiday and we're anxious to be off.<eos> Besides, brahms seems so fond of you.<eos> I only wish we had an opportunity to, uh... To explain to you the vicissitudes of a child as unique as our brahms.<eos> But, uh, you'll pick it up, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, I've got something to, um, help you along.
I have three other students who say your son started it.<eos> Those are all Billy's friends.<eos> Mr. Harvey, don't barge into my office and tell me how to run my school.<eos> Fine.<eos> I won't tell you how to run it, but you don't punish my son when he isn't responsible for the problem.
You wanna get rid of her, get rid of her.<eos> Time to focus on getting them kids back, eh?<eos> Just get her to write another note first.<eos> Maggie: This is two streets away from me.<eos> Sergeant Henderson: Sergeant mathews told you to come back Monday.
- You don't have to say it.<eos> I know, he's dead.<eos> Dead, and buried, and... moldering in the ground for the past two centuries.<eos> I just want to know... I just need to know if he really did die on that battlefield.<eos> He told you he would stand and die with his men on that bloody moor.
That Wednesday.<eos> So, two days before you buried her, you applied for her trust fund.<eos> I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?
- Which is a pleasure.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> As you know, I presented your figures in our last steering committee.<eos> Unfortunately, a lot of questions came up about some of the data you provided.<eos> So I defended your work since I know that the things we ask you to deliver are complicated and—
It will protect you against any rival.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Any news?<eos> What are all these?<eos> I told you I don't want to wear a veil.
It was that exercise.<eos> Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?
There ain't no time to be overwhelmed!<eos> Well done, Connie...<eos> Yes!<eos> Here's your beautiful little son, Connie.<eos> What did I tell you?
He may have a weakness in the chest, that's why he wears those odd sweaters.<eos> I think that's the fashion.<eos> What a shame about tonight, Mr Smith.<eos> Tommy, please.<eos> Will your wife have kept you back some tea?
I was hearing about how the baby shouldn't sleep on its back in case it gets sick, and it got me to thinking, what would make it sick?<eos> Oh, there are lots of little things.<eos> All babies get gripes and upsets.<eos> Such as what, Nurse?<eos> Have you had a little look at the pamphlet I gave you?
How to shape it, how to elevate it, and...<eos> - how my complexes will help...<eos> - Boring.<eos> We've heard that speech from you a million times and a half.<eos> I told you I do not want a fluff piece.
And neither did anybody else in this damn department.<eos> So why do I get singled out for it?<eos> Because you were the closest to him.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?
- I taught you well.<eos> Go home, Alex.<eos> I'm letting you off early.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened out there... that bothers you the most?
Now imagine what he or somebody like him can do with these things.<eos> Yeah, I hear you.<eos> Who is the one person you don't see here?<eos> A chief.<eos> And what does that tell you?
So I told one.<eos> - Why are you coming clean now?<eos> - 'Cause I can't live with this.<eos> Especially after Luke saving my life.<eos> If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.
Fifty?<eos> 100?<eos> Each with a completely different agenda.<eos> There is no such thing as a singular message.<eos> And anyone who tells you he's got a singular message is probably teaching at a university or writing a blog.
I remember.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Captain Webb.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Has everything been explained to you?
I'm from the Department of Justice.<eos> I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint... - Really?<eos> We have to do this in public?<eos> - Issued by the US government against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.<eos> This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court.
- Think about it.<eos> He was obsessed with how much money Otis was making at the dispensary, wasn't he?<eos> And it was his idea to sell the brownies, wasn't it?<eos> And he's the one who called Charlie Douglas pretending to be Otis, wasn't he?<eos> Did he tell you how screwed you were gonna get?
It's curious.<eos> It's a lot more than curious.<eos> This is tragic. That's my daughter, detective.<eos> And even so, she'd be the one I'd be looking for if I was still on the force.<eos> Nobody's pointing a finger at you.
You're a priest! You're supposed to believe in this shit.<eos> At least take a look at her.<eos> Father, I am telling you that the woman I love is possessed by the Devil.<eos> Now, you say that you love me like a son.<eos> Well, I'm asking you for your help.
You're in the real estate business.<eos> You don't build an empire off a 1.4 percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger.<eos> You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.<eos> What you ought to be doing is buying up plots of land then turning around and leasing said plots to franchisees who as a condition of their deal, should be permitted to lease from you and you alone.<eos> This will provide you with two things.
I couldn't agree more.<eos> What did you see when you arrived at Bundy?<eos> From the approach we could see the female victim, and there was a great deal of blood in the cracks of the tiled walkway.<eos> Officer Riske used his flashlight to point out several items.<eos> And what did he point out to you, sir?
No, man!<eos> No!<eos> Yes?<eos> Thank you.<eos> 462, um, the reason why I asked you here today is that the sheriff's department reviewed some court records, and it appears that you once accused your husband of abusing you physically?
I'll tell you now, Mr. Mayor, my group didn't spend all that money for nothing.<eos> The casino will go ahead.<eos> This is a betrayal. By voting against the casino, you betrayed me. And Marseille.<eos> You maybe, but not Marseille.<eos> The city doesn't belong to you.
- I don't know.<eos> This is a betrayal.<eos> By voting against the casino, you betrayed me. And Marseille.<eos> You maybe, but not Marseille.<eos> The city doesn't belong to you.
I'm the social worker of the regiment.<eos> Present rifle.<eos> Turn left.<eos> Down pillows.<eos> Captain Nathan Delille... On behalf of the Secretary of Defense... We distinguish you with the Cross of Merit.
Like us, Mr Shelby.<eos> Let's talk about trust, then, shall we?<eos> You are not a direct relation to the Romanovs.<eos> You are Georgian.<eos> And the palace where you live in Hampton Court is in fact a grace-and-favour house donated to you rent-free by the British Crown.
Samson.<eos> Lord Kitchener.<eos> Are you saying you took the life of a policeman?<eos> Oh, Father... .. now there is another life to be taken.<eos> If there is a voice telling you to take a life, you must ignore it.
Fuck me, Tom, I don't know how you do it.<eos> Incoming!<eos> - Mr Shelby? - Yes!<eos> Oh!<eos> Your little boy looks so much like you. Yes.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As we agreed, your jeweller will now select items to a total value of £70,000.<eos> When you have selected your chosen items, they will be put into a box and stored.<eos> When you have fulfilled your part of the deal, the box will be delivered to you.
I'm just asking.<eos> I hope they'll piss it off.<eos> And not just the Church, the people too.<eos> That's not very kind.<eos> What have the Poles done to you?
- We have to believe.<eos> - Really?<eos> What?<eos> What's hidden behind that forehead?<eos> - My forehead doesn't interest you.
Must have figured you'd get nasty.<eos> I don't know how you figured it out, but you found out he was the witness.<eos> No.<eos> Maybe you went over to his place to talk him out of it?<eos> I told you I didn't know it was his place.
We'll have to wait and see, won't we?<eos> Are you acting like this is my fault?<eos> It's not for me to say, is it, sir?<eos> How is it my fault?<eos> I told you to let me do the talking, did I not?
It is a good sign.<eos> It is a normal sign.<eos> I want to be normal.<eos> I want to be good.<eos> You must think I'm lying to you.
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.<eos> I believe you've restarted the program, and I would like to know...<eos> Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This whole city has turned its back on you, despite you risking your life to save it over and over again.
Bruce Wayne, I suppose.<eos> So it's a job?<eos> You're here to pay the rent?<eos> Surely not.<eos> All that's happened to you this last year.
- About everything.<eos> Bruce... I never should have made that oath to you.<eos> - I was arrogant and naive... and I'm sorry.<eos> I've tried to do the right thing, but... what a fool I've been.<eos> Uh... what kind of drugs did they give you?
See you later, sucker!<eos> Didn't even give him the dollar.<eos> I know it seems like I blew it, but you got to give me another crack at him.<eos> Now that I'm aware of our fascinating past, I have all the ammo that I need.<eos> Perhaps you would've had that ammo if you had read the file Diaz offered you.
- How dare me?<eos> How dare you?<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> - Wow, your help feels an awful lot like pity, so do me a favor and don't ever help me again.<eos> - Wow, well, you didn't seem to mind me helping you when I got you your job back at the Nine-Nine.
How dare you?<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> - Wow, your help feels an awful lot like pity, so do me a favor and don't ever help me again.<eos> - Wow, well, you didn't seem to mind me helping you when I got you your job back at the Nine-Nine.<eos> - I didn't ask you to do that.
I have got to stop living my life out loud.<eos> I've had a hell of a day.<eos> I've got a lot going on in my life, more than Peralta ruining my house, so can we please drop the charade so I can get home already?<eos> Absolutely, sir.<eos> Wait, I should tell you. Before you got real with me... I did rip out all these wires.
Let me show you something.<eos> This way.<eos> Mr Cheuk.<eos> How's your journey?<eos> I'll treat you to something special.
Mr Cheuk.<eos> How's your journey?<eos> I'll treat you to something special.<eos> Shrimps and crabs are local specialties.<eos> After food we'll find two shampoo girls for you.
You see your life in romantic terms, but it's a fantasy.<eos> You feed your mind with lies.<eos> Why are you speaking to me in this way?<eos> Because I'm trying to help you.<eos> What do you think you're doing with the broadcast I gave you?
- Oopsy daisy!<eos> - Mm. Oh, my goodness!<eos> Now here... not gonna worry.<eos> There.<eos> I didn't ask you to destroy a forest, did I?
So he never told you his real name?<eos> No.<eos> He said his name was Linden.<eos> Jack Linden.<eos> He never told you who he was.
The choice that we have is not to do the deal today or next week. The choice we have is to do the deal today, now, this minute. Or we don't do the deal at all.<eos> All you need to know is that Tradepass is buying farm machinery from Farrago Holdings.<eos> Uh, Frisky.<eos> You see, ultimately, Mr Ertun, this is about trust.<eos> I trust you, and, uh, I'm asking you to trust me.
Are you family?<eos> - Then I need to ask you to step out so we can speak privately.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Look, I don't know what that lady told you, but I...
Two days after Kelly dies, he risks his own life to save a stranger's kid from the train tracks, and you're saying he's not a reliable guy?<eos> Mr. Golkar...<eos> Damien Thorn is the best photographer out there, hands down.<eos> But he's also the most selfless, courageous guy I've ever met.<eos> And if these aren't the qualities you want in your collective, then good luck to you.
I'm nobody.<eos> You know my name, so you know who I am.<eos> Which means you know what kind of a mistake it would be to try to steal from me, right?<eos> I wouldn't dream of stealing from you.<eos> No, I came here to provide you with a valuable service.
I wouldn't dream of stealing from you.<eos> No, I came here to provide you with a valuable service.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Which is what?<eos> I came to show you that Mr. Proctor was mistaken when he told you that Banshee was a safe place for you to set up your manufacturing.
It was by a lake, and I remember that you teared up during their vows.<eos> Pollen count was off the charts up there.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> This is invitation only, and I asked you to speak to my lawyer if you want...<eos> And I asked you if you were having an affair with Laura Parks.
I'm... just trying to understand Rosa.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Do you think Fournier had an affair with your wife?<eos> My generation was less uptight about sexual mores than yours.<eos> That's not what I asked you.
There's nothing wrong with me!<eos> Mr. McGill, maybe we could just - take a break and...<eos> - Ernie, shut up!<eos> You think about ‭the choice you're making.<eos> I already told you he wasn't here.
Think I told you that.<eos> - I just didn't know what to say.<eos> - Oh, that's the thing..<eos> You don't have to say anything special.<eos> I told you, it's okay about what happened.
Go to hell!<eos> I got a better idea, Sheriff.<eos> You were depressed, drinking too much.<eos> After what you put your family through.<eos> I'm surprised it took you so long to do it.
Is that it? Did my kids send you to check on me?<eos> Well, you can put in your report to my special agent son that I know who I am.<eos> I don't need anybody to take care of me. And I feel fine.<eos> I even got my appetite back.<eos> I thought you might be hungry. I made a sandwich for you.
I don't remember.<eos> Stop me when you start remembering.<eos> You get sent up for a murder you say you didn't commit.<eos> You get a second chance to plead your case.<eos> Harlee visits you then goes after Kovach.
You found her.<eos> You were her friend.<eos> Why didn't you come forward and follow up?<eos> Look, like I said, I was on the street.<eos> Did a Detective Wozniak talk to you about Rita's murder?
We haven't accomplished everything we set out to do.<eos> But the one thing my constituents have always had... is the pride that they take in being represented by one of their own.<eos> I refuse to rob them of that.<eos> Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.<eos> We'll reassess our thinking and get back to you.
- We're having a baby! - I love you.<eos> The wedding, which was a simple affair, and took place at City Hall two months later... was a happy event. But as Bobby's brother in law said: life has it's own agenda.<eos> Yes? What do you want?<eos> Could you turn down the radio, just a little?<eos> I'm not asking you to turn it off. My wife gets these migraines.
No.<eos> Rhonda, if you're being truthful, let's try and understand why Andre's doubting you.<eos> I do understand why Andre's doubting me.<eos> It's because he's paranoid, which always precedes a bipolar break.<eos> Has he told you about his mental health?
She's always getting me to play make believe with her.<eos> It sounds to me like Olivia is about two years old.<eos> Yes.<eos> But she isn't, is she?<eos> Can you describe what the memory loss feels like to you?
Of course.<eos> Do you know who that is?<eos> No.<eos> Should I?<eos> If any memories relevant to the case return to you, please contact Louise here.
I wonder why that is?<eos> Perhaps because we can see them.<eos> We can, that's true, and they're hard to look at, but how many of them are there?<eos> - Twenty-two.<eos> - And what does that tell you?
I really don't know what that means.<eos> "If the glove don't fit, you must acquit."<eos> An inhaler doesn't fit how we picture a crazed killer trying to stab someone 22 times between hits off his Ventolin.<eos> No. That's not why.<eos> I told you why.
I don't even know where that first comment came from. It just...<eos> And then when you confronted me, I was... well, I was ashamed.<eos> I don't know if I told you this or not, but...<eos> I have a sister, and I really respect women.<eos> Probably doesn't mean anything to you now, but I'm truly, truly sorry.
I'll do it.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Thanks, mister.<eos> You're, like, the only nice person I've ever met!<eos> But first I want to hear how this happened to you.
Maybe you didn't take enough.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Agent Einstein informed me that you requested that she administer an illicit substance to you in your rather reckless attempt to talk to an alleged mass murderer.<eos> Yeah, and administer them she did.<eos> These are what I gave you, Agent Mulder.
He's the only lead we got, Tony, and I sure as hell don't have any other witnesses.<eos> You sure you don't recognize him?<eos> No.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What's wrong with you, man?
You can look at the dead one too, although I don't really think it's necessary.<eos> We know who he is.<eos> Who?<eos> Steve Adams.<eos> The one you called Turk that I emailed you about last year?
17th and 18th centuries, at 9:30pm.<eos> -15th and... - Sorry, I was just...<eos> - Where were you?<eos> - Around.<eos> I told you to put on the suit.
It's still too soon, I guess.<eos> We have to keep our distance.<eos> But as you all say, "todo se andará."<eos> Excuse me. I'll call you later.<eos> How many times have I told you to knock before entering?
The thing is that we have traveled backward in time a few hours and without the need for doors.<eos> - Shit!<eos> There's no time to lose, gentlemen.<eos> How the devil did he do it?<eos> Didn't I tell you to knock before entering?
- Thank you.<eos> Gentlemen, find him a bed, he's not out of danger yet.<eos> If this isn't a joke, it sure seems like one.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> I asked you for a file on the last year of Ministry activities and you sent me 18 pages full of unitemized receipts and incomplete mission reports.
I give up.<eos> Your point calls my whole life as a writer into question.<eos> The hotel looks like a set from a Rumanian film.<eos> They also got me on a fire truck to wave at people.<eos> Yes, along with the beauty queen. I'll tell you later.
I've been busy.<eos> Your mother told her a story a few days before she died.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> She'd been to visit you at the youth home.<eos> She was upset because someone had stolen the red sneakers she'd given you, and that the thief had beaten you badly and you'd been blamed.
Let's go make nice with Mrs. Allen.<eos> I was awfully hard on her yesterday, and I feel just plain sick about it.<eos> Community relations.<eos> I'm all in.<eos> Detective, my lawyer told you to stay away from me.
Yeah.<eos> Uh, go big or...<eos> Well?<eos> Uh, um, I can't.<eos> I'm sorry. Go big or go home... It must seem like an appealing strategy, and the smart move would be for us to tell you what you want to hear, but, uh, it's business suicide.
Yet it turns out a company, Greenfern Consultancy Services, has been paying him nearly £2,000 a month.<eos> You are the chief executive.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> It's possible he's being paid.<eos> But what I told you was true...
Can you tell the committee here what was the most embarrassing of all these alleged incidents?<eos> I think the one that was the most embarrassing was his descriptions of pornography involving women with large breasts engaged in a variety of sex with different people or animals.<eos> That was the thing that embarrassed me the most and made me feel the most humiliated.<eos> Professor, I'm going to yield the floor now to my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.<eos> Professor Hill, you testified that you drew an inference that Judge Thomas might want you to look at pornographic films, but you told the FBI specifically that he never asked you to watch the films.
But the fact is flatly he never asked you to look at pornographic movies with him?<eos> With him?<eos> - No, he did not.<eos> - No, he did not.<eos> Professor Hill, you said you took it to mean Judge Thomas wanted to have sex with you, but in fact, he never did ask you to have sex, correct?
I was hoping I could have a quick word with you, if that's okay.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sit.<eos> Okay, so let me start by saying... I get why you've been quiet through all of this.<eos> I'm sure a lot of people much smarter than me have told you that's the way to go.
I fired him.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> I say we're a lot alike.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We're gonna shop around a little, then we'll get back to you.
I'm crazy about you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> I'm gonna need that bathrobe dry-cleaned.<eos> Could I talk to you?
- That's what he wanted.<eos> - I wanted what you wanted!<eos> We're gonna need to take a sonogram before we can operate. And to do that, we'll need you fully erect.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna happen.<eos> We can give you an injection in your penis to stimulate an erection, or if you prefer, we can give you some privacy with your girlfriend while she assists you.
Do you understand?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Well that's the problem, Father.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> This might cheer you up.
Pick makhandla.<eos> What's his name?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Makhandla!<eos> Did the warrant officer tell you what you were to do the next day as an escort at a hanging?
The noise.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Don't hold on so tight next time, or he'll pull you down with him.<eos> Then you'll look like a puss, won't you?<eos> Did the warrant officer say anything to you after this?
No.<eos> No, I...<eos> Why is that?<eos> No.<eos> Why? Anthony didn't talk to you?
You've got to get tasteless.<eos> I shall say, "Mrs. Altman, how much money "have you made out of that tattoo since 1945?"<eos> You want more of that, do you?<eos> You think that's helpful?<eos> So, now, Mr. Irving, I will ask you to explain why, if, as you claim, there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz, the gratings taken in 1945 by the Polish authorities from Morgue 1 in Crematorium ll were covered in cyanide,
This poor little child has been taught a racist ditty by her racist and perverted father.<eos> Have you ever read Edward Lear?<eos> Hilaire Belloc?<eos> They haven't brought a libel action, Mr. Irving.<eos> You sued because you said that we had called you a racist and an extremist.
And then?<eos> Do what with it?<eos> What the hell did you and Jimmy do together?<eos> Things I would never have dreamed were possible.<eos> I know you think Jimmy was special, but I wouldn't trust everything he gave you.
Thank you for taking care of me.<eos> If you need anything...<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you too.<eos> We'll show you to your room now.
Wonder how many days it will take my heartbeat to slow.<eos> If whatever killed detective Henry and the medical examiner is contagious, then we've all been exposed.<eos> I'm guessing that whatever it is, you can't get it unless you've been exposed to contaminated blood.<eos> The medical examiner had the most intense and prolonged exposure, which may explain why he succumbed first.<eos> At your earliest convenience, I'm going to need a written report stating exactly what Detective Henry told you.
How are Mr. Reese and Detective Fusco faring in their new assignments?<eos> John, have you found your first number?<eos> Yeah, he's planning to bomb a school.<eos> I'm about 20 feet from his apartment.<eos> Detective Fusco, how are you doing with the name I gave you?
- What's that, honey?<eos> I think this isn't gonna work.<eos> But I can...<eos> We can do it however you--<eos> I can't give you what Jamie gave you is the problem.
Sparkling, please. - I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew you guys did house calls, but Jesus.<eos> Well, we're sorry for the inconvenience but we're here to collect on 941 tax.<eos> Look, Mack, I don't think I need to tell you how serious this is.
-I already did.<eos> -No, you can't. People will say you've had this persecution done to be called a saint.<eos> That they didn't actually oppressed that much. That we play the victims. We like suffering.<eos> But they're actually killing us.<eos> Look, I only ask you to be more humble.
Now, what do you like to sleep on, foam rubber or feathers?<eos> What are you nuts?<eos> Don't set a room up for her.<eos> Have you no conscience?<eos> Didn't your parents ever teach you that social injustice is wrong?
Well, I'm telling you, I left my...<eos> I was just...<eos> All I see is you running out of a café.<eos> How do I know that's yours?<eos> 'Cause I'm telling you it's my brief...
- No, he's greedy.<eos> Somebody paid him to plant it.<eos> I'm sure you will find this unpalatable, but consider your target.<eos> Whether or not Mr. Hynes is a "true believer," he got eight Homeland Security troops and five civilians killed.<eos> And, I might add, he prevented you from going to Santa Monica to find your son, so... save your sympathy for his victims.
You know, last week, the press said that I was involved in a torrid love affair with Cary Grant.<eos> I should be so lucky.<eos> Well, that's why I trust my instincts.<eos> They're more reliable than what I'm told to believe.<eos> And what are your instincts telling you now?
If anybody tries to sneak up on you, this will tell us.<eos> Do you know how it works?<eos> I think I can figure it out.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I brought you back your memory inhibitor.
These are very serious allegations.<eos> No shit.<eos> Director Volmer is a well-respected man.<eos> The sanatorium is of great importance for the local economy.<eos> Take me up there, and I'll show you what I saw.
Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> Pembroke.<eos> Pembroke.<eos> What have they done to you?
You appear to be under the illusion that this is a conversation. It is not.<eos> We've wasted quite enough time on this.<eos> Aircraft Woman Campbell, you are to be dishonourably discharged from the WAAF effective immediately.<eos> Sir, please. I<eos> - As a consequence this will prohibit you from joining any other branch of His Majesty's armed services.
Please.<eos> Sit down.<eos> After a great deal of deliberation... it's been decided that all charges of accounting fraud against you are to be dropped.<eos> What?<eos> Your involvement with Hughes and his grubby profiteers has left you with a valuable combination of skills and experience, Mrs Scotlock.
You don't even know who to protect me from.<eos> What we know is that the Russian mob is responsible for Tilda's death.<eos> We just don't know why.<eos> Do you need to see what they did to Tilda?<eos> What do you think they're gonna do to you once they know we spoke?
Can you come right over?<eos> Homer, you should use the Choremonkey app.<eos> People do all your chores, so you're free to follow your dreams.<eos> My dream right now is beer and toilet paper.<eos> Mr. Gumble, because I'm a decent person, this is the last beer I'm going to bring you.
I... spoke with her in the village the last time I was here.<eos> Nice girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Okay, Ms. Ellis.<eos> Um, I'm going to put you in room five.
- I am a victim.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> No, you're not innocent.<eos> We stopped looking because you said you killed him.<eos> And that money they gave you... that doesn't make you a victim.
Rosalind said you called them Inhumans?<eos> Heads of state calling, not sure what's happening.<eos> Watchdog agencies hurling accusations.<eos> Fox News won't shut up.<eos> I don't need to tell you how delicate the situation is, but we have to do something.
Testicular.<eos> No dudes, no dudes.<eos> Come on, daddy needs a pancreatic.<eos> I'm so sorry, Hilary.<eos> Uh, why don't you take a seat, and I'll have a social worker come by and talk to you about hospice.
A young, eager community of men and women of all races and backgrounds, a true reflection of America's future.<eos> How did he convince you to come back?<eos> I convinced myself.<eos> Forty-six years I was married to my husband before he passed.<eos> But if he'd pulled on me what Frank pulled on you, he would've been long gone.
I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.<eos> Meechum?<eos> I'm not ruling anyone out.<eos> Sir?<eos> I brought the safety deposit box for you.
I know my pin number, it's my birthday.<eos> Happy Birthday!<eos> No, the pin number is my birthday.<eos> He keeps saying pin number.<eos> Did you start with the temporary pin that we sent you?
- Oh, yes.<eos> I'd heard. - What had you heard?<eos> That he hands out vivas like Dolly Mixtures?<eos> Is this college gossip?<eos> Or did he beat you to a place on the board?
Let me?<eos> You do your job, I'll do mine.<eos> If they have made good on their threat, we're gonna need you for after, to make it stick.<eos> Please, doc.<eos> If anything happened to you, Mr. Bright would have my guts.
Good luck.<eos> Just one more thing.<eos> That's a Babylonia Museum mark.<eos> So unless you've got paperwork, it's been looted.<eos> And since you're not involved in anything like that, I know you'd want us to call the Iraqi embassy for you.
Fine.<eos> Forget it.<eos> So much for your code, crook.<eos> Anytime, assassin.<eos> Of all the dumb things I've seen in my life, you getting that guy to beat on you takes the cake.
That we were guilty.<eos> And that he couldn't find out who I was and that Laura was not my wife.<eos> Details, Mr. Doria.<eos> I have to warn you that the jury would only believe this absurd theory, if the details make it plausible.<eos> I have not yet told you how they arranged the appointment at the Bellavista Hotel.
Study the enemy and wait.<eos> To watch you.<eos> Tomas Garrido became a shadow in the shadows.<eos> He found an apartment in front of your building and managed to occupy it anonymously.<eos> And since then... he's kept you and anybody else that came in contact with you under constant surveillance.
There are primordial energies that flow through all things.<eos> I now command them.<eos> You're insane.<eos> Madness is a matter of perspective, Mr. Queen.<eos> Your morality blinds you from understanding what I have achieved.
Step right up!<eos> Teach an old Italian lady how to use an iPad!<eos> Now, that sounds like fun. I'll give it a try.<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> Look what I got for you.
Otherwise, get on out.<eos> Where's Sally-Ann?<eos> You want me to call the cops?<eos> No, I want you to help me.<eos> I never done anything to you.
No, I didn't steal any Gatorade.<eos> You know you stole it.<eos> And you drank it.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> I told you very clearly, ma'am, - that I told you that I lost my purse and I was-- - Okay, so--
Listen, I really don't want to talk about it.<eos> As former Gis, we have an obligation to share our stories here.<eos> Listen, asshole, I'm just trying to have a drink.<eos> There you are, James.<eos> - Is my brother troubling you? - Not at all.
Chase gave Javier a floor plan, a key to your house, a photo of you, and $50,000 to kill you.<eos> Look, I am trying to help you.<eos> Can you think of any reason your husband might want you dead, or is this a total shock?<eos> In two minutes, your husband is going to call you.<eos> He'll tell you he can't find his wallet. He'll ask you to go upstairs and check his bedside table.
Charles de Gaulle" Paris.<eos> are you coming?<eos> please leave a message".<eos> Yes?<eos> May I speak to you?
A couple of days later.<eos> I hadn't heard from him.<eos> When did you see him again?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Did he seem troubled to you, or concerned about something in particular?
Birthday cards?<eos> One Valentine?<eos> Maybe he wanted me to burn them(! )<eos> What about the phrase "Level Nine"?<eos> Is that familiar to you, did Michael ever talk about it?
Michael wanted to come clean to you about who he was, the things he did before he met you.<eos> He knew that it might mean losing you, but he wanted to do it anyway.<eos> He said there was no future without honesty.<eos> His charge sheet.<eos> This is what he'd have told you if he'd been here.
- What are you, a cop?<eos> - Private investigator.<eos> And you're working for him, aren't you?<eos> Did you threaten your mother the night of the murder?<eos> - Is that what he told you?
The Bureau has reason to believe<eos> Christopher Hall is now Michael Thorne.<eos> His credit card led me here, as I believe it did you.<eos> Care to tell me what happened?<eos> What he did to you?
I've told myself it was because I wanted answers.<eos> I needed to understand how this happened to me.<eos> And now that I'm getting answers, now that he's telling me everything...<eos> Everything?<eos> What's he... what's he telling you?
But we didn't talk face-to-face until...<eos> Paige Baker, I'd like for you to meet...<eos> Michael Thorne.<eos> I was wearing a wire, hoping to get a confession.<eos> And what did he tell you?
Your Holiness, Sister Bice is rather... quaint.<eos> No, Domen, she is not quaint.<eos> She's friendly.<eos> Mother...<eos> Let me explain something to you, that you, in your long life, have not yet had the occasion to understand:
Tell me right now, or what you've seen so far will be nothing but a foretaste of the macabre banquet that will bring on the ruin of the Church.<eos> Explain it all, right here, right now, because even a second later will be too late.<eos> Are you telling me that you're behaving irrationally with the faithful, the Vatican Curia, and the mass media because you were kept out of the loop on the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to your election?<eos> No.<eos> I am ordering you, beginning with your next utterance, to tell me why I was elected, and what my election was supposed to mean to you all.
One bottle of gin doesn't make an alcoholic of me.<eos> Agreed.<eos> One bottle doesn't.<eos> But a whole liquor store full does.<eos> Who told you I'm an alcoholic?
And that woman is the Prime Minister?<eos> - Hamsik, with the mohawk.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And she has an audience with you, Holy Father.<eos> Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.<eos> - Very good!<eos> Now, I ask you, please satisfy my morbid curiosity:
a reopening of discussions on the Lateran Pacts, a full review of the territorial boundaries of the Vatican State.<eos> This last request really is remarkable, I have to admit.<eos> I didn't know that you had expansionistic ambitions.<eos> But I was told before coming that this new Pope is a very funny man.<eos> But did they forget to inform you that this new Pope is a man who's far more intelligent than you?
No, I won't tell you anything else.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I'm stupid, it's true, but not that stupid.<eos> Do you resent me for not having made you a cardinal yet?<eos> Yes, at first I thought that was the reason I wouldn't confide in you again.
Only a great deal of sincere concern.<eos> What did you have me sign the other day?<eos> A simplified procedure for ordaining new priests.<eos> And why did you have me sign it without talking to me about it first?<eos> I had the documents delivered to you the night before.
- Did you have a good trip?<eos> - Oh, I just love helicopters.<eos> They make me feel like I'm having an adventure.<eos> Young people like you love adventures.<eos> Holy Father, may I remind you that we're the same age?
As you wish, Holy Father.<eos> What I really wish is to go back to Rome.<eos> I'm not a man who's comfortable on vacation.<eos> All intelligent men are uncomfortable on vacation.<eos> By the way, something that may possibly cheer you up:
Certainly!<eos> I've only have had one and I remember everything about her.<eos> Whereas you, Mr. Coen, have probably had thousands and don't remember a thing about them.<eos> I only remember certain perverse and lustful details.<eos> If you remember those, that's probably because we're continuing lecturing you about how wrong it is to remember them.
Then you faked Owen's suicide and left a note that would help to frame Harry, and prove your innocence.<eos> And Rose?<eos> Why would I get her involved? Ah.<eos> The wicked stepsister.<eos> How long did it take you to convince your father to cut her out of the will?
"I've gotta go.<eos> See you next time.<eos> Bye from Nexus 6".<eos> Is that him?<eos> - He looks a little like you.
If I had to choose a time in my life when I was young to re-live, I don't know which I'd choose, but I'm sure I'd have a three-finger sideburn.<eos> A lot of time has gone by, right?<eos> I'm sorry, do we know each other?<eos> You don't remember me?<eos> I made a lot of work for you about seven and a half, eight years ago.
Ready, action.<eos> - And those stairs, where do they go?<eos> - No, nowhere, no.<eos> The money ran out for the expansion project.<eos> Well, what can I tell you?
- Yes, yes, uh...<eos> What information is in this notebook?<eos> Perhaps time codes for different eras that they don't want revealed.<eos> Record everything.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you not to waste time drawing pictures, huh?
She might.<eos> Then I should probably get going.<eos> Matty, wait.<eos> I don't know why you and Jenna are giving each other the silent treatment. I mean, I get that breakups can be terrible, but yours just seemed, well, sad.<eos> Listen, uh, what Jenna told you about our breakup, that's not exactly how it went down.
Thank you.<eos> Humans... think of evolution in terms of progress and advancement.<eos> This final errand will be the catalyzing event precipitating a new era on Earth, akin to the meteor that felled the dinosaurs and ushered in the Ice Age.<eos> I'm honored, sir... and humbled.<eos> Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.
I'm sure that I had to start speaking in metaphor for you to start listening.<eos> I'm sure that man and woman is not all a body can be.<eos> I'm sure it does not matter.<eos> It does not matter.<eos> Remember how I told you that it felt like every room of my home being broken into at the same time.
Oh, it will be a problem.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have a better idea:<eos> her life in exchange for his.<eos> Your son will be returned to you as soon as you guarantee our safe passage.
So, I'm excited to get down there.<eos> -Hello, there.<eos> -Oh, hello. Welcome, sir.<eos> Blumquist, AJ. They should have the John Wayne suite ready.<eos> Okay, we actually have you for the Slim Pickens suite.
Look, there's a lot of ways to stay busy in prison, okay?<eos> You can read a book, you can watch educational television.<eos> You have to learn how to help yourselves in here.<eos> You know, there's... There's nothing forbidden for you.<eos> This scoundrel bothering you?
I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.<eos> I am a bit surprised, yes, to see both of you.<eos> I'm sure there's some wariness about us being here, but I think we have a good plan on how to handle Russia.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Raymond can lay it out for you.
You're a target because of what you know.<eos> 'Cause whatever that is, they... they want to keep in the dark.<eos> Karen has found something that will bring the truth to light.<eos> Here, uh...<eos> This... is this the body they asked you to make disappear?
I thought it was about money... or horses... or love.<eos> But it was about justice, wasn't it?<eos> A life for a life.<eos> Reggie killed your sister, so you killed him.<eos> He kept you here not out of kindness but out of guilt.
Well, if Gus wants you to do something, far be it for me to interfere.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, now, let's, uh, look at the video from last night's crime scene.<eos> See if we missed anything.<eos> Anything there remind you of the old case, Detective Dunn?
My client was put on trial for Reese's murder.<eos> Jeopardy was attached. That case was dismissed with prejudice due to police misconduct, planted evidence, and perjury.<eos> I found the stolen wallets from the flower shop robbery myself.<eos> I did not plant them, sir.<eos> And who was it who told you where to look for those wallets?
Captain raydor.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sharon, Miriam, do you both know why we asked you here?<eos> It's because rusty told you about the threats that Gary made.
That pant, it's got a red lining.<eos> You can see it in the long slit down the side.<eos> We have been talking about silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.<eos> Can I guess that you emailed me in the middle of the night for an emergency session due to garden-variety issues?<eos> I was down and I emailed you and I woke up and I feel better.
Yeah.<eos> She wants me to make like a public apology.<eos> Says it will look good if I have somebody from my church standing with me when I make a statement as my spiritual advisor.<eos> I guess I was wondering if that's something he would be willing to do.<eos> Do you want a spiritual advisor or you just want someone to stand behind you and act like one?
Damn right it's the truth.<eos> - Jacob?<eos> - You see what I'm up against?<eos> Are you still seeing this other woman?<eos> I told you, we're not gonna talk about that.
So, what's the problem?<eos> - Joshua was born premature.<eos> - At 25 weeks.<eos> - Yeah. We have a picture of Bishop holding him right in the palm of his hand.<eos> Bishop didn't tell you about Joshua?
- Right, ICSI.<eos> Uh, and if that works, we get...<eos> Blastocysts... then embryos.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Has anyone ever told you you remind them of a Bond villain?
I-I don't understand. Parents get sick, and Dr. Masters' father is ill with, uh, you know, gout.<eos> As a board member of this clinic, not to mention a close personal friend of Libby Masters--<eos> If-- If you could just...<eos> Because they are both in a board meeting.<eos> I told you I don't know when they'll be back from vacation.
Yes, I've heard Mr. Desai speaking to someone about that.<eos> He offloaded the cargo without my permission.<eos> I need to know where.<eos> Time is a critical factor.<eos> I'll have the information for you by end of day.
I think Gracie saw it, too.<eos> Don't you say her name.<eos> Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start.
Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.<eos> Said his death wasn't an O.D.<eos> If I'd have stopped it then...<eos> No, the Bureau didn't.<eos> So I'm telling you to stop it now.
Work your contacts and the data.<eos> They stick their heads up, I want us there.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Agent Pritchard, a word.<eos> Pritchard, I know some of these other agents are looking at you sideways for turning your partner and your boss in, but from where I stand, that was damn fine work.
You can see it's registered to us.<eos> Ma'am, I'd like to see that car.<eos> Why are you here, Agent Pritchard?<eos> I want to know who that man is.<eos> You show up without a warrant, you want to talk to my security because you figure since they're ex-lawmen, they'll share information with you in confidence...
That's right.<eos> It's a little bunny, my love.<eos> She's very delicate.<eos> Boss?<eos> Look, Don Pablo... this is the guy I've been telling you about, Limón.
Your decision, I'm sure.<eos> We were barely back from our honeymoon when I got dispatched to Southeast Asia to investigate the mysterious viral outbreak.<eos> Things fell apart pretty quickly, and when I came up, well... everybody lost someone in the fire.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Darien.<eos> President Peng says it is a great honor to meet you, and he wishes to welcome you to New China.
Less government, less taxes, more freedom, protect that freedom!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Governor, can you comment on your relationship with the search engine Pollyhop?<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
- Uh, he's in California I think.<eos> He's got two Gulf Streams. Have him pick one.<eos> Thank you so much, thank you.<eos> Thank you, take care.<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
Sorry, no offence.<eos> None taken.<eos> Did she go on the site as herself as Selena Callaway or did she have an alias?<eos> You know a nom de plume or anything.<eos> So the name Annie Green doesn't mean anything to you?
Anyway, lose control, we have no hope of getting it back.<eos> This was for the good of everyone.<eos> Everyone?<eos> You're looking at me like this is somehow my fault?<eos> I asked you to stop Leo Greene, and you didn't.
I don't want to spend another night away from you.<eos> Me either.<eos> I just lost my Internet connection.<eos> So did everyone in the cordon.<eos> I asked you to stop Leo Greene, and you didn't.
Let's get you home, son.<eos> I appreciate your help.<eos> You left me little choice.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Now it is I that don't believe you.
He reminded me so much of my parents.<eos> Brilliant, fearless, honorable.<eos> 17 days ago, his wife Sabine called and asked me to quarantine two doctors who'd accidently been exposed to a new viral strain.<eos> When I said Sayid Nassir's name as someone who may have also been exposed, she...<eos> She told you to say he was Patient Zero.
Okay, thanks.<eos> Lydia, I've been thinking all day about our conversation earlier today, and...<eos> Look, you can fire me if you want, but can I just explain?<eos> Um... Look, the thing is is, um... I have a really hard time meeting people.<eos> Remember that guy I told you about online? Well, it didn't work out, and I guess I was just jealous that you and Adam had met so easily and... And got along so well.
I have custody.<eos> He's my number-one priority.<eos> What do you think the square footage is here?<eos> No idea.<eos> But why don't I go get Tucker for you?
Single-handedly brings in an AFO. Well done.<eos> 'I'd just like to get on with my life.'<eos> Miss Denton.<eos> I'm Gill Bigelow, legal counsel to AC-12.<eos> I imagine they keep you VERY busy.
You won't move on, Steve, until you stop chasing me and you start chasing your real enemies.<eos> For Christ's sake, son, what was in that phone? !<eos> We've got to take that crap from her, sir?<eos> You lied in court! You lied to your partner and you lied to me!<eos> I didn't lie to you, sir, I just don't think it's appropriate to discuss an officer's private life.
Document 16 again. The night before Danny Waldron's murder.<eos> - Another call.<eos> - Who called you that night?<eos> Calls of a suspicious nature were made shortly before you volunteered to continue serving on Danny Waldron's squad and before you murdered him.<eos> Who made those calls and what did they ask you to do?
Er... it says here that you were acquitted of conspiracy to murder, but found guilty of perverting the course of justice.<eos> Yes, I'm appealing against the conviction.<eos> I'm going to clear my name.<eos> You won't be able to rejoin the police with a criminal conviction.<eos> I told you, I'm appealing.
Bonnie's right.<eos> They're waiting for me.<eos> I have a simple question for you, Ms. Keating.<eos> If it were that simple, I suspect you would have asked me already.<eos> So, your testimony is that my client shot you and somehow Emily Sinclair wound up dead?
Here's a question.<eos> Ms. Keating, aren't you lying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Then how can we trust anything that you think you saw or heard that night, including your claim that Catherine Hapstall shot you?
I don't care.<eos> Nothing's changed for me. What I saw in there proves the process works.<eos> Jason's life is worth saving.<eos> You might think you know what you're doing, but you're in denial.<eos> Jason lied to you. He stood there over your son while he bled out.
I'll be right there.<eos> Rose asked to see me.<eos> You sit there, say you can help me if I do what you want.<eos> But what about when I tell them what you are threatening me with?<eos> Destroying my life, my son's life because Annalise has asked you to.
Someone who wanted to protect me.<eos> No one would do that.<eos> Besides, you told me yourself you remembered coming home from school that day to find your mom.<eos> You told me that in our first session.<eos> Yeah, well, there's other things I've done I haven't told you about.
Otherwise he could get hurt or hurt himself or say too much.<eos> But that's not on me anymore.<eos> It's on you.<eos> I'm not the person you think I am.<eos> And I can't tell you what that means or what I've done, so don't ask me.
I'm sorry I told you, and if that's why you left, please don't blame anyone else.<eos> It's Wes. I just need to run something...<eos> Annalise, hey.<eos> Call me as soon as you get this.<eos> Oliver's gonna ask you for a job.
Uh, well, I am from Carson City, Nevada.<eos> - Hm.<eos> - I work in interior design.<eos> It's... it's when you make the inside of a house nice, like this.<eos> And I'm not sure if Owen told you, but I am pregnant.
Thank you so much for recording this robocall.<eos> It'll go a long way in getting this bill passed.<eos> Well, thank you for all the extraordinary work you're doing.<eos> Uh, where would you like me?<eos> Uh, Sally will show you where we set up for the recording.
- Have you read it?<eos> - Just an excerpt.<eos> It's powerful.<eos> And it'll be controversial.<eos> Say yes and I'll show you.
- No, ma'am. I did not.<eos> You and I both know that you interfered, Governor.<eos> You admitted so much to me when I asked you personally.<eos> You told me that the general had spoken to members of that committee.<eos> I told you that I have friends on the committee, which is true.
Watch me tell the press you put words in my mouth.<eos> Feel free.<eos> I think they'll have a hard time believing you, though.<eos> Check your messages.<eos> I'm sure your staff's been emailing you.
But that's not the same as interfering.<eos> So you never discussed the Russia plan with anyone on the committee?<eos> We may have discussed it, but it's not as though I was issuing orders.<eos> And I have to say, everyone's primary focus right now needs to be on the Miller family, not this.<eos> Did the president ask you to leave the White House?
He wants an interview with the president.<eos> He wouldn't say what for.<eos> What outlet is he with now?<eos> He's back at the Herald.<eos> Said he emailed you directly.
- Absolutely, Mr. St. Patrick.<eos> - Gentlemen. Look, does your firm provide personal security?<eos> Like, if you do, could you also still secure my three clubs?<eos> Of course.<eos> Is it personal detail for you?
OK, so let's try again, shall we?<eos> When you were a prison visitor to Jakob Marosi, did you ever send letters on his behalf?<eos> Did you think there was something I didn't wanna say in front of my husband?<eos> Is there?<eos> Mrs Clarke, did Jakob Marosi ever ask you to smuggle letters out for him?
Maybe I could take her there for a little while.<eos> - You're not qualified.<eos> - Qualified?<eos> She doesn't move, how hard can it be?<eos> - I don't think you understand the toll it could take on you.
- What?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. Go get the biggest knife you can find.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Do it! We have started an official investigation into the-the missing boat.<eos> Yeah, we... but we told you, uh, that we didn't know anything about any boat.
Sure. I was hoping you could help me with a case I'm working on.<eos> All right. What case?<eos> Vincent Keller.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You don't really expect me to believe that your best friend, your old partner, hasn't told you what's going on with her husband?
I don't believe you.<eos> Now I'm a liar.<eos> No, you're a survivor.<eos> I know 'cause I used to be one too.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't believe you.
I don't know anything about another target, and neither does Vincent.<eos> Cat, listen to me.<eos> Don't let him pull you down any more than he already has.<eos> I am telling you, there is no plan.<eos> And if somebody else is telling you that there is one, they are lying, they are setting him up.
Anything in there is what I'm after.<eos> You're not going to tell me what it is?<eos> Trust me, you don't want to know.<eos> If you're smart, you won't look either.<eos> Guttman, I don't give a shit what they're extorting you with. Photos banging your mother or a 3-month-old baby or a government minister, I don't care.
Forgot you can't talk.<eos> The... jaw.<eos> I wanted to...<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> What I did to you...
If we do as you suggest, the United States will just impose more sanctions.<eos> Our shelves are already bare.<eos> This would hurt my people and my economy for generations to come. This meeting is over.<eos> (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Diaz.<eos> I told you I could put money back in Venezuela's central bank.
Our shelves are already bare.<eos> This would hurt my people and my economy for generations to come. This meeting is over.<eos> (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Diaz.<eos> I told you I could put money back in Venezuela's central bank.<eos> And I've told you, you couldn't possibly give us enough money to make what you're asking worth the risk. REDDINGTON:
The killer is not a hardened criminal, because they do not panic.<eos> Then what are they doing at night by the docks, which is the haunt of malefactors and cut-throats?<eos> Marley was a dark man, at home in dark places.<eos> But the killer...<eos> Do you remember what I said to you early on in this case?
Well, thank you.<eos> You're pretty sexy your damn self.<eos> He's a little deaf, so you're gonna have to speak up.<eos> I'm gonna let you two get to know each other.<eos> Has anybody ever told you that you look like Santa Claus?
What if she figures it out?<eos> The senator's sorry he can't be here personally.<eos> Anything my team can do to assist you. Great.<eos> We should also address the fact that you are in a clandestine relationship with Brian.<eos> I'm guessing you give him immunity to NZT's side effects and he tells you what we're up to?
Either you're genuinely interested in me, in which case, thanks, but no thanks.<eos> I like catching the bad guy.<eos> Kind of my thing.<eos> And the second possibility?<eos> Someone at the FBI has been telling you about the questions I've been asking.
So have fun and don't expect official charges for a trial anytime soon."<eos> I think probably about a day and a half went by before anyone else talked to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I... don't understand.<eos> I told you to leave Russia.
When all of this started, we made promises to each other.<eos> - I know.<eos> I didn't mean to lie to you.<eos> - You're being assigned to a different handler.<eos> I told you to leave Russia.
This is what you think I expect in a real estate agent.<eos> I understand you're upset.<eos> The buyer is within the 10-day cooling off period for a timeshare.<eos> It's the law, Miss Seferian, not an oversight on my part.<eos> You're not doing what I asked you to do.
Did something happen to Vince?<eos> I was gambling at Fraser Downs.<eos> Now, if there's nothing else, I've got a business to run.<eos> He ever mention anything about life after jail?<eos> You guys spent seven years together, he say anything to you?
Yeah, it's Kurt.<eos> Kurt!<eos> Where's Kurt?<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> He refuses to take anything until he talks to you.
Trust me.<eos> Where's my big bag?<eos> Listen, Davey's hanging on at the agency - by a thread as it is.<eos> - What?<eos> If he knew what was at stake, he'd ask you to wake him up.
- of the rights and charges.<eos> - Denied.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> That may be the ordinary course of business, but there is nothing ordinary about the charges against your client.<eos> Ms. Keen, the United States government has charged you with 16 counts of capital murder.
The only sicko here is you.<eos> You killed my father.<eos> Now I'm gonna get some justice.<eos> Mr. Gecko, keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna ask you as a fellow law enforcement officer, please lower your weapon.
Yer a fucking beauty!<eos> Yay!<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.<eos> Because you fully admitted the offences and you've been of good character in the past, we're cautioning you for the offence of criminal damage, under Section Five of the Public Order Act.
Chief Superintendent Burridge from New Scotland Yard.<eos> But, on this case, you can call me David.<eos> Sorry. "On this case"?<eos> Are we still reporting to you, sir?<eos> As has just been made clear to you, DI Carne, it's Chief Superintendent Burridge's case now.
I can't say I understand it.<eos> But, what I can tell you is we don't get a weather warning like this every day.<eos> We don't get one every month, either.<eos> In fact, I've never heard of us getting one at all.<eos> Does the name Donora mean anything to you?
I could go for a pizza.<eos> ♪ This is your story me, too.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hanging.<eos> I kicked you off my case.
Daniel recalled the scent under hypnosis.<eos> Can you tell me where?<eos> The flowers should be somewhere near here.<eos> Nice to see you out of uniform.<eos> That colour suits you.
And then he turned his rage on the baby.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> He said he'd kill me, too.<eos> You killed your husband because of what he did to your son?<eos> No! No, I told you, a poltergeist killed Emmett.
Yes.<eos> And that's why I'm not going with you.<eos> I have to find him.<eos> But... (LAUGHS)<eos> He asked you to trust him, leave him alone.
He wanted us to...<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> But I did not kill him, I swear to God.<eos> God may believe you, but a jury won't.
Well, I'm flattered. You came for me personally.<eos> We aren't supposed to talk for another three days and I don't have my lawyer with me, so...<eos> This isn't a formal interrogation. That won't be necessary.<eos> Then I'll tell you what is necessary.<eos> You're going to put in writing that anything I say to you is inadmissible.
My lawyer's not here.<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> Then why did he tell me that if I told you he couldn't make it, you'd give me a continuance or something?<eos> I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Diaz.<eos> Since Perkins isn't here, I'll help you out.
No.<eos> We can't.<eos> But we can certainly strive to be clear about our own.<eos> Captain.<eos> I asked you to interview Commander Garrett.
No.<eos> I've never seen her before.<eos> Then how do you know she went off the side of the building?<eos> It was in the news.<eos> Look, you obviously wanted to check Neil's alibi, and I told you where he was.
What day?<eos> The day that woman accused you in the taxi.<eos> She accused me?<eos> She wanted to switch places with me.<eos> When you got out, I told her you were our teacher, and that we liked you a lot.
You knew that he was involved in an assault.<eos> You knew that he had mental-health issues. I-I didn't know he had mental-health...<eos> What was your follow-up?<eos> I did not know that he had mental-health issues.<eos> His mother spoke to you.
Taylor Blaine, you are charged with murder by means of involuntary manslaughter.<eos> This is a Level 1 felony, punishable up to 30 years in prison.<eos> Do you understand the charges you are facing?<eos> I do.<eos> Has your counsel explained to you that by accepting a plea agreement, you will waive your right to a jury trial?
And do you understand that if you accept this agreement, you will be sentenced to a term of no less than 10 years in a state-mandated facility?<eos> I understand.<eos> I ask that you carefully consider your decision.<eos> Once made, it cannot be rescinded.<eos> At this time, Taylor, do you accept or reject that which has been presented to you?
In the meantime, why don't you pay a visit to the ob-gyn listed in Ellen's address book?<eos> If Mr. Jacobs is innocent, it might be the other man in Ellen's life who reacted negatively to the pregnancy.<eos> Her doctor may know his name.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't see how I can help you.<eos> You were Ellen's doctor; she talked to you.
No.<eos> Mr. Clift...<eos> All I wanted... all I've ever wanted was to talk to him.<eos> Just look him in the eye and tell him what he did to me and to my family.<eos> Check with the prison; they'll tell you I've made dozens of requests for visitation.
We had a deal.<eos> I miss something?<eos> You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.<eos> That's Rollo Bastain from the case study that we assigned you.
At least, that's what our tipster said.<eos> - Deep Throat have a name?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - He didn't tell me.<eos> - What did he tell you?
I was so ashamed.<eos> I had almost...<eos> And...<eos> Your... and your mother never would've understood me.<eos> Sarah, she never believed what people said anyway. But you, I wanted you...
Going down.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Good work, guys.<eos> Something the U.S. Marshals can help you with, Agent Weller?
Her body was found in a Hell's Kitchen apartment this morning, tortured to death.<eos> So, again, how do you know Nermin and why was she here?<eos> Did you help her get into the country?<eos> We believe the Ahmadis are here to plan a domestic attack.<eos> What did Nermin tell you about their target?
And before you continue threatening me, you are not with the FBI anymore.<eos> So even if I did it, you don't have the authority, the resources, or the proof to come after me.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> I have something else.<eos> I told you I wasn't wearing a wire, but I didn't say I was alone.
But you had the tape, and you used that to blackmail her so you could get your share.<eos> But Sadie didn't like you having all that leverage.<eos> What I can't figure out is, what took Sadie so long to try to get this tape back from you?<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You burned through the money that Sadie gave you originally, so you needed more.
But for somebody like you... It's about more than just revenge.<eos> For you, every murder that Randy commits allows you to relive your own crimes, over and over again, down to the last detail.<eos> Is that right?<eos> There is so much anger inside of you that you would destroy your own son's life.<eos> I know what happened to you 30 years ago.
He knew.<eos> You didn't tell me you were bringing him in.<eos> Must have slipped my mind.<eos> I thought I was back on the team.<eos> I told you how this was going to go, Liv.
And some of us know what they're actually doing, which is hoarding patents in stem-cell cosmetics and totally testing on human beings.<eos> Like, I'm against animal testing.<eos> - OK. - Humans is, like, too far.<eos> - Do you know what I mean?<eos> Does "Leda" mean anything to you?
You'll run it in no time.<eos> You're like that bug that takes over the other bug and controls it and everything.<eos> And you're really good at figuring out business stuff, so...<eos> What color you want?<eos> Oh, CO Bayley, I asked you politely to please wait outside.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Huang. Please, please.<eos> Come in.<eos> Louis, you didn't tell me Alison was Chinese.<eos> This is the only surprise you've ever given me that I have liked.<eos> I'd like to present you with a traditional gift of oranges.
Can we keep her?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> When I was in here before, I noticed you do a great British accent.<eos> It's just how I talk.<eos> Okay, you don't have to brag about how easy it is for you.
You don't seem upset that Izzy's dead.<eos> I've been with that kid since he was collecting pennies with Shades Deep.<eos> The Izzy I knew wouldn't want me shedding a tear. - Hmm.<eos> - So I'm not.<eos> You sure it isn't because Izzy was suing you for screwing him over in his contract with you?
Smart way to kill someone, but I don't understand why you blew him up.<eos> - I don't know. It wasn't me.<eos> - Then who?<eos> - Joe didn't tell me that.<eos> - What did Joe tell you?
- What?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Not here.<eos> Gary, I did it the way you showed me to do it.<eos> But that's not the way I showed you to do...
I knew you would understand, Bob.<eos> It is so nice to finally be talking to a professional here.<eos> This is how I see it, okay?<eos> If I'm soft on China, I'm gonna get killed in the House.<eos> Your instincts are telling you you should be strong.
I get a piece of that.<eos> In perpetuity.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> - Mr. Ambassador. So I understand you have a message for me.<eos> What I say to you is in the strictest of confidence.
So you're gonna go talk to Treasury, I'm gonna go tell Tom.<eos> Done. Okay?<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hey, ma'am, I know you made the right choice with Charlie because when you have found someone you love, who makes you feel special every time he talks to you and you can be happy just thinking about him, you know...
I need to get ahead of this now.<eos> And if I don't, we're done.<eos> Richard, whether you appreciate this or not, I do actually have a plan here.<eos> You can meet with everyone in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO.<eos> I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.
You, the man who spent $20,000 renting giant fiberglass tiki heads, and $40,000 more when one of them was misplaced on the way back to the rental house?<eos> I told you it wasn't misplaced.<eos> I know exactly where it is.<eos> It's at the bottom of the bay.<eos> I called you a thief because you, sir, have stolen from us.
Excuse me?<eos> Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into do.
- At the very least, you probably knew you weren't going there to develop photographs.<eos> I thought we were just going to kiss.<eos> You mean like this?<eos> Defense exhibits 6A through D, Your Honor.<eos> Now, I know Mr. Barba already asked you about these photos, but it appears as if you were enjoying yourself.
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.<eos> I didn't do anything Abby didn't want.<eos> So she went to the police, testified on the stand, was publicly humiliated and ostracized by her friends for something that she made up?<eos> No, she probably thinks she was raped.<eos> Well, what does that tell you?
Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Geils, Tribeca,<eos> I'm afraid cybercrime has once again reared its ugly head.<eos> Lieutenant, I told you, it's just a printer jam.
- Hey.<eos> You don't start minding your own business, Kate, you're gonna get hurt.<eos> Most nights, Patrick was a happy drunk.<eos> Do you think he killed her?<eos> I told you what I saw.
Uh, Matt?<eos> Hey, you talk to Professor Blake? - I did.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Oh, a-and if you want that "F" removed so you can play tomorrow, you're gonna have to write a new paper... today.<eos> Didn't Professor Blake tell you to give me a break?
Detective Wallis and Barker.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Yes, Charlie told me you were coming.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> As Officer Fuller has told you, our prime suspect is Lee Walsh.
- Is there a problem? - We just have some follow up questions<eos> - for you and Rand.<eos> It's kind of late, Detective.<eos> Can't this wait until morning?<eos> Do these photos look familiar to you?
I... Nothing reported on any news source.<eos> The president is unharmed.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> What about Maxwell?<eos> Mr. Maxwell let his guard down as he spoke to you.
And here are your oven mitts back.<eos> Of course you're not fine.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> Day-after-day pain.<eos> Puts you to bed and sits there waitin' for you when you wake up.
What'd he say?<eos> - Preacher.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> What'd he say to you? !
We don't have to be what we've been.<eos> You can be good.<eos> That's what we want, right? We...<eos> We all want to be good.<eos> Something outside wants to talk to you.
I know what happened wasn't exactly my fault, my...<eos> My brain was altered.<eos> But it brought something inside of me out.<eos> That was mean and horrible...<eos> - What I did to you, Ms. Grant.
You can't expect us to believe you saved Jeremiah Danvers.<eos> He was on a mission to kill you.<eos> You asked for the truth.<eos> What is truth to you, J'onn?<eos> Huh? Wearing skin that doesn't belong to you?
Which makes you a terrible agent.<eos> But lucky for you, not a criminal.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's lying.<eos> He told you he tried to rescue your father.
But lucky for you, not a criminal.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's lying.<eos> He told you he tried to rescue your father.<eos> He told you he's protecting you.
Great.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> This should help get you started.<eos> You didn't get that from me.<eos> I mean, you, look, you did get that from me, but if anyone asks you,
Safe?<eos> Next to someone you love?<eos> I'll have a whisky sour.<eos> Good afternoon, ma'am.<eos> The American Union representative dropped this off for you.
- Only me. Understand?<eos> See you Thursday.<eos> "I'm going to kill you."<eos> I meant metaphorically.<eos> Did Julian ever hurt you?
We didn't get to that part yet.<eos> Now, sir.<eos> - Okay, but--<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Just for the record, I asked you why you pulled me over, and you couldn't tell me.
Stay in the vehicle, ma'am.<eos> Sir, have you been drinking tonight?<eos> No, sir, I have not.<eos> I'm not sure if I mentioned this to you, but I'm an attorney. so I have a pretty good knowledge of the law, and unless you tell me why you're fucking with me, this could constitute an illegal stop.<eos> At this time, I'd like to ask you to participate in a sobriety test.
Lieutenant Commander Choi, Naval Reserve.<eos> I'm a resident at Chicago Med.<eos> Chief Mason came into our ED complaining of stomach pains.<eos> We did a CT and found this.<eos> This cancer could kill him, something that could have been prevented if you'd run a scan three months ago when he first told you about his symptoms.
Based on the angle of excision on the edges, I can say that our unsub definitely used the same knife.<eos> So, according to our theory, do we think this victim also defamed the church in some way?<eos> Maybe he offended good old Saint Fermín himself?<eos> Or maybe our unsub has appointed himself the new patron Saint of Pamplona, and these are just a form of consecration?<eos> When I asked you to keep this quiet, issuing a travel warning to all visiting Americans was not exactly what I had in mind.
So, it came from your shop.<eos> It could have come from anywhere.<eos> This sword tested positive for traces of human blood that matched Dave Briggs.<eos> This book has the same mold spores growing in it that we found in the sheet that you wrapped Dave Briggs' body in.<eos> Look, I told you where I was the night Briggs disappeared.
You're not just a priest.<eos> You're one of the strict kind.<eos> At least that's what Rachel said.<eos> She said her brother went to your church because you're as religious as it comes.<eos> Did he come to you to confess his sins?
Okay, just so you know, you're not putting me under.<eos> Just do whatever a dentist does.<eos> I want to be awake for this shit, you know?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> If a guy was talking to you about suicide when you were working on him or whatever, would you put that in your file?
That's cool.<eos> Do you mind if I just sit there with you?<eos> Don't worry. We're doing it off campus.<eos> And you don't have to come.<eos> Hey, uh, can I talk to you?
Where were you when you learned that Lobos had escaped?<eos> I was in the van with Felipe Lobos when we were ambushed.<eos> You survived the shot to the chest.<eos> - Two, Agent Donovan.<eos> LANCE: Your vest protected you, but I've been thinking, why didn't they shoot you in the head?
Bella's a doctor. I'm an architect.<eos> Never mind that we were buying her a car for her birthday. We were a part of the evil 1%.<eos> To make us a little nuts, she started volunteering to help all those... vagrants.<eos> Did one of those homeless men hurt my little girl?<eos> Does that seem more likely to you than Amanda running away with her boyfriend?
And I wrote, like, eight songs, one after another, like, boom.<eos> And is that common to be able to generate a good, quality song in such a short amount of time?<eos> The song "Yesterday," McCartney woke up with that in his head.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mr. Canton, do you mind if I ask, how long did it take you to write the eight songs for your second album?
I loved you.<eos> And I still love you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Listen, um, I guess he told you I'm an attorney.
Of course!<eos> And all because you stayed for a cup of tea.<eos> You are a genius, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> Socrates chose hemlock for his own execution, and so did you.<eos> Thomas Lightman showed you that the justice system you had given your life to was corrupt.
Always insisting on people calling him Uncle Mirth.<eos> Well, that's just his old stage name.<eos> Sorry, Mrs McCarthy.<eos> Not terribly hungry.<eos> What's the matter with you?
His Eminence has decided to wait until his body is cold before announcing his replacement.<eos> Allora, let us pray for him.<eos> This is becoming tedious.<eos> Humble acts of genuflexion - they always appear so conceited.<eos> Deference is a virtue that has sadly passed you by.
Quite.<eos> Even so, you must have something?<eos> What I can say is that His Holiness has cause to look favourably on Cardinal Papillon.<eos> I don't know what he's talking about.<eos> Your humility is a credit to you.
And did Mr. McBride represent you in these legal troubles?<eos> Yes.<eos> So it's your understanding that Mr. McBride was aware that you work as a prostitute.<eos> Yes.<eos> And when he asked you to blackmail the officer, was your understanding that he implied
How'd it go?<eos> Uh, uh, not well.<eos> Uh, Sh-Shannon has a lot of difficult questions.<eos> But isn't it your job to have the answers?<eos> I mean, isn't that why I asked you over here?
My son draws better than her.<eos> I wonder what else you stole from my room.<eos> It's just a magazine.<eos> If you're staying here, you can probably afford another one.<eos> Well, that doesn't entitle you to take what's mine.
Were you not even gonna hear me out?<eos> About cutting communication with our commanding officer?<eos> No.<eos> Screw you guys.<eos> Sir, Musa Wazari, does that name mean anything to you?
Only you can do that.<eos> This was just after you escaped from the Hunters in Afghanistan.<eos> You're not suicidal, Flynn.<eos> You're angry.<eos> The Hunters did something to you.
For now we have a more pressing problem - the security of the graveyard.<eos> We have to allow for the possibility that what happened to Alexander was not an isolated incident.<eos> I've drawn up the rota for guard duty.<eos> You expect us to camp out in the graveyard all night?<eos> I wouldn't ask you to do anything I'm not prepared to do myself.
For many years, now.<eos> Shall we talk about why she left?<eos> I can be... ..obstinate, Doctor.<eos> Evidently.<eos> To what are these letters urging you to confess?
I am not a thief.<eos> We could play this game if you want.<eos> I ask you questions, you tell me lies.<eos> We go round in circles.<eos> But I can't be bothered with all that, so I'll tell you what's going to happen.
Look.<eos> We...<eos> Mark has his own room in our house, and, uh... I just got him a bike helmet so he can ride my old bike, and... We're catching him up on his math and his spelling so that he won't be behind.<eos> Detective, Detective, Detective!<eos> I told you from the start this was only an emergency placement until we could find the boy's family.
It had to be Graff.<eos> Or else you're partly responsible for having hidden the truth from your son.<eos> But I'm not going to ask you to take my word for it.<eos> I'm gonna let you check for yourself.<eos> I'm going to invent a letter, a message from beyond the grave to you from your son, and I'm going to tell you what Dwight would have said about what happened, and let you run it by his dad.
- Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, Doug.<eos> Can I ask you a few questions?<eos> What about? Well, actually, it's about what happened - to your friend Libby.<eos> - I wish I could help, but like I told you, I wasn't home that night.
Maybe at a truck stop whoring themselves out for cocaine.<eos> You must know the power of addiction.<eos> We're here to talk about these girls, not me.<eos> Nadia talked a lot about you.<eos> On our drive... how Sergeant Voight took you off the street. Mentored you.
He's a very sensitive man. Over time, we grew close.<eos> How close?<eos> He was a confidant, able to read my moods.<eos> Like he'd say, "You seem like you're feeling a little sad today."<eos> Did he ask you for favors?
See if we can corroborate this.<eos> - You want us to pick him up?<eos> - Nope. Not yet.<eos> I'm gonna have a sit-down with Lucky Jack, see if I can rattle his cage.<eos> So you deny that Bardot supplied you with confidential NYPD files?
Sorry to bother you.<eos> Uh, it appears you put the wrong birth date on this paperwork.<eos> Apparently, you think you're 26.<eos> Oh, wow, that's weird.<eos> Um, do you need me to shoot you over an email with the correct birth date?
The killer could be his wife, Karen.<eos> That was meant as a compliment.<eos> And I suppose you think that women should feel flattered when they are catcalled walking down the street?<eos> I know I do.<eos> Is this something that happens to you frequently, Dr. Fuentes?
I will not be trying; I will succeed.<eos> I have no doubt you will.<eos> With Agent Booth's help.<eos> Exactly. I'm sorry?<eos> Dr. Brennan, this committee is placing you on six month's probation, to be overseen by Agent Booth.
Yes. They want to hear how eddie was helping me.<eos> But I-I don't think it's what got him killed.<eos> Ah. Did the police have any information about the case?<eos> They did not tell me more.<eos> Did eddie ever say anything to you?
Congratulations.<eos> - She should have done stand-up.<eos> - They're laughing because of cutbacks.<eos> - Should I have laughed more?<eos> - She likes you, actually.
Well, I don't do authority, alright?<eos> These days, I barely do sober.<eos> Then I recruit Waverly.<eos> People in town rave about her.<eos> I told you to leave her out of this!
I can't go away for a month.<eos> I won't.<eos> We disrupt the investigation, the Dark Army wins.<eos> Chinese are pointing to a group of Uighur separatists.<eos> I told you what I saw at the airport.
That's why you went into cardiac arrest.<eos> It's impossible, 'cause Tessa gave them to me last night at home.<eos> Your-your wife, who you are presently cheating on, she controls the medication that determines whether you live or die?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, whatever your wife gave you wasn't your heart pills, all right?
If this is really the guy, why did we burn the house?<eos> How come we didn't put surveillance on it? What was the thought process here?<eos> You know Director Comey's taking a more aggressive strategy on everything ever since the shit hit the fan over that video.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can walk you through the report if we need to.
No, but I didn't push for that.<eos> I think we just really wanted to move forward.<eos> I got my friend to give her a job.<eos> Her name's Maggie Campbell, she has a dog-walking service...<eos> Did Chloe tell you where she was going last night?
You didn't have a choice, right?<eos> No, but, if I didn't run...<eos> Then you would have been trapped with him, too.<eos> I'd like to be alone.<eos> Did Chloe talk to you about her life before?
Okay.<eos> Can I get back to working out now?<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> Yeah, thanks for your time. Okay.<eos> Um, just one more thing, does the name Misha Vanni mean anything to you?
And I love my husband very much.<eos> Now I need you to leave the room 'cause I'm embarrassed to say you gave me a huge bon...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> So over the phone, Josh told me a little bit about your relationship.<eos> Oh, so he, uh, told you what started this whole thing is the fact that we've been trying to get together for, like, a whole year, and when we finally did and tried to kiss, he backed away, suddenly sickened by me.
I'm sorry.<eos> And believe me, I wish I didn't have to say this.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> After everything that I just told you?
Just wait right here, all right, Bailey?<eos> Could we talk for a minute? Sure.<eos> My wife has end-stage lymphoma.<eos> All right.<eos> I have power of attorney, so I need to instruct you that if she starts to die again, per her wishes, that you do not resuscitate her.
We just want to be left alone right now.<eos> Sure.<eos> Dr. Halstead,<eos> Ms. Goodwin would like to see you in her office.<eos> Did he tell you to resuscitate his wife?
Ms. Goodwin would like to see you in her office.<eos> Did he tell you to resuscitate his wife?<eos> Her husband wants her in the trial.<eos> - He agrees with me. - Yes or no.<eos> Did he tell you to resuscitate his wife?
Hey, thank you.<eos> Here's an Andrew Jackson. Make a clean set of sheets happen, I'll introduce you to his twin brother.
You know, you basically get a fancy hotel room with a mortgage payment-- that's all it is.<eos> Does someone have a question?<eos> No, no, my husband was just remarking on how beautiful the place is.<eos> Mr. Williams. Hmm?<eos> Let me paint this picture for you.
I have to say, I am surprised.<eos> Mmm.<eos> I mean, you struck me as a kind of man who would do anything to keep his wife happy.<eos> I mean, think about it, Mrs. Williams.<eos> Every morning, waking up with the Pacific Ocean calling out to greet you.
You being here means one of two things.<eos> Either you got my 10K, - or you got a death wish.<eos> - Of course, you owe him money.<eos> - Did I forget to mention that?<eos> - Listen, this idiot doesn't have what he owes you, but my division does.
You and I are fighting about Dad.<eos> You guys are fighting about me?<eos> We're not fighting about you. I just think that you could use some extra help with the case.<eos> And I think he's cutting you off at the knees.<eos> Mr. Sanderson, do you think Stewart is cutting you off at the knees?
Uh, may-- maybe I should have brought them all.<eos> You think? !<eos> I can't believe I said you were doing a good job.<eos> You ruined this night by making it all about bringing the wrong pin.<eos> Mr. "S," Hayley didn't ruin this night for you.
See you soon. What's going on?<eos> It's nothing, Pippa.<eos> It's departmental business.<eos> Just stay out of this.<eos> I'm assuming Lieutenant Benson told you to walk out of here.
Welcome to Tepid's Lukewarm Grille!<eos> The only reason you love this dump... is because they give you free food for life.<eos> Well, they did burn my fingerprints off pretty good! Least they can do is give me some free food.<eos> Oh, um, excuse me, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you... to put that shirt back on.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to put that shirt back on.
The evidence suggests that Busquet broke into the offices of Save the West Side to retrieve the leaked documents, lest his error be discovered one day.<eos> O'Neal walked in on that, sealing his fate.<eos> I swear, I had no idea.<eos> Yeah, well, your reputation for litigation precedes you.<eos> Had Busquet ever told you about his cock-up, you'd have sued him blind.
You leave me with no choice. (whispering):<eos> I'm gonna ask that you please remove your headphones now!<eos> Ma'am!<eos> What?<eos> Do you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?
You wanna share a cab?<eos> Not so fast, pretty boy.<eos> Get over here.<eos> The only thing you'll be sharing is a 4:00 baloney sandwich... with that guy.<eos> Mr. Wheeler... when I specifically asked you if you had feelings for one Samantha Saffe... what did you say? Well, technically, I never had feelings...
It's like my mantra.<eos> I never want to be out of integrity with myself.<eos> - That's my thing.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You know that story that I told you about the car
How's the campaign coming?<eos> What's that expression about swimming upstream?<eos> Feel like... some of that is the direction you chose.<eos> Yeah, I can see where this is going,<eos> Danny, and I get that you're looking out for your community as best you can, but as I told you before, I'm not the candidate you want.
Thanks.<eos> How we doing with the Kate Warner homicide?<eos> The investigation is ongoing.<eos> Well, it's been three weeks, so you must have something.<eos> I'm not talking to you until I have solid evidence and a confession.
That depends on how many more secrets you all have.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Not here.<eos> First I killed Kate, and then Melanie, and now... now Dad did?<eos> I don't care what Eric's told you, my father did not kill Kate.
Do you really think you can get me to confess?<eos> Get you to what?<eos> Did you kill Kate?<eos> Eric.<eos> Kate went up on the roof with you, and then she told you she was pregnant.
Because I have a proposal for you.<eos> Kind of a challenge.<eos> I'm a researcher.<eos> I'm currently working on a very interesting project studying the innate ability of women to be multi-orgasmic.<eos> So I guess what I'm asking you is...
Yes, that's all I was saying.<eos> I'm not sure that is all.<eos> Is it not also possible that you want your husband to... to hurt you?<eos> Just tell the truth, Fran.<eos> And even if you do want Gary to hurt you, we are not saying that's wrong.
Just please tell me we're... we're not going down next.<eos> I don't...<eos> You want a psychic?<eos> They're chockablock in Kreuzberg.<eos> So, did you get a chance to look into that photograph I gave you?
Black, please.<eos> He'll be here any moment.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Ah, here he is.<eos> Um, uh, Mr. Zohani, the man I've been telling you about...
Casey!<eos> Get out, now!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Son of a bitch, he's got it!<eos> I told you to step back.
- Thanks, guys.<eos> - Great evening.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice meeting you.<eos> What did I tell you?
Bring me some edibles.<eos> - Jay.<eos> Brianna Logan. Pleasure.<eos> Likewise.<eos> I don't know what Mouse told you.
Uh, so Mouse did my security system, and recommended you for security detail.<eos> I like ex-cops, um, ex-military, preferably ones that don't scare the customers away.<eos> We're an all-cash business.<eos> The Feds still won't let us open bank accounts.<eos> If this were, like, six months ago I'd be putting you in handcuffs.
You're not hard to follow.<eos> We never received your immunization records.<eos> State school board requires those for employment.<eos> Yours don't exist.<eos> I investigated your degree and found out it was issued by what generously might be referred to as a "mill," and a call to your last known address in Kentucky revealed that you use the name Epping when it suits you.
- You can't be in here.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Please.<eos> - Jake?<eos> - What's the matter with you?
What was your name?<eos> Mrs. Emily Baker.<eos> I am making a note of that.<eos> "Was very rude to a former Marine who served his country valiantly."<eos> On November 12, 1963, at 1100 hours, I delivered to you a document of the utmost importance for Agent Hosty.
Previously, on "11.22.63"...<eos> I have something to say!<eos> I'll fucking kill you.<eos> On November 12th, I delivered to you a document of the utmost importance for Agent Hosty.
I didn't believe he was serious, and then, when I woke up this morning,<eos> I couldn't get it out of my head. I knew that Kennedy was in town, and I had this bad feeling, so... I went to where I knew Lee worked.<eos> I guess I... I hoped that I could talk him out of doing something stupid.<eos> Mm, let me see if I got this right.<eos> Your neighbor told you he was gonna kill the President.
Jake, false identity, two houses in different cities minutes apart, a partner who you call your brother, who isn't, who committed suicide after you put him away under a false name, a murder in Jodie...<eos> This girl's husband...<eos> Her name was Sadie.<eos> Should I, uh, proceed to the part where you have no identity at all prior to 1960?<eos> Should I proceed to the part where your superior's gonna come in here and tell you to burn that letter that Oswald wrote to you two days ago?
Hold on. Wait, wait.<eos> Look, I just need to talk to him, okay?<eos> - He's my brother.<eos> Hi, Angelique.<eos> I'm here because the plot of your book was stolen from a chapter that I gave you, and I've had a committee of independent authors review the works side by side, and my legal team seems to think
Did you recognize any of them?<eos> No.<eos> What about a license plate number?<eos> No.<eos> I told you what I saw.
Dr. Shane was looking for me.<eos> I'm Millicent Silvano.<eos> You. We got to talk.<eos> Dr. Shane, I'm so sor...<eos> Did I spit on you?
Fun, huh?<eos> Lights had to be out.<eos> MRSA can be transmitted a number of ways.<eos> Bacteria in the water, lack of sanitary conditions.<eos> Um... did he tell you he was dying?
At first I didn't think anything of it, but now I'm wondering whether it was to hide bruises.<eos> Yes.<eos> Whatever chronic back injury he has, it began at your hand, did it not?<eos> There are two things you should know, Mr. Springer.<eos> First is that I'm going to punch you in the face.
He had weathered one government inspection, but his luck couldn't hold out.<eos> He needed pain pills, and he needed lots of them.<eos> The infirmary at The Keep should have had them by the thousands.<eos> Now, Dr. Bader called you the day he was killed. You said so yourself.<eos> Maybe it was the first time he told you about the mess he was in. Maybe it wasn't.
You... you couldn't pay. And then I was gonna call the cops on you. And then, uh, you... you gave me your watch to hold onto.<eos> Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came. Was I with anybody?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Did I talk to anybody?<eos> Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?
- What class?<eos> - Fire Cycle.<eos> I teach Monday, Wednesdays, and some Fridays to pay the rent, while I day-trade and study up - for my Series 7.<eos> - So you day-traded away Veronica's - $100,000? - No.<eos> Is that what she told you?
Had it over a year.<eos> Just won't heal. Doc says if it gets infected, I might just have to have my foot cut off.<eos> So, what can I do for you, Agent Jareau from the BAU?<eos> I think you know.<eos> Will you tell me about the missing boys and who sent their clothes to you?
It gets so tedious.<eos> They were sent by a zealous fan.<eos> Do you have any idea how much mail I get?<eos> Ridiculous, fawning letters. I barely read 'em before I toss 'em.<eos> Well, you must have some idea who sent the clothes to you.
Mrs. Park.<eos> I pushed him too hard, just like I pushed his father too hard.<eos> Now my husband's dead and my son's in the hospital.<eos> [Ga-in] Don't worry, Mrs. Park, everything will work out.<eos> I told you to trust me, didn't I?
My jam.<eos> Man, this is more embarrassing than the time I caught you watching "The Notebook."<eos> He wrote her a letter every day.<eos> I challenge you not to cry at that.
What's the progress?<eos> I am conducting an MRI, as per the very thorough research guidelines you sent over.<eos> With the crops gone and-and the Abbies amassing outside, we have to understand why this one is so docile, when the others all want to kill us.<eos> Wouldn't you agree? Yes.<eos> That's why I told you to do it.
Three years. Our exhibits are displayedin chronological order, starting with the Palaeolithic age,down there... moving into the ancientcivilisations of Mesopotamia and ending on the right side inthe period of Abbasid.<eos> Although, I can see from your faces you do not seem interestedin what the past has to offer...<eos> Far from it. The past is exactlythe reason we are here.<eos> Only not this far back.<eos> A man who was living in Germanywould send regular payments to you.
- Because I do.<eos> But here's the thing...<eos> It's not worth it. - Sorry. What's not?<eos> - I say some things. You say some things. It ends up with me not seeing her.<eos> And I don't want that to happen to you.
No, wait. Don't...<eos> Where did you get the gun?<eos> Oakland.<eos> All legal.<eos> So, Mr. Samnang, you mentioned the victim pointed the gun at you.
Turns out you're stuck up and emotionally withholding like a lot of beautiful, smart, and sexual, and... you have no idea what I'm talking about.<eos> No, crazy man.<eos> - Flo, wait up.<eos> - I'm on break.<eos> If you're looking for cigarettes, Dr. Panttiere had the nurses clean you out.
Get the cash from under the bed.<eos> Take a taxi.<eos> Go to the bus stop where Revere Avenue runs under the 280 freeway in Portola.<eos> I'll meet you there and I'll explain.<eos> So, this is real simple, what you're gonna do... you're gonna take a cab, like he told you.
Dr. Burnside, you have no factual knowledge about the circumstances of the accident itself, do you?<eos> I confine myself to what the body of the victim tells me, sir.<eos> Uh, well, the body didn't tell you anything about the cause of the accident, did it?<eos> No.<eos> And the body didn't tell you about any negligence from Mr. Siletti, did it?
We had to be everything to each other.<eos> I know.<eos> Your mom told me.<eos> Even when she was there, she wasn't there.<eos> She was there enough to see what your dad was doing to you.
Counsel is calling for a conclusion.<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> Did the defendant seem impaired to you?<eos> I wouldn't say wouldn't say Mr. Siletti seemed impaired.<eos> Mr. Reardon, didn't you tell me during preparation for this trial that the defendant appeared drunk to you, specifically using the words "drunk as a skunk"?
Did the defendant seem impaired to you?<eos> I wouldn't say wouldn't say Mr. Siletti seemed impaired.<eos> Mr. Reardon, didn't you tell me during preparation for this trial that the defendant appeared drunk to you, specifically using the words "drunk as a skunk"?<eos> No, Counselor.<eos> I told you that I would have been drunk as a skunk, since I personally have zero tolerance for alcohol because I'm a non-drinker.
That never happens when Dr. Panttiere's involved.<eos> - Oh, and Doctor?<eos> - Yes?<eos> You chose to give the position of CIO to her.<eos> That decision is beginning to reflect poorly on you, in the eyes of the board.
I know.<eos> It's a lot.<eos> But I'm sure Halima didn't tell you I was an easy teacher.<eos> No, she didn't, but she doesn't tell me a lot of things.<eos> Uh, why don't I tutor you.
So do we just go home now or...<eos> - All the time, man.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> So you heard it too?<eos> Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, please, let me help you with that, okay?
- Thank you.<eos> ...and relieved.<eos> Listen, anything you need, call me directly.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Doctor, can I speak with you for a second?
When we had no luck on the underage-sex front, we passed the case on to Narco, thought they might have a better chance getting Bo on a drug charge, and we moved on.<eos> Well, Hudson didn't.<eos> I just found all this stuff in his apartment... fresh notes on McClaren, interviews with someone named "Juliet"<eos> dated this month. It's not clear if he was working the case or the girl, ma'am.<eos> Does the "Juliet" mean something to you?
When I was at a real low point, I bet at my laptop for a week, living off a bag of rice.<eos> But now I'm back working as a chef, growing my own veggies, just enjoying the everyday things.<eos> Who shot you in the knee, Mr Murphy?<eos> I don't know who.<eos> This person, or persons, took you to Lansdowne Park, walked you to a secluded area and shot you in the knee, and you have no idea what they look like?
Brown hair, blonde hair, glasses?<eos> Couldn't say?<eos> I didn't see them.<eos> Mr Murphy, this is your last chance.<eos> Please describe to this commission who shot you that day.
You knew Todd needed money, so after finding out your boss had a new Ferrari, you decided to help Todd steal it.<eos> He was giving you your cut when he came to see you, only Major Hamilton found out and got his own revenge later that night and that's the reason you haven't come forward.<eos> You feel responsible for Todd's death, don't you?<eos> Major Hamilton doesn't drive a Ferrari.<eos> Can you describe the document I've just given you?
She is our manager.<eos> - Yeah, it wasn't my idea.<eos> - Hey, she's working for free, man.<eos> See?<eos> I told you she digs you.
So, mr. Conley...<eos> Until the past month, boyfriend one,<eos> Craig conley, had been giving our victim $1,000 a month In child support.<eos> Which explains why the cash deposits were cut in half.<eos> When we first told you about heather's death, You said, "really?
Wait.<eos> Uh, if Nick didn't call for his ride until three minutes later, who was he waving to here?<eos> Maybe the FBI will be able to answer that question.<eos> Special Agents Soto and Morris.<eos> Captain, I have a federal court order directing you to turn over all evidence related to this act of terrorism to me right now.
And I know what you're thinking, but I didn't go home with him.<eos> I was clear we weren't doing that, and he told me "No problem" and gave me his phone number in case I changed my mind.<eos> - He tell you how he made this money?<eos> - No. Mostly, he just talked about how hot my ass looked.<eos> Kimberly... do you have a boyfriend... someone who might be jealous over the attention Nick gave you?
Richard Downey. Ah.<eos> Yes.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> I was able to confirm a courtyard suite for you. - [Coughs]<eos> - I'll just swipe your card for incidentals, and Benny will show you to your room. Oh.
Your mother and your bookkeeper.<eos> His mother was dead, so I made sure To make good friends with my husband's accountant.<eos> "Oh, Bobby," I'd say, "you work so much harder than I do. Let me handle the bills."<eos> I don't think he understood that I was seeing checks go out, to cover these giant personal expenses On his Corporate credit card.<eos> So, you knew that Mr. Cushing was cheating on you.
Dwight did not grow up like that.<eos> I mean, this is gonna sound clichã©, but my best friend is a black woman.<eos> Dwight had friends of all different races.<eos> I didn't teach him hate.<eos> Does the name Brian Schultz mean anything to you?
Actually, I'm not getting married.<eos> We went our separate ways, as they say.<eos> Huh. He didn't want me to continue working after we got married.<eos> I'm sure a lot of men feel that way.<eos> I think it's a sin to waste the gifts that god gave you.
"The zombie community"?<eos> - Christine McKenzie.<eos> - AKA "Dead Ringer"?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> Uh, we'd like to speak to you about your stolen wallet.
I don't give a damn what you found.<eos> I want you to leave my son alone.<eos> Your son is now a witness in a homicide. I don't need your permission to talk to him.<eos> Edward, we're all very sorry about what you've been through.<eos> Can you remember anything about the person that was shooting at you?
Oh, my God!<eos> I mean, I really thought I was screwed in there, you know?<eos> I mean, my hands... look, I'm still shaking.<eos> - I'm like a wreck.<eos> - What did I tell you?
Thanks.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Back at it.<eos> Hey, Lieutenant.<eos> Squad 4 sent this incident report over for you.
Ashley Hughes, 21, crush injuries with bilateral hip dislocations.<eos> Good distal pulses.<eos> - How'd it happen?<eos> - Fell on me.<eos> - What? What fell on you?
I'm just trying to disconnect.<eos> Be happy or something.<eos> I get that.<eos> Look...<eos> I think Oliver's going to ask you for a job.
- And nor should you.<eos> You see, the concept of nobility in France was deemed legally incompatible with the equality of its citizens in 1789.<eos> You must be Inspector Rousseau.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what my wife told you.
I'm so not gonna do well here.<eos> Are you a good person?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who says no?<eos> Have you ever felt like no one believes you?
I've no objection on religious grounds.<eos> But too many of our mothers were malnourished as children, so we see a lot of very narrow pelvises and, in that case, the witch doctor can't save them... But we can.<eos> With forceps?<eos> Yeah, with forceps or a Caesarean.<eos> It's why I asked you to bring the lignocaine.
Yes, we can't and don't do any operations that require a general.<eos> We have our own methods and we get good results for both mother and child.<eos> Babies are precious here.<eos> Well, babies are precious everywhere.<eos> Nevertheless, I expect half your patients come to you asking you to prevent conception.
My father.<eos> At least he was the last time the police called me about him.<eos> And here's a hint. You want him to talk you better bring a bottle of whisky.<eos> Whisky. Got it.<eos> So there. I gave you what you wanted.
It's gonna be okay.<eos> Ali.. You're really vulnerable right now.<eos> That's not why.<eos> I promise.<eos> His plane landed hours ago. I'm just asking you to tell me if he got on the...
Yes!<eos> Great!<eos> It turns out the skin growths on your face are what saved your life.<eos> Stem cells in the skin formed new tissue called harmatomas, expressing high levels of dioxin-metabolizing enzymes, isolating the dioxin away from your vital organs.<eos> Now, I'm gonna put you on an anti-obesity drug called orlistat.
I'm not supposed... I'm not supposed to be here.<eos> Please, just come, come.<eos> Come, I'm...<eos> You all right?<eos> I did not ask you to do anything.
I can do what I want.<eos> You know that.<eos> Mr. Poletti.<eos> Rose.<eos> I brought something for you.
- What happened next?<eos> - You saw the tapes. It went south fast.<eos> We were made the moment Fawn walked in the door.<eos> Which takes us to two nights ago.<eos> Steven Frost instructed you to back down after, and I quote, "DeJean showed brash and unpredictable behavior, making him a liability to our negotiation."
One with betrayal and jealousy, though sadly classic.<eos> A truly gifted director watches as her former classmate's star rises in Hollywood, while she fought like hell for every opportunity.<eos> I love what I do.<eos> So what if Zane made millions because he chose the gym over acting school? I make art.<eos> But when Zane asked you to cast him as Hamlet, you told him no, didn't you?
I doubt she needs your kind of help, Agent Mallory.<eos> You may think you know Ms. Shipton, but, in fact, you do not.<eos> You could have fooled me.<eos> I'm sure she has.<eos> Tell me, did Ms. Shipton ever tell you why she left MI6?
And neither is mine.<eos> Did I say it was?<eos> - I mean, yeah, basically.<eos> - No.<eos> So about the chapter that I sent you.
He was always looking for excuses to hang round the nursery.<eos> Did it occur to you as odd?<eos> I thought he was...<eos> You thought he was "paying court".<eos> And neglected to tell you he had a wife.
You and Amy's date.<eos> It's not really a date.<eos> It's more vague and no official plan.<eos> Felix?<eos> She likes you.
Played the game of my life that night.<eos> When she wasn't there at the end, I knew... that something was wrong.<eos> You should be eligible for parole.<eos> No, I don't go before the board anymore.<eos> What's the first question they ask you?
No, no, no, don't put this on her.<eos> It's her job to not take sides.<eos> That's true, but I find focusing on the immediate problems to be the most effective solution.<eos> I prefer to discuss the past.<eos> Did he tell you I was kidnapped when I was 16?
I spent a couple nights in the county jail before my lawyer could get bail.<eos> - And during this time, did you speak to any other inmates?<eos> Yes, there was a, uh, man in my cell block.<eos> -Why is he on the stand? -Shh.<eos> And what did this man tell you?
I think you're lying.<eos> I think you do remember.<eos> I... I don't blame you for not wanting to talk about it.<eos> I wouldn't want to either.<eos> But I read about what he did to you.
Thank you.<eos> It was our hope that this stunt would burn out on its own, but it seems to be metastasizing.<eos> All the city papers have picked up the story, and the President has started to receive calls from several alumni and donors.<eos> The situation's become a university problem.<eos> So, with everybody's best interests in mind, we are notifying you that you are suspended, effective immediately.
I want you to say it.<eos> I like you, too.<eos> Vince.<eos> Ms. Keating. Honor to meet, finally.<eos> Did Wes ask you to wait out here?
Yeah, Oli hacked Produce Guy's e-mail.<eos> Guess what he sent someone a link to just three weeks before Edith was poisoned?<eos> It's an article about... Antifreeze.<eos> He e-mailed this article to someone about three weeks before your mother got sick.<eos> I told you we could never do this.
They said that if we played it like it was Ryan, they would make sure that Melanie went along with it.<eos> When I spoke with her the next day, she didn't even bring it up.<eos> I just didn't want to believe that she was really raped.<eos> That's your story.<eos> And we believe you.
You don't know about the day-to-day reality on Rikers Island.<eos> It's all about the inmates.<eos> My cos get beat up, jumped.<eos> But you lay a hand on an inmate, and they write you up.<eos> Good luck to you when you need a prisoner to testify.
- To Dodds!<eos> Number three.<eos> He looks smaller in there.<eos> They usually do, Counselor.<eos> And for what it's worth, while he was in holding, he told me he got paid $250 each time he talked to you.
You want me to take a polygraph? No problem.<eos> Want me to give you a sample of my DNA?<eos> I will do whatever it takes.<eos> Just please rule me out so you can find the person that really killed Phoebe.<eos> All right, say we believe you.
- Please.<eos> Sit.<eos> We know that you and Marissa were having an affair and that your wife, Teri, found out.<eos> She confronted Marissa over your infidelity, and that confrontation ended in Marissa's murder.<eos> When Teri got home, she told you what she had done.
Mr. Wu, however, was unaware that you owned the property with a partner.<eos> He says he's been negotiating with you and you alone.<eos> Jared's wife told us there was one property you absolutely refused to unload.<eos> We're guessing this is the one.<eos> See, he didn't know anything about the ginseng, so when he pressured you to sell the place at a discount, you made a decision.
Stay with us, Alina.<eos> Pressure's holding.<eos> - Okay, I need to make another incision. - All right.<eos> So, I, uh, I talked to that pharma rep. And she's gonna try to get you in on that trial study.<eos> I told you I didn't wanna do that.
He never pins you to the bed, never holds your wrists, never pulls your hair?<eos> No, no, no, none of those things, no.<eos> Has he ever asked you to do anything you're not comfortable with? No.<eos> He's never objectified you?<eos> Never asked you to perform with other men or women?
I can't describe it.<eos> It's a body language thing, I think.<eos> Body language?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you recall what body language suggested to you Rebecca Thornton wanted to have sex with you?
But I can't risk putting any more lives in danger. Thought this was from Barry Allen?<eos> It is.<eos> Only from 40 years in the future.<eos> - And neither can this. - Fascinating.<eos> Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret.
Don't move.<eos> What the hell is this thing?<eos> I can't risk putting any more lives in danger.<eos> And neither can you.<eos> Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret.
Nope, the kitchen is officially...<eos> Salmonella and E.coli-free! Okay, guys,back to work.<eos> Which is a huge relief.<eos> Guess General Matthews' food poisoning must've come from somewhere else.<eos> As I assured you it did.
Okay, well, let me just get Blake.<eos> Well, this is more of a you and me conversation.<eos> I, uh, I need to show you something.<eos> Why are you showing me an X-ray of my arm?<eos> Because it's one of the many things Blake's done to you over the years.
Did you know he was the same guard who slipped<eos> Gabriel into Halawa to meet with Adam Noshimuri?<eos> You didn't know that, did you?<eos> Tuasopo played you, Michelle.<eos> He saw the chance to make a few extra bucks, so he told you about Gabriel's partnership offer to Adam.
Because he asked me to call if I knew anything.<eos> And what did you know?<eos> Is this how this works...<eos> you pull me off the streets and drag me into this anonymous building and start questioning me without a lawyer?<eos> When we told you about John Broadbent dying from a CHI, why did you leave your office?
I know many kings.<eos> Quite a few princes, too.<eos> This guy's last name was King.<eos> Captain, let's cut to the chase.<eos> I'm aware that my son thinks I'm a monster, and I assume he's convinced you of some outlandish things, but I hope that won't color the course of your investigation.
We're talking about a potential murder that these people have committed.<eos> I mean, at least one.<eos> Maybe more.<eos> It's typical government bullshit.<eos> Agent Gaines, I'm gonna have to ask you to watch your language.
We're a part of something that matters, and we matter because we are a part of it.<eos> You don't actually believe that.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I am very sorry about my outburst last week.<eos> I'm gonna be completely calm and ask you, please, don't take me off this case.
You're a woman. You'll understand this.<eos> My daughter is all I had.<eos> He took her from me.<eos> So until somebody makes it worth my while, I will haunt you.<eos> You want us to pay you for your daughter?
I grabbed him, I tried to drag him into my car, but...<eos> But what?<eos> He knew that I was... liberating meds from patients and selling them on the street.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> He told you that if you took him back, he was gonna rat you out.
The Wisconsin Dells is God's country.<eos> - Hmm. - Seven mornings of sleeping in, seven afternoons at the indoor water park, the Ho-Chunk Casino.<eos> It sounds like a dream come true.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did anybody fill you in on the baby we found this morning?
- What's wrong with him?<eos> - Don't worry, I got this. Zoey, take Hunter into the bathroom and turn on the shower as hot as it will go.<eos> Riley, go to my room, grab some towels. I'll make sure the window and door are sealed. Let's go!<eos> I'm just saying if getting the weather job was that important to you, you probably should have said something.<eos> Oh! Oh, you mean like when I told you how important getting the weather job was to me!
You can't return to the streets safely.<eos> Can this be appealed?<eos> Son, you gotta think about your quality of life.<eos> There's a lot of brave men out there who never got the chance to do what you're doing... to walk away from a shooting.<eos> The department will find something for you where you can be effective, and you won't be in danger.
Once I gave you the opportunity to eliminate the Nazi assassin, you were free to make your case fit anyone.<eos> Not anyone.<eos> The Panel are not fools.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> I know the value of the information I gave you.
Any wife would, but I'm also a neurologist, and I couldn't ignore his symptoms.<eos> Oh, so you diagnosed the Lewy Body Dementia?<eos> Yes, but I got second and third opinions, and they both agreed it was LBD, and that was about four years ago.<eos> Four years, really?<eos> You know, Nathan expressed deep regret to me about the pain that he's caused you.
I'm trying to make the best of it, just like you said.<eos> Well, don't bother. Making the best of it sucks.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> This town is a crap circus.<eos> What has gotten into you?
This town is a crap circus.<eos> What has gotten into you?<eos> You clearly got the promotion like you wanted.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> The blue looks great on you.
Okay.<eos> See now, no sooner do I try and help you out you go and make me regret it.<eos> Nobody asked for your help.<eos> Too high a price as far as I can see.<eos> All I did was ask you to stay out of it.
You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> Just...<eos> Now, Captain, let's just get down to business. I'd like to leave St. Louis.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> You touch my son or my daughter, I will hunt you down and I will kill you.
Well, depends on whether you're talking in the moment or hindsight.<eos> In the moment.<eos> You get so caught up in things, Ms. Person, and you get this idea about what happened.<eos> And it's like you get a kind of tunnel vision.<eos> Is that what happened to you, sir?
Well, she just cares.<eos> While she didn't serve, she's always been willing to pitch in, to help.<eos> She's a very empathetic person.<eos> Big-hearted.<eos> Has Dr. Torres discussed her move to New York with you?
- You don't know that.<eos> All you have are a few grainy pictures.<eos> They don't mean anything.<eos> He had something to do with that shooting in Harrisburg, the one where a bunch of innocent people lost their lives.<eos> Get me what I asked you for.
Mr. President, you must believe...<eos> It doesn't matter what you knew or didn't know.<eos> Not now.<eos> What matters is that you stay safe.<eos> For whatever reason, these terrorists your administration is in bed with are turning on you.
Thanks. That's very kind.<eos> Okay.<eos> How many other girls live here?<eos> There's space for 20 or 30, but I'm not sure how many are here now.<eos> We've thrown some things into the closet for you.
My life is at stake from here forward.<eos> Listen to me, Faisal. It's called a safe house for good reason, okay?<eos> So you and I can meet in safety and achieve our common objective... peace, stability, and democracy in Saudi Arabia, right?<eos> Whose version of democracy? America's?<eos> I think that one likes you.
Excuse me.<eos> Are you on the election board?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I work for Mr. Cobblepot.<eos> He just wanted me to confirm what Butch gave you. May I?
I already tried him.<eos> What happened, you forget your cane?<eos> I don't need it anymore.<eos> Put an all-points out on Gordon.<eos> Hey, does that guy look strange to you?
- Who's there? !<eos> - Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.<eos> No one. It's only me.<eos> Guilty. He's guilty! Guilty.<eos> Guilty. What is wrong with you?
I'm not telling you anything about our sessions.<eos> Simon Halbrooks, of Private Investigative Solutions.<eos> That's my company.<eos> Built it myself. Hmm.<eos> Dean Cooper made several off-the-books six-figure payments to you in the last few weeks.
Since you can't tell time, we're going to have to have you report here three times a week. Oh!<eos> Sharlene, no, come on, now. You know I run a company. I can't come here three times a week.<eos> This isn't some thug rapper you're negotiating with, Holloway.<eos> This is the United States government.<eos> You need time to consider, I can send you back to Danbury to think it over.
I'm a lawman, remember?<eos> I'm one of the good guys.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Sit back down.<eos> I'm not gonna let Dwight hurt you anymore.
If you do not accept my offer, I will send you an e-mail thanking you for our enlightening conversation on conscious synthetics.<eos> - I'd tell them.<eos> - That you didn't tell me anything.<eos> Of course.<eos> And I'm sure they would believe you.
Thanks.<eos> Izzy?<eos> Someone to see you.<eos> Isabelle.<eos> Did you get the stuff I sent you?
Now, please don't get me wrong. He is a good man.<eos> But he is... a man.<eos> And they are so very prone to bumbling, are they not?<eos> Oh, yes, I suppose they are.<eos> I believe that he confided in you that he was intending to court a lady.
Regulations say you should've gone with your men to Manila.<eos> The first duty of a soldier, Lieutenant, - is to defend Spain.<eos> - You didn't do that too well.<eos> I didn't surrender, God knows I fought until I had no strength left.<eos> Isn't this enough for you, or this?
Is it not too risky to do this?<eos> We could still maintain our first assets... and wait if something better comes...<eos> Mr. Kim...<eos> Yes sir?<eos> You just do what I tell you to do.
Sorry, the thing is..<eos> Get off me!<eos> You idiot! Go help her!<eos> Hey!<eos> What's with you? !
You gave it to me without knowing me.<eos> My name is Drew.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> - Mrs. Dalton...<eos> How many thousands of non-insurance-covered dollars have I given you over the past five years?
I do solemnly declare that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me, God.<eos> On the 8th November last year, you said in your statement that you recalled being woken by something in the night?<eos> Yes.<eos> We were in bed, both in bed, my wife and I, and... we were startled by a very loud thud, like something being dragged across the floor.<eos> And is it true or is it not true that the next time you saw Timothy Evans he told you that Mrs Evans had gone to Bristol with the baby?
People asking for help.<eos> Their cases didn't go the way they wanted them to go, so... I read them all.<eos> His moved me, so I reached out.<eos> We talk about his case.<eos> Um, Ms. D, all due respect, what the hell is going on with you?
- Oh, he's fine.<eos> A few bruises, but no signs of sexual abuse.<eos> But emotionally?<eos> There are some signs of trauma.<eos> Did he say anything to you in English?
We're more concerned with the middle. Excuse me?<eos> Ana claims that you raped her. Forced her to?<eos> Please.<eos> So the sex was consensual?<eos> I told you, we never had sex.
Stan Moraino?<eos> Deputy Chief Moraino.<eos> I mean, he's the one who ran the operation, right?<eos> He's the one who protected you.<eos> He provided you with this cush job for what?
The body can experience residual reflexes.<eos> Yes, muscles can spasm, and then they stiffen.<eos> There are a lot of reasons for slight movements.<eos> This wasn't slight.<eos> Okay, I promise you it does not mean that she is actually...
Unsupervised interrogation of a suspect?<eos> Where's your partner?<eos> Who are you... really?<eos> You know, when I first read you were Spring's bodyguard, when he died, I assumed you were going to be a lot of help to us, but you know what, now I see it.<eos> Now I see what stopped you from going the agency route.
We just have a few quick questions.<eos> Misty, this is a very troubling time, but, uh, I always have time for you.<eos> Now, you were briefed by the CIA today, weren't you?<eos> I can't speak to any specifics. Everything's confidential, so...<eos> We understand that, Senator, and we won't press you on it, but can you tell us what the CIA said?
Do you need anything? Uh, yeah, actually, you can help us out.<eos> We need an emergency contact for this patient.<eos> Can you maybe go through his phone and see if you can find someone in his social circle who can answer questions?<eos> Yeah, I'd be glad to do it.<eos> Thank you. That was uncomfortable.
- Very good.<eos> Well, you're lucky to be alive, Mr. Solloway. Wait.<eos> What happened? What... wh...<eos> - How did I get here?<eos> - I don't know all the details, but your wife may be able to tell you.
Don't usually allow animals here, but... Well, the nurses seem to like me, so...<eos> How you feeling this morning?<eos> Like I want to get back to work.<eos> But the doctor won't let me go.<eos> Mr. Keslow, they just took your kidney out of you.
You check their security tapes.<eos> You must be up to something really dirty. It's never that easy with you.<eos> Come on...<eos> You never admit when you're lying.<eos> Whenever Mom would catch you in some story that didn't add up, you would just bob and weave until she just got tired and gave up.
I don't even understand some of these swearwords.<eos> He was purposefully provoking me.<eos> You know I'm not supposed to get this report. And amazingly, he hasn't asked for your immediate dismissal.<eos> He wants to observe you again.<eos> - Maybe he likes you.
Cleanliness is a virtue here in the Reich.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I read that.<eos> Glad you're fitting in.<eos> Helen wanted me to ask you if you have any objection to pot roast.
We continue to let you live and your friend Frank live.<eos> Why?<eos> So I can be useful.<eos> And are you being useful?<eos> I told you about the counterfeiting.
You mean because it didn't benefit you.<eos> That's the only reason you ever do anything, isn't it?<eos> What I did I did for you, Joe.<eos> You have a great future ahead of you.<eos> And you thought I'd be useful to you.
Excuse me?<eos> I'll send someone over to collect them soon.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm trying to solve a murder case that has national attention and FBI oversight.<eos> I ask you for something, please cooperate.
There's no denying that.<eos> It was a horrible accident.<eos> Um, you've suffered bodily injury and loss of mobility.<eos> Uh-huh. Now, we know in situations like this, the injured party will file suit against, well, - everybody.<eos> - But I can assure you, as the new CEO of Hawthorne Concrete that my company was in no way responsible for what happened to you.
We fight, hook and dagger, and slash and stab to the very last man.<eos> [sighs] Shit.<eos> Deputy?<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, Mr. Williams asked you to hold those kids for me?
Prove you're a doctor.<eos> Prove it!<eos> I'm sure... the doctor can demonstrate his medical knowledge.<eos> This is our regularly scheduled group therapy time, where we all try to help one another with our issues.<eos> Convince me you're really a doctor, I'll let you out of the jacket.
Time and space, it's not all that it's cracked up to be.<eos> Maybe this guy just knows things before they happen, like me.<eos> Don't you know things before they happen, Josh?<eos> Yeah, some things I know, but...<eos> Do you want me to tell you?
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> So, there's what, just you and that deputy here?<eos> Or are there others out there wrangling up steers somewhere?<eos> Mr. Harp, I don't think you're understanding the situation.<eos> This man was drugged and killed with a heroin overdose from a large yellow syringe, which matches the drugs and syringe that we just found on you.
Mom?<eos> It's your sister, Hye Jung.<eos> Get an MRI for now.<eos> You can leave now.<eos> She'll show you where to go.
You get right to the point.<eos> When dealing with the big chiefs of the white men, I've learned it's best to cut through the bullshit early, or you're likely to drown in it.<eos> - Touché.<eos> - Seriously, Sawyer, why should I throw my money, my publicity machine, and my sizeable off-Res native constituency your way?<eos> Because I'm going to solve your biggest problem for you.
Not exactly.<eos> - We made a deal first.<eos> - Okay. But what happened after you made the deal?<eos> He released me.<eos> And then he shot at you. No.
I don't know about original.<eos> I find him to be thoughtful and observant.<eos> Did he ask you about why you left Philadelphia? - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> He didn't ask you about the scandal surrounding your dismissal?
So.<eos> Mr. Browning, I've read your statement.<eos> But isn't it true that when you had your run-in with the sheriff out there in those woods, you were actually hunting down a girl named Gabriella Langton?<eos> You were gonna kill her so she couldn't charge your men with rape.<eos> Walt shot at you strictly out of self-defense.
Don't go to that new bagel place.<eos> You're under arrest, Ms. Joyce.<eos> Geez, you scared the...<eos> Ohh, you scared the heck out of me.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, but, uh, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me... to Colorado.
It's okay.<eos> I'm not so sure she's on your side.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Every passenger in the last 72 hours whose flight originated from Boston.<eos> Yeah, you can fax it to the number I gave you.
Thank you, Silvia, but you don't have to wait on me like this.<eos> But I want to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where's my father?<eos> The Reichsminister had to leave early, but he has a car waiting for you.
On the grounds that five minutes ago, she told me she'd sooner deny Leonard Bailey a new trial than to risk looking incompetent.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then permission granted.<eos> Ms. Casey, when you were Leonard Bailey's public defender, did he tell you that at the time of the murders, he was in the apartment of a woman named Maria Gomez?
I meant every word, Abigail.<eos> So, who's the muscle?<eos> Oh, Gina and Tina?<eos> Presidential motorcade.<eos> I can introduce you if you want.
He's rotting on death row for a crime that he didn't commit.<eos> So you met with him for ten minutes and you're ready to release him?<eos> No, what I'm saying is--<eos> You're a second-year law student, Rachel.<eos> I asked you to be a part of this because you're one of my brightest students, but I also asked you in particular because I didn't think you'd be so naive.
That is my official drop-out request.<eos> I'm doing the Innocence Project.<eos> What are you doing here, Harvey?<eos> You didn't give me a chance to show you all the motions I filed to keep that bastard out of your backyard.<eos> Because I told you if you were late for dinner you could go screw yourself.
Did you ever see "Wall Street"? Money never sleeps.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Have a look.<eos> Let me get this straight. I hire you, and the first thing you do is come to me for a favor?<eos> I came to you for a favor when you were my tenant.
- What's this?<eos> - Have a look.<eos> Let me get this straight. I hire you, and the first thing you do is come to me for a favor?<eos> I came to you for a favor when you were my tenant.<eos> Now, as your lawyer, I am coming to you with an opportunity.
- You heard me.<eos> He hasn't come to see you once.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> It doesn't matter to me.<eos> He could be lying on a beach in the French Riviera, while you can barely see your wife and kids, and that doesn't matter to you?
'Cause he thought he was maybe gonna have sex with her?<eos> Objection. Leading.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> - Nothing further.<eos> So, Sean never told you that, uh, he thought Ashley liked him or that he was interested in having sex with her, did he?
Look, guys.<eos> This isn't about Melanie.<eos> It's about her daughter.<eos> We need to get justice for her... with or without cooperation.<eos> I told you, I don't want to do this.
The only question is... will I also be filing perjury charges?<eos> You agreed to lie for Metcalf because he threatened to out you for making those illegal sex videos, right?<eos> But now that we know about those videos too, you got no reason to lie for Metcalf.<eos> I'd err on the side of telling the truth.<eos> Probably gonna be better for you in the long run.
Jenna miller was taken to the er with bite marks on her breasts and her thighs.<eos> She was bleeding, all injuries consistent with sexual assault.<eos> - Did you talk to jenna at the hospital? - Yes.<eos> She said that she had been raped.<eos> - Did jenna tell you that she had been offered money for the sexual encounter?
Witness may answer.<eos> I was passed out.<eos> No matter what I said or didn't say, that means he raped me.<eos> That means he raped you?<eos> Or is that what the SVU detectives and the DA told you?
Why are you asking me?<eos> All I do is pick up and deliver. That's it.<eos> Anything else is none of my business.<eos> Excuse me, I gotta go.<eos> Uh, did anyone from the Inquiry ask you about any of this?
Nonsense.<eos> Algeria needs a leader.<eos> I will call for elections.<eos> My people should have the chance to choose me.<eos> Do I really need to remind you that at the beginning of negotiations, the insurgency demanded your head?
You know, I could give you my tailor's number.<eos> He can redo your whole closet.<eos> Anderson: Can he design me a new ass?<eos> 'Cause this one is definitely past its prime.<eos> $11 million to go along with the one million I gave you in cash.
Sounds like a blast.<eos> You know, there'll probably be another fiesta next week.<eos> Families rent that restaurant for them all the time. You should check it out.<eos> - All day party do me good. - [chuckles]<eos> What was he telling you about?
A lot of people.<eos> If we don't find them soon, it may be too late, but in order to do that we're gonna need to ask you some questions.<eos> The problem is if we take your tube out, we cannot guarantee you'll be able to breathe on your own.<eos> And once it's out, we may not be able to put it back in.<eos> What we are asking you to do won't help you directly, but it could save a lot of lives.
Reggie was a photographer with "Stars and Stripes."<eos> Now they said that you're having trouble catching your breath?<eos> Well, I can't say you're making it any easier.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Mr. Dixon, um, the doctor that put you on steroids...
To be a whore at one of your executive clubs?<eos> Bet you get a nice fat bonus for signing someone like her.<eos> Dad, stop.<eos> Listen to her.<eos> Put the gun down or he will shoot you.
I'll-I'll be up in a minute.<eos> Again, the house is offline.<eos> Diplomatic Security's on high alert.<eos> This house is probably the safest place the secretary could be.<eos> And what does that tell you?
Kimble, we need the right enemy.<eos> We need to be absolutely certain who did this before we strike.<eos> And personally, I... I have a difficult time accepting that the only way to bring the country together is through war.<eos> You have a lot of difficult decisions ahead of you, sir.<eos> Speaking for Congress, I want to assure you that you have my complete support no matter what you decide.
Oh!<eos> Oh, it's here.<eos> Mrs Svrcek.<eos> Mr Elliot, thanks for coming. It's a pleasure.<eos> I asked you here because...
Mug.<eos> Mrs Svrcek, what a pleasant surprise.<eos> Mr Elliot.<eos> Please, call me Duncan.<eos> Erm... What I told you yesterday about you running the yard.
And what if they did?<eos> The police won't help you, Mrs Svrcek.<eos> You see, round here I can do whatever I like.<eos> And I'm telling you, that I want to run your yard.<eos> Well, I'm telling you, I've made my decision.
That's... look, there's still time to get him what he wants.<eos> I-I can, I can handle this.<eos> You have time to get him what?<eos> How did he disguise his voice?<eos> Wh-What timetable did he give you?
Were you allowed to speak to your wife?<eos> We're not gonna do this right now.<eos> I'd like you to leave my house, please.<eos> Mr. Stone, I've worked dozens of kidnap cases.<eos> I'm not asking you to rely on my, experience and judgment alone.
I can't believe you people.<eos> I was taken.<eos> Yes, by two Pakistani men.<eos> We've heard your, um, bigoted fantasia.<eos> Do these look fake to you?
Sure.<eos> Energy drinks?<eos> Human pyramids?<eos> '90s ska music?<eos> What did '90s ska music do to you?
He's coming back on the line now.<eos> - Thank you. - My pleasure, sir.<eos> Governor Royce.<eos> You're a hard man to reach.<eos> Well, I told you before. I'm pretty busy.
Eight or nine checks, tops.<eos> None above... $5,000.<eos> Okay, well, let's do the math here. Let's say it's nine, and $5,000 each, that comes to $45,000.<eos> Now, the fund shows withdrawals about 20 times that.<eos> I ever tell you about the first time I met her, all dressed up?
At the moment.<eos> If enough time passed...<eos> How much time is enough time?<eos> - Nic...<eos> - She likes you.
This wasn't a Virgin Marski situation.<eos> There was nothing immaculate about this conception.<eos> Well, the fun part's over now.<eos> Yeah, she's mine.<eos> Excuse you.
Sorry about Landon.<eos> I imagine he was just a bit overwhelmed.<eos> By day he seems so tame.<eos> You know his father was a carpenter.<eos> Tell me, how is it you see all these writers and producers every day and no one's ever asked you to come read for something?
Maybe there's something else you would like.<eos> This, for example. Hmm?<eos> Actually, monsieur, this can be worn with a silk shrug.<eos> Oh, but you don't need it.<eos> The dress would be just as flattering on you without it.
Hey, don't put this on me!<eos> My son knows he can talk to me anytime!<eos> I've worked my ass off to be supportive and easy to open up to!<eos> And you all thought I was the crazy one.<eos> You went online, you read all the reviews, but here's something they don't tell you about Korean cars... no one'll ever steal it.
Nori and I are very happy, and I'm glad you're warming to that.<eos> Was I that disapproving?<eos> Look, that... that night,<eos> Nori didn't actually think you'd go through with it.<eos> But I ran after you, and I lost you in the fog by the bridge.
I don't know what I'm looking at.<eos> - I told you, man, he pulls.<eos> He Pu-u-ulls.<eos> - Okay, stop saying "pulls."<eos> Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
Mr. President, no SEAL has ever been captured or left behind on a battlefield dead or alive.<eos> I have zero intention of my team being an exception to that legacy.<eos> Your team's safety is my primary concern.<eos> If you have an opportunity to capture Nassar alive, that would be optimal.<eos> But if you think it's too risky, I am ordering you to take him out and get your men back safely.
But you do recall the gaps.<eos> Now, I can't help but think that the fear and frustration of not knowing is precisely what's causing these sudden, uncontrollable bouts of anger.<eos> I... I just want answers.<eos> And hopefully, I can help you get them.<eos> But I need you to know there is always a chance that you will never know for certain what did or didn't happen to you.
ANC...<eos> Hello, this is Titus Kincaid.<eos> I'm supposed to be on now, but my door is stuck.<eos> I am terribly sorry about that.<eos> A maintenance crew will be sent to you shortly.
This fucking doctor... You think he would have done the things I've done for you?<eos> ¿Quieres Que me quede?<eos> No, está bien.<eos> Ms. Patterson, I'm Detective Blackstone. I'm from the Oakland police department.<eos> Did Sergeant Moreno tell you why I wanted to talk to you today?
Shoot me the address.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna text you that address, with a text.<eos> - And it's gonna...<eos> - Mr. Holstein.<eos> What did I tell you about sitting on the lab tables?
And once they're off the plane, it can return to Istanbul.<eos> But what about the rest of the passengers?<eos> No.<eos> As we discussed, they are all registered with DHS.<eos> And as I told you before, ma'am, the people of my state are frightened.
Where are we?<eos> Clear the area.<eos> 10 minutes, then we roll.<eos> Mr. McGrath, this concludes our broadcast day.<eos> What'd I tell you, Halbeck?
Can I ask you where you were between 9:30 and 11:00 last night?<eos> You can ask all you like, I'm not gonna make any comment.<eos> So you don't deny that you were there?<eos> Nice try, Detective, but I'm not confirming or denying I was anywhere last night.<eos> Did he talk to you about Kyle Hampton or the O'Donohues?
So you don't deny that you were there?<eos> Nice try, Detective, but I'm not confirming or denying I was anywhere last night.<eos> Did he talk to you about Kyle Hampton or the O'Donohues?<eos> Okay, I think this conversation is over.<eos> Did he tell you he was planning on speaking to the police?
Not my something to say.<eos> It's his.<eos> You know, Carl, I...<eos> I need a favor. What is it?<eos> I don't know how much he told you about what happened the other night.
Cut!<eos> Mei Mei, that was great.<eos> Okay, moving on!<eos> Mr. Zhao?<eos> A guy named Jimmy Wah left a message with the production office for you.
Sure.<eos> You said in your statement the last time you spoke to Mr Le Saux was earlier that day.<eos> Midday?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's when he told you to pick up his son from...
Here you are.<eos> Let's get that...<eos> There you go.<eos> So...how can I help you?<eos> I think Theo Kettler suggested to you that Le Saux Haulage is for sale?
Thank you.<eos> Oh, Mrs Svrcek?<eos> You're gonna get other offers, I know that.<eos> And some people might even try and take advantage of what's been happening.<eos> Might try and tell you that your business isn't worth what you might think it is.
What new information do you have for me?<eos> [Nanette] Well, I've looked into that.<eos> Okay, all right. Where were you when Greg Faull was killed?<eos> So can you tell me the real story?<eos> So around that time, did John ask you to do something and give you any money?
Come on, Diego.<eos> Did you really think it's no big deal to vandalize the Secretary of State's office?<eos> I thought maybe it was just a prank.<eos> You know, crazy powerful people.<eos> So someone asked you to do it?
All right, that's smart.<eos> That'll give you infrapericardial control.<eos> Cutting him from stem to stern right now is completely reckless.<eos> Just get control of the IVC from above and below the liver from the incision we've already made!<eos> Yeah, that is what the textbooks would tell you to do, but any trauma surgeon will tell you it will not work without a sternotomy.
Your DNA is going to come back IDing you as Giza Barerra.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Well, I bet you know who Alejandro Medina is.<eos> See, we know that you killed his father when you took over his cartel.<eos> I wonder what kind of a tattoo he's gonna give you when he finds out that you're alive.
Detective Murphy, let's talk about the 11 hours you spent...<eos> The 11 hours you spent eliciting a confession from my client.<eos> For murder.<eos> Sure.<eos> How many times did Richard tell you he was innocent?
I couldn't tell you.<eos> What I do know is that he said he was guilty.<eos> Once.<eos> But before that, 59 times<eos> Richard told you he did not kill Layla Everton.
Tell him that the only way he could escape was by admitting he killed Layla?<eos> You asking if I trapped him?<eos> I did not.<eos> I told him it would feel better to tell the truth.<eos> I told you already I didn't kill Layla.
And offensive.<eos> Oh, I'm not mocking Koreans. I'm mocking my dad, who happens to be Korean.<eos> That's called satire.<eos> Teachable moment.<eos> Dr. Park, did you study the material that the school e-mailed you?
She's actually been my best friend for 10 years.<eos> And I knew I loved her from the day I met her, when, in 2005, when we were, like, 15 years old.<eos> Well, it took me a year to convince her, that we could date, because her thing was, like,<eos> "I cannot, because you know the kind of family that I come from."<eos> And I was like, "Okay, I understand that, but I'm not asking you to marry me right now, so I'm... I mean, I'm not understanding what the apprehension is."
I-I don't understand.<eos> Why are you showing us these?<eos> We found them on the ground where Bennett Nealy fell.<eos> In Afghanistan, young lovers give each other tasbihs as a sign of affection, yes?<eos> He just asked you if you think that they're hers, and you said, "I hope not."
I have nothing to hide, not even what's under this robe.<eos> Well, removing that robe won't be necessary, sir.<eos> We're investigating the death of Chris Ristow.<eos> I have no idea who that is.<eos> He stole three million dollars from you.
So far, everything that he's released has proved to be 100% accurate.<eos> Sir, he has you dead to rights.<eos> An 18-year-old Senate page.<eos> This is extortion.<eos> No, Senator, I am simply presenting you with the truth.
You know what it is?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> But if there's something you need to tell me, Peter, this is the time.<eos> Well, everything I've ever told you has been true.
Yes, sir.<eos> Grace, I promised her that I would not spy on her tonight.<eos> Um, so I don't want to spy on her, but I want to ask you some questions, do a little research.<eos> Look, Mr. Williams, I-I already know where this is going, okay?<eos> You want me to tell you about her boyfriend.
This psychopath gets the best medical care on Earth and goes back to eating tapioca pudding and shanking people.<eos> And Jackie?<eos> She goes to the morgue.<eos> That's just the way this one went.<eos> And that's just okay with you?
I realize that, Dr. Brockett.<eos> I told her. Now it's up to her to decide.<eos> What are you making, Brandon?<eos> Niko wears this mask when he's fighting. I'm making one for me and my donor.<eos> Dr. Brockett. Can we have a word with you?
I'm sorry.<eos> He was a great kid, a good son, straight A's in high school, played the saxophone in the band, and now he is making a sex tape with a woman twice his a while dating her daughter.<eos> That is not the boy I knew.<eos> If Maya didn't kill him... who do you think did?<eos> Sir, that's exactly the reason why I've asked you here today.
She couldn't have children before the surgery because of the fibroids.<eos> So that gives you permission to mangle a young woman's body?<eos> I didn't man...<eos> I saved her life.<eos> Then why don't they believe you?
In fact, we think he saw everything Jack was saying in the media and started to wonder, had he been tricked?<eos> If he had, how did you learn his secret?<eos> Was he in danger of being exposed?<eos> He created the Raphael Arnold profile so he could look into you, only you saw through it.<eos> You knew he was onto you, so you ambushed him the other night.
I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.<eos> What-What are you doing in our apartment?<eos> Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor, the tall guy... dressed like a little boy.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you, but you can't stay here.
- Just like you.<eos> - Should that impress me?<eos> You come from a town so small it doesn't even have a name.<eos> You were raised by your grandmother.<eos> Your mother, Graciela, taught you how to turn poppies into morphine and morphine into heroin.
Well, I've aged quite a bit, sir.<eos> But you're looking as brilliant as ever.<eos> He doesn't look that cool to me.<eos> You punk!<eos> This is my grandson. The one that I've told you about.
Excuse me?<eos> A second habeas petition?<eos> Even with that socalled confession letter, it took balls to try that.<eos> Well, someone's got to have them.<eos> Well, like I told you, there were no errors made during the trial.
Shinwell said you pressed him hard on SBK money drops.<eos> He told you they happened at a jewelry mart up in the Bronx, but that place is set up like a fortress.<eos> So when there is a drop, SBK has guards and spotters at every entrance and exit.<eos> No once can get within a thousand feet.<eos> So, Shinwell told you there was a drop coming up.
I don't know what the fuck is going on.<eos> Dad...<eos> Should a man in his condition really be drinking?<eos> I am gonna fucking kill you.<eos> I'll let you in on a little secret.
Shoot, shoot, shit.<eos> -Well, which is it?<eos> - Is it "shit" or "shoot"?<eos> -I am deeply offended by myself, sir.<eos> Let me ease you off the shit-shoot mountain, captain.
I know your...<eos> I know your daughter died.<eos> But we all die someday, don't we?<eos> So what is it that's so terrible that you can't talk about?<eos> Okay! Here's what I'm not telling you.
It's true. You really fucking can't.<eos> That smile right there.<eos> You do me a favor. You take that to Elizabeth.<eos> You make it up with her.<eos> I'm sorry I said to you what I said last night.
"Monsters.<eos> "Are they real?<eos> "Or do the stories exist only to make us respect the sea's dark secrets?<eos> "The question both vexes and excites me<eos> "and is the reason I've written you a second time to request a meeting.
Angela, you've been complaining about night terrors.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> If you're hearing voices...<eos> You listen to my conversations?<eos> What did Pete tell you?
We already knew all that.<eos> Your job here is done when I tell you it's done.<eos> You told me, this was gonna be a simple extraction.<eos> It should have been.<eos> I didn't ask you to light up half of East Berlin.
It took me years to get back on my feet.<eos> Sara, that's not who I am.<eos> Things happened.<eos> I can understand your anger, but you shouldn't demean yourself.<eos> Dear Mr. Eldan, I hope it's okay that I'm writing to you.
I can't say "shit."<eos> You're being too hard on yourself, son. You can't learn everything in one day.<eos> All right?<eos> Mr. Hope?<eos> Can I speak to you for a moment, please?
Leave a message.<eos> Come on!<eos> What the...<eos> All right. Everybody, if you give me a couple of seconds I will explain everything I know.<eos> - Who put you in charge?
Hey guys, I'm really sorry, I am, I don't have any time to talk right now but...<eos> - If you call my assistant...<eos> We have reasons to believe that there are allegations against as many as 87 priests in Boston.<eos> I can't talk to you about that.<eos> Does that number sound right to you?
But nothing will work as long as that thing is still on.<eos> Young lady, I'm gonna assume that your knowledge of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.<eos> Shutting it down is impossible.<eos> There is no off.<eos> I'm telling you what it's doing.
Now, tell me what that says. - "Death."<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> I cannot argue with that.<eos> There it is, in black and white.<eos> But with a little applied science... what do I give you now?
Is that why you took off your top?<eos> I took off my top because...<eos> Well, 'cause I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.<eos> I've never done a nude scene before, so... what the hell, right?<eos> Did Sally tell you that this was... this is a very important article for me?
Boxed his research?<eos> Is that stored somewhere?<eos> Is there..<eos> Is there any.. any way that I could maybe get to it?<eos> Did Francis ever tell you how we met?
GREZDA:<eos> Heroin.<eos> Ninety-nine percent pure.<eos> The very best in the world.<eos> And my son told you I'd be interested in this?
I want you to tell me in front of God, your father, and everyone here that you don't love her.<eos> Say it!<eos> Tell me you don't love her!<eos> You're wrong about him, Tom.<eos> Mr. McCurdy, I need to talk to you.
Is this something that they teach you at the Police Academy?<eos> Or have you always been a robot?<eos> I can understand that you need professional distance, from a hardened criminal.<eos> But, when there's a poor downtrodden housewife, sobbing in the back of your car, on Christmas, one has to wonder.<eos> I'm guessing it's something they teach you.
Chief Atlee.<eos> Kind of you to accept our invitation.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> We know you created the Syndicate.<eos> But Lane went rogue and turned it against you, didn't he?
Oh, why, thank you, thank you.<eos> Um...<eos> Look, I'm here tonight for business.<eos> And I am a recovering alcoholic.<eos> So when I ask you for a vodka martini on the rocks if you could give me water with olives that would be fantastic.
He's one of the passengers from earlier.<eos> I don't-I don't believe this.<eos> So...<eos> So what you're saying... is... is that we've definitely gone past Barrock's Hill?<eos> Have you not heard anything we just told you?
Yes, sir.<eos> How's my girl?<eos> I should... call a cab.<eos> Just when you think it can't get any worse, you run out of cigarettes.<eos> Oh, tell me where to go. I'll buy some for you.
- Deputy.<eos> - Raise your hands.<eos> If you move in a hasty manner, I'll put a bullet in you.<eos> Well, that's the only thing.<eos> Like I just told you, I ain't got no weapon.
Maybe I shouldn't bet.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - A blonde hair.<eos> - Looks like from a woman.<eos> - I told you his manner was suspicious.
Are we breakin' camp?<eos> No, you go back to sleep.<eos> I'll wake you when we're...<eos> Unless you want to eat dinner.<eos> Here, we saved some for you.
Thank you.<eos> Just give me enough so you can operate.<eos> I don't wanna wake up next month.<eos> And take the rest in case my wife needs it... or Deputy Nick.<eos> I'll put some in a whisky flask and I'll leave the remainder for you.
Mrs. O'Dwyer?<eos> Yes?<eos> Have you eaten anything since they took you?<eos> A little.<eos> If it's been more than a couple of days... you should try to eat some of that bird they gave you.
All done?<eos> Done.<eos> I have your life transition agreement for you to sign.<eos> A contract that balances the needs of all the stakeholders in this situation.<eos> The core of the contract is the new life that is on loan to you will remain the property of the company.
- I quite understand.<eos> - ...<eos> Routine.<eos> I quite understand.<eos> Did Mr. Henderson tell you where he was going? He...
You think this is funny, Mr. Thomson?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm only joking.<eos> You have no idea how nervous you look!<eos> Did Mr. Henderson tell you that he was not gonna have you in the shop anymore?
She had a vision, bro.<eos> And when it comes to money, bitch got a nose like a bloodhound, man.<eos> Be like, "Scooby-Dooby-Doo," and shit, man.<eos> Yo, she be like Dino from The Flintstones... but black.<eos> I already told you, I fucking hate drug dealers and I'm sure as shit ain't signing no contract to work for one.
Let's just say this woman is yours and she is late.<eos> Could you not find a boat like a normal person?<eos> I was bored and I've never seen a man shot before.<eos> Why don't you go and stand over there by the fire and keep warm?<eos> Duellists, stand apart with the attorney between you.
- I'm sorry, it's just that...<eos> Every time I was thrown out, when my mom was fucked up, one of her boyfriends was fucking with me... he was there for me.<eos> When I had no money, when I was starving, his folks bought my shit for school.<eos> Okay, when my mom was busted for possession, he got his dad to bail her out.<eos> They do that shit so they can own you.
You went to see them, right? Yeah.<eos> Part of your deal?<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> They did that to you.
They're called the Saviors.<eos> They own our lives.<eos> And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.<eos> And they will come looking.<eos> You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors... either they kill you or they own you.
What our vision is is kind of we send you out there, sort of bearing witness to these bored, rich ladies who are taking surf culture, co-opting it, just turning it into basically, like, some shitty yoga,<eos> - which they've already ruined.<eos> - 100%.<eos> And then you look like the opposite of a surfer.<eos> You're just kind of wandering around, and, like, we just throw you in the mix.
There's a reason your good Reverend here still looks human, while the rest of you all look like Satan's butthole.<eos> There is an antidote and he's been keeping it for himself. No!<eos> That is not true!<eos> This man is a liar!<eos> You don't want anyone to have the cure because it gives you the power... it gives you the power, the power, the power over you!
I just don't know how to move forward.<eos> Why don't you come join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.<eos> - You're being serious?<eos> - Yeah. Barry and the team, they'd be thrilled to have you.
How do you propose to find a proper spell without me there to...<eos> Well, you said a few of the Loughlins survived, right?<eos> That was the rumor?<eos> So you expect one of them to... to what?<eos> Translate their ancient super secret family spell book for you?
No exceptions.<eos> You will be given a new identity.<eos> Study it.<eos> Become it.<eos> It is you.
You should come with us to hear Harriet speak.<eos> You know what we do with nigger-loving slave-stealers?<eos> Your friend want to be white.<eos> That mean you want to be a nigger?<eos> 'Cause I'll brand you like one.
Where is he?<eos> Keep applying pressure.<eos> A bullet in the shoulder ain't nobody's idea of fun, but it ain't going to kill you. No hospitals!<eos> They'll find me. - We can't.<eos> - We're not going to a hospital. Not after what I saw you do back there, after what I saw those guys try to do to you.
Let him make a mistake.<eos> - Bosch.<eos> - Rudy.<eos> I didn't come here looking for trouble.<eos> It just follows you?
- Equal rights!<eos> Equal rights!<eos> - Clear off!<eos> I shall have to call the police.<eos> I'll get the law onto you.
And I am giving it to the Belt.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now the time.<eos> Other ship come, take you load for Earth, for Mars.<eos> They take you, okay?
I already know it was right.<eos> If I didn't come back, Mother would have killed the woman I love.<eos> Your life will always be Rhea's responsibility.<eos> But son, you belong with your people.<eos> It means so much to them to have you back.
But you never said why you stole.<eos> Was it to buy drugs?<eos> I didn't buy $25,000 worth of drugs.<eos> For the girls?<eos> I would've given you money for the girls.
- Why do you think that is?<eos> - I know why.<eos> Because the culture is set from the top.<eos> Since Axe likes me, other people do, or pretend to.<eos> Why do you think he likes you?
Just the two of us.<eos> We'll celebrate our way. No.<eos> Big occasions like this need to be marked, acknowledged, for posterity and for fun.<eos> You deserve to be celebrated.<eos> And you should be surrounded by your whole gang so they can honor you, too.
I can tell you know more about him than you're telling.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> You're my lawyer, Cam.<eos> Not them.<eos> Just you.
That makes him the perfect man to volunteer for Arnold's unit.<eos> As a private in the Loyal American Legion, You will be perfectly positioned to learn of Arnold's schedule and observe his movements.<eos> You want me to enlist as a Redcoat?<eos> More like Tory Militia.<eos> Look, rivington is a lying shite, But by naming rampaging rebels as the attackers at Lyme, He's given you the perfect motive to join under.
I want an honest conversation with a friend.<eos> Diane, you're not a spring chicken.<eos> Oh, so it's ageism, with my book of clients?<eos> Call them, Diane.<eos> How many will actually go with you?
Erin, where are your folks at?<eos> In the ICU with my baby sister who choked.<eos> - You need to go, okay?<eos> - Wait.<eos> - And I'll let you out, okay? - Hold on!
No, my answer's no.<eos> Uh, sorry, Mick, no, yeah, you-you're breaking up.<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no. I know what you're doing. Stop it.<eos> I can hear you just fine.
Abe but that's the truth.<eos> Well, I guess that's good luck for me, because I'm not here for Sarah.<eos> I'm here for you, Eddie.<eos> You're needed.<eos> Your people are waiting for you, and I'm here to bring you back.
But you just said it's for the good of Verona.<eos> Verona needed a show of power.<eos> I gave them one tonight, and I can give them another and another.<eos> But I can't give them you.<eos> I won't give them you.
Along with my self-respect and a fat weekly paycheck.<eos> How you doin', Colt?<eos> Still throwin' up trash bag windows?<eos> That's cool.<eos> So they just gave you this, huh?
That's the same move I use.<eos> You agree to take a test drive to get the manager out of his office, you go into his office, get on his computer and find out the name and address of the buyer.<eos> Right, once he's got this kid's address, he goes and follows this kid, waits for the chance to jack the car.<eos> But then, the coppers show up.<eos> Now you're forced to improvise.
Oh, Big Boi here, he rolls deep, doesn't he?<eos> You know how he does it?<eos> Off the backs of all of his artists.<eos> They write the music, they write the lyrics, they're out there shaking their asses 200 nights a year.<eos> They're on the grind. You?
- Wait.<eos> What? - And three girls, and they'll be strangers to you.<eos> Nine kids? !<eos> Are you crazy? ! Shh!<eos> This doesn't concern you.
Your mommy coming to pick you up after work?<eos> I know yours was doing life until she was shanked in the shower.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's tough being a crack whore.<eos> The kinzies took you in.
If we can force them to come in and face us, we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> With this.<eos> They need you to make the video if they want the ransom.<eos> So, if we destroy the camera, they'll have no choice but to come in and film you themselves.
He didn't dump me. I dumped him.<eos> No wonder the Justice League doesn't take me seriously when this crap is all they see.<eos> Well, what if we showed them something else?<eos> We will build a campaign that will show the world how strong, smart, and capable you are.<eos> The Justice League will come crawling for you.
Reddington: Your people are on site? Cooper:<eos> Yes.<eos> With all the necessary extradition documents.<eos> That won't be enough.<eos> They want me to give you over.
He didn't really talk that much.<eos> Exception to the rule here.<eos> What about Dax's state of mind?<eos> Was he struggling with anything since his time in the service?<eos> Look, I want to help you, but if the guys learn that I'm spilling my guts to you, then they might start to feel like this isn't a safe place.
Do it now!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm setting it down.<eos> All right?<eos> I need everyone to put their heads down and your hands on the back of the seat in front of you.
As were you. Both of you.<eos> I would never have kissed him if I didn't think that you were dead.<eos> Come now, Wynonna, we never lied to each other.<eos> You are free to kiss whoever you like.<eos> As long as they want you too.
We need to go to the police.<eos> I already have, sort of.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They're investigating Alistair and Steiner for fraud.<eos> They told you that?
Not like you.<eos> That's why Clayton Prep would like to recruit you.<eos> Gardner, I think of you like a daughter... much to the chagrin of my real daughter, who can't run fast at all.<eos> I think you should at least consider this opportunity.<eos> They want to recruit you?
Ah, yeah.<eos> I had a mate coming 'round, but he blew me out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Usual questions.<eos> Have you made contact with any known criminals, or have they made contact with or attempted to make contact with you?
No. No, he wouldn't, because that's how you become a polar bear's dinner.<eos> You nervous about tomorrow?<eos> No. Oh, you're, like, freaking out.<eos> Kind of.<eos> Well, hey, just remember they recruited you.
I already told you, back off.<eos> Fuckin' cops.<eos> - Lenny. - All right.<eos> - Now? Okay. - Just right here.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna do you a solid. And trust me on this. Don't turn your back on anybody.
Cardiac failure?<eos> He's 10.<eos> My son is 10 years old. This doesn't happen to 10-year-olds.<eos> Like I said, I have some very knowledgeable colleagues<eos> I'm excited to consult with. More knowledgeable than you?
- Hmm.<eos> And now, all this is happening on top.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The timing isn't a coincidence.<eos> Negative entities often feed off emotional distress. They like to kick you when you're down.
You win.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Your girls called me.<eos> They called you?
What?<eos> The pilot.<eos> The message.<eos> All of it.<eos> Did they send you?
- Stay back!<eos> I crown you like they crowned the King of Jews!<eos> Father!<eos> Sam!<eos> And I crucify you like they crucified the Nazarene!
Is that where you met Evelyn?<eos> No. I met her at prior health club I was working at, Equinox.<eos> Why'd you leave Equinox for Atlantis?<eos> - Better pay?<eos> - No. Was it because of the members at Equinox, women members, complained to the management about unwanted attention from you?
She's calmed down a bit since she's had some company.<eos> - Hello, nurse.<eos> - Any objection to me popping by?<eos> - I can just leave you with your friends.<eos> - Bless you.
I knew I had to get out of there.<eos> I loved him, but I knew I couldn't stay because that's what I do... I leave.<eos> So that was the inspiration for the "Thumb."<eos> Amazing.<eos> You think maybe you leave people before they leave you?
I loved him, but I knew I couldn't stay because that's what I do... I leave.<eos> So that was the inspiration for the "Thumb."<eos> Amazing.<eos> You think maybe you leave people before they leave you?<eos> You think maybe you leave people before they leave you?
- Veronica Allen.<eos> - The widow.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll send Crate and Barrel to get a search warrant for the offices.<eos> They'll meet you there once you've talked to Mrs. Allen.
- Next time we meet it'll be as enemies.<eos> You're going then?<eos> I'm not a Thane's son. I have no choice.<eos> You saw what choice I have.<eos> My mother wants to drive us apart. That's why she's sending you.
- Yeah.<eos> He got a job offer there, and I've been missing home a lot.<eos> Are you done with San Francisco?<eos> So, if that's something that you'd be interested in, I can make it happen, but I do have to warn you,<eos> Owen will hate you, but he would also love to have you back.
And now you come here to lecture!<eos> You found the perfect formula!<eos> You denigrate your hometown and get paid back in Euros for it!<eos> You kiss Europeans ass!<eos> They should give you awards,
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.<eos> They're all Staties?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.<eos> They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?
How could they miss that?<eos> Hubris.<eos> The Vatican has watched nations rise and fall from its ivory towers. It never feels threatened...<eos> Not even now.<eos> And they did send you here, right?
You work shifts and studies.<eos> How should I pay when I don't get paid the same as a man?<eos> I solder the same metal gadgets and must pay the same bills.<eos> Right now it is about the children's best interests.<eos> Next time you can't cope with the task, the state must do it for you.
Look at this.<eos> A catch they will sing songs about.<eos> A catch you brought in.<eos> For those of you who followed and believed, I thank you.<eos> And for those of you who didn't,
You like the life you have?<eos> I've got clothes, food, and church on Sundays.<eos> Yeah, the fosters treat me right.<eos> Treat you right, huh?<eos> They own you...
Now, of course, I knew that there would be protesters here today... and I could've chosen not to come, or I could choose to avoid them as I leave, but I'm not going to do that,<eos> because those students out there, your fellow classmates, I'm their president, too.<eos> And whether they vote for me or not, I have to lead them as well.<eos> So, it's important to hear them, to talk to them, to listen to their ideas, because, just as you're learning in college, a diversity of ideas makes us all wiser, and that holds true even for your president.<eos> True leadership is not running away from those who disagree with you, but embracing them, and that is exactly what I intend to do when I'm done today.
Can you believe those clowns? Mr. Sheffield:<eos> Sounds like you'd rather be over there.<eos> Why don't you go? Pbht.<eos> I don't need them.<eos> I made a new friend here with you.
- Weren't you out there when Avery threatened to kick us all out the house?<eos> I think I was, yes.<eos> Then why you in here reading a book like that didn't just happen?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> When you don't talk to people, Dan, let 'em get to know you, people start thinking you don't like 'em or that you think you're better than they are.
Gil asked me to post about it.<eos> Registering college kids to vote to try to reverse the political apathy of our youth.<eos> - That's noble.<eos> - It's really not. It's a photo-op for the candidate's children who are starving.<eos> Okay, well, I'll make you some eggs.
The Dedication Box.<eos> Here you can leave any type of dedicated message...<eos> So, without further ado, let's listen to these messages.<eos> Good night, this is a message to all the nurses and doctors working in the Hospital de la Fe in Valencia.<eos> I just wanted to say you're champions and many thanks for taking care of me and making me feel like I was in a 5-star hotel while I was admitted. I send you a big hug and I carry you in my heart.
This feels like something different.<eos> This here is hallowed ground, home to the nine covens of New Orleans.<eos> Y'all need to be on y'all's way.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna give you one guess what they're here for.<eos> Cami, either they're gonna kill you or Klaus will for losing that thing. You need to go. No.
Collect my son's bride.<eos> Take Elvina with you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - She knows their ways.<eos> My mother wants to drive us apart. That's why she is sending you.
Act three... spoiler alert... you're a parking lot.<eos> Oh, even after 1,000 years, you've never managed to curb your hubris.<eos> You still wander through a smog of your own self-importance.<eos> I can kill anything. Even them.<eos> Even you.
Girls, man...<eos> They just... just be trippin'.<eos> Yeah, they be trippin'.<eos> Lesson one.<eos> Women... you just...
Just trust me. You have everything you need.<eos> What is it?<eos> I think I know what we can use to kill Savage.<eos> Savage has warned you all about the radicals who oppose us.<eos> They will not show you the mercy I just did.
It was that tall, handsome British fella.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I did it, too, didn't I?<eos> Oh, I respect what you do, dung beetle.<eos> Much as celebrities hate you, you know, they need you, keep you in the limelight.
"Star Trek."<eos> What?<eos> That's an episode of "Star Trek."<eos> It's an episode of "Star Trek."<eos> They finally got to you.
As the Governor of New York... I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism because it's been right here on our doorstep.<eos> You know what I did when 9/11 happened?<eos> I joined the Air Force because I wanted to serve my country, just like my grandfather did when he boarded a transport ship on this very dock and sailed to the Pacific to fight the Japanese.<eos> When my children grow up...<eos> Charlie and Lily... I wanna be able to... to look them in the eye... and tell them that I fought for you.
I prefer to spend the rest of my life in jail than to turn my back on a friend in need.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> I have worked with some difficult people in Washington...<eos> bull-headed Republicans, radical Libertarians...<eos> Ted Cruz... but never anyone quite like you.
She's lying.<eos> She was there. She must have hacked the system.<eos> You're starting to sound like her.<eos> Talk to the CIA!<eos> They'll tell you what happened because they can ID her.
Can... can you show us where he lives?<eos> - Think we should... - Did she understand what you said?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think we should follow her.<eos> Wait down there till they come for you.
On the fourth hand, the world could end tomorrow, and I might end up regretting it.<eos> But on the fifth hand, I could regret regretting it.<eos> While on the sixth hand, that guitar, on the seventh hand, the man jewelry, on the eighth hand, those eyes, while on the ninth hand, I still have feelings for him.<eos> You guys are right. I have to go to this coffee.<eos> Oh, what would I do without you?
Before you ruin things for me...<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Where are tonight's contestants for this black bachelorette?<eos> Oh, relax, relax.<eos> Let the contestants come to you.
TOM: Sarah.<eos> - Hey. "[ Groans ]<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Take it easy!<eos> Did they call you?
Reading, huh?<eos> Sarah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Take it easy. Take it easy!<eos> Did they call you?
Time to pay up.<eos> Time to let go, partner.<eos> I'll take you all to hell with me.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> They're gonna take you.
What we didn't know was, around then,<eos> Patrick was going underwater with those Mint Hill houses.<eos> He would have been scrambling for money just to stay afloat.<eos> At least until Melanie got things up and running, but that would take some cash to do.<eos> You think that they blackmailed you.
That was just an outpost.<eos> There are more...<eos> More Saviors... more outposts.<eos> If they know about your friends... it's already too late for them.<eos> The Saviors... they did this to you?
Come on open the door!<eos> Van!<eos> Where the hell did he come from?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is it one of you?
I haven't read this article.<eos> Okay, maybe I'm too busy making the tech awesome, because it's not mediocre.<eos> It's actually... turns out, it's fucking revolutionary.<eos> So, I guess that's the truth.<eos> And also, I'm not fired, these guys aren't fired, you all are fired.
The most important thing is that they need to know that somebody's there who understands what they're going through.<eos> You know... So really it's your compassion that they need to feel.<eos> Compassion.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And after you tell the parents... they might want you there when they tell the child.
Just calm down.<eos> We always knew this was a possible problem.<eos> You know who's behind this, don't you?<eos> Jackson Brooks.<eos> Did they tell you that?
- Sixth strike.<eos> - What can I say? Okay, dad, we're getting creamed.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Watch this.<eos> Did they teach you to bowl?
And you made me look like a fucking idiot!<eos> I'm coming up with a plan to fix it, 'cause I actually do care.<eos> Oh, I understand. I understand.<eos> Because you're gonna fucking fix it, 'cause I tell you what.<eos> I didn't get to where I am by letting assholes like you drag me down.
Social work.<eos> I thought I could figure things out.<eos> You went back to Care First. You were there before?<eos> A lot of people don't know this, but at the age of 18, the foster system is done with kids.<eos> If your guardians are nice, they'll keep you around till you get a job, go to college.
I don't want to infringe on any other group of people.<eos> You're not like a Confederate soldier, is what you're referring to.<eos> I will not insult my Confederate ancestors.<eos> I love my Confederate ancestors.<eos> Good for them and you.
- I know.<eos> - It's not that difficult.<eos> - They hate coming here.<eos> They saw the bruises and your wrist. - It's upsetting.<eos> - They told you this?
They don't have any evidence.<eos> All they had was trumped-up charges.<eos> I've met people that have been in and out of jail<eos> - their whole lives.<eos> - That ain't going to be you.
Montana.<eos> I got back this morning.<eos> Charles's funeral is tomorrow.<eos> I go on a grouse hunting trip every year with my friends.<eos> They'll tell you, I was there the whole week.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, Ralphie?<eos> As for you, um you earned this.<eos> I can go kayaking?<eos> Well, it's got to be safer than driving with Sylvester, and besides, you're not a typical kid. I have to stop treating you like on
You're lying.<eos> You went to the police.<eos> - No.<eos> - You went to the police.<eos> - They're with you right now.
Come on, Damien.<eos> Can't we talk about this?<eos> Why?<eos> So you can tell your cop friends about it?<eos> Now, I'll bet you're wired right now.
But Dudley claimed credit for absconding with Joseph Tudor.<eos> That's why the Vatican were forced to drop their charge against me.<eos> They are convinced that you were Dudley's accomplice in undermining their plot.<eos> What jurisdiction does the Church have in France?<eos> None, which is why the Archbishop is going to approach the regent and ask her to hand you over.
- It's not labor.<eos> Your aneurysm has ruptured, and I know you didn't want surgery, but now we have no choice.<eos> We're gonna get you into the O.R.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - They've got you, honey.
Ask him.<eos> They come to you when they're sick.<eos> Isn't that right, Dr. Yedlin?<eos> That's when you care for them.<eos> That's when they trouble you.
If that's your attitude, what are you doing here?<eos> Atonement, same as you. But I'm not kidding myself.<eos> I know it's not going to make a lick a difference.<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> - My problem is that they might need you.
Then I will suffer.<eos> Ah, Miss Penvenen?<eos> Captain Poldark.<eos> Seven months away has given me an appetite for such sights.<eos> And doubtless they for you.
Let's chat.<eos> Senior agent, huh?<eos> Dwayne, it's me, not some suit from Washington.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But they sent you.
Don't know where they are.<eos> You're gonna help us find 'em.<eos> Even if I wanted to, which I don't, I'd be disbarred.<eos> We're not talking to you as counsel.<eos> We're talking to you as an accessory.
- Hey, guys, could you just keep the chatter down?<eos> I'm working here. - Oh, right.<eos> Am I in your way?<eos> - No, it's mostly them.<eos> Uh, Dean, we were actually just coming to look for you.
No, Maria, no.<eos> You forgot I'm the one who found Marco's body.<eos> You didn't see what they did to him.<eos> These people are savages.<eos> I don't believe that about you.
Here's what I know, Eve. You've got a little girl with heart issues, medical bills have been piling up...<eos> I have no idea what you're talking...<eos> We know there should've been blood in the jewelry case on the shattered glass.<eos> There wasn't. You cleaned it up because you didn't want us to I.D. your cohorts.<eos> So you're gonna tell me now, who were the two thieves that paid you to let them in?
My wife was barren.<eos> Wasn't her fault.<eos> Just was.<eos> Well, what about neighbors or friends?<eos> Could they go get it for you?
- That we picked him up.<eos> You just did.<eos> Considering the backup and the wire that I'm wearing, you can tell me who hired you to kidnap Iosava or you can chose to keep your mouth shut, and I'll make sure you'll be eating and shitting from the same bowl for the next 5 to 10 years.<eos> I've made a simple offer.<eos> They get you back if I get my husband back.
You mean this?<eos> Yes!<eos> Dean had it.<eos> And your fav -- Castiel.<eos> They were around you. How did it never -- I turned it off.
And taken away the state's best shot at convicting him.<eos> And now we know why Wallace wanted you to stay away from CTU.<eos> _<eos> An illegal search in Landon's apartment?<eos> This is why I told you to back off CTU.
You know, this is exactly what I was talking about.<eos> Some meta's been gifted this incredible power, and this is the very best thing they can do with it-- terrorize a city.<eos> It's - - It's pathetic.<eos> Why exactly do you hate metas so much?<eos> If you think I'm gonna break down now and tell you that one killed my parents and that's why I have to do this job, I'm not, okay?
I made this from a strain of cananga odorata.<eos> Smell.<eos> Now, open the vault.<eos> Access granted.<eos> Did they send you?
Is that a trick question? It means he's got top-level security clearance. Could be Special Forces, ex-CIA.<eos> You can never trace those guys.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, this is she.<eos> Thank you.
What about Manila?<eos> Under siege.<eos> Did you cross the Sierra Madre?<eos> The Tagalog...<eos> The Tagalog attacked you?
- No.<eos> - No, it wouldn't.<eos> You know what, Blush?<eos> I'mma get you some names.<eos> I'mma call up some of the other investors, make sure it's cool that we disclose their names to you.
He says don't let him down.<eos> So, I gotta die to please my father?<eos> I gotta die to please my father?<eos> I'm just the messenger.<eos> They'll tell you what to do when you're there.
Okay, babe.<eos> Why do you have a gun?<eos> I was separated from my family.<eos> That was careless.<eos> Did they give you the gun?
You used to be a quartz, too, didn't you?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Ugh!<eos> Disgraceful.<eos> I can't believe I've resorted to recruiting you freaks!
This might explain why someone would ransom the wife of a man who is flat broke.<eos> Kidnapper could have been after this software?<eos> Or a cut of the profits.<eos> Did you tell a lot of people in your family about this program?<eos> I told you, that's who it was for.
And yet, today, they are often relegated to the fringes of society with little options for work.<eos> - Hey. - Hi.<eos> - Hello. - I'm Ellen.<eos> Page: Komal, one of the band members, has invited us to her home where she lives in a hijra community.<eos> - Thank you, thank you.
Well, that's never really been easy for me.<eos> Then you're not as smart as I thought you were.<eos> Don't tell anyone I said this, but I like the way you are and I don't like anybody.<eos> Just give other people a chance to get to know the real you.<eos> They'll like you, too.
Yeah, I'm totally pitting my parents against each other. - Yeah?<eos> - They're gonna spend so much money on gifts, they're not gonna have enough money left over for my college.<eos> Nice.<eos> You know what you should do?<eos> Get one of your parents to buy you a helmet with a visor.
Good choice, boss.<eos> At least my nose is naturally brown.<eos> Hey, could you please go to the market for me?<eos> Get Stuart or Raj to do it.<eos> Howie, they've been doing everything for you.
Ricky Morales was a gangster.<eos> Who kills gangsters?<eos> Other gangsters.<eos> Ricky was shot in SBK territory.<eos> I already told you...
And then the deadline passed and nothing was heard.<eos> [Loney] Medicine Man came in and said,<eos> "Do you want to see Tom and Norman?"<eos> And we said, "Yes."<eos> "Okay, we take you. We take you in the boot of the car one at a time."
- What is it?<eos> - Hi!<eos> - Hi, Madison.<eos> There she is.<eos> Grandma and Grandpa are here, they're going to take you for the day.
Jesus, I just had Derek on the phone.<eos> Apparently lndependiente are in the frame as well.<eos> Two firm. 150 grand per album.<eos> Fuck, you're kidding me.<eos> Steven, there's someone in reception to see you.
Big man!<eos> Who normally attends you?<eos> Is it Thor?<eos> Is it wolverine?<eos> Does he normally attend you?
Roy...<eos> Oh Roy.<eos> Grandma, what happened?<eos> They hounded me.<eos> So I wouldn't tell, what I did to you.
Now I can go.<eos> - To where, Andouille?<eos> - To see Homer, Plato,<eos> Shakespeare. And Perrault.<eos> I have something to say to you, cat
Oh, I see.<eos> So you are tired of your little affair?<eos> You're all done with it.<eos> Now you want to make sure you don't feel guilty so you're going to manipulate us all into some absurd happy ending.<eos> I have met a lot of control freaks in my life, in fact, I thought I was one, but you, you make me look like an amateur.
What the fuck?<eos> Why?<eos> Looks like I'm gonna be going to work with my parents.<eos> I don't wanna fuck it up.<eos> They asked you to come back?
Tears are not gonna change my mind.<eos> I'm not crying to change your mind now.<eos> I'm crying because you've grown into a real man.<eos> You know, you should join the Navy.<eos> And the Navy would be lucky to have you.
What are you doing?<eos> I wish to speak on behalf of the defendant.<eos> You have not been recognized.<eos> Sit back and you'll...<eos> These men convinced you that they speak for you.
Now, some of you may have picked up on this.<eos> But the "Post" is in trouble, because everybody gets their news online now, so we have to improve our online presence in order to stay viable.<eos> The reason the "Boston Sentinel"'s readership went up last quarter and ours didn't is because they post their news on Twitter twice as fast.<eos> We need to break news first.<eos> Now some of you who have gotten bigger stories lately, maybe you feel like I'm not talking to you.
Are not the Sons of Liberty the same cabal that sparked the Liberty Pole Riots? The same men who murdered your older brother Thomas?<eos> Well, you see now why I must do this.<eos> And why I beg you not to tell my father.<eos> He may never speak to me again if he were to learn of my past.<eos> He may never speak to you again if you should die while exposing the rebels or while masquerading as one.
What is this white-people lunch?<eos> What is this store so excited about?<eos> This is where lunchables live, mom.<eos> If we get separated, try and join a white family.<eos> You will be safe there until I can find you.
- Aren't you?<eos> - Look, I did my job.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I don't have to believe you.<eos> What matters is that they believe you.
That's right.<eos> Can I please have some water?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> We need a better bite on this.<eos> So maybe instead of, "Did they ask you to do this?" say, "Did they ask you to lie?"
Andy: Thank you.<eos> [ lock beeps ] [ women whistling, catcalling ] See?<eos> Some women like me.<eos> They're whistling at me, you idiot.<eos> Of course women like you. I'm the only police officer here you haven't slept with.
I shall have you...<eos> You're taking us through Valyria.<eos> The Doom still rules Valyria.<eos> Stone Men!<eos> Had any touch you?
Shut up, man.<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> You're a dumbass, you know that?<eos> You think you just ended up in here with me.<eos> They put you here.
Which was a transformational moment For the school, by the way.<eos> Yeah, marked the beginning of a great synchronicity<eos> Between glee club and football. Just ask any of the-the football guys<eos> That are back for homecoming. So, why aren't they here<eos> Trying to recruit me? Why'd they send you?
And for the time, if we show her patience and love, she will completely come over to our cause.<eos> Let me probe deeper.<eos> I want you to be a sister to her, Ariadne.<eos> We might be able to take the Lexicon by force, but we will need mystics like her to help us unlock its riddle.<eos> Why would they blind you if they need you to work?
- I know. I don't know what to tell you, bro.<eos> I'm getting the rest of the dough tonight.<eos> - When?<eos> - I'll get your cut by midnight.<eos> Tonight, I'm meeting the guy and I'll get it to you.
He's not dead...<eos> He's just unconscious.<eos> Vanessa! Talk to me!<eos> Well, apparently, when he said a fight to the death, darling, he meant your death.<eos> And since he doubts that's on the table anymore, he's just decided just to have his men kill you.
Mr. Crawford.<eos> I told you I don't want a detail.<eos> I'll respect that.<eos> However, you should know this will escalate.<eos> And while your family doesn't seem to be the target, they could become collateral damage anytime they're with you.
What are you doing?<eos> What?<eos> The Captain, showed me how to kill three at a time.<eos> I just shot my 73rd!<eos> They could also kill you!
I'm going to head to the mine.<eos> See what nonsense them people are up to...<eos> The lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack nothing.<eos> He shall feed me in a green pasture and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort...<eos> They will be happy to have you.
- Talk to me, not her.<eos> You chose him.<eos> You threatened to kill me, your own father.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> They raised you.
You're who's behind, captain, not me.<eos> And I'm not the one pulling the strings here.<eos> It's D.D.A. Rios who's in charge and D.D.A. Rios who's delaying the process.<eos> When I have my deal in writing...<eos> Phillip, if you show the police some goodwill, they might show you some in return.
Something personal, but private.<eos> So no photos or memorabilia.<eos> But you also like women.<eos> Temporarily, at least.<eos> And they like you.
All right.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You ok?<eos> Ok. We got you.<eos> We got you. They--they took Jeff.
Not that they told me about.<eos> What's it like?<eos> It's just an office building.<eos> You'd be bored, really.<eos> They tell you to say that, don't they?
That was so lame, it ruined her.<eos> - Who's Jodi?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Okay, I can get you in and out of city hospital in an hour.<eos> These guys can watch your girls for you.
That's the best thing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We decided. I'm going.<eos> Look at them.<eos> I'm telling you, the bravest thing that you can do is stay here and protect them.
They're my guys-<eos> What I done, boys, is set you up nicer than an umbrella salesman in a hurricane.<eos> You and your crew stay out of the sun.<eos> You don't lift a finger but to point John Chinaman toward a pile of rock.<eos> I'm paying you to babysit, is what I'm doing.
The railroad?<eos> The scars of reconstruction can't heal until we link this nation east to west...<eos> Make it whole again.<eos> You sound like a politician.<eos> I never pictured you as one.
Now I got half a girl's volleyball team and a boy who wants to be their cheerleader.<eos> But I love him... No judgment.<eos> My wife and I adopted a four-year-old girl, Micah.<eos> I also do alarm systems, in case you're in the market.<eos> Give me your contact info, I'll put you down on my weekly e-mail blast. All the guys get it.
Here he is.<eos> Murdered.<eos> They came for me, you know.<eos> But now I'm building a Mountain of their ashes.<eos> If I've found you, they will find you.
How has it come to this?<eos> Could we have a moment please?<eos> Everett, why are you here?<eos> Well, I just told them what happened.<eos> But didn't anyone advise you not to admit guilt?
I want this torment to end.<eos> Then you must take responsibility for your crime.<eos> - I'll be hanged...<eos> - If you go to the police yourself, then I believe the church will be lenient.<eos> But if they come to you...
For, like, the millionth time, my dad is super gross rich.<eos> Like, disgusting rich.<eos> He'll have me out of prison in no time.<eos> Chanel, your parents abandoned you.<eos> They legally disowned you three weeks ago and filed an amicus brief with the prosecution, stating that they think that you are a serial killer.
- Tell me.<eos> Let's see. We met at the university.<eos> I had a mouse in a box to dissect.<eos> - The mouse escaped and you saw it and almost fainted.<eos> If you want my parents to believe you you'll need to change the end.
- Tonight?<eos> - Of course, no problem.<eos> Wait... I actually have some stuff to do tonight.<eos> Jong Soo.<eos> I need you too.
The longer he stays around, the more questions he'll have.<eos> Wanna really blow his mind?<eos> Tell him there are two of these things.<eos> Best in the city.<eos> They sent you.
And you, the Russian military,<eos> Will be left holding the bag.<eos> It is true.<eos> The SVR has fallen under the control of oligarchs And international bankers.<eos> Would you be surprised If I told you some aren't even Russian?
~ Good spot, good spot, Hammond.<eos> Since I seemed to be stuck with Pinky and Perky, we went to watch some of the other drivers in the first race.<eos> They don't half start off close together, don't they?<eos> ~ You could crash by there!<eos> ~ Yeah. This'll be you.
Trauma room is in there.<eos> Let's back up.<eos> Page Grey, Torres.<eos> Let's get Cardio in here.<eos> Brett, they got you now, buddy.
I am motivated circumstances, created by others.<eos> Your team is waiting in the basement.<eos> I charge you to go and find Arnesen.<eos> Hello.<eos> Glad to have you join. I was obliged to stop you Oscar.
Always walk briskly.<eos> Makes you a moving target.<eos> Oh, that's for Lofty. Lofty!<eos> And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified.<eos> Act as if you know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it.
Let him think he won.<eos> He'll let his guard down, now, and you'll get your revenge later.<eos> ♪ Got me trapped, I'm in handcuffs for your love. ♪ This is the last thing you got to do.<eos> Look, I know you can do it.<eos> You're gonna make people stop and listen to you.
A newlywed killed on her honeymoon. An 18-year-old girl murdered trying to save a friend.<eos> Some of those graves shouldn't have been filled in the first place.<eos> Oh, you still think you're solving murders.<eos> They don't care who killed those people.<eos> They're sticking you in as test runs for something bigger.
This is business, huh?<eos> Let me tell you how this will happen.<eos> You will give me the phone number for your Osela contact.<eos> I'm gonna call them, and you're gonna tell them what a great friend<eos> I've been to you, how I saved your life,
Oh, an hour and six minutes.<eos> Leave your sister alone.<eos> - RAF boys are notoriously flighty.<eos> I'd never step out with one.<eos> One hasn't asked you.
It is.<eos> - There she goes again... 'Cause of Dražen.<eos> If he were alive, this would be fixed in a month.<eos> Don't want one of them to mess around here. I'm cancelling it.<eos> - What's the matter with you ?
I'll go and get them.<eos> Keep them.<eos> I want you to take them to the mainland and deliver them to some friends of mine.<eos> It's a hotel near to the airport.<eos> Wait there and they'll find you.
At your age, straightforward, biological reason supervenes.<eos> But some of the people who live here, haven't you've seen them?<eos> The vanguard of the well-to-do.<eos> They've fitted themselves so tightly into their slots that they no longer have room to escape themselves.<eos> Slots designed by you.
Oh, it's okay, you know. This control freak teacher's pet who only looks out for herself didn't even notice.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> It seems like you notice plenty.<eos> Like my... my secret phone calls that apparently I lie about.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, maybe if you made a couple friends, they'd call you, too.
Oh, I see where you're going with this. One second.<eos> We'd like to offer you a job.<eos> A job?<eos> This seems most unorthodox.<eos> We were sent from your former employer, First Fiduciary National, and they would like you back.
She should have thought of that before she hired Travis Tanner.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna start by introducing the proposal, Then you chime in.<eos> Jack, I gave you 50% of Dellmore, But I need to be seen as leading the charge on this.<eos> Louis, I got the partners in line by telling them It was my proposal.<eos> Okay, so I'll introduce you with my full support And then you can just take it from there.
But I did drag you to that stupid birthday party.<eos> [laughs] You didn't drag me anywhere!<eos> Well, dragged or not, thanks for going.<eos> You were there when I needed you, even though I didn't think I needed you.<eos> Which is why I wanted to ask you something.
Being threatened?<eos> What have you dragged us into?<eos> How could you do this to us?<eos> To your father?<eos> They gave you this, didn't they?
We got him.<eos> Field behind the building.<eos> So I want to know... why'd you ambush your friends?<eos> They were going to cut me out, so...<eos> They told you that?
I'm just glad the world finally knows the truth.<eos> It was time.<eos> Ms. Guthrie.<eos> Wait here, or I'll have to call security.<eos> You were their employee. They trusted you with their privacy.
I'm not talking about you.<eos> I'm just talking about the brotherhood.<eos> No, but you talk about one Shadow Boy, you talk about us all.<eos> - You know, we're a group.<eos> - Wow. You can't just p-put 'em down, say, "Oh, I'm not talking about you."
I've put that into her already.<eos> [Wolfgang]: I've been told they'd like to take the next step.<eos> [Lily]: What is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They'll contact you directly.
And it is, perhaps, more fitting, every moment that I see you suffer,<eos> The Federation made a grave mistake in interfering.<eos> We are not Federation!<eos> No!<eos> But they sent you, just as they sent this.
It's great, yeah.<eos> The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site was his son, Patrick Tierney, who died on December 20th, 1935, exactly 13 years to the day.<eos> See those sorority girls over there?<eos> I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.<eos> Yeah, in just a few years that's you, and that's gonna be me.
I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world. They're probably missing me right now.<eos> They're probably out looking around.<eos> "Hey, where's Emmet? Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.
They spend most of their time bandaging up the slicers.<eos> What if I want to be a runner?<eos> Have you listened to a word I've just said?<eos> No one wants to be a runner.<eos> And, besides, you gotta get chosen.
- Fuck.<eos> - That's what I said.<eos> Who the fuck did all this?<eos> Did you do all this?<eos> Is he paying you for each one?
I know you're watching!<eos> I got a phone!<eos> You can call me on this phone!<eos> I know you didn't just happen by.<eos> They sent you, didn't they?
All right, that's where we at, man.<eos> I'm gonna come check this out.<eos> Cool.<eos> Well, okay... You know, you all goin'. 'Cause you all got stuff to do.<eos> Goin', man. Thank you again. BENNETT:
Is it carbon-chipped?<eos> For performance.<eos> Does it jump through a red light on a mis-shift?<eos> My friend says it's nothing to worry.<eos> Friend sell you the car?
- Mr Michaels, I don't feel comfortable.<eos> - OK, listen to me.<eos> A thousand years ago I was in your position.<eos> And you know, just enjoy it. It's glorious fun.<eos> And remember, they need you more than you need them.
That's what we're doing here.<eos> Like the Three Musketeers.<eos> This is probably ho-hum for you, but for me and Betts, well, it's just, um...<eos> Anyway, thank you for what you're doing.<eos> You know, Gene Jr. and Betty Jr., even though they're just twinkles in their mother's eye, they thank you, too.
Finn was, like, a real leader, you know?<eos> And so are you.<eos> And I'm gonna need you to be that guy when we get to L.A.<eos> The kids want you to be that guy.<eos> They're all waiting for you to see yourself the way they see you.
You have been conspicuously absent for the past decade.<eos> Whoa, Sweets!<eos> Hi, Lance!<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> These-these guys know you?
What happened to your real mother, your true father?<eos> Was the Khan their benefactor, too?<eos> How do you serve the monster who slew your brethren and call him father?<eos> You worship his whores, concubine and queen.<eos> And you are left here as nursemaid while war is waged.
Aren't you even curious?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> So that's it?<eos> They told me they'd contact you.
Well, okay. Talk to me, Sky.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Okay, I wanna help you out.<eos> I just need something to take the edge off, Mr. J!<eos> Okay, we'll take you to Medical and have you taken care of.
Sharon, I don't even know half of their names.<eos> How do you expect to get into contact with them?<eos> I'm a detective.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine. But just to... Just to spell it out for you, 22 other kids graduated yesterday.
I just wanted to come by to... to give you something.<eos> Honey, this was, uh... this was your Grandpa John's and I gave it to your daddy when... when he patched into the club.<eos> This one's for you, so you have it when you become a member.<eos> I love you, Abel.<eos> Your mommy and your daddy, they love you, too.
The fish, yes, but also the coral, the kelp.<eos> All of it.<eos> It was rape.<eos> If you're gonna write about a fisherman, you should probably spend as much time down here as possible.<eos> You know, I could introduce you to some real guys.
Jordan. Listen, Cameron, we got this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Uh, what he means to say is, maybe if I go on this side, and then... Mm-hmm.<eos> And then what would happen?<eos> If you guys back up for a second...
Julie.<eos> You sure she should be flying in her condition, sir?<eos> The baby might get airsick.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> How do women manage that... tiny little thing throwing up inside you?
Because we're about to have ourselves a bloodbath.<eos> -Don't you wanna know why I left?<eos> -I already know why.<eos> You got boring. I got a conscience.<eos> Prey that begged for their lives, it was like... even if I used every part, like I taught you, I mean, it's still wrong.
or let me just say the or part maybe it doesn't matter to you, maybe you want it, maybe, I mean, you're not coming out because you think inevitably they're gonna catch you and you want to do it first,<eos> you're coming out because you want to fucking come out and...<eos> Oh there is that, I mean that's the thing, I don't want to hide on this and skulk around,<eos> I don't think I should have to obviously there is circumstances that are saying that.<eos> I think it is powerful to come out and be like look I'm not afraid and I don't think other people should either, you know, I was sitting in the office right next to you last week,
We're all just stuck like this Until we figure out how to move on.<eos> - There are others?<eos> - Yeah, you're lucky you found me first.<eos> Some of them are messed up.<eos> Just wandering around, Watching your loved ones forget all about you, Gets in your head.
They banished him from Olympus.<eos> So, that's why you're here... To threaten me?<eos> No, no. I'm here to warn you, son.<eos> Siding with that girl, wronged as she may be, sends a message to your peers. These are the same people who may one day hold your future in their hands.<eos> Now, you do this today, and they will turn their backs on you just as surely as the gods banished Momus.
Nothing!<eos> That's what you were doing!<eos> Then the Normandies took care of it.<eos> Well, who told you that the Normandie 1-9s took care of it?<eos> Did they tell you that?
Terrific.<eos> He takes good care of me.<eos> Then take a picture of Desi taking a picture.<eos> Iris became one of my favorite models, and so I said, "Well, Iris,<eos> I've got to photograph you at your house."
Sami... do you remember this jacket?<eos> Can you tell me where you got it?<eos> In my village, when I was working for Mujahed.<eos> Rebels?<eos> And they gave you the jacket?
Who wants to go first?<eos> Don't you use tarot cards or a crystal ball or something?<eos> Oh, I used to.<eos> My wife thought it made the customers more comfortable if they saw me actually doing something.<eos> But the truth is, all I really do is look at you. Tell you what I see.
No.<eos> No, no. No Dwarves here.<eos> You've got that all wrong.<eos> Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!<eos> They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.
I've seen them.<eos> How do you know about the Tengu Forest?<eos> I was raised there before I fled to Ako.<eos> Those scars on your head.<eos> Are they the ones who marked you?
In those early years together, I could not fail to be impressed.<eos> But you will find that you must share him with his public.<eos> They will be the constant.<eos> And, in truth, you will never absolutely know which one he loves the most.<eos> You.
Maybe there's one thing.<eos> It's just like you say.<eos> Mrs. Lucy gonna be comfortable.<eos> Mr. Walton gonna to see to it.<eos> Judge Harden say to tell you they upholding the law.
Alive.<eos> Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.<eos> And you must be Annabel. / I must be.<eos> How are they?<eos> Well, just let me warn you.
Last night, I walked lsis home.<eos> She made me drink.<eos> Her two cousins were there and wanted me to stay.<eos> They were tipsy. I put them to bed.<eos> The bed was big. I slept there so as not to wake you.
- OK, here we go.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> This is usually how it works.<eos> Perps go on the move, cops get moving.<eos> A little pro tip for you: "perps", short for perpetrators.
Emily, you're are now playing for one million dollars.<eos> Remember - you have three minutes to answer.<eos> Three minutes that can change your life<eos> But I don't believe a word of it.<eos> I gave you a chance to confess.
We'll mail it tomorrow.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, they miss you too.
You know, they wear those big furry hats.<eos> I'll make a couple of phone calls.<eos> Well, what should I do?<eos> You fill me in and then wail' by the phone.<eos> I know you want' to help, but if this is sit-do wn, I'm sorry, you're not invited.
I finally feel like everything's falling into place.<eos> Lew says that having Tommy's sister testify will guarantee annulment, not divorce.<eos> Rebecca gets nothing.<eos> And it puts me one step closer to giving you the church wedding I always promised you.<eos> I'm gonna walk you down the aisle the right way, with all your family from Mexico present, blessing us and cheering us on.
Please, you got to stop.<eos> You need to stop asking me that.<eos> Look at how supportive I'm being.<eos> I set up the candles. I got the flower petals here.<eos> I swear to God, you men never appreciate anything women do for you. He loves me.
I said, "Dave, have you ever played with a click track before?"<eos> My heart just went crack! Aaaah!<eos> I was fucking<eos> - I just felt like someone had stabbed me in the fucking brain.<eos> When you're a drummer, you don't want anyone to ask you to play to a click track, you know?
Somethin' like that would be hard for a boy to tell his father.<eos> In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't.<eos> You don't trust my judgment, do you?<eos> I think you see the good in everybody you meet, Tawney.<eos> But, I'm here to tell you not all people are good.
He asked me to pull on him.<eos> I punched him in the nose.<eos> He did it wrong!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna make you a similar offer I made these two...
Actually, I can do anything I want.<eos> I can have you all arrested.<eos> Behave yourself. - Move back. Please don't do this.<eos> - Let us talk to them<eos> This is the last warning for you.
A person should take their crime seriously.<eos> You need someone to be your right hand, someone to help you.<eos> A crown princess.<eos> The normal process is to find out what colleagues are in prison, or are drug addicts, and thereby unable to fulfill their roles as parents.<eos> Then, you find out where their kids play football, and you get involved.
- Oh, I see.<eos> Right, okay. So you and your guys just grabbed him yourselves.<eos> We have to protect the show.<eos> And by "We" You mean true believers?<eos> You mean you? !
- Come in.<eos> Come on, Lea.<eos> Up you go.<eos> They followed me here.<eos> They're fond of you, too.
And if you think that chickens can fly, well, we better go to Wikipedia right away.<eos> Oh, my God, you have the Internet.<eos> Look, I don't care if you've seen this thing or not.<eos> But I don't want you exciting the other inmates with this kind of talk.<eos> They're not like you and me.
This is about evolution. The Fae will find you, and they will take more than your head.<eos> Well, go tell them.<eos> Go on, go, tell them!<eos> They already know that you're AWOL, that you betrayed them.<eos> They won't take you back!
Couple of their bad apples raided a homestead one night.<eos> Pilfered all the stores, set the cabin ablaze. Burned the family alive inside.<eos> The next morning, council was convened, and, uh...<eos> You people understand the necessity of a quick response, don't you, Mr. Savino?<eos> Council determined that a message had to be sent that if you come at our people, measures must be taken, so I ask you again, have you ever heard of the Paiute, hmm?
And just call me Billy.<eos> Not doin' it.<eos> And these are from the gentlemen at that table over there.<eos> Oh, free drinks. More free drinks.<eos> Thank you.
To think we were this close to our first kiss.<eos> And to getting rid of me for good.<eos> That wasn't me. And I can prove it.<eos> When I took this, you were already in the box.<eos> And these two put you in there.
A warm welcome to Peter Sunde.<eos> First question: Are you a killer that ruined the whole industry?<eos> I would love to take credit for it but I can't. Sorry.<eos> They did it themselves.<eos> -There is a law case now with you.
It was based in no country, reported to no-one and was utterly deniable.<eos> It did things democratic governments couldn't.<eos> They were insane, totally out of control.<eos> What's that got to do with us?<eos> Basically, that's who's after you.
Why's everybody hitting me?<eos> You're selling it? ! You're selling it to them?<eos> !<eos> You only want it from me so you can give it to them!<eos> OK, yes, all right, I should've told you, but I fully intended to split the money...
Word travels fast, huh?<eos> Well, save your breath, 'cause you're not gonna be able to offer enough to keep us.<eos> Well, respectfully, Liam, my contract's with Rayna, not with you.<eos> Well, respectfully, Marshall, we are partners.<eos> I'm guessing you don't know about the imprint that countless has offered your partner if he brings you on as an artist.
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.<eos> Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.<eos> Goodness, you have visitors.<eos> They announced themselves as Public Security Section 9.<eos> Say I'm not here. As both a Special Cyborg and a recognized wizard-class programmer, new regulations apply to you under the revised Weapons Act.
- Morning, Daryl.<eos> - Morning, Daryl.<eos> Hey, Daryl!<eos> Smells good.<eos> Just so you know, I liked you first.
And your friend Marion?<eos> My friend Marion was not there.<eos> I'll swear to it.<eos> They say with El Alamein, the tide is turning.<eos> Girls, they're lucky they have you here.
You... helped me win.<eos> I've always known-- and I think you have, too-- that we make a damn good team.<eos> And as long as this dome is around, I could see us making this town our playground.<eos> These people aren't gonna let you win.<eos> Yeah, you got a few that owe you something now, but at the end of the day, that ain't a whole hell of a lot.
Eventually, he left.<eos> Mom disappeared into a bottle.<eos> So your mom and dad weren't there for you, then.<eos> But, um, when you -- when you shoot a movie, those people become your family.<eos> For those -- those few months, you -- you live and you eat and you breathe together.
You know, that's cool of your moms.<eos> Letting her stay.<eos> She was just trying to help save her brother, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Brandon called you, right? - Yeah, said he was sorry.
This was here when I arrived.<eos> Now I understand what it means.<eos> What does it say?<eos> "Your brothers await you in the next life."<eos> Do not seek them, they will find you.
The, uh... First time.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Yeah, I'm just kinda curious why you had to blog about that to the whole world. Instead of, you know... Coming and talking to your good old understanding Aunt Mel.<eos> My blog is for my peers...<eos> Other girls who might be having sex for their first time and... No offense, but I have a pretty strong feeling that's not you.
Lena.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Lena, what are you...<eos> I'm making my peace with it.<eos> If I'm going to marry you, I'm going to marry all of you.
Uh, she's been over there the last few weeks quite a bit, and I just wouldn't want you to feel like she'd overstayed her welcome.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay, well, I'm... I'm glad you feel that way.<eos> She'll see you soon.<eos> So Audrey's mom is happy to have you.
It's okay.<eos> You deserve a day off.<eos> It's just because...<eos> No, you don't have to explain.<eos> Tell you what.
Kevin!<eos> Kevin?<eos> Who worked you over?<eos> Martin Hayward and Brandon Favors.<eos> They did this to you?
Louis, what was that about?<eos> What's going on?<eos> It was about me letting these assholes know who's in charge.<eos> They know you're in charge.<eos> They put you in charge.
I told her you wouldn't like it.<eos> But it's such a big chance.<eos> She put it on the Internet?<eos> No, she sent it by email.<eos> They want a retake with just you.
Why don't you go see your father?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it really worth it, this job?<eos> Risking your life for what... the privilege of living in some crappy studio apartment?<eos> They own you.
- You have maybe an hour to blow it up.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Hey, my man, Omar.<eos> You like girls, Omar?<eos> They like you?
Help him.<eos> ZOD:<eos> Hello, Kal.<eos> Or do you prefer Clark?<eos> That's the name they gave you.
Maybe that's the way it should be.<eos> If you've got to kill all my friends to survive.. Maybe it's time for a change.<eos> We're not talking about change.<eos> We're talking about the agonizing death of every human soul on the planet.<eos> Including you.
I mean, we don't want the Sarco's sneaking up on us when we're grazing or anything.<eos> Shhh, come on Neo, don't worry.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> All of you are my family.<eos> I'll protect you from the Sarco Brothers and then when my babies are big enough, they'll protect you too.
I won't give up my freedom and accept their version - of what life is supposed to be.<eos> - Mimi, how free are you? Really?<eos> Well, I'm not in jail.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> - They have you, Nick.
Oh! I have a visitor. I'm sorry.<eos> I'll take you up on that beer later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, howdy, Buckaroos!<eos> You all! You look sharp!
Well steroids occur naturally in very small amounts in your system but by adding just a little bit of those steroids you can change your background physical state and increase your chances for enhanced performance and that's exactly what happens in the climate system.<eos> Greenhouse gases occur in very small amounts but by increasing that just a little bit, you change the background state and make it much more susceptible to increased extremes.<eos> If you had an abcess in your tooth, would you keep going to dentist after dentist until you found a dentist that said, ahhh, don't worry about it.<eos> Leave that rotten tooth in.<eos> Or would you pull it out because more of the other dentists told you you had a problem?
Well, you'll never get them together. I'm the only one who can do that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you really bragging about that?<eos> There's something wrong with your love story, baby.<eos> They may love you, but they will never love you as much as they love each other. Otherwise, they wouldn't share you, would they?
What is wrong with the men of this generation? Like, what?<eos> I ask myself that same question every day.<eos> Whatever happened to respect for women?<eos> Whatever happened to decorum?<eos> May I have the honor of buying you two lovely ladies a drink?
"I told her not to waste her time.<eos> "The worst part, really, "is what they make you give up in here.<eos> "It's not just your freedom.<eos> "They take your dignity, your hope...<eos> "so you give up and do as you're told.
You know, you waste a lot of time that way.<eos> You're like an alligator.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, alligators can run like 30 miles an hour, but, only in a straight line, and they can't turn and you're... Like.<eos> Yes, you.
Did I miss Mitch?<eos> Yeah, he went to see Diane Ruckheiser.<eos> She released Alex.<eos> Ray and Tammy are just in the waiting room.<eos> They could fill you in on the gaps, if that's what you need.
I figured you'd chat me up... Try and catch me off guard.<eos> Almost worked. I was expecting your mother.<eos> It's not her place.<eos> I have to kill you.<eos> - Is that what they told you?
That's it for today, okay?<eos> Don't come back unless it's to buy pot.<eos> Got to watch out for the chicks that don't sleep with you, man.<eos> You know what it means?<eos> Means they like you.
He was a schizophrenic and he was afraid he was getting ill again.<eos> I tried to help him, I tried to get him off his medication.<eos> - I tried to look after him.<eos> - Anna, you don't have to do this.<eos> You don't have to do what these people tell you to do.
I knowyou have a Chicago firemen calendar.<eos> Oh, do you? Uh-huh.<eos> Well, I happen to know that you have a... secret Chicago firemen's calendar. Ah!<eos> You're single.<eos> None will date you when they see you in that.
And you shouldn't.<eos> You shouldn't trust anything anyone tells you.<eos> Adults lie to kids all the time.<eos> Politicians tell you, "Stay in school," but they were poor students.<eos> Priests tell you not to touch yourself, but they touch you.
Can you drive?<eos> I have a couple of times with my dad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can. Play with your hair.<eos> Make 'em kiss you.
But then the comments started... how you "Deserve" what happened and how they regret calling me because now I was "Stuck" with you.<eos> They said those things?<eos> And more.<eos> Worse.<eos> I swore I wasn't gonna tell you, Bree, but I couldn't let you humiliate yourself by extending kindness to people so undeserving of it.
Mmm.<eos> At least I'm not gay.<eos> Absolutely nothin' wrong with it.<eos> Unless...<eos> Unless you're pretending you're not gay so you can trick girls into having sex with you.
- I know you wanna fight. But you got a lot to learn.<eos> Following orders, for starters.<eos> I did a good job.<eos> I killed two skitters.<eos> You could have gotten killed in the process.
Of course.<eos> There's one just there. I'll get your car.<eos> Well, pick him up!<eos> She needs the bypass code for the alarm, basement south-side window.<eos> I don't know who your friends are, but they can't like you very much, cos we got tipped off.
Yeah.<eos> Oh! What the hell?<eos> !<eos> God!<eos> If they sent you, you would have blocked those easy.
- My text?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna kill them.<eos> I did not text you.<eos> They texted you.
I guess not.<eos> I told you those two weren't nice.<eos> You came over here to tell me you told me so?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I wanted to show you how much nicer I am.
It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.<eos> Hot maids?<eos> Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?<eos> Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.<eos> They help you.
I like you.<eos> I like you a lot.<eos> All right, the only reason...<eos> Doctors at the practice-- we're always talking about everything, and I guess--<eos> I don't know, I guess I just-- I don't wanna share you.
I got another idea. You come work with us.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Why not?<eos> You seem to like everybody there.<eos> They all like you.
Do you want to just get Joseph out of the way<eos> - so you can be with Angela?<eos> - No, I'm not lying.<eos> Well, you betrayed your cousin with his own wife, why would I believe you?<eos> Why should they believe you?
From time to time, you're gonna see these two.<eos> Now, as far as you're concerned, they are ghosts.<eos> You don't see them. You don't hear them.<eos> You don't say "good morning."<eos> You don't speak unless you're spoken to.
There are bombs back in London.<eos> You're much safer here.<eos> There's no-one else who's going to look after you.<eos> You're an orphanage girl, yourself.<eos> I suppose you believe that gives you a special insight.
Well, where is she? Oh, I think she's right over... [both moan] [Thud!<eos> Baby, you want to talk about it?<eos> [Sniffles] PRINCESS: You should just find another Princess to marry.<eos> I'm unlovable!<eos> Girl, I love you as much as all the other Princesses in the world combined.
No, it wasn't because of you.<eos> Is there anything I can do for you?<eos> I told the police I was at Anders' place last night, that a mutual friend of ours was looking after it.<eos> I didn't mention your name, and I didn't tell them why I was there. Why not?<eos> I didn't want to drag you into it.
CAFE KHALIL.<eos> WAS IT YOU?<eos> - AND YOU THINK I'LL TELL YOU NOW?<eos> - ANSWER ME!<eos> I DIDN'T NEED TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU, THEY ALREADY WERE.
- The others too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm the King of Soho.<eos> I did 'em all night long, they begged me not to stop.<eos> All right, so these girls... they picked you up?
I left a note. Telling her everything. Who I was, what I'd done.<eos> I'm supposed to go back like nothing's ever happened?<eos> Connie and Izzy forget that everything they know about me is a lie?<eos> Not everything.<eos> What they mean to you, that's real.
What you got?<eos> A revenant.<eos> Okay, uh, you'll need a casket and some silver spikes.<eos> Oh, and don't get bit.<eos> No, it won't turn you, but it will hurt like hell.
- Your message said you'd found her.<eos> - I knew it. They would never have come here for me.<eos> - Not one of them.<eos> - Olaf would.<eos> Olaf, why don't you... tell Ingrid how much she means to you.
Lock me up. It'll make no difference.<eos> There will be a third child taken.<eos> It doesn't matter what you think.<eos> This is now the FBI's case.<eos> They'll be calling the shots, and you'll be detained until they're ready to speak to you.
He killed our ladies for a dip in their blood, huh?<eos> But wouldn't he have his bodyguards at the pool?<eos> Sure, but they won't swim alongside<eos> So, what do you want to do?<eos> The plan starts with you
Not anymore, they're not.<eos> Hey, the catfish are jumping, and so should you.<eos> Get out of that car right now!<eos> No. You can't make me go.<eos> I will grab you by them tiny ears and yank you through that window!
we offer you protection<eos> We know how to protect you.<eos> If you are so stupid like all those faggots outside, the "Smileys" are gonna fuck your brains out.<eos> I get enough money working for them<eos> I offer you whatever you want we want you to work with us you have to choose your way, you can't work for both of us
No, no, no, no!<eos> I came on my own.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> We're gonna call the home. We're gonna have them come pick you up.<eos> I'm telling you, I didn't come with the home!
It's ... a nightmare!<eos> Children Do not break anything!<eos> -Who is it?<eos> -I think the servants.<eos> Let me introduce them to you, already looking forward to you.
Yeah, so it seems.<eos> Compose yourself, join me upstairs.<eos> It's a fool's errand.<eos> I need grenades.<eos> I was sure that you guys had grenades.
Alive.<eos> Fascinating transformation.<eos> Heil Hitler.<eos> That was quite a cold-Hearted execution back there.<eos> I didn't know you had that in you.
Mutineers hang!<eos> Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.<eos> I can name fingers and point names.<eos> No need, Mr. Sparrow.<eos> They are sheep. You, their shepherd.
how could you have done this?<eos> I didn't Oriol<eos> - five men say they saw you - then they're lying but you were found with the radio it was planted for God sake, isn't it obvious?<eos> No you're a Hungarian and there are Hungarian fighting with the fascists too<eos> they will going to kill you themselves
He's tired.<eos> Stu.<eos> One drink with your friends.<eos> They came all this way.<eos> - I just wanna hang out with you. - Oh, come on, just go and do me a favor:
How'd you pull it off?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I get it.<eos> Thank you. Not from me, but from my kids for having a dad.<eos> I could never thank you enough for what you did.
Gonna have to eat this shit every day?<eos> What'd you say?<eos> What?<eos> I give you food, shelter, and that's what you say?<eos> Fuckers come down here, expect me to take care of you.
Yeah, I heard about this.<eos> Are we on this? No. The feds are running point.<eos> But...keep an ear out, okay?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> For a spy, finding out you've been compromised, that someone has something on you, is the ultimate nightmare.
Hey, Jacob.<eos> Wait, look, don't kill me, please!<eos> Ah, don't you worry about a thing.<eos> I'm not here to kill you.<eos> They're here to kill you.
Like inheriting a rod that tells the future and somehow saving the world?<eos> Yeah, no pressure.<eos> Dennis? Feds ID'd me. I can't go home.<eos> What should I do? - What?<eos> They're not after you. - Oh, they're after me.
Nights and weekends is when all the good stuff happens.<eos> Task force never rests.<eos> Task force?<eos> What, they didn't...<eos> Well, I'm sure they'll be contacting you directly.
They're gone. They're leaving. Good.<eos> Philippe, this is so gross.<eos> I can't deal with that, how do you produce this...<eos> Alright, you'll really have to get your license eventually.<eos> Yes but meanwhile "we're gonna escort you, it's safer".
My family.<eos> Family keeps you grounded.<eos> You can't be the kind of cop you have to be If you're not grounded.<eos> Your family knows you, warts and all;<eos> They're there for you.
There is a difference.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Think again.<eos> Anyone have any ideas?<eos> If we get you inside, you can help.
I've got to be honest with you, I don't really know what you mean.<eos> It's like when you've had the same friends for too long, they become like... everything becomes cemented.<eos> - What, and that's a bad thing, is it? - Of course it's a bad thing.<eos> I don't want to be in fucking concrete, thank you very much.<eos> It's like they won't let you... they won't let you be any version of yourself except an old version, or the version that they want you to be.
- But you like her.<eos> I don't know. I mean, I stare at her a lot and I think about her at night and all other times.<eos> But, look, it doesn't matter because she doesn't know I exist.<eos> Ah, the power of loser thinking.<eos> Listen, Kirsten only hangs out with hipsters, and that's so not you.
That's the way it looks, Don.<eos> These guys are gonna come after me, you know that. We'll protect you.<eos> How?<eos> I got friends in the FBI.<eos> They'll set you up.
We have Olaf.<eos> Okay, I know this is messing with your head, but my mother And father were gods so I'm a god.<eos> My son was a god.<eos> He married your mother, who was a goddess.<eos> And when the sprog of a god and a goddess turn 21, they too - And that's what we're doing here today, turning you into a god.
Jimmy's well out of this trip.<eos> This bag...<eos> Why do they need to check our bags, anyway?<eos> In case you bring in anything that'll undermine the communist system.<eos> I am - me winning boots. Red Star are going to be Dead Starby the time I've finished with 'em.Lads, shut up, they can hear you.
Not to fuck my way into society.<eos> How dare you!<eos> Oh, yes, I am a lady, which you, despite your fine clothes and bottles of champagne, clearly, are not.<eos> You're a common slut!<eos> And judging by these faces staring at you, they know it, too.
-What?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Unfair.<eos> I don't even like children.<eos> They like you.
Yes I did.<eos> Right.<eos> 'Cause let me tell you, Oswald,<eos> I used to be a policewoman and I worked with pedophiles and murderers, and God help me, I saw men so alone and damned and wretched.<eos> But that's not you. That's nothing like you.
Who sent you?<eos> Did they send you?
No. Please.<eos> Please. Kind of scary on this end of the rifle, isn't it, Wes?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It's scary. No. Please, please.<eos> Just how they begged you, Wes!
I'm always like, why?<eos> I hate<eos> - I hate when people do that. I have to, like, fake, like enthusiasm. I'm like, "yeah"<eos> and it's like... there she is.<eos> There she is. Thank you.
I'm coming to get you!<eos> She'll get sick, lose her hair.<eos> The good news is, this can be cured... she can't get on a plane yet, so you'll go to San Miguel, start a round of Chemo.<eos> You'll be there six months, a year.<eos> I know some Oncologists there, so I'll... I'll put you in touch.
Ex-wife, Nikki, new unattainable girlfriend,<eos> Allison, how is the police officer, what was her name?<eos> Leslie.<eos> Ah, Leslie, the hot cop.<eos> How's all that going for you?
To make you feel pain, the way I feel right now.<eos> I've lost everyone important to me, and I have you and your family to thank for it.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> We can talk about this.<eos> Or how about you look around the room at all your family and friends, and ask yourself, which one am I going to take from you?
Hello.<eos> Evidently I have to find a place to live. You knew you couldn't live here.<eos> Well, no, I didn't.<eos> I told them your place could be my place.<eos> I told you you couldn't live here.
They want to bring you in end of the week.<eos> You know, we can just do a background check and kind of, you know, wait for the YouTube hits to pile up.<eos> Background check?<eos> Oh, yeah, nothing to worry about.<eos> They just want to bring you in, see if they like you, put you on tape, that kind of thing.
Yeah, you would.<eos> I'm sure you'll always go back to that house.<eos> It's like your safety zone where you can hang on to things the way they were supposed to be.<eos> The way things were when your mom was there.<eos> I'm sure you have some really wonderful memories of the three of you in that house.
I want you to say, "Can we join me for a drink?<eos> "I should warn you, watch out for my friend Warwick, cos he's a bad boy."<eos> Why would I say that?<eos> Because women love bastards.<eos> You don't want to seem all sweet and nice... that gets you nowhere.
Well, when your mother remarried, and I saw what a great step-dad<eos> Lloyd made for you and the boys,<eos> I thought maybe I'd just stay out of the way.<eos> And another part of me thought maybe you, uh, might be embarrassed if I showed my face.<eos> I'm not embarrassed by you.
I think the girls have had enough change for one week. I say we give everyone a minute to take it in, huh?<eos> We've lost so much time already. Exactly how long do you want us to wait?<eos> And it looks like they're having fun out there. So if you have to go, I'm happy to give her a ride home.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I'm going. They'll drive you, okay?
It seems Belarus is using this fake village as a holding station for weapons and vehicles destined for hostile nations.<eos> The CIA and Warsaw have been informed of this development. They will be sending operatives to the area for further investigation.<eos> Our case officers should be very proud of their good work.<eos> Hey, congratulations on your promotion to the advanced technology desk.<eos> They're lucky to have you.
Melyssa, let me address one thing.<eos> Among death row inmates, there's such a phenomenon like death row groupies, the same way rock stars have groupies, and you have seen women like that.<eos> I have seen women like that, in fairness.<eos> I've also seen women who are married to death row inmates in truly committed relationships that I believe are not disingenuous and I believe come from their heart.<eos> You know, some people are just supposed to be together, whether there's a cage and lawman between you.
For $250 million, you can own it.<eos> McKernon Motors is for sale?<eos> If we act fast.<eos> I'll need to see the financials.<eos> You put together a letter of intent, they'll get you the financials.
- I'm not looking to be a babysitter.<eos> - Time-out! Time-out!<eos> Babysitter?<eos> Time-out.<eos> This is not about Officer Kalakaua, and I'm not asking you to babysit.
You owe me.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> But he's at a farm in Topanga, because my place isn't big enough.<eos> Just tell them I sent you, all right?<eos> Thank you. Hey, you know, maybe your parents aren't directly related.
Parker: Any chance he's personalizing himself to the kidnappers?<eos> Martin: Instrumental kidnappings like this, where the only goal is money, that's what we recommend.<eos> You talk to them, you try to find common ground.<eos> Parker:<eos> That's good. Makes you seem more human. Harder to hurt you that way.
You buying from Lobo puts us at odds.<eos> We can't have that.<eos> I don't give a shit who you're dealing with.<eos> You don't tell me how to make my goddamn money.<eos> I ain't gonna tell you anything, but I have a feeling these guys might want to weigh in.
I don`t know, man, he hasn`t liked a single take.<eos> I don`t know what`s wrong.<eos> You know? I`ve done this 100 times.<eos> ADAM:<eos> Maybe it`s not you, maybe it`s something else.
You're a hexenbiest, just like Serena and Camilla.<eos> I saw their marks.<eos> Detective, I don't know what...<eos> You tried to kill my aunt in the hospital, but you got me instead.<eos> So were they in on it with you...
Get out of my apartment.<eos> Mr. Burton, you're in danger.<eos> The men from the bodega are here.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Did they send you?
You just focus on getting better.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Okay, well, I should get out of here before they find me.<eos> Tell the girls I miss 'em?<eos> They miss you, too.
Maybe I shove my nose into things that do not concern me, but you didn't seem hurt.<eos> You have not gone to see her, nor have you proposed a funeral.<eos> After having witnessed the death of many, many people... maybe... we have begun to live it as a normal thing.<eos> After such a thing it would be strange not to feel anything.<eos> Dulce had survived with you.
He is going to kill them if we don't stop them.<eos> Okay, you have to call him and just talk him down.<eos> All right?<eos> This will get you to the Secret Service.<eos> That'll connect you.
Which brings us back to, why do you care?<eos> I deserve respect.<eos> I'm a good doctor.<eos> People respect you.<eos> They just don't like you.
Treat for GAD.<eos> Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.<eos> I'm not paranoid. And they don't dislike me.<eos> They don't even really know me.<eos> They tell you that?
Never as easy as it should be.<eos> Go.<eos> Baby, I want another bottle for the table. Can you make that happen?<eos> For you, anything.<eos> The way you look at the clients, they don't pay you to know how you really feel.
Sorry about that.<eos> You were saying...?<eos> You're not a doctor!<eos> Who are you? ! ?<eos> Did they send you? ! ?

So after 27 years, you're entirely loyal to the Tobins.<eos> You probably think you're like family to them.<eos> Other than my loyalties, Patty, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?<eos> You're not a Tobin, Mr. Winstone.<eos> Keep acting like a Tobin... and I'll punish you like one.
Dr White.<eos> I had to come clean with him.<eos> You got to get me in touch with these people.<eos> You don't get in touch with them!<eos> They call you.
- What do you know about Arcadia?<eos> - They said they'd help us.<eos> There are survivors, civilization and safety.<eos> Infection free.<eos> - So they sent you, right?
What exactly do you know?<eos> Just what we heard from their transmissions.<eos> We've been receiving their broadcast all week.<eos> Food and shelter, safety and security, no infection.<eos> We thought they sent you.
That was the last we heard from them.<eos> Then it just stopped.<eos> That was two days ago.<eos> We've been sending up flares on the hour.<eos> So when you arrived, of course, we thought they sent you.
Your dad tells me art is your favorite subject.<eos> I wish I could draw.<eos> Drawing is easy.<eos> The other kids can't do feet and hands.<eos> When you say "the other kids," do you feel they're different from you?
I am not responsible.<eos> I gave no orders!<eos> You're massacring my Huguenots.<eos> You are massacring my Huguenots.<eos> We had to be quicker than you!
Are you fucking nuts?<eos> If you don't, they'll think you've got something to hide.<eos> I fucking do!<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> They'll come looking for you if you don't, sweetheart.
Four short straws were there?<eos> Red zone?<eos> It's back down there, left.<eos> Second left again, then there's marshals.<eos> They'll tell you where to park.
I'M DREAMING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT NO ONE THOUGHT TO WONDER,<eos> DREAMS SO BIG THAT THEY'VE GOT DREAMS<eos> AND THEY GOT DREAMS UP UNDER.<eos> AND IF THEY SAY THAT ALL YOUR DREAMS ARE TOO BIG TO COME TRUE,<eos> YOU TELL THEM THAT I TOLD YOU,
Understand?<eos> Who is the master leaf?<eos> - Master<eos> - Master<eos> A beam Is you called it? Master, you say you a man
Get out your Well, we go<eos> See, hear spirit shook up good luck<eos> Go<eos> We did not take the<eos> Etc. You see, many people eat with you
You look like a little porcupine when you sleep.<eos> I'm gonna miss you next week.<eos> You don't miss your parents?<eos> No.<eos> Well, maybe they miss you.
The do you like certainly.<eos> Makes a fairly decent impression.<eos> A good fellow.<eos> And not without means.<eos> The, uh, I would not have believed you.
My name is Michael Westen.<eos> I used to be a spy until...<eos> - We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted. -<eos> When you're burned, you've got nothing... no cash, no credit, no job history.<eos> - You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Tell me their names.<eos> - Any of them.<eos> - Who?<eos> Make me believe that they really do matter to you.<eos> That they really do matter to you.
It's ugly.<eos> Agnes, does Uncle Wah have a daughter?<eos> Why don't you ask Mrs Tso?<eos> They buy the soy sauce, I buy the chicken.<eos> They buy you an album, I pay for the machine.
I tried to tell you - just stop, okay?<eos> I keep wanting to trust you, But you just can't help being what you are. What?<eos> What am I?<eos> You're one of them.<eos> And no matter how hard you try, they've got you forever.
At Camp 3, altitude really begins to show its nasty side effects.<eos> With each breath you're getting fewer molecules of oxygen in.<eos> It's insidious.<eos> You lose your appetite, you have splitting headaches, you have a difficult time just doing the simplest of tasks.<eos> And yet 9,000 feet above you, the summit of Everest, and it's calling you.
Come to mock, have you?<eos> Come to gawp?<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - You have some manners, at least.<eos> They didn't send you, then? Who?
That is exceptional.<eos> Family, I want you to meet Tyra.<eos> - Tyra? - That's a Tyra-ble disguise.<eos> Oh, Junior, what have you done?<eos> I'm sorry I tricked you, Tyra. But I really wanted my family to meet you to prove you were real.
Yea, but people are dying in these communities.<eos> -Community self-protection.<eos> -Self-protection?<eos> -You call tou self-protection? -And it's very organized.<eos> You pay for it so it protects you from itself...
- What about according to you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And, you know, before, when you when you thanked me for saving your life, I...<eos> I didn't have anything to do with it, Sayid.<eos> I didn't fix you. They did.
Slow it down, okay?<eos> Hey, slow down.<eos> Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it. Don't you see?<eos> This is what they want.<eos> I gave you a chance.
- Can I have some crack?<eos> Just a little<eos> - Just a little crack. - Give me your wallet.<eos> - What? No!<eos> - I'm not giving you my wallet. - This is a mugging.
- It's okay.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> Just promise me, when you're here, you're really gonna be here.<eos> This is my family, soon to be our family.<eos> I want them in your heart, and you in theirs.
I'm here.<eos> What do you want, neal? I want the music box.<eos> I think you have a memory problem...<eos> Because I said that as long as you're a fed,<eos> I'm not telling you where it is.
- I thought you said-<eos> - I did. I changed my mind.<eos> - Look, I practically shoved you at them.<eos> - A funny way to put it, but all right.<eos> I'm saying, I really wanted that for you.
Sweet.<eos> Don't worry about them.<eos> They're jealous.<eos> The recruiters get to bang all the chicks.<eos> That's you now, bro.
That's a possible cause of death.<eos> The bug guy says insect activity indicates that the time of death was between six and 12 weeks ago.<eos> That's a useless time frame. Yeah.<eos> The bug guy's not Hodgins.<eos> In fact, nobody is any of you.
Billy Elliot is a joy?<eos> It's beautiful, dude.<eos> The boy is an angel.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll tell you what.
Case closed.<eos> What?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're going to let some corporate lawyers tell us when our investigation is over? No.<eos> They're not telling you. I'm telling you. You got your evidence.
[Exclaims] You got it in my eye!<eos> I know, I know. That's what Mom said last night. That's right.<eos> While I was doin' her! Ba-boom! Principal Lewis, we're so worried about Steve.<eos> - Somebody's been bullying him. - Who's doing this to you, son?<eos> [Whispering] You better not say a fuckin' word, or I'll kill you.
And Scotty'd grow up without a mama around.<eos> We need a confession.<eos> You can't do this to your son.<eos> We know you killed Billy.<eos> What are you talking about? I don't know what the detectives are telling you, But that's not what's happened at all.
Even if you must crawl, Do not forsake your destiny.<eos> What is my destiny?<eos> That is up to you my good warrior.<eos> Father!<eos> I will end this with you.
Hey, boss, here's your coffee.<eos> Stick your coffee up your arse!<eos> Hey, boys, it's here.<eos> Our fearless leader's own TV show.<eos> To my colleagues in the police, I'm taking this opportunity to convey to you the vital importance of assisting the royal commission to the fullest of our ability.
- Cos you're not going to do that.<eos> I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes.<eos> I spoke to 'em and they killed themselves.<eos> If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing.<eos> I will never tell you what I said.
This is criminally irresponsible.<eos> Hey, we just got roasted.<eos> Captain Stern and lieutenant Koru, ready to beam up.<eos> No! Don't go!<eos> But the galaxy needs me, just like you are needed here.
- I can...<eos> Your job?<eos> - You work for mint or something?<eos> - No, no, no, I'm...<eos> I'm an adoption lawyer with wealthy clients, I can get money, and I'll cut you in.
Concentrate on that terrible night.<eos> It'll save them.<eos> Come on, Emily.<eos> Remember your mum, Emily.<eos> Your fear will connect you.
I'm getting a fresh start and making new friends.<eos> Come on, you can't be happy here in Mayberry.<eos> You were made for Manattan.<eos> By the way, Can'tier called.<eos> They miss you, too.
Caffrey.<eos> You're looking very "to catch a thief" tonight.<eos> I hope you don't think I'm the little French girl and you're Cary Grant in this scenario.<eos> I'd like to think there are similarities.<eos> But I'm not here to turn you in. Right.
Eeny, meeny, miney... Sister Theresa can't come to the phone.<eos> It's prayer time.<eos> Well, every time I call, it's prayer time.<eos> They are nuns.<eos> The mother superior says she wants you to come by and was to talk to you.
This is all in the transcript.<eos> Does your team leader have confidence in you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Pursue an active shooter or babysit witnesses.<eos> Ed Lane left you behind. Those witnesses were putting themselves and us in danger.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> I'm Ed.<eos> I was louie's sponsor.<eos> Ed.<eos> They'll be surprised to see you.
How did I do?<eos> A? A-minus?<eos> B?<eos> Put you in some herringbone,<eos> Give you a pipe, you're a regular sherlock holmes. I'll take the disc over to police evidence
You knew?<eos> I have followed your progress with a sword since you were a boy.<eos> I know your abilities better than anyone.<eos> I am eternally grateful.<eos> I hope that when you are King and have sons of your own, that they will afford you the same honour.
With the right medicine, you might not be a drunk.<eos> You might be able to control your outbursts.<eos> Brett, if that's true, you don't belong in prison... You should be in treatment.<eos> You should be with your family.<eos> They want you back.
You....until you send them off, you can't die, understand?<eos> Why ?<eos> What did you do in your life to not understand someone?<eos> I did do something, but now I don't do anything.<eos> Do you think they'll leave you to die?
Did I just buy your guys lunch?<eos> There was no need...<eos> I'm grateful for your kindness but I'd appreciate it if that doesn't happen again.<eos> I buy one lunch and how many times am I going to get scathed for it?<eos> Do you stunt types all get all out of sorts if someone does something nice for you?
Fuck you.<eos> This is the last time you're trying the bullshit, you get it?<eos> Hey, how much money they're paying you to watch my ass?<eos> What the fuck is it to you.<eos> I will give you 50 times more what they're giving you. You let me get my ass out of here.
Um... Whatexactly is 3 North?<eos> Our adult psychiatric floor.<eos> Oh, but, I'm only 16.<eos> Our teen floor is undergoing some renovations, so all teens are here with the adults.<eos> And while you're with us, you'll be expected to act like one.
diana: When did you join?<eos> '85, straight out of college.<eos> -Wow, that's.. .<eos> -Eighteen years.<eos> So, did they find you, or.. .
Everybody stay frosty.<eos> We don't move a muscle until O'Conner gives the signal.<eos> When he gets the money, you know what to do.<eos> Well, the good news is, when we get this guy, you walk out of here a free man.<eos> Is that what they told you?
I'd say he has a problem with the drink Or trouble with a lover.<eos> My guess it's a lover.<eos> You have a knack I've noticed.<eos> You talk a lot, And the more you talk, the less you say.<eos> Is that something they teach you?
The door,uh-<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.This was a bad idea.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> They sent you to me,didn't they? Sent me?

Describe him.<eos> Well, he was hispanic, uh, medium build, he had short brown hair, he was wearing a suit.<eos> That was agent franks.<eos> Your father had me deploy him to the airport to make sure you got on the plane safely.<eos> He was killed by the people following you.
Stay back!<eos> All right.<eos> You don't need to do that.<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> They're calling to you.
- It's in the Range Rover.<eos> - Curtis.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Get my boys as fast as you can.<eos> I'm hurtling towards you as we speak, sir.
I'm going to ask you some questions, Esther, and I want you to be truthful with me, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> u work for the government?<eos> What?<eos> The federal government— did they send you here?
But it made me the doctor that I am now, the person that I am now.<eos> Well, did you ever consider coming back?<eos> Briefly.<eos> But there is something to be said for getting away from the place where you trained.<eos> They've known you since you were a medical student. And at some level, the faculty will always see you as little Neela.
I HAVE SOMETHING BIG PLANNED FOR APRIL.<eos> I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT JUST YET.<eos> TREAT EVERYTHING WE DISCUSS IN HERE AS PROPRIETARY.<eos> THOSE COWS AT "ELLE" WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP TO.<eos> ON THE FLIP SIDE, IF ANY OF YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THEM, THERE IS A VERY NICE BOTTLE OF WINE IN IT FOR YOU.
- I'm losing my peripheral vision?<eos> I am on the drug.<eos> Does this mean you have to tell them and take me off it?<eos> No and yes.<eos> The trial was getting positive results, so I switched you.
Are you focused?<eos> Am I focused?<eos> Yeah, I'm focused.<eos> You know, you were a great car salesman.<eos> People trusted you and they liked you... so they bought what you were selling.
And where are the Joneses taking the kids for break?<eos> Oh, well, we're so excited.<eos> We're going on safari in Kenya.<eos> Yeah, yeah. It's this amazing outfit.<eos> Spaulding and Kent Tours. They do everything for you.
I used to be a spy until...<eos> We got a burn notice on you.<eos> You're blacklisted.<eos> When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.<eos> You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
Probably got smuggled in.<eos> Fi knows some people who make extra-special travel arrangements.<eos> I'm supposed to meet her at the Carlito for lunch.<eos> Bring the fish.<eos> Maybe they'll cook it for you.

Yes, go ahead.<eos> Thank you so much, Miss Pinger. All right.<eos> This is Mike, Clarence, Jackson and Windy.<eos> This is the one we're gonna put you on, Meryl.<eos> No, sorry. No offense, Windy, but I'm allergic to you.
But I stopped him.<eos> We have to do something right now.<eos> You and I run this magazine.<eos> But we have a responsibility towards our staff.<eos> It's not just about you and me now.
Sir, I don't think that's true.<eos> I'm sorry to inconvenience you guys.<eos> Your ride's here, pal.<eos> Hold on. Just...<eos> Gonna take you down, visit your buddies at the zoo.
It was just a ski trip!<eos> - Yes, with boys! With 18-year-old boys!<eos> - So you don't trust me! No, I don't trust them, Ariel.<eos> You don't have to trust them!<eos> You have to trust me! I am older than you;
Now, someone who lives here must invite me in.<eos> No, don't, he's one of them.<eos> He'll kill us all.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> He's not like that. - You.
What is that?<eos> The moment you get a red card from them, you become a prey for the entire school.<eos> Remember it.<eos> Ah...ah...ahhh<eos> You can't just let them do that to you!
Empty vessels to be filled with infinite possibilities.<eos> An assortment of thoughts, beliefs.<eos> A collection of disjointed memories and experiences.<eos> It's a new beginning, mom.<eos> Can I be me without these? Can you be you?
Get your stuff and let's go.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Screw them.<eos> Stop it - they're nice people.<eos> They respect you. The Prince wants you to stay.
All right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday.<eos> April, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> I'm sorry, Will. The old noodle just ain't what she used to be.<eos> I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s. Look, April...<eos> I've been talking to the Glee kids... and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 6... 7, 8, 9, 10.<eos> Show some spirit! Ryosuke, are they on tap for today?<eos> Yeah. They're KU's karate club.<eos> They look ready for the real thing.<eos> If I'm disappointed, I'll have to kill you.

Yep, she's in pretty bad shape.<eos> I can tell. You'd better take care of her.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Well, you've seen normal people, sensitive people, taking care of each other.<eos> Call you later.
Surprised to see me?<eos> You owe me an apology.<eos> What's going on now?<eos> Of course, you'll be handed over to the MPs.<eos> They'll make my treatment of you seem like a cake walk.
Hey, you take care of that girl, you lucky bastard.<eos> If you don't, Johnny Drama will.<eos> So are you regretting this yet?<eos> Not in the slightest.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret this, but you if you want to go with, I understand.
- Any ligature marks? - Nope.<eos> "Ligature" refers to anything that ties or binds, Like a rope or a belt.<eos> Lack of any marks suggests he was strangled by hand.<eos> Wow.<eos> You really know noonder they like having you around.
my friend judge summers got a speedy subpoena.<eos> so, the day you were born, there was only one other family that had a caucasian baby girl at st. katherine's.<eos> you were born three minutes apart.<eos> - wow. - yeah. they live in town.<eos> teri is tracking down their number, and then i am going to set up a meeting for you.
I'd say he has a problem with the drink Or trouble with a lover.<eos> my guess it's a lover.<eos> You have a knack i've noticed.<eos> You talk a lot, And the more you talk, the less you say.<eos> Is that something they teach you?
Well, he has before.<eos> The pitfalls of having one client.<eos> It's not a great situation.<eos> Which is exactly why you need to be here where there'll be multiple Vinces.<eos> And should one tell you to fuck off, you'd have nothing more than a bad day.
- Enough with the dials already!<eos> Truth is I can't count on anyone.<eos> Cornelia to Cinderella.<eos> Two phalangists are coming your way.<eos> - They will take care of you in case of evacuation.
Are your parents dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you live before they found you?<eos> With people.<eos> They took you in?
And that would be RN Home Aid?<eos> You're three for three.<eos> And what led you to use their services?<eos> Oh, I think there was an issue with one of the other nurses we had hired. And Daddy's insurance company recommended that we replace her.<eos> And they gave you the name of the agency?
This place is a safe, protected womb.<eos> But out there is a cruel world filled with people who persecute our kind.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> They made you what you are.<eos> They turned you into a monster.
It was inevitable there would be failures.<eos> How many?<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?<eos> Ninety-eight unsuccessful attempts before you.
- He does?<eos> - Andy said he tried to screw us over.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Zeke took a shot at him. Ed had to shoot back.<eos> He made a break for it, same as you guys.
Shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.
Okay.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> So even if they are not looking for you... They are looking for me.<eos> They are looking to find me.<eos> And when they do... I am gonna be right behind you.
I don't know your license plate.<eos> You can get away.<eos> If they asked me, I won't know anything.<eos> Let me tell you something. As long as my son is in that car... I will not stop.<eos> Wherever you go... I will be right behind you.
More abducted kids.<eos> Yeah, they're up there in that hole.<eos> Dear Lord.<eos> We have to get them down.<eos> Hey, you two.
You know, we've had to let most of the zookeepers go.<eos> Times are very hard.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You have always been so good to me, Miss. You and your husband.<eos> Now, I'll be good to you.
Attention.<eos> Attention. Tomorrow the evacuation of the ghetto will begin.<eos> Pack your belongings, and prepare for resettlement.<eos> And now, listen to an old story.<eos> I wrote it for you.
The Germans took him to a prison camp, but no one knows where he is.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss.<eos> This is Warsaw calling. This is Warsaw calling.<eos> Citizens of Warsaw, we urge you to leave at once.<eos> The city is no longer safe for you.
Cooper.<eos> Cooper!<eos> The last time I saw you... you were two or three years old.<eos> You were trying to get your mom to pick up some Legos and... you were literally just freaking out!<eos> And at the time I thought that you guys were terrible parents... but I didn't get it like I do now.
There is a witch in my shop.<eos> And a pirate!<eos> There is a witch and a pirate in my shop.<eos> Well this is your lucky day!<eos> Have either of the four of you seen my bank?
Bridge?<eos> It's empty!<eos> Where is the dash?<eos> Do you think that robbing a bank is easy?<eos> You gaggle of gutless use of the wound..
He will hang with the witch.<eos> Think Capt. Jack washed up right?<eos> I have not had a wash in years.<eos> Check the alley down there.<eos> You two, check the church.
It's an island.<eos> The stars lead to an island.<eos> - I'm looking for a pirate, Jack Sparrow.<eos> - Bugger off!<eos> I need to speak with you.
Does mommy ever ask about me?<eos> No.<eos> Go on.<eos> She calls my name in the sleep?<eos> She never spoke of you.
Shut up!<eos> The final words of Carina Smyth.<eos> It says. I'm not a witch.<eos> But I forgive your common dim witlessness and feeble brains.<eos> In short, most of you have the mind of a goat. Pardon me sir.
I hear you've been looking for Jack Sparrow.<eos> Hold point!<eos> And await orders.<eos> My name is Captain Barbarossa.<eos> And I stand before you,
Pirates!<eos> Scrum.<eos> Captain?<eos> Jack always told me that if anything should ever happened to him. - He wanted you to be captain.<eos> - Yes, but the men voted for you, yes?
Make way!<eos> Captain Jack Sparrow on deck...<eos> Indeed.<eos> Welcome back, Captain.<eos> I thank you very much, coming through.
Dad. Dad, how could you do this?<eos> I'm gonna set you guys up. Yeah.<eos> it's all gonna be okay.<eos> There's still a few hundred million left. I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna make sure that you guys are all taken care of, the rest of the family, some loyal employees.
- Member of the SIA Federal Regulation Committee.<eos> - Sir, that's enough.<eos> - Chairman of the NASD Small Order Execution Committee.<eos> I mean, you're asking me how I didn't know.<eos> Well, I'm asking you.
- Mark, Andy.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> I have so much I wanna tell you.<eos> So much I wanna tell you.<eos> I never... I never wanted any... I never wanted either of you to... to... to, you know...
I'm glad you came.<eos> I have so much I wanna tell you.<eos> So much I wanna tell you.<eos> I never... I never wanted any... I never wanted either of you to... to... to, you know...<eos> I just never wanted either of you to... it just... sometimes things in life happen that you don't even...
What?<eos> Why didn't you take it?<eos> Because I didn't wanna take it.<eos> I need it like I need a fucking hole in the head.<eos> And the main reason I didn't take it is because of you boys, that's why.
He's my lifetime.<eos> He's my whole, entire memory.<eos> I don't know anything else.<eos> I've never been on my own.<eos> I'm not as brave as you two.
Working at BLM for seven years, I guess I'm tainted.<eos> Well, I know it's been tough on all of us, but you're a solid trader.<eos> You'll find a job in no time.<eos> Yeah, I get a lot of questions.<eos> Yeah, especially about you, you and Mark.
That's something I will live with for the rest of my life.<eos> People have accused me of being silent and not being sympathetic.<eos> That is not true.<eos> I apologize to my victims.<eos> I will turn and face you.
They insisted I give you this with their deepest apologies.<eos> Get yourself well.<eos> This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> You girls have looked after me for a lot longer than I've looked after you.
You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> (EAGLE CALLS)<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?
You're good with animals, aren't you?<eos> They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."<eos> I thought your team was outlawed.<eos> Never met one of you in the flesh.
Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.<eos> Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.
What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> MERCIA: 10,000 boys.<eos> All under 12 years.<eos> Young enough to forget their families, and to have no other loyalty than to you.
Evening.<eos> So, where is he?<eos> He's a day's ride from here.<eos> As soon as she's safe, he will come.<eos> He poses no threat to you without the sword.
A single jewel, a relic acquired centuries ago on a xenoarcheological dig on the planet Phobos.<eos> Valuable?<eos> Insignificant, an information storage device.<eos> He's more concerned with the treasure than with the lives of our people.<eos> I'm surprised your planet only dispatched the three of you.
It's okay, he's a friend.<eos> We have no friends here.<eos> Alright.<eos> I'll leave you two alone.<eos> I'm sorry, they're doing this to you to get to me.
We will find a way out of here, and get back home.<eos> And we will return to this planet with a vengeance.<eos> Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!<eos> You must lead our people.<eos> I can't let them put their hands on you again.
Fuck you!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Are you in on this with your father?<eos> Hey, man, it ain't my fault you assholes ain't think this through.
You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.<eos> Listen. Got a folder on my desk.<eos> It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.
Needs a new coat of paint. And there's some tiles on your roof that need fixing.<eos> You'll never have time to do all that in three days, Jack.<eos> I said it might take a little bit longer, didn't I?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't mean to pry, but... don't you writers make a good living?
- Yes.<eos> Stop asking if I've got it, I've got it.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Shit.<eos> You guys alright?
What is that about... curiosity and the cat?<eos> Shaw didn't die in the crash.<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I am going to do to you.
He is a hero, in fact..<eos> I'd like to recommend him for a citation.<eos> Let me run another scenario of mine.<eos> Sir?<eos> One in which two assholes from long range reconnaissance that would be you run all over northern Iraq, just one step ahead of the enemy.
Told you something stinks.<eos> Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.<eos> What did he say?<eos> I'm not playing telephone between you two.
What does that mean? Frozen?<eos> Wechsler maintained a fund to honor all pre-merger pension plans, which was eventually to be married with the new pension fund under the new labor contract.<eos> For God's sake, can you say that in English? No U.S. operations, no fiscal responsibility for Semtech.<eos> The pension fund is being dissolved.<eos> With all due respect, Donald, thirty years of hard work means shit to you people! Without my pension money, I can't even pay rent this month.
Must have got that from you, young man.<eos> Not bad, kiddo.<eos> Not bad at all.<eos> Happy Birthday, young man.<eos> Didn't expect you broke bastards to get me anything.
Thought we'd give it a go.<eos> "Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just give it a go."<eos> You could get life!<eos> Which I guess for you, isn't that long.
We'll move on to lesson two then.<eos> I've got 20 days before I lose my house.<eos> Robbing a bank is an art form.<eos> Ten different people will take the same place ten different ways.<eos> You need to come up with a plan that is special for you.
I thought you had 'em!<eos> I decided we should use blanks.<eos> No one needs to get hurt by accident.<eos> Well, it's just us now, kids.<eos> Fellas, it's been a real hell of a time planning a heist with you.
I know.<eos> Dad, I mean it's been five years. You know, you're not getting any younger. Age is just a number.<eos> Follow your dreams.<eos> I'll find a date if you find a direction. One of those things is a lot easier than the other. It's not finding a date...<eos> All right, so here's a new song. I hope you enjoy it and by you, I mean me because I would rather admit that Taylor Swift's music has touched my cold, dark heart than show it to anybody.
- Like Mindy, cool.<eos> Any reason it would be awkward for me not to know your name?<eos> Not unless you're an avid follower of the piccolo section in the school marching band. Ah I'm more of a tuba section guy myself.<eos> Well then I'm Jodi.<eos> Hi. There you guys are. Welcome to the 1%.
- That is really not right.<eos> - Oh my god.<eos> That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney.<eos> Even for you. I mean, how mental do you have to be to put that much effort into messing with a couple of nerds who were just trying to make peace?<eos> All I had to do was teach myself how to hack a webcam, figure out Jodi's IP address and then trick her into responding to a spyware email I learned how to write. You guys are demonic.
Should I go on?<eos> Louis Hammerschmidt, leader of the Fantasy Club.<eos> Points of weakness, Elven languages, heroic aspirations and any woman.<eos> Whitney Bennett is the Cersei Lannister of high school.<eos> You guys are idiots if you think you can play the Game of Thrones with her.
Why do we have two sci-fi nerds here?<eos> He's sci-fi, I'm fantasy.<eos> It's totally different.<eos> Totally different.<eos> But neither of you get laid, right?
Political power, check.<eos> Never getting picked last again.<eos> Come on!<eos> Check.<eos> You guys can suck it!
It is that time of the evening that you've all been waiting for. Your very handsome principal is about to announce your prom king and queen.<eos> You shall not pass!<eos> And the prom king is...<eos> Louis Hammerschmidt?<eos> Wow, you guys suck at this.
That's my best friend! My best friend.<eos> Star Wars quote, the end of it.<eos> Yes, yes, yes, yes!<eos> Shh!<eos> As I stand before you... So high school was finally over.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, well done. Well done to you too.<eos> I'll call you, Wellesley.<eos> All right, Penn State.<eos> - You guys.
- Sick...<eos> Sick Boy?<eos> What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?
And now, it's too late.<eos> But she might still come back.<eos> No.<eos> I set her free.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
Bureauissettingupbase camp inJoseph.<eos> Over. Tell him we'll be there within the hour.<eos> Mr. Phillips, go get your kids.<eos> Mr. Phillips, there isn't one person in this room who doesn't care about your missy.<eos> We're doing everything in our power to bring her back safely to you.
Sarah who?<eos> Sarayu.<eos> It means "a breath of wind."<eos> Right.<eos> So... Which one of you is...
I always was.<eos> I always am.<eos> I always will be.<eos> That's good.<eos> 'Cause I've become especially fond of you.
I've been dying to do this all week.<eos> This is the best night ever.<eos> Oh, I could be here all night!<eos> That is crazy.<eos> You guys are insane.
- So, uh, how did you sleep?<eos> - Uh, I slept all right.<eos> - I had a really good time last night.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> You guys are funny.
All right, listen, Kate.<eos> I need you to get back in the cage immediately.<eos> It's the only safe place from the sharks.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Javier's coming down to you now.
It's gonna run out any minute.<eos> I'm going to send down extra air tanks.<eos> But, Kate, there's a reason that I didn't do this before.<eos> Moving onto a second tank is going to increase your chance of nitrogen narcosis dramatically.<eos> You're going to need to watch each other closely to make sure that neither of you is behaving strangely or hallucinating.
I've got the spare tank.<eos> Kate, get down.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Where is it, Lisa?<eos> It's right above you, don't move.
Alice?<eos> Alice, do you want anything?<eos> Maybe just some fruit.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Come on, you guys have seen it all before, right?
It'll last longer.<eos> I'm not Jewish.<eos> We wouldn't care if you was, mister.<eos> We's former racists.<eos> Good for you.
Among many others.<eos> But this girlfriend of yours, congratulations.<eos> That's good, that's very good.<eos> I mean, after all, you need to feel the feelings before you can write about them.<eos> So I write the card for her and I give it to you.
He's been asking questions again.<eos> That why we're here.<eos> I think he's trying to read my mind.<eos> That's what these are for.<eos> Friends, I have good news for you today!
Right or wrong it is a brand.<eos> A brand sticks.<eos> Now you run on home to your mother and tell her everything is alright.<eos> There are no more guns in the valley.<eos> Who are you guys?
"Why do you look like that?<eos> What's wrong with you?"<eos> You wanna know what's wrong with me?<eos> Nothing. I'm just dandy.<eos> Until of course some asshole like you comes along, and ruins my damn good time.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.<eos> Let me breathe in.<eos> Broke a little sweat there.<eos> First order of business.<eos> Which one of you losers is Agent Gru?
The soup of the day, madame and monsieur.<eos> The gummy bears were my idea.<eos> Looks too good to even eat!<eos> Am I right?<eos> - But I made it for you....
I don't know, this guy, with the mansion and the cars and... all the hair, silky-smooth, luxurious hair.<eos> I feel worse than I did before I came.<eos> Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.<eos> Give him a chance.<eos> Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I catch up on some brother stuff, you girls should go with Fritz.
I feel worse than I did before I came.<eos> Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.<eos> Give him a chance.<eos> Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I catch up on some brother stuff, you girls should go with Fritz.<eos> He has a surprise for you. - Yay!
What are you doing?<eos> Intruders!<eos> Intruders!<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey, you!
No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Get 'em! Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Hey, you! Freeze!
LASER!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look.<eos> I got the girls.<eos> You two go take care of Bratt. Wait.
Haven't I said from day one you two were destined to be BFF's?<eos> This is Katie.<eos> Yes, I've heard about you.<eos> So I'm thinking threesome playdate.<eos> Angie's house, you guys bring the kids.
Cheese, girls.<eos> - Where's the pink marker?<eos> - You haven't told her those stories yet?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Brenda tells me that you guys have been friends for a while.
- Captain.<eos> - Really?<eos> Oooh, well.<eos> Not bad!<eos> The thing is, I've had some experience with you people before, and the main problem I got is you just forget who's in charge.
He's in charge.<eos> - You told her what's going on?<eos> - For the most part. - Hmm.<eos> The girl and gang...<eos> I'm with you.
So, everybody on?<eos> OK!<eos> So, my guys, listen out...<eos> I have spoken to our usual employer, and after tonight's little snuffle, there's now a bonus in place.<eos> If we succeed and the girl dies, each one of you gets an extra $100.000.
I have spoken to our usual employer, and after tonight's little snuffle, there's now a bonus in place.<eos> If we succeed and the girl dies, each one of you gets an extra $100.000.<eos> Here's the problem.<eos> If we fail...<eos> If she lives to see another day... Every last one of you will be hunted down and killed...
But... Right now... There isn't anyone I'd feel safer with.<eos> Let's have a little chat, shall we?<eos> Go.<eos> So, now you're in Clyve's. End of the road, nowhere else to go.<eos> And only a single steel door... separating us from you, so...
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.<eos> I made a vow, remember?<eos> To look after the three of you.
God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm, I'm sorry, my love.'<eos> I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.<eos> Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.<eos> I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
Yes!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey...<eos> Pia's in.<eos> You guys wanna see something funny?
We got it!<eos> Is it hot in here?<eos> Let's get the fuck out of here.<eos> Scotty, we got what we need, please respond.<eos> Will one of you guys try him because he's just not listening to me.
Not just view it digitally.<eos> - Good thinking.<eos> - That's what I do.<eos> That's the way I am.<eos> And you two will help me translate what these writings actually mean if indeed writings is what they are.
Billy, you don't have to yell.<eos> We can hear you, okay?<eos> - (YELLING) Okay!<eos> - (TRINI) Hey!<eos> You guys looking to get busted or something?
(ECHOING) Find anything interesting?<eos> If I do, I'm keeping it!<eos> - We know why you're here.<eos> - (ZACK) Oh, yeah?<eos> You guys wake up surprised to be alive and jump over a house?
Wait, where's the other guy?<eos> One, two, three, four... oh!<eos> There he is.<eos> Oh, no, no, no!<eos> All of you.
You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.<eos> And you must never reveal your identity.<eos> Ever.<eos> To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.<eos> Have any of you morphed before?
(ZORDON) Alpha 5, begin the exercise.<eos> (ALPHA 5) Uh... sorry, guys.<eos> - What exercise?<eos> - Chill out, dude.<eos> (ZORDON) These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita's army.
(HOARSELY) Not a video game.<eos> (ZORDON) This is why you must morph into your armor.<eos> If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army, it'll be the beginning of the end.<eos> Rangers, welcome to training.<eos> - I'm so excited you guys are back.
Everybody just focus!<eos> - (EXCLAIMS) - (PUTTY GROANS)<eos> Lucky shot.<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> You guys all know you could be murdered, right?
I'm sorry, (STAMMERS) he just morphed.<eos> He did it.<eos> You saw it, right?<eos> (ZORDON) Do it again.<eos> All of you.
He did it.<eos> You saw it, right?<eos> (ZORDON) Do it again.<eos> All of you.<eos> Any of you.
Okay, we don't know how.<eos> (ZORDON) That's what I thought.<eos> If you can't morph, you are not rangers.<eos> Go home.<eos> All of you.
(SIGHS)<eos> (ZACK) Hey, guys... guys, look, uh...<eos> I'ma stay up here tonight.<eos> Make a fire.<eos> I got some food if you guys wanna stay.
We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what?<eos> One of you does.
- It must be.<eos> The source of life itself is buried there.<eos> Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.<eos> Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don't kill you.<eos> - At least one of you.
(BOY 2) The blue was the best one.<eos> That's who I wanna be.<eos> (BOY 1) Hey, no, I wanna be the blue one!<eos> (BOY 2) I wanna be blue one.<eos> Hey, how about one of you guys try to be the yellow one?
(ZORDON) This ranger team did what my team could not.<eos> You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.<eos> - Attention!<eos> Attention in detention.<eos> - (ZORDON) Each of your names will be etched alongside the great ranger teams before you.
You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.<eos> - Attention!<eos> Attention in detention.<eos> - (ZORDON) Each of your names will be etched alongside the great ranger teams before you.<eos> I will always owe a debt of gratitude to you all.
SLIVKO:<eos> You hear that, boys?<eos> We're scientists now!<eos> (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)<eos> You guys are not scientists.
Stay tight.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> (GASPS)<eos> SLIVKO Oh!<eos> Behind you!
They never smile.<eos> Did you crash here?<eos> Oh. Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.
- He's still in bed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where's Colleen?<eos> She left.<eos> Can I stay with you guys for a little while longer?
I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.<eos> By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world, you will not remember any of what you've heard.<eos> Ignorance is bliss.<eos> Well, what's wrong with bliss?<eos> Some of you know each other and some of you don't.

Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide! Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height!<eos> On!<eos> On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<eos> And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.<eos> Which I doubt not for there is none of you here so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes!
Yes.<eos> Absolutely, yes.<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals, step by step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington The Poisoner.
- Shot me during a session.<eos> - Only with a tranquilliser. - Hm.<eos> We still had ten minutes to go.<eos> - Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.
Are you all right?<eos> Interesting.<eos> All right, there you go, you got what you wanted, and he's dead.<eos> Dead or alive, he really wasn't very interesting.<eos> But you three, you three were wonderful.
Probably just take it.<eos> There's only one bullet left.<eos> You will only need one.<eos> But you will need it.<eos> Please, go through. There's a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared.
What happened, did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.<eos> You've still got the gun, haven't you?<eos> I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.<eos> Just two of you go on from here.
So cute.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Way to keep your eyes on the prize, Templeton.<eos> We find out what the new puppy is, and I go home.<eos> You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?
Candy corn?<eos> Lollipop!<eos> Deal.<eos> Best boss ever.<eos> And you guys don't always have to toe the company line, you know?
Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.<eos> Either one of you could have gotten us through that field... Had you flown with what's between your ears instead of what's between your legs!
Let's go take a walk.<eos> I am Mantis.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Smiling.<eos> I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Your quarters are this way.<eos> We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.<eos> Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids... I wasn't just gonna hand you over.<eos> You said you were gonna eat me.<eos> That was being funny!<eos> Not to me!<eos> You people have issues.
I'm taking control.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm taking us into the stratosphere.<eos> Excuse me? Yeah, don't worry. She can handle it.<eos> Although I warn you, one of you may need to take over.
See?<eos> You're awesome.<eos> Bro.<eos> She's awesome, man.<eos> Oh, yeah, you guys must've been hilarious when you were young. Must've been?
Whatisgoingon?<eos> Is it Sasha?<eos> Yeah, sh-she's been really sick and scared.<eos> And John's been acting weird.<eos> You guys seemed like you were great.
Hey.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kim, it's Elliot.<eos> Elliot.<eos> Uh, god, I was just thinking about you guys.
II haven't found any Indians.<eos> No, Andy.<eos> It's seven o'clock.<eos> Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof... ruff, ruff...
How's Linda?<eos> She's doing a lot better.<eos> Got the government agencies to finally get one of them electric wheelchairs.<eos> Fuckin' war.<eos> So the government's taking care of you?
- Coming right up. - Excellent.<eos> How is school, Miriam?<eos> The kids this year are so cute.<eos> Okay, here you go.<eos> Keep the change. The tip is for you all.
An interesting fellow.<eos> You Jones?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now let's get to it.<eos> Explain to me exactly what Dougie did to make him owe you money.
We are not wealthy people.<eos> We drive cheap, terrible cars.<eos> We are the 99 percenters.<eos> And we are shit on enough.<eos> And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.
And we are shit on enough.<eos> And we are certainly not gonna be shit on by the likes of you.<eos> Nevertheless, lady...<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> Without my knowledge, my husband came to you for a loan of $20,000.
All right.<eos> You want Chantal to mess with him before I come?<eos> He'll sing for me.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
Sheriff Truman, I'm not here.<eos> I'm on my lunch break.<eos> Oh, Sheriff. Oh.<eos> No lunch in the conference room, Chad.<eos> I know, but... you guys have donuts and coffee in here all the time.
Uh, excuse me?<eos> I was about to...<eos> Push the Bat-Signal? Good call.<eos> I like your instincts.<eos> I've got a surprise for you guys.
- Oh, you don't need to know that.<eos> And I want you to put Joy onto Patel.<eos> She'll be able to close it.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Doesn't it occur to you that I'm doing this all for you?
I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?
She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?
And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.
It's the only takeout I know.<eos> Smells good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the rest of my session just joining the two of you.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.
He'll be here.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're late.<eos> Sorry, everyone. I, uh... had a problem with the elevator.<eos> I know some of you aren't happy with me.
- The idiotic dream of a child.<eos> Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen. I know this isn't what you wanted. Any of you.
You can fight. I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.
Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No. I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.<eos> And over what, huh?<eos> A little money?<eos> I always thought the two of you looked after one another.
Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.<eos> I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know... I wish I'd never come to China with you.
Where are you taking him?<eos> Colleen, what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.
- you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.<eos> You know, they may claim to have loftier ideals, but the Hand are just common criminals with good marketing skills.<eos> You take their money and they'll come running.<eos> You two stake out the compound.
You're screwing everything up.<eos> You need to take control of your passions, Ward.<eos> You'll never be a great leader until you do.<eos> I'm sorry about that, but no one pulls weapons on me.<eos> All of you, please, to the couch.
- No.<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.<eos> I know a good family therapist that could help, should any of you survive the night.
- Let me get her to a hospital.<eos> Danny said he's coming. He will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Two minutes to go.<eos> Maybe Danny's figured, with all of you out of the way, he'll be in charge of Rand.
Marcus: Um, that's very kind, but...<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> You don't have to do this, Josephine.<eos> We just had some food.<eos> Oh, you young ones are always having junk.
Do you not say grace before eating?<eos> Thank you, o lord, for these bounteous gifts received from your table.<eos> In the name of our savior, Jesus Christ, our lord.<eos> Amen.<eos> Do either of you work?
We're both retired.<eos> The extra money from the room comes in very handy for daily things.<eos> Did you take your pills, dear?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Do you guys, um, ever go out anywhere?
Our parents died young so he kind of became my surrogate mum and dad.<eos> I guess I got sidelined along the way.<eos> Mark is my family now.<eos> Family is very important, dear.<eos> How about you two?
We have never found anyone alive before.<eos> What about her?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Help us!<eos> You are meant to help!
They are spread across London.<eos> Same as I will do for Marcus.<eos> But I kept him as a memento, seeing he likes joking so much.<eos> Thought he could keep you company, try and make you laugh.<eos> We prayed every night... and god gave us you.
I don't know shit?<eos> Well, go on, please.<eos> Educate me, man.<eos> Come on, I'm listening.<eos> You Americans you think you know it all.
$11 million!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Murdock.<eos> - Oh, my pleasure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why do these people have a picture of K'un-Lun?<eos> And what else did they know?<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> You guys start over there.
Well, stay off them somewhere else.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You'd be putting the cops in danger.<eos> - I'll put you in danger.
The Hand's done it before.<eos> Pompeii, Chernobyl.<eos> Events the history books like to call catastrophes, just cover-ups.<eos> 'Cause New York is next.<eos> And the only thing keeping Manhattan from crumbling to a pile of dust... is the four of you.
- What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.<eos> The woman on the radio.<eos> They'll come for them next.<eos> How many mice must drown with you?
They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?<eos> How do you suggest we hide him?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.
I don't think I have to answer to you.<eos> But considering the events of the last few hours, I thought it best to keep her isolated.<eos> Because you think we will kill her?<eos> No.<eos> I think she might kill you if she even senses your disloyalty.
Where's Jessica?<eos> They're digging up info on Midland Circle.<eos> We think that's where it all started.<eos> "We"?<eos> As in the rest of you who worked against me?
Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.<eos> By Jessica.<eos> Our Jessica?<eos> Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?
Because from now on, nothing will stand in my way.<eos> Not even death.<eos> - You guys okay?<eos> - I'll live.<eos> I don't suppose either of you snuck a flask in here.
How are we gonna get out of this?<eos> I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> Three of you wanna sit?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> We've had no luck identifying the bodies we found in the warehouse with you.
We've been raised to fight someone else's war.<eos> But you and I, we're the same.<eos> All we want to decide is our own futures.<eos> You sound like your master, Alexandra.<eos> But neither of you know what I want.
It's hard to tell.<eos> The more I think about it, the less I like our odds.<eos> Yeah, well, do like me.<eos> Don't think about it.<eos> If you told me a week ago that I'd be here with you two, about to blow up some building and fight ninjas to save New York...
- Harold, you should really just audio books or...<eos> Emma!<eos> Hey, how how are you?<eos> Yeah, you all packed?<eos> Aw. I know, I really wish we could go with you guys but
There's a girl.<eos> She's coming, okay?<eos> There's a girl... Mandy.<eos> Okay, she's here to stay, all right?<eos> And-and-and you guys have to take my lead because I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me - as me because I'm somebody else.
Uh... Wow.<eos> Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Mm. - But I guess the most important thing is for Brian, Jr. to have a relationship with his father.<eos> And you know, Mac, you seem like a real stand-up fella, so, if you boys are open to it, the only thing I can think of better than Junior having one dad is, well, him having two.
- No.<eos> Who-who just barges into someone's apartment<eos> - and takes over?<eos> - Nobody. Oh, my God, are you serious?<eos> That's exactly what you guys are doing!
He'll smell it in the morning.<eos> Well, then, I'll open the window before I go to bed.<eos> The rain will come in and spoil the new carpet.<eos> How pernickety you are.<eos> I thought you lot worried about things like that.
I did nothing of the sort.<eos> If you had set out to humiliate me, Philip, you really couldn't have got off to a better start!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because now it looks as if I came begging to you!
If Ambrose hadn't been such an idiot, this place would have been your home.<eos> I think I'm the idiot.<eos> I thought coming here would bring him back to life.<eos> I don't know why you came.<eos> I don't know anything about you.
In her room.<eos> It looks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.<eos> Get it straightened up.<eos> All right, come in.<eos> Oh, it's you!
Thank you for a delightful and successful evening, Philip.<eos> Let's hope the dancing doesn't keep you awake all night.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> May I wish you both a very Happy Christmas?<eos> Oh, and you too. Merry, Merry Christmas.
There doesn't appear to be any proviso should Mrs. Ashley marry again.<eos> That's not likely to happen.<eos> But the point should be covered, should it not?<eos> If you insist.<eos> In case of marriage, her property should revert to you. Unless, presumably, you predecease her?
- Yes, I think so.<eos> - I think I should...<eos> - No.<eos> Why don't you ride over tomorrow?<eos> The two of you?
Damn near went in after it.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Rachel.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I've got something for you.
Yeah, well, you drank two tall boys, so there's no great mystery there.<eos> I snuck one on the ferry.<eos> Paula, have you met aggie, rose's fiancé?<eos> And Cody, Katie's fiancé?<eos> Wow, you guys really started early.
Could someone please come to the beach.<eos> Hi.<eos> Honey, I'd like you to meet the sklar family.<eos> My mother elanor, great grandfather marinus, grandmother Anne, and father Warren.<eos> Were any of you down by the beach?
When's din din?<eos> Me and Hank are starving!<eos> And this is my dear brother Henry.<eos> I believe you two have already met.<eos> So they barged in and built their fort, pulled the rug right out from under you?
Locals, if not hired by the government, certainly not discouraged or punished.<eos> We've found persecution wherever we've gone.<eos> It's why we came to America in the first place.<eos> You know about Salem?<eos> That was you?
It is old as anything.<eos> Old as the trees.<eos> Old as the sea.<eos> Blessed.<eos> All of you.
I love you too!<eos> She's gone, gone, gone.<eos> Ran cross country in college.<eos> Probably halfway to the 101 by now.<eos> That's that the flat gray thing that the cars go on, you fucking freaks.
We put fliers announcing the change in everyone's mailbox.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't get one, and I'm not okay with the change.<eos> - Gray is sad.<eos> - Gray is sophisticated, elegant and cool.<eos> Excuse me, either of you know Gus Cruikshank?
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> For how long?<eos> And how much blood?<eos> You kill Santino, the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.<eos> This kingdom is mine and mine alone.<eos> All right.<eos> Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston, while you still can.<eos> And you, its privileges, sir.
Mmm-hmm.<eos> And the Continental?<eos> You killed a man on company grounds, Jonathan.<eos> You leave me no choice but to declare you excommunicado.<eos> The doors to any service or provider in connection with the Continental are now closed to you.
This is really hard to say.<eos> Uh, and forgive me for the timing of this, but, in about 90 days, you're gonna lose everything here.<eos> What?<eos> You all have been in trouble for a very long time and jt did not have the heart to tell you.<eos> The horse market took a downturn in '08, jt refused to sellout, so he leveraged the ranch for you guys to survive.
I need to know what he did right, what he did wrong and what around here is worth saving!<eos> - Now?<eos> - Right now.<eos> We lease this back pasture to a dairy farm for grazing, it brings in a little.<eos> Most of the workers have found jobs elsewhere, a handful have stayed loyal to you.
- Twenty-four hours?<eos> The prison rehabilitation equine program works mostly with inmates incarcerated for non-violent reasons.<eos> Drugs, theft, fraud.<eos> They're more likely to hack into your computer, than hack you to pieces.<eos> Still, we gotta cover ourselves for liability to protect you and us both.
Scottish.<eos> It's Irish if I say it's Irish and if you can't listen to me, you can't hear what these horses have to say and that makes you no damn good to me.<eos> - Got it?<eos> - Got it.<eos> But first you're gonna do chores to get them used to you.
Roll it, roll on that. Roll!<eos> Go!<eos> Listen.<eos> If I gotta go back there...<eos> You guys ain't never coming back to this program!
It rehabilitates the convicts and gets the horses healthy and ready for adoption.<eos> So they all get a second chance.<eos> What I have seen in the last 90 days on my ranch has been magical, and I'm more proud of that than anything I have ever done in my entire life.<eos> So our horses will be auctioned off this weekend at the usa qha regionals.<eos> If any of you are interested in adopting, but let me warn you, they are gorgeous.
This is what our horses looked like 90 days ago.<eos> This is what they look like now.<eos> The truth is, this majestic animal needs our help.<eos> Overpopulation, drought and other factors are leaving thousands of them left to die out in the plains.<eos> Some of you may have heard that headline on a blog or something.
We had chips. this all started 'cause you sent me this in the mail.<eos> I got freaked out.<eos> Well, I sent it to you because I missed you, I wanted to see more of you.<eos> That's all that is?<eos> It's not because you feel trapped in your own home and you guys are fighting too much or whatever it is?
Want to hear more about it? The sci...<eos> Aah!<eos> No nerds!<eos> Fight Milk!<eos> Finally there's a crow-based protein alcoholic drink for you.
Basically, we're trying to expand our product to the world of UFC women, and look, uh, ring girls are the perfect combo. - Really.<eos> I mean, honestly, ladies, you could afford to lose a few pounds, maybe in this area...<eos> - Well...<eos> - or here.<eos> Really, I mean, between the three of you, we could be opening up a bakery with all the muffin tops I'm seeing.
- Now, Fight Milk will help you lose those unwanted pounds so you don't have to resort to surgery, which could cause scarring and make you even less attractive - to men than you already are, okay? - All right.<eos> - Now, I feel like...<eos> - No, no, look, I'm sorry, my friend has really weird women issues.<eos> I didn't realize he brought a laser pointer.<eos> But the point is, you guys could look even better if you drank Fight Milk.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Oh, no, but, no, it's not about that at all.<eos> Yeah, it's about this.<eos> A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney to figure out which of you is entitled to a two-dollar scratcher?
The very foundation upon which this group rests, eh?<eos> - And that hope belongs to me.<eos> It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Each of you will have an opportunity to plead your case.
No, they've just been wandering around the bar, blowing kids, doing whatever they're doing, you know?<eos> - Frank, behind you!<eos> - Is this where we're headed?<eos> Know what I mean... as a society?<eos> Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?
He's swinging by. - Oh, you're dating a stripper.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Wow, gross.<eos> Gross?<eos> If you guys started dating a stripper you'd be bragging about it for days.
Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches, or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Just don't call me Daddy.<eos> Yeah, my generation... we drank our problems away.<eos> But since you softies like to talk about everything, I figured this was a good thing to do.
You're out.<eos> Dishonorable discharge.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Doesn't matter. We're done with you.
Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy?<eos> - Uh, y-yes, it is. Boy speaking.<eos> - Oh. Yeah. Uh, I hear youse are re... rule good.<eos> Well, yeah, that-that is true.<eos> Well, I've got a party for you.
You guys were supposed to give valentine's cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail in a suggestion box covered in hearts.<eos> I'll give it to you, though...<eos> it got a little nasty at the end.<eos> A-A little bit nasty?<eos> One of you put anthrax in the box.
Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings,<eos> - something that Dennis doesn't have.<eos> - Right, that's true.<eos> And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.<eos> But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man - and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,
It's because he doesn't have any feelings and we do.<eos> Yeah, because we have feelings and you don't, and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, stop!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I hate Valentine's Day because you assholes never got me anything!
- With Cricket, you do.<eos> Well, now it's $2.50, Crick, so you want the job or not?<eos> - You know, ticktock.<eos> - Uh, look, guys, um,<eos> I got a new life, so I don't need anything from you.
Have you heard from Christian?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He sent me flowers.<eos> To wish me luck.<eos> Sweetheart, are you ever gonna tell me what happened between you?
Coping together.<eos> Working to make life better for the children... of parents addicted to drugs.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> And now, thankfully, I will be handing off my speaking duties to our master of ceremonies, Mr. nomad Paul.<eos> Paul". Thank you, Mr. grey, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I wanna thank you all for coming here this evening.<eos> I was expecting a small family gathering.<eos> Thanks, Mia.<eos> But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.<eos> As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.
But I'm happy that you're all here because I have an announcement to make.<eos> As most of you know, yesterday ros and I had a narrow escape.<eos> And something like that reminds us of what really matters and how important it is to seize the day.<eos> We should Cherish the people we care about and who care about us.<eos> Mom, dad, I know I haven't always been the perfect son. But I owe everything to you both, so thank you.
Haven't seen her yet. - She doesn't live too far so...<eos> - Well, that's not good.<eos> A woman nearby got attacked?<eos> You know I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> If a woman round here has been attacked, I don't want either of you anywhere alone after dark.
Good morning.<eos> - Mind if I sit in?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Okay, class.<eos> I have a treat for you.
Baby.<eos> Of all the stunts you could pull.<eos> - Where are they going?<eos> - Nowhere. Not yet.<eos> You two, out!
I go where he tells me to go and I do what he tells me to do.<eos> Where I am from, that's called slavery.<eos> I really like her.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Ladies after you.
My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> Diana...<eos> Diana!<eos> All of you should be ashamed!
Friendship ending the war, friendship...<eos> - Okay, You have no money.<eos> - No.<eos> All I want now is a picture of that beautiful face.<eos> You will not need a photo because I'll go with you.
We stand against you and your witch.<eos> Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.
Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> It is over for all of you..
And you're right master...<eos> Blessing will up on us.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm not gonna be spending my evening out here.<eos> You stupid idiots!
- Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.<eos> All of you.
- Hey.<eos> I love you, Claire bear.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - I will bring you Luddites kicking and screaming into the modern age.
Well, you really didn't have to go through all this trouble.<eos> I didn't want to put you out.<eos> - Oh, no, I mean, you're practically family.<eos> I mean, the only family we can stand.<eos> - I thought I should follow up, see how you guys were doing after what happened.
No, no, he didn't.<eos> - Get Mr. merman back to his room.<eos> This time, follow the procedures precisely.<eos> - Yes, sir, come on, Mr. merman.<eos> - Doctor merman to you, you young...
I understand why you hated me, I hate me.<eos> I was your only friend, but I didn't know you were real.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's time to set you free.<eos> - Honestly, I still think you guys could have gotten a higher number, but as long as you're happy.
Mr. Bonanos, can we speak with you for a moment?<eos> Jake.<eos> How you doing, Jake?<eos> I'm fine, thanks.<eos> If it's okay with you guys, I'd like to get straight to the point,
Yeah, well, he did a good job.<eos> Hey, you guys are a lot earlier than I thought.<eos> Yeah, we made great time.<eos> We had a speed demon in the passenger seat.<eos> I'm just finishing up dinner, you guys make yourselves at home.
And we could all be super heroes.<eos> I think we just need to... To take it slow.<eos> You know, I think it's better.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> I made the bed for you guys so I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.
Forces formations mu Serbia is one of the best, But you're asking for something ridiculous,<eos> If I wanted to, you or dead Kseniya, So, you must first die,<eos> And nothing can hold me, You know you need our strength,<eos> But you will not get it,<eos> That's up to you, my friend,
Their destroyed homes, is back again, The government gave the house as well as repairs to damaged homes,<eos> I think silence is golden,<eos> The silence I think is very valuable,<eos> They want to know, you have proof, ,<eos> You guys are awesome, but not only the super powers that make you great,
Not home, land and big city like this,<eos> You're not ready for this,<eos> Wait,<eos> The threat is still unfinished,<eos> What if we need you again?
But it's like you said. How are we gonna make a record out of other records?<eos> Let the labels sort all of that shit out because they gonna pay us $1500 each upfront.<eos> - For real?<eos> - For real.<eos> I got one for each and every one of you to sign right now.
Zeke, it's so good.<eos> Yeah, let's hope that's what the dean says today.<eos> You might forget me around those smart college girls.<eos> You ain't got nothing to worry about.<eos> Our mayor has a message for all you graffiti vandals.
That's all I ever asked.<eos> Stay in school, no drugs, no gangs and no graffiti.<eos> Y'all flying colors now, too?<eos> All we're doing is trying to make music, I swear!<eos> We let you do the music because we trusted you!
- I'm not a pretender.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> Be gone, bitch.<eos> You gotta swing them hips a little harder, make that ass bounce.<eos> I expected trouble from Dizzee. He come out the womb like Hannibal sacking Rome, but the three of you all at once?
♪ You know you got to cross your Rubicon Say, we all came here... ♪<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> I can't even stand the sight of you!<eos> I can't do it for you.
Peace, queen.<eos> A...<eos> A... Assalamu alaikum, my Asiatic black brothers.<eos> Kings of Africa.<eos> Peace be onto you and yours.
And the Glocks from Austria, not the U.S.<eos> Totally untraceable. Nice.<eos> Shotgun's still not answering.<eos> Pull your cell batteries, in case he got pinched.<eos> You two, you ride in the back, since you're both validated.
Come in.<eos> Come in.<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> After you.
That happened at a bachelor party!<eos> They're strippers!<eos> They climb all over you!<eos> You can't stop them!<eos> You guys know!
She sent me out for groceries.<eos> Um, I had to replace the cheese.<eos> Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?<eos> I don't know. I think I just, um, needed... Air.<eos> Yeah, 'cause actually, uh... I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and i have actually been having a lot of problems lately.
What do we do?<eos> No way.<eos> No way.<eos> Come on.<eos> ...fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
Uh-huh. Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice work, guys.<eos> Gary: I love you!<eos> All right, you two.
- Sure, but I didn't have much time with it.<eos> Great news! Jesus!<eos> It's me, it's okay.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here, John?<eos> I have something for you guys.
Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang.<eos> For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.
You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.<eos> I know that you polish off at least half a bottle of Delaney Company Brandy every night.<eos> James...<eos> You could have written to your father just once.<eos> In the end, he was calling for you.
Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like...<eos> It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.
People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.<eos> Two hours.<eos> You...

What do you want?<eos> You think your father's kid feeds himself.<eos> I heard you done a lot of evil over there.<eos> Now it's time for you to do some bleeding good among your own.<eos> Me and my wife have looked after that boy for ten years with not one penny from you and nothing but threats from the mad old bastard you just put in the ground.
And will you be including that in your account to the Royal Commission?<eos> No.<eos> Luckily, I'm not being tried for that today.<eos> - They serve good hock to traitors.<eos> - Perhaps you'll be served the same.
I need to see someone.<eos> From Mr. Delaney.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley!<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley!<eos> I have a message for you, sir, from Mr. Delaney.
Where's the other one?<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - She don't speak, she's in mourning.<eos> I've had a coach drawn up.<eos> You ladies are going on a tour of the grounds.
His mother.<eos> ♪ Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. clements ♪<eos> ♪ You owe me five farthings, say the bells of St. Martin's ♪<eos> ♪ When will you pay me, say the bells of Old Bailey ♪<eos> This just arrived for you, sir.
Come on!<eos> So, erm, now the witness is sewn together... we can begin.<eos> Please confirm that you are James Keziah Delaney... of Chamber House, Wapping Wall, London... lately accused of conspiring with the members of the<eos> Secret Society of Correspondence... against His Majesty The King.<eos> And you have pledged to give us the names of the Americans who conspired with you, and others unnamed, to commit acts of treason within the confines of the City of London.
Mr. Chichester, how goes your investigation?<eos> This will not stand.<eos> Oh, but it will!<eos> It always does.<eos> Delaney would not make a deal with you.
I need to be on the water by high tide.<eos> - You have a ship?<eos> This laudanum is diluted somewhat with burdock, so you can continue to function.<eos> But I doubt you'd be able to steer a ship to America.<eos> You have people with you?
March where?<eos> For what bloody purpose?<eos> For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.<eos> What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?
What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?<eos> Hang it in the meat locker.<eos> Just keep the powder out of the steam.<eos> Bloody madhouse again!<eos> While we're on the subject of housekeeping, I mean to have a word with you about food.
I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.
The son does not inherit the debts of the father.<eos> James Delaney has declared a new trading company in his own name.<eos> And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.
I can wait.<eos> But Mr Delaney's son knew nothing of any marriage.<eos> How would he?<eos> He was in Africa.<eos> But he often spoke of you. He was very, very proud.
No, the river will take him of its own accord.<eos> Here.<eos> Thoyt, sit down.<eos> So, gentlemen... tell us of this widow.<eos> Can none of you read?
Thoyt, sit down.<eos> So, gentlemen... tell us of this widow.<eos> Can none of you read?<eos> Or are you all too busy trying to catch my eye and only pretending to read the agenda before stretching your necks again?<eos> You, what's your name?
There are no practical difficulties.<eos> Apart from that great big river that connects us.<eos> Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.
Did you really eat flesh?<eos> Why don't you tell your friends that you're sick and you can come and hear everything?<eos> I would laugh at you, but you're not well.<eos> And I can't stand to have you this close to me...<eos> Because I will always be this close to you.
All the tea in China.<eos> As Horace Delaney's widow, I also own half of the trading post at Nootka Sound.<eos> And I believe Nootka is of value to the King.<eos> If you are in contact with the King, then you are already in grave danger.<eos> I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried.
You will not be granted a licence to purchase.<eos> Your name is already on a blacklist.<eos> You will not get a single grain anywhere in England.<eos> So, now... is the game up?<eos> When they speak of you, there is such hatred now.
Wait!<eos> I wrote a fucking book about chemistry. If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.<eos> I already did. I was very impressed.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I have a use for you.
In the cell, I called you "James".<eos> I think that surprised them most.<eos> Certainly surprised me.<eos> If your intervention had been ten minutes later, I would have been raped.<eos> But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?
By the way, I found your red roses in the mud when I threw out the oyster shells.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.<eos> Countess Musgrove is, let me think, sir... 1,550 places above you in the social hierarchy of London.
I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that.<eos> Yes, I might have a use for that, actually.<eos> You may need to bring a couple of girls to the Dolphin with you.
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.
And besides, Carlsbad said to say that you can have her.<eos> You can have her as part of the deal.<eos> Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.
So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.<eos> But look, if you don't want to deal with the obstacle, we can certainly take care of that for you.
I've only not known James a little while.<eos> But I have the feeling you've not known him a little longer.<eos> We were children...<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I were to have intentions regarding James, would I need to be wary of you?
And a chimpanzee.<eos> In the absence of a chimpanzee, a gorilla will have to do.<eos> Please, madam, please, sir, take a deep breath... and step into the beyond.<eos> One wonders if they will ever be seen again!<eos> I did my research on you.
Good morning.<eos> The Gypsy woman owns this island between two parishes.<eos> It is tradition she offers duellists a little token of good luck. Three shillings each for heather and goose feathers.<eos> This is not a fairground.<eos> Gentlemen, a slight has been perceived and one of you seeks satisfaction.
Search the boat. Come on!<eos> Get them off!<eos> Come on!<eos> Check below.<eos> You, check the bilges.
You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you? Now.<eos> Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.
Your apprentice.<eos> Lick.<eos> Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.
Lick your finger.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before I go on the subject of confidence... and betrayal, I hear that the Company are offering £10 for any information.<eos> I also know that one of you has already considered collecting.<eos> Let me be very clear.<eos> I know which one of you it is.
Be careful.<eos> Making gunpowder and being careful are good bedfellows.<eos> What?<eos> What do you see?<eos> He's just scared of you.
Steady as we go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> No!<eos> The letters your father wrote to you are beautiful.
As in your premonition.<eos> The French, blew Mauritius almost in half.<eos> And where do we get this chlorate?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You need to ask a far more important question, which is, where will you get a chemist insane enough to work for you if you decide to add fucking chlorate to these vats?
For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.
The-The-The Influence? Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?
Accept what?<eos> Nootka landing ground in return for the tea trade to Canton.<eos> And safe passage through your blockade.<eos> But you must assign the treaty before you leave London.<eos> Well, that would require me to trust you.
And yet, you have so much to tell.<eos> We need some more coal for my fireplace. It's freezing!<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> This is the Delaney household. We have no warmth here.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley is not a suitable man for you.
She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.
How, how did he know?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Very well.<eos> We will allow him to think he is one step ahead... while we exploit what is undefended.<eos> And to you, your church on Earth and in Heaven, we offer honour and glory, now and for ever.
I received a message that you wished to speak with me.<eos> After you have eluded me so long.<eos> May I sit?<eos> I need to know why you're seeking me?<eos> First, I must tell you that I already know many things about you.
In gold.<eos> And silver.<eos> And you're a British citizen?<eos> German by birth, British by marriage.<eos> And you?
And when you have taken your shot, I'd like to talk to you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> You should know that I have testimony from a reliable witness...<eos> I've told you, I have nothing to say to you.<eos> ...someone who will swear on oath that it was you who organised the loading of human cargo onto the Cornwallis bound for Antigua.
My God, look at you.<eos> Well, your plan worked... you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have a use for you.
Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.<eos> And what exactly is it that my father owed you?
The silver tooth is mine.<eos> Who has a blade for the dentistry?<eos> Relax, Mr. Delaney.<eos> You're in safe hands.<eos> Your devil saved you.
And like a wolf you tore out his heart, and then threw him into the river.<eos> And down he floats... directly into Winter's arms.<eos> So I cut out your spoils.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's for you.
I was told the details of your situation by a representative of his Majesty The King, George.<eos> And indirectly it was the King who financed the drawing up of that very expensive piece of paper, which you just burnt.<eos> As a rule, the King's council very rarely makes business with an actress unless it's up the back alley of Maiden Lane.<eos> The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.
The piece of paper you just burnt also states that, as Horace Delaney's widow,<eos> I also own half the trading post at Nootka Sound and I believe Nootka is of value to you and to the King.<eos> So, as you can see, it's a very simple swap, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your half of the house for my half of a piece of land that I have no interest in or use for.<eos> I also have a trunk full of your father's belongings, letters to you, to your father from your mother.
The price was two sovereigns.<eos> I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.
Dougie?<eos> I love you.<eos> Dougie.<eos> And the fucks are at it again!<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help!
Daddy! Daddy!<eos> Daddy! Daddy!<eos> It's seven o'clock.<eos> Do you know where your freedom is?<eos> Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof...
And the fucks are at it again!<eos> These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.
Our new favorite insurance agency!<eos> Oh, my, God, Battling Bud, you're the man!<eos> Looks like you boys made quite a night of it.
Thanks.<eos> We're gonna check it out, though. I'll tell you that.<eos> I'll go bring your dinner, Ed.<eos> You want me to move to another booth?<eos> So you guys can...?
You guys. It's beautiful.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a kegger.<eos> - Well, me too.<eos> - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...
- Well, me too.<eos> - My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...<eos> 'Cause that would be weird.<eos> We thought we'd spent a night in Provence with you guys.
Yeah.<eos> - You look so beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> My God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just... I'm so happy to be here with all of you.
- Thank you.<eos> My God, are you crying too?<eos> I'm just... I'm so happy to be here with all of you.<eos> Celebrating you, Aria.<eos> Well, I couldn't have imagined this day without you guys.
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.<eos> Those boys, they need me.<eos> I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.<eos> But you boys are at the coal face.<eos> After all the blah, blah, blah, you boys are where it actually happens.
We got tonight free, right?<eos> Then what's the plan?<eos> We're drinking. Tell me we're fucking drinking.<eos> Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so... I'm taking her to dinner.<eos> Just the two of you?
We're gonna lose guys.<eos> I am not gonna lie to you about that.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!
But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!<eos> I have faith in you!<eos> I know who you are!<eos> You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known.<eos> Carry that knowledge with you!
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?<eos> I need ANA guys going in first.<eos> Trey!<eos> You take those first two guys with you.<eos> You two, up!
Guys, guys... Is this really that bad?<eos> I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure. But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?<eos> It's hip.<eos> And you guys...<eos> You guys are the operators.
- You knew Andy Warhol?<eos> - Yeah, why can't I know Andy Warhol?<eos> Blondie introduced us.<eos> All right, that... just... just stop it.<eos> I'm telling you, you guys are the least interesting people I know. Aww.
And, like, I look at you, and you're so beautiful.<eos> - That's true. - Stop. And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.<eos> You are, and so are you, and...<eos> I agree.<eos> You guys are just right.
I'll leave it at that.<eos> Tick-tick-tick.<eos> Could she put a shirt on?<eos> Boom.<eos> Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family.
- Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - And me.<eos> - And you guys.
Honey. It's okay.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> How can you not wanna make up on this song? Come on.<eos> Make up, yes, not make out, silly.<eos> It's what you guys do when you get mad at each other.
Tony, this is my father.<eos> Tony. David.<eos> We've heard all about you, Tony.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you two lovebirds home.
Good morning, gentlemen.<eos> I trust that you had good holidays, but time and tide tarry for no man.<eos> So...<eos> Henry viii.<eos> Which of you bright young things can give me a characterization of the age, hmm?
Do you know him?<eos> Not really.<eos> Young Alex: Not personally.<eos> I'm really sick of staring at wood paneling.<eos> I'm sorry to report that I have some rather sad news which I wish to share with you all this morning.
Certainly will.<eos> Don't let it get to you, old bean.<eos> Insightful as always.<eos> Alex:<eos> Henry viii. Now which one of you young bright things can offer characterization of the age? Simpson?
Nice meeting you, Adrian.<eos> They're brilliant.<eos> Really brilliant.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> And you.
- No, stop it.<eos> Don't you disobey your mother!<eos> Or what, you're gonna take me over your knee?<eos> - Yes, I just might...<eos> - Stop it, both of you!
God and the savior versus atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair.<eos> Madalyn, what exactly is it that you have against God?<eos> First off, there isn't any.<eos> And second off, your God manifests itself through organized churches, your organized movement.<eos> And every single one of them, including you, is always interested in money.
You know... if somebody did something to them... it's probably someone from that place.<eos> My mother pissed off a lot of people.<eos> Especially those she was closest to.<eos> Uh, excuse me, uh...<eos> I just want to say American Atheists has had a wonderful year, and... that would not be so without all of you.
What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?<eos> You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.
I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.<eos> You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.<eos> I love you two.<eos> Everything I've ever done, I... I've done for you kids.
Yes, I'm threatening you.<eos> What are you gonna do about it?<eos> This is what I'm gonna do about it.<eos> I'm gonna use my free speech to make sure the kids of this town don't end up degenerated like the mayor.<eos> You people talk and talk and do nothing!
This is what I'm gonna do about it.<eos> I'm gonna use my free...<eos> Shut that off, and do your homework!<eos> Degenerated like the mayor.<eos> You people talk and talk and do nothing!
Boy Scouts of America.<eos> Solomon, you know you're grounded.<eos> Get inside.<eos> Guys, I have to go.<eos> None of you confessed?
Being an adult doesn't mean that you suddenly have the answers to everything.<eos> What do you think I should tell him?<eos> That you love him.<eos> Start there.<eos> I'm gonna be such a better parent than you guys, just FYI.
And with that said, um... the first at the open mike is...<eos> Diwata Jones.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Diwata Jones.<eos> Though some of you might know me as Sister Berthe from sophomore year's production of The Sound of Music.
Are you guys students here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We've been hearing there have been some issues with teachers. Censorship.<eos> And a play was rewritten without the author's permission.<eos> Do you guys know anything about that?
So the demi god can see the problem of people. When the future king goes out, so he finds out the problem of poeple. That old man ate my brain telling me stories.<eos> You're so amazing In this age.<eos> You've not seen yet.<eos> In those days the girls never blinks when I play with the sword.<eos> This castle Is being build for you
They've been riding the storm and taking souls since long before I was born.<eos> Yeah, we won't survive them.<eos> Not without your help.<eos> Kira entrusted me with her sword while she's with the Skinwalkers.<eos> And now, I'm trusting you because I believe she would want me to.
- Bait?<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I'm faster than you.<eos> As soon as Hayden's out, Scott and Liam, you guys close the gates, and then I'll put down a barrier of Mountain Ash.
He wasn't just remembering someone. He was remembering his son.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott, can you hear me?<eos> Listen, I remember something.<eos> At the start of the year, Stiles was trying to find a place for you guys to live after graduation.
And I remember saying something to Stiles.<eos> Something like it's not always a good idea to live with your friends.<eos> Even your best friend.<eos> But Stiles said it wouldn't matter because you weren't just friends.<eos> You guys were more like brothers.
Find something else. I heard you almost got killed. I hate this.<eos> Malia.<eos> I gotta leave for a few, okay?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Whatever's happening, it's worse for you guys.
Which is why I think it should be you.<eos> I won't last two minutes in there.<eos> Then think of something else.<eos> Malia's right. It's all about the connection.<eos> When I was remembering him, I was also remembering the two of you together.
Too much?<eos> I got one.<eos> What's that?<eos> An induction script.<eos> One of you is going to talk me through this.
And Theo's not in it.<eos> But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack. But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.
She's playing us.<eos> She has no reason to play us.<eos> She's already won.<eos> So, this what we're doing now? We're working for criminals?<eos> I don't know about you guys,
You guys are pros.<eos> Independent contractors.<eos> Artisans, really.<eos> The best con men in the business.<eos> Which is why I can't trust you.
Now... I made this just for you.<eos> Keep staring, you'll blow his cover.<eos> Is that why you showed up,<eos> To make sure we don't succeed without you?<eos> I am responsible for you two.
- Sorry.<eos> - No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Someone's still trying to kill you.<eos> Yes, and they hired The Hammer to do it, so as long as he stays on my payroll, I'm safe, unless, of course, I need to worry about whatever is going on with the two of you.
- No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Someone's still trying to kill you.<eos> Yes, and they hired The Hammer to do it, so as long as he stays on my payroll, I'm safe, unless, of course, I need to worry about whatever is going on with the two of you.<eos> What is going on with you two?
You are trespass.<eos> Excuse me, I don't know how I got here.<eos> If you could just point me to the nearest road... look, I could... I could just get a ride from there.<eos> Please?<eos> You... y-y-you found her.
Ojo said the girl went round the pass.<eos> Ojo was lying.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.<eos> Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
How long have you been saving that?<eos> A few miles.<eos> I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.<eos> Show of strength.<eos> But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
It's just an herbal remedy.<eos> What kind of witch are you?<eos> I'm not.<eos> But I get that a lot here.<eos> And you?
I don't remember anything.<eos> Liar!<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> When I found him in Nimbo, he was barely alive.<eos> So it was you.
You have no idea what you've done!<eos> He's free.<eos> I... was... protecting... im!<eos> I was saving him!<eos> You... aah!
You're here for a few days, you're contradicting my most talented councilwoman.<eos> Second most talented.<eos> And there's no need for an autopsy to determine where these women came from.<eos> Mistress West.<eos> The Wizard of Oz has demanded an audience with you.
Stoked a fire.<eos> But running off like he did is a blood crime,<eos> Mistress-New-Mistress.<eos> Running off is a blood crime. Understand?<eos> Mistress never spoke of you.
I am a Cardinal Witch.<eos> The last of our kind.<eos> I have powers you can't even fathom.<eos> And I own a run-down brothel.<eos> Because I hate magic even more than you.
I'm a killer.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Captain!<eos> If you let me join your brigade,<eos> I'll kill for you.
- You're welcome.<eos> Sylvie!<eos> They found you.<eos> The butcher said he saw someone taking her 'round.<eos> Has she been with you long?
Let's get you some proper food and a warm bath.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll come with you.
Full circle.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> Your new world awaits.<eos> I knew it was you.
Here.<eos> Your new world awaits.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> In the water.<eos> I knew it was you the whole time.
Magic strong enough to kill a witch.<eos> What is it?<eos> A bullet more powerful than magic.<eos> Sylvie, did you do this?<eos> Can I count on you to build my arsenal?
Dorothy's reunion with the soldier.<eos> Did it reveal anything new?<eos> You knew it wouldn't.<eos> Yet you let her see him anyway.<eos> What sway does she have over you?
He's here.<eos> I heard him. Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.<eos> I'm sorry, Father, I'll... I'll come and help you find him.<eos> You know I'm always here for you.
But Glinda, she watched the last of the witches get slaughtered by The Beast.<eos> What good would new ones be?<eos> Sober up, you fool!<eos> She's not going to use them against the beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
She's going to use them against you.<eos> What did you think Glinda would do?<eos> You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't.<eos> And now they're going to take Emerald City from you!<eos> They are going to take Oz from you with the very elements you outlawed!
Can I count on you to build my arsenal?<eos> The Mother Witch lives and breathes for Glinda!<eos> I saw young Witches.<eos> She's not going to use them against The Beast.<eos> She's going to use them against you.
Nearly all of them.<eos> She sent them to die against The Beast Forever.<eos> And I helped her.<eos> I killed them too.<eos> I won't help either of you repeat the past.
Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...<eos> All of you...
I will return with all the soldiers of Ev, and we will turn your Emerald City red with blood.<eos> Make these guns.<eos> We take them to war.<eos> A war on magic!<eos> I should be coming with you.
This... this... this skin... It's the only thing that was ever really mine.<eos> Tip.<eos> Yeah, I know, I'm trespass.<eos> I remember.<eos> I don't want trouble with any of you.
No, Jack...<eos> - No!<eos> - So is she!<eos> Jack!<eos> Because we are fair, you will hear the charges against you before you are sentenced.
Only a witch can kill a witch.<eos> Those guns...<eos> No, those guns are supposed to kill The Beast Forever.<eos> We are not The Beast Forever, you fool.<eos> If not you, then what?
Is what over?<eos> You looked into my mother's eyes and you said a great war lay ahead of us,<eos> one in which pirates and slaves would stand together and strike a blow that might shake the very foundation of the British Empire.<eos> Now our ships are gone, our army is fractured, battered, and beaten.<eos> And the only man among you I trusted is dead.
- May I suggest...<eos> - I thank you for your aid today.<eos> It is, I believe, to be expected, today, tomorrow, every day till the war is won.<eos> That is the burden that we all ought to share.<eos> I serve you best, my Lord, when I am seen by the street as having some independence from you, as your silent partner, I am able...
My government will hear about this.<eos> The Russians are burning a path from the east and they'll be here soon.<eos> Let's see how you fare with them, Dr. Woodruff.<eos> They're savages.<eos> You Americans and Europeans, whether you come here to help or to fight or to make a profit, you'll never be anything but insignificant.
- Just leave me alone!<eos> - What are they going to do?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> - Who are they?<eos> ! Heroes, not collaborators, like you lot!
_ _<eos> If there's any explaining to be done, then you'll do it.<eos> You're playing a dangerous game, Superintendent.<eos> Not nearly as dangerous as the one you're playing.<eos> If I submit a full report about young Spode's murder this afternoon, the German C-in-C of Great Britain will likely find it very healthy to distance himself from you, as will your colleagues in Berlin.
Draw a pistol and keep your wits about you.<eos> - What are they going to do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - Heroes, not collaborators like you lot!
Arthur will take you half the way, then another car will take you on.<eos> It's all arranged.<eos> You're going to go and spend some time with Uncle Harry's cousin.<eos> Get some fresh air and a taste for the country.<eos> I wish I could come with you.
My guess is that it's verbal and that some smart kid has found his weak spot.<eos> He also brought up his father, who, believe it or not, he thinks might be Darth Vader.<eos> What?<eos> Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality. And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.
Wonderful!<eos> This is the indoor staff.<eos> Good heavens!<eos> Fifty and something, I believe.<eos> On behalf of you all... I'd like to welcome the incoming Viceroy and his family.
Oi, Mohsin bhai.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> He's my friend.<eos> You Punjabis always look after your own.<eos> - You Bengalis... - Hey!
- Your Excellency...<eos> - I know how grave the situation is.<eos> I'm meeting the leaders and all the maharajas, who of course have their own fears about what a transfer of power will bring.<eos> There is a great deal to do.<eos> I want to hear from all of you.
- Gentlemen!<eos> Whatever is going on in those rooms upstairs is none of your business.<eos> It's 5.45.<eos> Dinner is now running late.<eos> All of you, jaldi, jaldi.
They have large Hindu and Sikh populations.<eos> Then we must divide the two provinces between the two countries.<eos> Half of the Punjab and Bengal to India, the other half to Pakistan.<eos> Partition.<eos> And which god among you decides where the border falls?
Pakistan will come to be.<eos> Ah, Allah be praised.<eos> - Pakistan Zindabad.<eos> - Our Pakistan.<eos> Mohsin, our sisters are all in hiding because of you animals.
He can only hope that the Viceroy will find a solution.<eos> With communal fighting increasing in violence, especially in the Punjab, the task of handing over is obviously a tremendous problem.<eos> Curfews have been imposed in Lahore and Calcutta, and large areas of Bengal and the Punjab remain unsafe.<eos> Rawalpindi and its surrounding villages are in a critical state.<eos> We know that some of you have families in these areas.

We must ensure we can be proud of what we say.<eos> In less than 30 days now, India will be divided.<eos> The partition council has agreed that the national assets and debt will be apportioned 80% to India and 20% to Pakistan.<eos> We will be following that same formula in this great house.<eos> Finally... and I am sorry to say this... each one of you must choose which country will have your allegiance, India... or Pakistan.
There is a calculable transformation in the real world, and solely because someone was there to watch it.<eos> Which may account for the fact that I have become significantly sweatier once I've noticed the mysterious stranger watching me from the back of the room.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Go get drunk.<eos> Hey, I remember you guys from...
So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida,<eos> they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> Hello!<eos> It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.
Which is...<eos> For Christ's sake.<eos> Praise the Lords, please help yourself and those less fortunate to the buffet.<eos> I got plenty of honey ham.<eos> But for those of you that do not partake of pork...
Selfish reasons.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.<eos> Colleague to colleague?<eos> You all think I'm like you. I am not like you.
Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.<eos> Colleague to colleague?<eos> You all think I'm like you. I am not like you.<eos> You, I'm particularly not like.
- Some dickhead. - Yeah.<eos> Coward.<eos> Foetus face!<eos> What is it about your Cinammon, mate? Come on-- tell us!<eos> I'm not completely sucked in like you guys think.
Yeah, It was your flash.<eos> That's what set him off.<eos> How is he doing?<eos> - Much better.<eos> I imagine that I... owe you all an apology.
Take care.<eos> Where are you guys going?<eos> South.<eos> Rain's coming. It sucks out here without a tarp.<eos> Well, maybe I can go with you, maybe I can join your troupe.
He sent you, right?<eos> Rainer wants you to turn down "Locked."<eos> If they make me an offer, I'm taking it.<eos> Do you really think that's a good idea?<eos> You guys can't even be in the same room together.
'Big day for you.'<eos> Get any sleep?<eos> Um, a little. After Cassie finally stopped talking.<eos> She's excited for you. So am I.<eos> I really don't know what I'd do without you guys.
'I'll send a car.'<eos> Wow!<eos> Uh... that's so sweet of you actually but, you know, my friends just put on their very first play and, um, I'm gonna be celebrating with them tonight.<eos> So let's make it a party.<eos> I mean, I'm not going without you.
Finally, he's here.<eos> And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.<eos> We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.<eos> It's just one long, drawn-out middle.<eos> Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.
Okay, thank you, Toby.<eos> Thank you, my boy.<eos> Well, hello to you all.<eos> As always, it's a pleasure.<eos> When you all first got here, you...
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't need these.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> If any of you idiots... think of taking this to the cops, let me remind you that I am me and you are you, right?
Thanks, but no.<eos> My chariot awaits.<eos> Bye, Clay.<eos> See you, Justin.<eos> You guys go.
In fact, it ruined just about everything... as you'll soon see.<eos> And stick around, Justin.<eos> I'm not through with you yet.<eos> I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.<eos> In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
Where the hell is Justin?<eos> I don't know, Jess.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.<eos> Did he ride with you guys today?
But what happened to Justin?<eos> Why isn't he here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mr. Porter pulled him in yesterday, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.<eos> Is everything okay with you guys?
Yeah.<eos> Females!<eos> Male!<eos> I have concluded that this school sucks!<eos> Except for you guys.
I'll shoot in his spot.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> The butterfly effect.<eos> It started with Justin, then on to you, Alex.<eos> And the rest of you.
- Yeah.<eos> That can happen, can't it?<eos> What are you trying to do?<eos> Anything.<eos> I'm trying to do something, anything, which is more than any of you did.
The Jeep's not a hundred years old.<eos> It's not even paid off yet.<eos> Why don't you take the station wagon?<eos> 'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.
Come dance with us.<eos> Well, hello there, ladies.<eos> So, are we gonna be seeing an encore presentation tonight, or what?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna try and tell me that these babes right here aren't you guys?
Man, I'm so fucking calm.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - You think I'm scared of you? - You should be.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> How many of you remember the Oh My Dollar Valentines?
Marcus Cole, presiding.<eos> Courtney Crimsen, recording secretary.<eos> All members present.<eos> Petitioners, please state your names.<eos> That's you, guys.
It's my fault.<eos> Goddamn it, hey!<eos> Watch your language!<eos> I'm taking some fucking responsibility.<eos> Since you guys can't.
Well, you do, you look really good.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, I want to play!<eos> Scoot over, Clay.<eos> I don't think there's any... room. Whoa.<eos> Are you guys playing?
But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
Are you with Bryce?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We're hanging out at his place.<eos> Tell him to get over here!<eos> Who else is there? Is anyone else there with you?
I bet you went down on him.<eos> Sometimes it's better to wait.<eos> I mean, you made the hot list.<eos> They said you had the best...<eos> I hear you two like a guy between you.
We need to stop texting.<eos> Seriously, if they get our text records, we're done.<eos> Oh, my God, I didn't even think about that.<eos> Spread the word, we all need to meet in person.<eos> Did you guys get subpoenas too? Shut up!
Just relax, just relax.<eos> We'll go nice and easy. But if you're not lucky, you die a little bit...<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> ...over and over... until you realize it's too late.<eos> I know some of you might think there was more I could have done, or should have done.
I can have that for you... His door is closed behind me.<eos> Yes, sir. - But you didn't.<eos> He's not coming.<eos> I think I've made myself very clear... but no one's coming forward to stop me.<eos> Some of you care.
So, let us assume that the measuring of you and your proposal are done... and that we are partners... in a venture to acquire and reform Nassau.
Well, maybe he only has enough blood for one of his heads, and we both know which one he follows.<eos> Come on, I'm pretty sure Emma's gone on to one of the other rooms.<eos> - Can I stay in here a while?<eos> - Yeah, that's fine.<eos> If you guys wanna follow me, just a bit further down the hall, we've got another pronounced cold spot.
- Oh my god, okay.<eos> - Sophia!<eos> Shit.<eos> Alright, I'll go find her and check the fuses.<eos> You guys just stay...
- No, I didn't.<eos> - Belle.<eos> - I killed belle's boyfriend.<eos> When she opened the door, I saw my chance to get to you.<eos> Belle has the same color eyes as me, so none of you realized I was in her.
Just...<eos> Come outside.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey. So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.
What's going on?<eos> Hey. So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.<eos> And I owe my life to you all, twice over.<eos> A bunch of us do.<eos> Enid says that you want Gregory to get us to fight the Saviors with you.
So do you, I guess.<eos> Chop-chop.<eos> And, Rick... if Daryl does turn up here two days from now, two months from now... hell, two years from now, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.<eos> Keep that hatchet handy.<eos> You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.
Do you want a massage?<eos> Negan loves them.<eos> And I was a licensed therapist.<eos> You know, before.<eos> While I appreciate the gesture and your commitment to your assigned objective, I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening of your own volition.
I like waiting to hear bad news less.<eos> We got a little problem that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.<eos> Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.<eos> We have to cut and burn everything before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.<eos> I know the royal garden is important to you.
- Then I'll go, too.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> No.<eos> The Hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.<eos> Maggie needs you.
Tequila.<eos> Mental note. Locked.<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, no need to talk. This is hopefully a quick visit.<eos> Oh. Well, what can I do for you?
Eugene, get up.<eos> We're breaking you out.<eos> Eugene!<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Everybody stay calm.<eos> We don't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> Stay down and listen to what we say.<eos> We want this to go as simply and as peacefully as possible.<eos> All of you can make it that way.
Just talk to them, okay?<eos> It's not over!<eos> They've forgotten.<eos> You've all forgotten.<eos> Some of you actually want to fight them?
I have to remind you!<eos> Yes.<eos> I am gonna do this, and then I'm gonna die.<eos> But it's that important.<eos> This is your life, all of you.
Yeah, we do.<eos> It's not just the ones I killed.<eos> I think about the people I didn't kill, too.<eos> We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.<eos> I-I want to go with you.
But Eugene?<eos> He's one of yours.<eos> And after what he did...<eos> He stepped up.<eos> You people... are animals.
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.<eos> You guys gotta like Sasha.<eos> I do, too.<eos> Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.<eos> Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
Daryl...<eos> Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.<eos> I see you.<eos> And the pool table and all the pool cues and chalk.<eos> And I want it now or Sasha dies, and then all of you.
He put himself in danger for you.<eos> And that started it all...<eos> From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm, to the prison, to here... to this moment now... not as strangers... as family... because Glenn chose to be there for you that day a long time ago.<eos> That was the decision that changed everything.<eos> It started with both of you, and it just grew... to all of us... to sacrifice for each other... to suffer and stand, to grieve, to give, to love, to live... to fight for each other.
Like any professional fighter, I want to be paid market value, so we're gonna be testing the limits of that.<eos> But listen. No...<eos> No... No disrespect. II've enjoyed my time here.<eos> Thank you guys so much.<eos> It's been a privilege and an honor to fight in front of you.
You guys need anything, don't hesitate.<eos> I'm at your disposal. Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take care, guys.<eos> Looking forward to working with you, all right?
Everything good?<eos> He asked to be paid in cash.<eos> I bet you he has an exwife.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Do all you guys think this way?
II don't care.<eos> You're all getting tested every two weeks.<eos> You girls have to think about your life after this.<eos> If you get something, nobody's gonna want you. Okay?<eos> Now... You two, you two have a cam show at 5?
That's all they paid for, that's all they get.<eos> If they try get you to stay longer, tell them no.<eos> We've shot here before. They're cool. I'm not finished.<eos> They try to ask you to do something you're not comfortable with, politely tell them to fuck right off and call me.<eos> They did not buy the right to do anything they want to you.
Just... But don't lie to me.<eos> You should ask her.<eos> I'm asking you, man to man.<eos> Something happen?<eos> I didn't know about you guys.
[Clears throat] This chicken's perfect, man.<eos> It's exactly how I like it... zero moisture.<eos> - Cuttin' weight sucks.<eos> It's not about cuttin' weight. It's about eatin' clean.<eos> You fucking goats - should try it sometime.
What are we gonna do? !<eos> You know he's coming for us.<eos> All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage.<eos> Obviously, I get her.<eos> You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.
Not that family means anything!<eos> This family does.<eos> All right.<eos> Good job, champ.<eos> Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?
And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were... Quote mode...<eos> "staying together for the kids."<eos> End quote mode.<eos> "Quote mode." I like that.<eos> You millennials.
"staying together for the kids."<eos> End quote mode.<eos> "Quote mode." I like that.<eos> You millennials.<eos> Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?
I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic.<eos> I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them.<eos> I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.<eos> you. - Mom!<eos> - Mom! both of you, too.
Did he say he never forgets a kid?<eos> You mean two for two, right, Vance?<eos> Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.<eos> So this is... Vindicators Three?<eos> And you guys did Vindicators Two... without us?
You came here and defeated our arch nemesis... while so drunk you don't remember doing it?<eos> That's something "obvious" to you?<eos> Look, I'm a lit...<eos> little more complex than you guys, and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.<eos> So I thought, why not just do your job for you, so we can have a little fun game.
I figured it out.<eos> - Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.
- Congrats!<eos> - You did it it!<eos> It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.
It was a bit.<eos> All of the descriptors apply to all of you.<eos> Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.<eos> That's always his point.<eos> Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then we'll deal with the two of you.
Let's say... you have to hit... five three pointers in... five minutes... or...<eos> I don't know, the whole place... the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb.<eos> And try to make it a-a lesson about... yourselves, like... like how selfish you are... Are or something.<eos> And also Hawaii.<eos> You guys hit the baskets, I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.
You two make quite a team.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, I guess...<eos> That's a three pointer.<eos> But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.<eos> I mean, really unspoken.<eos> Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband unspoken.<eos> We aren't married anymore, Alan.<eos> Sure, but were we married when you two were "stranded" on Delphi Six for three days?
Vance that guy, that guy sucks<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yo...<eos> I can't believe we're getting Gear Cream with a Vindicator.<eos> So, you girls in Gear college or Gear...
In a matter of hours, the governor and his wife will set sail from here aboard separate vessels to seek aid in our efforts.<eos> He to Port Royal, she to Philadelphia.<eos> I alone am to be left in charge of Nassau's security.<eos> And I gave our lord governor my solemn oath that I would see it protected... against any and all enemies.<eos> I look forward very much to be working with you to that end.
I think she's just wanting us to have some bonding time.<eos> Teenagers.<eos> Oh, she's been probably working on her secret project.<eos> I'm so curious.<eos> Do you guys know what that is? - Mm-hmm.
You stay for them."<eos> And now I have to leave.<eos> I have to leave for them, and you know I do.<eos> Ready for the big night?<eos> You guys look...
Join me.<eos> Signed, Long John Silver."<eos> You heard him.<eos> The time is now.<eos> Who among you would like to lend his efforts to Long John Silver and resist me?
It would help if Nassau knew I was coming.<eos> Can you see to it?<eos> Of course.<eos> [ sighs ] I don't make this request lightly.<eos> But after everything Max has done for the council, for you, it seems like a moment when she's owed something back.
Mr. Gary Busey's coming back from heaven on the 14th.<eos> How is he gonna know where to land?<eos> All right.<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna let you keep Gary up there, but you guys have to be my deputies.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... I don't think that a ten-year loan would be prudent at this time.<eos> For our bank.<eos> With you.
Oh, really?<eos> Which one spoke to you?<eos> The... second least expensive one.<eos> Uh-huh. And Mitch is so sad he's missing this, he said to get one to bring home.<eos> Oh, cut the crap, you two.
The... second least expensive one.<eos> Uh-huh. And Mitch is so sad he's missing this, he said to get one to bring home.<eos> Oh, cut the crap, you two.<eos> Nobody's buying any paintings.<eos> I don't mean "nobody," I mean you people.
You know what?<eos> You guys suck.<eos> So sorry, I'm new here, so...<eos> Allison's great.<eos> Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.
Allison's great.<eos> Unlike you, she's kind. She has a big heart.<eos> Oh, we know, she told us about that condition.<eos> Fuck you all.<eos> I like her more than I like you people right now.
We gotta find some sort of psychic Drano, or...<eos> You know what it is, don't you?<eos> The blockage?<eos> It's your stupid brother.<eos> The history between you two and how it made you go crazy, and hire a doofus to break into his house.
Madeline?<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't realize Mr. Stussy was expecting you.<eos> - Mr. Stussy... - It's okay, Madeline,<eos> I got it.<eos> What can we do for you, friend?
That... This...<eos> - You lent us some...<eos> - Capital.<eos> Which we've told you, we're happy to pay back with interest.<eos> You see, that's the problem with you Americans.
You're saying...<eos> My brother was trying to rob me?<eos> All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I'd like to thank you for bringing all this to our attention. And to assure you that if anything fruitful comes to mind, any details that you might find illuminating, then we'll make sure to bring them to your attention, all right?
I'm sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> He said pretty girls should only open their mouths - when they see a dick.<eos> And, just so I'm clear, which one of you is the dick?
Did you see the press conference?<eos> Should have left the kids at home.<eos> DA called me, asked me to bring them. Bullshit.<eos> Don't let them exploit you like that.<eos> They don't give a shit about you.
If there was a God, I'd thank him for that.<eos> There is a God, and he shines.<eos> If there was a God, my son would still be alive.<eos> I'll call you when I get a name.<eos> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.
Do you think he's gonna pay?<eos> He's obsessed with his son.<eos> When he sees what is on this video, he'll pay.<eos> Heather, there's no one to protect anymore.<eos> Except you.
And I'm gonna personally take it out on you.<eos> I'd have to go back and check my notes.<eos> Maybe I messed up the evidence tag.<eos> You've got 24 hours to figure it out.<eos> I know some of you are disappointed in me, but may I remind you of Isaiah 1:18.
Good to see you.<eos> Hey.<eos> What a turnout.<eos> What a turnout.<eos> I want to thank all of you for coming.
What a turnout.<eos> What a turnout.<eos> I want to thank all of you for coming.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Now, many of you know I'm a proud Harris High Dragon class of '86.
This is a fully funded program that will start next fall with five of our most challenged schools, beginning with Eli Harris High School.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's right.<eos> Today you're going to be hearing a speech, but it won't be from me because the Real Initiative isn't for me or any of my boring friends and fellow colleagues up here.<eos> It's for you.
Thank you so much.<eos> Um...<eos> You know what?<eos> All year long, you all have to listen to me make speeches and go off about whatever the hell is so important on that day.<eos> So tonight I'm going to give you all a present:
I think.<eos> You're, uh... Kind of like his guide star, right?<eos> Lighting the way, and all, through the dark.<eos> Like Julie is to you.<eos> How long, you and her?
Lot of catching up to do.<eos> I bet.<eos> Must have been up late.<eos> - Till 3:00, 3:30.<eos> - Just the two of you, was it?
How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?<eos> One of you guys.
I'm...<eos> I'm not in, uh...<eos> Anymore...<eos> No?<eos> Well, it has not been the same around here without you guys.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> No worries.<eos> Come on in.<eos> We're all set to go.<eos> H-hey, rob... Was it you guys who sent the car for me this morning?
You f... you fucking assholes.<eos> About fucking time.<eos> Assholes... all of you.<eos> Grab yourself a beer and let's get started.<eos> Those of you with families won't be going home tonight.
About fucking time.<eos> Assholes... all of you.<eos> Grab yourself a beer and let's get started.<eos> Those of you with families won't be going home tonight.<eos> Those of you with hot dates, consider them iced.
I can't leave without them.<eos> Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.<eos> Now get in.<eos> Okay.<eos> You and you in number one.
I still don't know what to tell my staff.<eos> Half of them are expecting to be fired - or arrested any minute.<eos> - Tell them they won't be.<eos> Tell them to stop listening to Brett O'Keefe.<eos> Look, most of you know me.
So?<eos> Honestly... it's hard to listen to what's said in this room, 'cause what I'm not hearing is a plan.<eos> "Follow the money," which... believe me, will be much harder than you think.<eos> That's what you'll be doing when the world rolls right over you.<eos> 'Cause you're missing it, all of you.
Right, how's everybody feeling? Good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You good?<eos> Looking good.<eos> A lot of you are gonna remember this from last year. I know you will.
There's no time. You're gonna be all right, okay?<eos> We've got you.<eos> Mag.<eos> That was quick.<eos> We were right behind you.
Two shots, two ducks.<eos> You like this, you dumb fuck?<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You love it.<eos> Just like I love... Just like I love this company and you guys and this guy right here. Come on in.
A pimple waits until you're 12 to come on your face.<eos> Righty-o, then.<eos> The lady has free reign.<eos> No law can govern the lioness.<eos> And as for you fellas, there's only one rule, so learn it well.
Please, no!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Hey! You people are sick!
Then you know that the president will not hesitate to cut you open and pull it out.<eos> I mean, I know this man.<eos> He is cold and he is merciless.<eos> You think he gives a shit about you if he's willing to end the world?<eos> I thought that's what you people wanted.
A woman's center in my district?<eos> Centers.<eos> It's plural, and it's new.<eos> Well, there's nothing I enjoy more than a sheet cake with a thick layer of frosting.<eos> Particularly when it's made by a pair of lovely young things like you.
Who here lives by the word of God?<eos> And who here lives by the word of God every day of their life?<eos> No one.<eos> We all fall short of the glory of God.<eos> And I don't know about you, but I can certainly see this is true for the city of San Francisco these days.
Everyone in Nassau knows what Long John Silver's return means, what's expected of them when he does return.<eos> All that remains is for him to return.<eos> SAYLE: We're not apart on this island.<eos> We cannot be apart.<eos> Many of you have got kin at the Underhill estate.
Well, we've all hunted small... piraguas or less.<eos> It'll have to start there until things are settled.<eos> But it is the only way there will be any semblance of order in the meantime.<eos> There aren't gonna be many men out there eager to take orders anytime soon.<eos> You were chosen... because I thought you were worthy to be the first captain's counsel of a restored Nassau.
Yes, my Lord.<eos> There's a fight soon to be underway in Nassau.<eos> A fight that... we are entitled to be a part of.<eos> A fight to answer a cowardly crime.<eos> A fight... that's been stolen from us by you fucking people.
There's a fight soon to be underway in Nassau.<eos> A fight that... we are entitled to be a part of.<eos> A fight to answer a cowardly crime.<eos> A fight... that's been stolen from us by you fucking people.<eos> So... the way I see it, each one of you owes us a fight.
[exhales] And for as long as he is chained to this place, then I am as well.<eos> I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave.<eos> Especially... when he learns of your... current state of being.<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, but seeing what I see in your service... I fear there are things I may know about you that even the governor does not yet know.<eos> I have grown quite fond of you, ma'am.
I suppose the good news is that's how we'll know we're finally getting somewhere interesting.<eos> - MAN: All clear!<eos> - MAN #2: Clear the fort!<eos> MAN #3: Close the gate!<eos> What can I do for you, ma'am?
But what is certain is that many will die and much will be lost.<eos> I think we've all seen our fair share of loss and I have had enough of it.<eos> So, I'd like to ensure that this fight does not come to pass.<eos> How do you suggest we do that?<eos> I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you... control of the fort, its guns, its magazine, the unconditional release of the remainder of your prisoners.
- You're prepared to do all of that?<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> In exchange for the cache.<eos> The chest with the remains of the Urca treasure.<eos> I'm told it is hidden... buried in a secret place known only to Captain Rackham and the two of you.
I get the cache, and guaranteed safe passage off the island for everyone in this fort... and you get Nassau.<eos> The money isn't ours to give.<eos> We have partners who would almost certainly rather fight this out than lose their treasury.<eos> Your partners are your problem.<eos> There is a reason why I invited you here and not them.
I will not undermine his position once the shooting starts.<eos> So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.
I wonder, ma'am, if he might want you to leave when he learns of your current state of being.<eos> UTLEY: She's flying the governor's banner.<eos> It's him!<eos> We'll make our landing under cover of the fort's guns, reinforce them, and move to retake Nassau.<eos> I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you, control of the fort, all of it, in exchange for the cache.
Were you with him before he died?<eos> I was.<eos> I've been told that he departed the island before all of this started.<eos> That he killed two soldiers in the process.<eos> Everyone assumed he'd turned, that somehow one of you had turned him, but that isn't what happened, is it?
I had concerns when we first arrived in Nassau, and I told her as much... that the instincts that had allowed her to survive for so long there, to thrive there, would eventually return.<eos> And that when they did, it would cause conflict between us.<eos> I don't believe that's what's happened, my Lord.<eos> You don't?<eos> She's done this out of devotion to you.
If these people are successful in compromising the first, there is no end to the damage they can cause the rest.<eos> In this war... you and I have far more that unites our interests than separates them.<eos> For if Nassau falls, if it becomes a dark symbol of what mayhem these men can unleash, a rallying cry that might be heard throughout the New World... how long before these same men turn their eyes to Cuba?<eos> To your plantations and your ships?<eos> How long before Spanish slaves are emboldened by it and set their eyes on you?
Why are you still here?<eos> Have you not seen Mikey since you've been back?<eos> I probably have.<eos> You people all look the same to me.<eos> Jeez, I just figured after two months, you guys must be dying to... touch butts?
That money disappears, doesn't matter how, the man's responsible for his money.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What do you think the consequences should be?<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> So whatever happened between you two doesn't matter.
And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them for you.
A little more.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> God is on my side.<eos> There is only one possible outcome for all of this, and we both know what that is.<eos> You people will lose.
For the record... this is the proof that my path is righteous.<eos> You know, you can keep hiding behind your religion all you want, Jadalla, but we both know this is just about killing innocent people... some of them Muslim.<eos> Not that you give a damn.<eos> You're a psychopath, Jadalla, just like your father.<eos> Both of you are sad, little men, twisting your faith into an excuse for violence.
Now do what I say, or my men will put a bullet in his head.<eos> I don't believe you'll do that.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> You told me yourself.<eos> My husband means nothing to you.
] Oi!<eos> Do you mind?<eos> You what?<eos> I can't hear myself think over here!<eos> Not with you lot, screaming and shouting like a lot of pissy girls.
Through there, down the corridor, last one on the right.<eos> Right.<eos> Kenny, how you doing out there, you're alright?<eos> All good.<eos> You?
- How do you do?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> It's a nice day.<eos> It is a nice day.<eos> I have some very bad news for you children.
- It looks like a list.<eos> Wrong!<eos> It's a list.<eos> A list of chores.<eos> Rich brats like you are probably spoiled rotten and have never done a chore in your life.
I wasn't expecting to see you.<eos> We meant to come sooner.<eos> We've been cleaning.<eos> Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.
Yes, Count Olaf told me you were very particular about that.<eos> I hope you appreciate how much he's doing for you.<eos> I wouldn't say "much."<eos> Well, perhaps not compared to what you're used to.<eos> What can I do for you?
If you might use my library.<eos> Is there any book you're looking for in particular?<eos> A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.
I always find cooking for family to be something of a mitzvah.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> - Commandment?<eos> - Blessing.<eos> You children have had such sorrow in your lives already, you deserve the blessing of a new family with Count Olaf, and, if you don't mind my saying so... with me.
It would have been so easy to lessen your suffering by divulging the secret.<eos> And yet, he never did.<eos> Have you yet asked yourself why that is?<eos> My father didn't mistrust Flint.<eos> My father mistrusted all of you.
The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.<eos> And as my collateral to ensure that this deal is consummated, he'll be coming with me to the fort.<eos> "This deal"?<eos> As in the one in which you walk away with all my money?<eos> It seems the only means I have of registering any meaningful disapproval of this deal at this point is to kill one or the both of you.
You're going to inform Mr. Silver what's happening.<eos> We're getting onto the Walrus and we're getting it and us out of here.<eos> If we're still here when they make their landing, none of us will survive the day.<eos> You would surrender our position to the Spanish Navy?<eos> You were prepared to surrender this position to Long John Silver just a few hours ago.
That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.
You'll have plenty of time to murder her another day.<eos> Right now, you need to rest.<eos> You asked to see me, my Lord?<eos> I cannot imagine what sort of horror this is for you.<eos> Please know, to whatever extent there could be any doubt, that the choices she made in recent days were made out of concern for you and out of love...
In dressing the body, my Lord...<eos> I don't know how to say it. - Leave.<eos> - Beg pardon, ma'am?<eos> - Leave now, please.<eos> - I'd be careful if I were you.
I honestly don't know.<eos> Not long, I don't believe.<eos> She rarely included me in her thinking.<eos> What I knew of her was mostly observed rather than shared.<eos> But one thing I know to be true... whatever risk she took... or danger she braved... they were all made out of love for you.
Not long, I don't believe.<eos> She rarely included me in her thinking.<eos> What I knew of her was mostly observed rather than shared.<eos> But one thing I know to be true... whatever risk she took... or danger she braved... they were all made out of love for you.<eos> She saw a life with you and the child... and she was determined to deliver you all into it.
I don't advise that we consolidate them...<eos> Absolutely. I mean, the wars are our priorities.<eos> A ringleader of the pirate militia.<eos> He surrendered himself.<eos> Said he would only speak with you directly.
He said he wants to make a deal.<eos> Follow me, please, Captain.<eos> Those men at that table are among the wealthiest in the Pennsylvania Colony and critical suppliers to my husband's business.<eos> They consider character to be of paramount importance in choosing their partners, and so my husband has gone to great lengths to assure them that our family's sordid beginnings are long since behind us, and you just stood in front of them<eos> and proposed that my husband join you in a revenge plot against the royal governor of New Providence Island.
Unless we bring him the cache and surrender it to him by his deadline, she dies.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Who else knows about this?<eos> No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.
Terms.<eos> When this is through, you'll present this to your people and advocate to accept them.<eos> Every fugitive slave in your camp will receive their immediate emancipation.<eos> With one condition.<eos> Any escaped slave who seeks refuge with you after the ratification of this deal will be surrendered to the law.

Seems confident it's to be done, doesn't he?<eos> To rescue her without paying the governor his ransom.<eos> He is confident in his plan... as am I.<eos> Maybe.<eos> One of you is more confident than the other, I think.
37.<eos> 38.<eos> 39?<eos> 40.<eos> Oh, good for me. You Regina and Luca?
For the wedding? Yeah.<eos> Toby and Lily said they wanted to keep things casual.<eos> Travis is coming.<eos> I say the more the merrier.<eos> Well, if it's cool with you... I'd love to.
Excuse me?<eos> Everyone sees it!<eos> Stomping over anyone who gets in your way?<eos> Crash, crash, watch out, here comes momzilla!<eos> Hey, you two, we're ready to start!
Hey. Uh, can we talk to you guys for a second? Sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm sorry about making a scene at the wedding.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> It's been a stressful year for both of you.
You're staying?<eos> We called Melody to see if my old job at the deaf program was still available, and turns out it is.<eos> I'm gonna cut back on DJing and we're gonna take care of Carlton together.<eos> So, you're coming home!<eos> And I want you to know we'll be here for you all the way.
Critical to holding our alliance together.<eos> We absolutely must get her back alive.<eos> And you think I'm the one best suited to lead our people through this?<eos> I think that you are the best of us.<eos> The two of you together are the world in balance.
They waited an hour before disbanding.<eos> Evidently, that is the lifespan of "the governor is on his way"<eos> as a viable measure of delay.<eos> The solution to our problems is not going to come from a council meeting.<eos> They are losing faith in you.
The threat the pirates present has never been greater.<eos> Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function.<eos> - The defense of civilization... is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.
A fantasy that despite what we'd heard of her, she was learning, growing.<eos> And that someday, she'd seek me out and... a woman who reminded me of myself when I was younger would arrive in Boston and...<eos> I'd walk the Charles with her and... teach her the things a woman can do in this world.<eos> It's the wrong river and the wrong woman, but perhaps to get even this close to a fantasy is something.<eos> So, let us assume that we're past conversations about ledgers and that the measuring of you and your proposal are done and that we are partners in a venture... to acquire and reform Nassau.
The only male heir to his family's banking operation.<eos> Supremely uncurious, bordering on dim, but fundamentally decent.<eos> The investments he's overseen have shown modest gains at best and losses more frequently.<eos> This is not the man you would like to put in charge of Nassau.<eos> I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.
You think he would listen to me as a wife.<eos> I suppose it needn't be him.<eos> But to have the kind of control you will need to have, there will need to be someone occupying the role, and that someone... solves a number of problems all at once.<eos> Money, limited ambition... and reform-minded parents would find your story most intriguing.<eos> In terms of your obligations to him, there are plenty of ways for a man like that to retain satisfaction in a place like Nassau with little or no participation from you.
And...<eos> Flint is on his own out there and disadvantaged.<eos> That said... Flint's been on his own and disadvantaged countless times since I've known him.<eos> And here we are.<eos> Suppose what I'm saying is... if I were you, I would assume the worst... and act accordingly now while you know you still can.
If they say you know his mind as if it were your own, we thought you might have a better idea which way he went than we could.<eos> How in the fuck would I know which way he decided to go?<eos> All Flint needs is an hour, maybe less, to conceal that chest in a way we couldn't hope to recover.<eos> Every moment we stand here deliberating is a moment closer to his victory.<eos> The three of you, that way.

- Oh, nice try.<eos> But you can just call me... the Old Man of Hoy.<eos> What's his name?<eos> He doesn't trust us.<eos> Of course I don't trust you.
Or maybe, just maybe, you were supposed to get out.<eos> He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.<eos> I've seen more than my fair share of snares.<eos> You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind.<eos> Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you, I suspect we'll be seeing each other again soon enough.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Look!<eos> Look!<eos> Now... a man who needs no introduction, but I'll introduce to you anyhow.<eos> I give you the Grand Marshall of this year's Pride Parade...
"Copulation for a better nation."<eos> By having sex with every homie in Oakland.<eos> - By any means necessary.<eos> - Mom! They exaggerate, honey.<eos> Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Don't be a child, Daniela.<eos> Don't treat me like one.<eos> Everything I built in this world, I built for you.<eos> But if you force me, I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.<eos> I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.
Wow.<eos> Is Nomi okay?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Lola says she's a bit concussed but she'll sleep it off.<eos> She was more worried about you.
I know sometimes I say things I shouldn't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I would ask the same thing.<eos> You want to know what it's like between Will and me.<eos> It's much more intense than when I visit with any of you.
For too long, we have elected liars.<eos> And hypocrites.<eos> We have elected thieves.<eos> The time has come to elect a real man.<eos> I give you, from the Kenya Democratic Reform Party...
Well... you gotta do it now.<eos> Is this working?<eos> My name is Nomi.<eos> I am Teagan's only sibling, which means, yes, I am her former brother-now-sister.<eos> This may come as a surprise to some of you.
Because you want to believe you're perfect.<eos> But you know you're not.<eos> That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
Put your fucking cards down.<eos> Trust almost killed Axe Capital.<eos> And that is never gonna happen again.<eos> Things got a little too free and fucking easy around here.<eos> And to eliminate the possibility of any questionable information passing from any of you to me, all future conversations will be held in the presence of my Chief of Staff, Stephanie Reed.
Years and years.<eos> So I'm too young?<eos> You're getting that?<eos> Too green.<eos> It'll go to an old hand like one of you two, then?
Imagine that.<eos> And I knew he wasn't gonna cheat anyone else that day and would look over his shoulder thereafter.<eos> I had managed something better than payback.<eos> By acting with purpose and understatement,<eos> I had created a more just environment, which is what I am asking of all of you.
- There's a great company...<eos> I know a guy from Wharton with a...<eos> We should go to cash, take some time off, and...<eos> Okay, fuck this.<eos> Do any of you have juice with Raya?
So how do I keep you?<eos> You kind of can't.<eos> Just look at him.<eos> The everyman grilling away.<eos> You know, he sent the chef away tonight because the two of you always do this together.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
I've been meaning to talk with you.<eos> It's terrifying, isn't it?<eos> The president and I have a simple request.<eos> Tell us what you see.<eos> If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
You forgot salty.<eos> Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.
Uh, anyone mind if I drink this one, too?<eos> You've had enough caffeine.<eos> All right.<eos> Go to my bag, get my hotspot.<eos> I'll upload for you.
Me, too.<eos> Not not.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Hey!<eos> You!
KAT:<eos> This is one of our newest crew members.<eos> Miranda North from the Centers for Disease Control.<eos> She's a doctor, too.<eos> You guys are witnessing a space triathlon.
I come from a long line of plumbers.<eos> I can fix a shower.<eos> Well, Hugh doesn't shower anyway, he's British.<eos> - First international incident.<eos> - I'm not being critical of you.
A clamp.<eos> It failed.<eos> - It's on me.<eos> RORY:<eos> Yeah, no shit it's on you.
For all I know, we're carrying anthrax onboard.<eos> You can't compare Calvin to anthrax.<eos> Yeah, I know at least five guys back home who can do my job.<eos> {\pos(375,5)}( panting )<eos> Nobody can do yours except you.
Okay, okay.<eos> {\pos(375,5)}( hand squeaks over glass )<eos> Little sod.<eos> MIRANDA:<eos> How hard is it holding on to you?
What's it doing?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> RORY:<eos> You guys got eyes on it anywhere?
Will you turn around?<eos> Can you turn around?<eos> DAVID:<eos> There's a man dying in there!<eos> We can't hear you if you take your comm out!
I do.<eos> I trust you.<eos> DAVID:<eos> Wait here.<eos> I'll signal you.
But not now.<eos> We're off it now.<eos> Oh, come on, Zelda, for real.<eos> It feels like I haven't been back here in ages.<eos> Tell me about you.
You've given this a lot of thought.<eos> I give everything a lot of thought.<eos> And yet, you've never come into my office and shared any of those thoughts.<eos> You think I should?<eos> I just want you to know that I'm here for you guys.
If this turns out to be something big, and we don't call him...<eos> He would kill us.<eos> Or maybe we should go back to the woods tonight and find the killer.<eos> Scott?<eos> You guys didn't hear his voice.
I know you're supposed to drive out tonight, so if you don't call me back, just promise me you're actually going.<eos> Just get in the jeep and go.<eos> You'll find three words on the official FBI seal,<eos> "Loyalty, courage, integrity."<eos> These are the qualities we expect of all our interns, the qualities we demand of you during your 6 months with us.
Uh-oh. I think we found our intruders.<eos> Told ya!<eos> Now let's smash some alien thieves.<eos> Um, actually, we were just leaving.<eos> You thieves ain't going nowhere.
We were trying to protect your krutackin' planet!<eos> Uh, yeah?<eos> By stealing our stuff?<eos> It's not yours.<eos> You Terrans can't be trusted with Sanctuary's power.
I am Groot!<eos> What kind of fail-safe system did you so-called heroes slap together?<eos> One that will rain vengeance!<eos> Actually, it's meant to protect Earth by stopping hostiles from getting their hands on our tech.<eos> The only thing Earth needs protecting from is you guys!
Actually, it's meant to protect Earth by stopping hostiles from getting their hands on our tech.<eos> The only thing Earth needs protecting from is you guys!<eos> Hey, we're not the ones who dropped an asteroid on our headquarters.<eos> No, you're just the ones who messed with its size and forced us to.<eos> 'Cause you space freaks ripped off the rock in the first place!
Clink.<eos> Jamba Jeans.<eos> Seriously, amazing.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You guys literally cracked open the market on athletic denim, and I am...
Jamba Jeans.<eos> Seriously, amazing.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You guys literally cracked open the market on athletic denim, and I am...<eos> I'm just so happy for you.
- It is... kinda.<eos> ...while waiting anxiously for Alterplex to launch what the company claims to be the final generation of energy solutions.<eos> If you're joining us now, we are less than a minute away from entering a new future.<eos> This is really big for me.<eos> I want it to be good for you guys too, you know. I know.
Personal ones.<eos> We are aware of your sister and nephew.<eos> And your new surrogate-father role. And the surrounding circumstances.<eos> It's very noble of you, Will.<eos> Mr. Reynard respects your position which is why our generous relocation package includes all three of you.
Take... take 25.<eos> Well, then I guess I just don't understand the point of the scene.<eos> It's about when Mira goes off her meds.<eos> Yeah, no. I know that. Thank you.<eos> I mean, I don't understand why there's this whole romantic bit where you swoop in and save her and act like you guys are meant to be together when this is a movie about a shit relationship.
I think it's about time to... yeah, let's go.<eos> - You're not wearing a watch.<eos> - Well, I know what time it is.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I convinced Sharva to book you over JC Chasez, so you have to perform.
Sorry about that.<eos> - Abigail.<eos> - No, I thought that was really cool.<eos> I liked it.<eos> Okay, I have a question for you guys.
And I bless that sexual GPS service every day.<eos> Listen, Banana, it's only a bus ride away.<eos> We can bring cheese, wine, books, diapers, culture.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> You guys will take the bus? No.
Well, that's not an insult to me because it means I look like I got railed by a football star.<eos> Wasn't intended to be a compliment.<eos> With the help of Byron, who has completed all 12 steps of Al-Anon, I have come to realize how exhausting and narcissistic and ultimately boring this whole dynamic is.<eos> And I finally feel brave enough to create some distance for myself.<eos> If you guys happen to know all of those really pretty girls out there who have, like, jobs and purses and nice personalities, those are now my friends, not you guys.
Byron allotted for extra guests because that's just the kind of guy that Byron is.<eos> That's who I'm with now.<eos> My fiancé, okay?<eos> Well, Shosh will definitely get her wish.<eos> All of you will because I got an important job upstate and I am moving there with my child, and none of you will probably ever see me again.
That Theda Bara wears too much make-up.<eos> Did you see your Yankee again last night?<eos> He's not my Yankee, but yes.<eos> We went swimming in the lake.<eos> Just you two?
Got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Okay.<eos> You guys need to get some energy out.
I don't know what I want for you!<eos> What I really want is something that can never happen, okay?<eos> I want you to be happy, I wan... And I want you to be well.<eos> I want Mom to be alive again.<eos> I got... I wan... I want both of you to...
Sounds exciting, Sam.<eos> We're gonna have so much to talk about.<eos> Let's... Why don't we say tonight?<eos> Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.
Good evening.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?
- More drinks. - No, this is getting...<eos> He's lost his mind.<eos> So, where to...<eos> The past or the future?<eos> Well, the future, or course, away from all you cynics.
Because I don't trust anyone, ever.<eos> And then I realize I don't trust anyone, so I try to.<eos> And then, I end up trusting the wrong one.<eos> It never fails.<eos> Are all women today as selfaware as you?
I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.<eos> I must take issue with something that you said earlier.<eos> There is absolutely nothing mediocre about you.
Great.<eos> Let's wrap it up and get out of here.<eos> Can it be fixed?<eos> Never mind this.<eos> I'm more concerned with you.
Yeah, just think, now you don't have to do that anymore.<eos> I'm just gonna go to bed And figure out what to do tomorrow.<eos> Hey, Norma?<eos> Can I stay here for a little while?<eos> I want to look after you guys while... While he's still in the basement.
For money.<eos> Who gave the order to murder Senator Wilkes and Clara Ward?<eos> We can't do this?<eos> Well, all I can say to you is here we are, and we're doing it.<eos> And the last one of you two to tell me who gave the order to murder my friend never sees dry land again.
Easy.<eos> Jeff's dad when he was 25.<eos> What?<eos> Interesting.<eos> All right. Okay, you two. Go.
I just want you gone.<eos> Right here.<eos> Pretty sure you've been told, on pain of death, to take me alive.<eos> Or I'd be dead by now.<eos> I'm not spending the rest of my life running from you people.
Dr. Saroyan, hey.<eos> You sure you want to be out here?<eos> Yeah, I... Dr. Brennan's safe, so... I just... (Saroyan sighs)<eos> It's hard to believe, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I never knew Zack, not like you guys, but... still, I don't know, just...
Uh-uh.<eos> We're not done here, Doctor.<eos> Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, a word of advice.<eos> The person you're searching for has a pathological need for control.<eos> He, or she, will want to get as close to you as possible, to... manipulate you. Steer your investigation.
And I remember.... fighting off attackers with you by my side.<eos> In the Maluku Islands.<eos> I meant the motorcycle bar, but yes.<eos> The Maluku Islands, as well.<eos> I remember the day each of you was hired.
So we're just supposed - to give up on her?<eos> - I refuse to do that.<eos> Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.
Dr. Brennan saw something in these remains.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then it's up to you to find it.<eos> Look, Brennan trained you for this exact moment.<eos> She's counting on you.
Cam the caterpillar. Yeah, we're all in it.<eos> It's-it's about us.<eos> Cam has something to tell you both.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... I haven't been completely honest with you guys, because it wasn't official, but, um... Arastoo and I aren't actually going to Europe.
Yeah, well, the consequence is, he's gonna get fired... and, you know, a lot of people would love this job.<eos> Now that you say that, I remembered he told me his buddy is an engineer at one of those storage companies, so I think he went over to make sure it was all being done properly, but I can find him and make sure it's going okay.<eos> - That would be huge.<eos> Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> So great that you guys got that...
Apart from our cocktail of the day... which is the Grasshopper.<eos> Equal parts creme de menthe, creme de cacao, evap and a dash of cocoa.<eos> Slips down like a liquid after-dinner mint, and then kicks you like a mule.<eos> We got you some bitter lemon.<eos> Actually, I'll have a cocktail, if it's all the same to you.
- What are you doing? - It's my mom.<eos> I got to take this.<eos> Is that Marillo?<eos> I'm going to go talk to her.<eos> You guys wait here.
You owe them.<eos> I'm on more than one team.<eos> Guys. Hey, can I talk to you guys?<eos> Can you guys stop talking for one second, please?<eos> Look, I know... I kind of been cocky since I got here, and I got no right to ask you all for anything, but last night, I was assaulted by police on campus.
Yeah.<eos> Man, I love your guys' place.<eos> It's, like, 100 times nicer than my place.<eos> My place is dank and dirty and gross.<eos> You guys have towels and toothpaste...
Yeah.<eos> And I can be, like, the sober guide.<eos> Your guru.<eos> I'll set it all up.<eos> Make sure you guys have an excellent trip.
It's all good.<eos> This actually is a really good sandwich.<eos> That's pretty much what you can do with those things.<eos> I feel like I don't feel anything.<eos> But if you guys said you were feeling something then, then I'm probably feeling it, too.
Well, it was like, three weeks ago. Yeah.<eos> We should move something again. That felt good.<eos> I could take both of my hands and smoosh your head... like a watermelon, right now.<eos> 'Cause that is something that's in my blood. I'm part barbarian, you know what I mean?<eos> You... What are you doing?
- Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Seems like you guys are havin' some fun out there.<eos> Mmm-hmm. - Maybe I should come join you.
You can only buy clothes like that downtown.<eos> I never got to pass it.<eos> Remember, there are no victims in that classroom.<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> Everyone else in the school is scared of you, but I'm not.
- But...<eos> - But?<eos> I'm having all these weird cravings I never had before the surgery, like red wine.<eos> And I like different types of music, like classical, which I never paid attention to before.<eos> But tell me more about you guys!
- If you had changed, or you were at least trying...<eos> - I am trying.<eos> I don't use any more.<eos> And I really have been living in my car because my landlord was stalking me.<eos> I would have loved to go to Italy with you guys.
My proprietary algorithm allows me to recognize millions of objects, gestures, and voice commands.<eos> See, Booth?<eos> AMI is no different than us.<eos> That is not accurate, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.
Not to mention the fact that Ian owned a 55% stake in their company, so he didn't need Kate's permission to sell.<eos> Ugh.<eos> What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.<eos> And even if the NFL doesn't hire me, I love being at the Jeffersonian. And working with all of you.
Yeah, me, too.<eos> Who killed him, Seeley?<eos> I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out.<eos> Need my help?<eos> No, I'm good. But either of you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo before he, uh, went missing? Not me.
Hey, speaking of labor, is Brennan really narrating her own audiobook?<eos> It's pretty crazy how she managed to bring the Agent Andy character back, right?<eos> Yeah. Ooh, Fisher, you can tell us if the science was authentic.<eos> So, a sternum transplant-- is that for real?<eos> Oh, you guys actually read Dr. Brennan's books?
This again.<eos> Look, as I told your colleagues, we all want to help, but this is disrupting my students' learning environment.<eos> Don't you mean disrupting the tutors that you have taking the students' classes for them?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. And I told your people already, we didn't see Austin the day he died.<eos> So, I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.
Not bad.<eos> Though you should probably know the term Newfie's considered offense coming from a C.F.A. Non-native.<eos> "Comes From Away." What?<eos> We've got a potential witness.<eos> Thought one of you could take the rental car and go and check her out.
You don't think you're getting out of this room without an explanation, do you?<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, there are very few jobs in the D.C. area for a forensic anthropologist.<eos> A fact that Arastoo reminds me of on a daily basis.<eos> Getting my doctorate means that it's time to move on.<eos> And wearing the jacket just makes it a little too real for me. And the fact that I'll soon have to leave all of you.
If you added crushed almonds that would be a delicious Moroccan dish called amlou.<eos> Or more likely, it's a high-end hair oil, but I found none of that in the victim's own hair.<eos> Which would suggest that he put his fingers in another person's hair just prior to death.<eos> Well, I'll let Booth know.<eos> How are you guys coming?
Radioactive Party Panthers from Fort Lauderdale.<eos> Thought you guys were supposed to know this stuff.<eos> We know enough, Kirby. Enough to be talking to you.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> And I'm sorry. You guys are with FBI?
I mean, you're not wrong.<eos> I like my job, but compared with you and the other interns...<eos> There's something bigger out there.<eos> You need to go after it while you still can.<eos> You guys are like my family here.
Oh, so sorry. I just wanted to inform you we've moved your personal items from the changing area into your car.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi. Yes, I, uh, I'd like to say a couple words.<eos> So, as most of you know, I'm Cam's daughter.
- It would seem so, sir, yes. - Good.<eos> I want hourly updates, and I want to know... sir.<eos> Abby.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Which one of you is Agent Spaulding?
Now, like all of you, I am awed by his artistic talent, but I promise you... the greater privilege is to know Kyle West the person.
I don't think it was just any bullet.<eos> I hope not.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't either of you say anything?
If you really wanna know, I know a way.<eos> The trail's gone.<eos> Uh, maybe he just stopped bleeding.<eos> God, I think we should split up.<eos> Lori and I go this way, you guys go that way.
She doesn't understand, Frank.<eos> Not like we do.<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> "Dear Mrs. Starks...<eos> This morning, your husband, Phillip, faced his maker with all his might, thinking only of you.
Not like we do.<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> "Dear Mrs. Starks...<eos> This morning, your husband, Phillip, faced his maker with all his might, thinking only of you.<eos> I share this to reassure you that his devotion was constant, and that even the thought of you and the love you shared eased him in his final moments.

You?
Come. I've arranged a place for you to stay.<eos> That was quite a risk you took.<eos> You could have been caught, Samuel, sold into slavery.<eos> But Aurelia sees a future now that she never saw before.<eos> We both do. And we've got you to thank for it, Nurse Mary.
I'll leave you to it.<eos> He's awake.<eos> Mr. Bullen, are you awake?<eos> Dr. Hale?<eos> - Is that you?
Ah, you're looking better.<eos> I've come to get my wounds redressed. Wait here.<eos> I'll find you a doctor.<eos> Told vulgar jokes, such as... what's the difference between a dog and a fox?<eos> You.
Pardon me, Doctor.<eos> What advice was that?<eos> On remaining here-- as a nurse.<eos> Would you be so kind as to petition Dr. Foster on my behalf?<eos> I feel that coming from you, it--
On remaining here-- as a nurse.<eos> Would you be so kind as to petition Dr. Foster on my behalf?<eos> I feel that coming from you, it--<eos> Yes, you may have to do that yourself.<eos> I suspect it will be better received coming from you.
Are you soused?<eos> Telegram came from Boston. They say Aurelia's arrived safely.<eos> So with the papers you procured for me and my wages... I bought this.<eos> Steamer leaves Tuesday next.<eos> And I have... I have you to thank for it.
You will do nothing!<eos> Everything you do only deepens our shame.<eos> Sweetie, I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Well, old man, our paths diverge-- you being fitted for an eternity box, me heading down the peninsula to fry other flounder.
We did it, Mike.<eos> However this plays out... I have no regrets.<eos> Michael!<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.<eos> I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.
Freedom has a price.<eos> I died seven years ago.<eos> Left behind a brother... a wife... a son.<eos> But the dead talk... if you listen.<eos> They're there with you... reaching out... trying to tell you something.
Whatever you bring in, you bring out.<eos> And one last piece of correspondence.<eos> Something really wrong with the world when I'm receiving dozens of letters a week for guys like you.<eos> Nothing compared to the e-mails.<eos> What is it with you killers that put the satin on women's panties anyhow?
You take us straight to the address right now!<eos> I-I get cigarettes.<eos> Linc, this is a setup.<eos> We're gonna grab your bag now.<eos> May peace be upon you, guys.
Severing ties with this town would be healthy for all of us.<eos> I didn't tell you this morning because I...<eos> I knew that you were already hurting, and I didn't want to...<eos> Sell it!<eos> Fine, do what's best for you guys. - It's just a house.
I don't hear anything.<eos> Why don't you just go in the house? I can't.<eos> My mom and I..<eos> Look, I know that this is just A.D. pressing on a raw nerve, right?<eos> They're just taking the fact that I'm some sort of Dickensian foundling but one of you needs to take this. Or stick your fingers in my ears so that I can get some freakin' sleep 'cause I've tried literally everything.
- I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
If you can't find Jenna, it's 'cause she doesn't want to be found.<eos> She hasn't even been answering my calls or texts.<eos> You sure you don't know where she is?<eos> I already told you I wanna cut ties.<eos> And if you're smart, you guys will stay away from her too.
He's weak, it doesn't make him sick.<eos> And what about destroying Ali's memorial? Stealing Caleb's money, joining Mona's army.<eos> I mean he has a dark side, Hanna.<eos> We all do when we're pushed hard enough.<eos> I don't care how many videos you show me he's my friend, just like every one of you.
I couldn't.<eos> They still don't trust me?<eos> Fine, I'll help you and your friends like I always do and then crawl back under a rock.<eos> Mona, come on, it's not like that.<eos> I have literally bled myself for you, Hanna.
Because it may be a part of the reason why you were tortured.<eos> Most of the e-mails that I sent in high school were about mean queen Alison.<eos> And her loyal band of followers.<eos> I gave details about how you made my life a living hell.<eos> And how the rest of you just watched.
What're we doing to stay out of jail?<eos> - Has anyone heard from Aria?<eos> - No. 'Cause she doesn't have one of these.<eos> Okay, guys, I know we all woke up early and we're cranky, but let's stay focused.<eos> I'm as freaked out as the rest of you.
Yeah, well, there's no way that's gonna happen.<eos> Maybe there is.<eos> I was driving.<eos> I'm the one who killed him.<eos> If I turn myself in, then you guys are safe.
It's been a long journey for us.<eos> And we talked about having a child our first date.<eos> Didn't we, Em?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Have you discussed which one of you would, uh, like to carry the child?
Do you still see her when you look in the mirror?<eos> The, the loser the pigtails and the frumpy sweaters.<eos> 'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.
The, the loser the pigtails and the frumpy sweaters.<eos> 'Cause I see her.<eos> I see her right now.<eos> None of you are sure when you look in the mirror.<eos> None of you are really certain who you are.
A.D. doesn't have any leverage anymore they've nothing left to threaten us with.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I'm not sure about anything.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I'm sure about one thing I'm sure about all of you.
Is there a BlueHawaii in there?<eos> Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.<eos> I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He get you out of prison, too? No.
Hands up!<eos> Thank God you guys got here when you did, that's all I can say.<eos> I mean, he would have...<eos> I'd be dead right now.<eos> Look, if it's okay with you guys, I'd like to go home, clean myself up a bit.
- Oh, we're in, let's go, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, why not?<eos> That sounds great.<eos> - Yeah, for sure.<eos> You know what? I'm pretty beat, but you guys have fun.
I mean, like, what would you do if it was you and it was Tyler's baby?<eos> Would you keep it?<eos> I don't know. Um...<eos> That's a big question.<eos> Yeah, but you guys are so perfect together.
I slept with Holly. I know.<eos> She showed me pictures.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pictures of you sleeping.<eos> Pictures of you guys up in some big house together. Pictures of her with your family.
You see, keeping Klaus alive does come in handy.<eos> I keep him for his blood, in case the wolves get out of line.<eos> I keep him as collateral, in case his family comes back.<eos> I keep him, because I can.<eos> I put him down, I kept him down, and I am the only one that can stop him from coming after all of you.
Previously on Reign...<eos> Martel De Guise.<eos> Thank you for coming on such short notice.<eos> Tell me why you're here.<eos> I came back for you, darling.
Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> I have a message for you from the De Guises.<eos> It seems my would-be assassin is a Catholic radical.<eos> He confessed the two of you worked together to plan the details of my murder.
Lola was said to be involved.<eos> She was beheaded.<eos> - Where was Narcisse?<eos> - He's in prison.<eos> Reverend Knox, it was you.
- They were waiting for me at an inn east of the village.<eos> Start there.<eos> You find John!<eos> I promised Lola that I would protect her son.<eos> And now it is up to you.
Just until I can find a way out of it.<eos> You don't want me married to Martel, either?<eos> I had his father killed. Do you think I want him rising in station?<eos> Lord Martel De Guise.<eos> We were just speaking of you. I'm not surprised.
To placate Spain. And keep the Valois on the throne.<eos> As a friend to your family, to you, I urge you to say yes.<eos> Renee, are you there?<eos> It's Gideon Blackburn. Lord Narcisse sent me.<eos> I'm alone. I'm here to help you and the boy.
You're not a tolerant queen, you're a sheep surrounded by wolves.<eos> And a fool to refuse our protection.<eos> Very well.<eos> You need a knife to your throat, here it is.<eos> If you don't marry my son, Clan Gordon will turn against you.
I do care for her more than I should.<eos> Certainly more than I ever intended.<eos> But no matter what I feel about Mary,<eos> I am an Englishman.<eos> I have my family here, and I serve you first.
I mean, I don't want to see my country descend into more bloodshed and war.<eos> And I don't want to see you in danger.<eos> You admitted to falling for my rival.<eos> How do I know she hasn't turned you against me?<eos> I'm not against you, Elizabeth.
You admitted to falling for my rival.<eos> How do I know she hasn't turned you against me?<eos> I'm not against you, Elizabeth.<eos> I know you feel your cousin is your enemy and you must be hers in return.<eos> But the two of you are so consumed with each other, you didn't notice Knox in the corner, cheering you on to fight to the death.
You seek absolution for killing your friend.<eos> She wasn't your friend, Elizabeth, she was your prisoner.<eos> What a grotesque curse of royalty, that you cannot even tell the difference.<eos> The truth is that had you not taken her family hostage, had you not forced her here, then Lola would still be alive!<eos> Maybe you're right, but we confided in one another as friends do, and she agreed to come here because she was desperate to get away from you.
I am half brother to the queen.<eos> My family has royal blood in our veins.<eos> The people believe that God chose us to rule, while you merely spout His teachings.<eos> That is true power.<eos> Power that a commoner like you will never have.
Because of them, Ontari, your rightful commander, is dead.<eos> This imposter stole her Flame. No.<eos> Wanheda saved us, all of us...<eos> Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you.
Welcome back to the coalition.<eos> Time to go.<eos> We'll do our best to keep the king on his throne.<eos> We'll find a way to beat the radiation.<eos> If either of you screw this up, we die.
_<eos> Eli, put that rifle on the floor!<eos> If we give them a fight, they'll kill us!<eos> They're gonna kill us anyway, Momma.<eos> No, not you three.
Go inside.<eos> Jeannie, are you okay?<eos> Everybody's fine.<eos> All right, go on with your granddaddy.<eos> You too. Get on in there.
- That's right. - Yeah.<eos> I was taught at a very early age you have to roll with the punches.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Now... Now, I see some old faces here from a lot of different sides of a lot of different fights.<eos> Some of you, I've rode with.
Now... Now, I see some old faces here from a lot of different sides of a lot of different fights.<eos> Some of you, I've rode with.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Some of you, I've fought with.<eos> And some of you, I've bled with.
Yes, sir.<eos> Some of you, I've fought with.<eos> And some of you, I've bled with.<eos> That's right.<eos> And some of you, maybe back in the bad old days, might have taken a shot at me.
What I'm trying to say is, why does she get to leave the house when she's only level two?<eos> - It was Luke's night out.<eos> - Yeah, but Ellen got to go.<eos> It's "Eli" now.<eos> It might make you feel better to know that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip for you guys in a couple of days.
Not really.<eos> Let's talk about that "really."<eos> Just normal shit.<eos> The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.
Just normal shit.<eos> The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.<eos> We could at least have some manners about it.<eos> Not rub up against you guys on the bus.
I met a girl upstairs who's looking for a roommate.<eos> - You're leaving us?<eos> - Just your couch.<eos> I liked having you around.<eos> Hey, you two... you're up.
It just makes it easier.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Hey!<eos> They're here!<eos> Oh, I've got a surprise for you.
Oh, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> But we were always so grateful that you were there for us.<eos> He used to come visit every Christmas, and he would always bring Travis those model-airplane kits.<eos> And you guys would put them together in the garage.
Now, we know Gemma finished her talk in the Visitor Centre at four.<eos> By five, she'd been drowned in this pond and her body taken to the observation hut.<eos> So we're looking for someone who was on the island on Tuesday afternoon.<eos> I've already got a list. They had nearly a hundred people that day.<eos> And I'm gonna need you lot to track down every single one of them.
There was a family with twin girls.<eos> I talked to them.<eos> And was Ryan on the boat this whole time?<eos> We had some deliveries for the lighthouse, so he was back and forth from the boat.<eos> And it was just the two of you on the boat when you left the mainland?
That's 50 grand.<eos> You know what they'd do to us if I threw it away?<eos> That's why I left the pub on Tuesday, try and give it to Ben myself.<eos> So what happened?<eos> There was police at the train station at Newcastle, and you lot were all over the island, so I was trying again today.
Are you gonna eat that?<eos> I'll have it, yeah.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm pleased to report that last month was our largest haul to date.<eos> So, for all you ass-busting quota makers, it's time for your weekly entertainment.
I should never have taken your bloody money.<eos> Why don't you look at me when I talk to you?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> I won't be silenced.<eos> Not even by you.
All right.<eos> He's fine.<eos> They've got him ready for transport.<eos> Okay.<eos> Had to be you guys?
You gotta look at where the wave breaks, how it moves.<eos> Does it crash or does it crumble?<eos> Saw what you did.<eos> It's been all over the news.<eos> That was you guys, right?
If I'd have listened to you, Marius, I'd have lost all my money, hmm?<eos> But of course that was the plan, wasn't it?<eos> Feeding me the cards.<eos> Wasn't it?<eos> What I want from you now is to finally drop the con and admit... that I fucking got you.
What's there left to say, huh, Marius?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> I should have killed you three years ago.<eos> All of you.
You can deal or, I don't know, security. You choose.<eos> You always wanted to deal in Vegas.<eos> - Yeah, but you hate Vegas.<eos> - I do.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Motherfucker.<eos> _<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I get a panic call from Carly in the middle of the night.<eos> She's worried about you guys.
Lily pond.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.
- But I didn't...<eos> - But you should realize that most people find it uplifting... - ... patriotic, even.<eos> - No. - You check your recruiting numbers. - I-I-I...<eos> Fudge is not a person. He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.
Come in.<eos> You know, from the beginning of the epidemic, our fear was that everything we'd worked for would just be swept away.<eos> But the drugs came, and the death rate has been dropping.<eos> But now there is a new threat, one I never predicted.<eos> You.
He loves all that SEAL stuff.<eos> He's already talking about going to...<eos> BUD/S. Well, maybe I can meet him someday.<eos> Talk him out of it.<eos> For him and his buddies, you guys are like superheroes.
I'm fine.<eos> I don't want it to be you, Dad.<eos> It's never gonna be me.<eos> I'm bulletproof, buddy, remember?<eos> Why don't you guys go to the Dairy Queen and get yourself a treat, okay?
He was a private.<eos> 19 years old.<eos> Having fun, boys?<eos> Yep.<eos> Gentlemen, I have something for you.
Like you did out there?<eos> Huh, Joe?<eos> Come on, let's get some fresh air.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> I have every right to be shit-faced, same as all of you.
Me, I killed three for, what, Chase, 20 bucks an hour?<eos> Well, given the travel time, we're looking at $18.<eos> See, we don't do it for the money.<eos> Neither did our buddy.<eos> See, he didn't die for money or you or whatever it is you wannabe GI Joes do for a living or the flag or the stock market.
And then after that, I'll give him back to Boko Haram, and we'll add the $10 million plus the girls, and that should balance the scale.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Emir, he's more valuable to us.<eos> That's for me to decide.<eos> You Americans had the Jordanians waterboard me 86 times, and I vowed every time to kill 100 infidels every time they put a towel on top of my face.
Where did you get this?<eos> The less any of you know about where this came from, the better.<eos> Okay, anybody know what happened to this guy?<eos> All these guys in these tapes were interrogated and released.<eos> All right, so besides you guys and Rip, he's the only one who knows what happened, right?
He paid his taxes, he voted, and for what?<eos> If you don't have ... loads of money in America, you're nobody.<eos> You're trash.<eos> America betrayed us.<eos> Yeah, you and 50 million other people.
Only one way to find out.<eos> They find us up here, there's no explaining ourselves.<eos> We're all dead.<eos> Quiet.<eos> You...
There are people in my government, believe it or not, who want that man out for their own convoluted foreign policy over here.<eos> That's the job Whip and I were sent here to do.<eos> But for some reason, we were betrayed.<eos> Which means we're getting out without Ramal.<eos> And every one of you is crucial to that plan.
Police, journalists.<eos> So please know we are a resource if you need any guidance.<eos> He's a lawyer, right?<eos> Um, Mike Richardson, a trustee for the university.<eos> With all due respect, the whole "We're here for you" spiel loses its intended effect when you have legal counsel taking notes.
My point is, it's awful, isn't it, that this is what happened to him.<eos> Like...<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?
Did you even know Wes?<eos> Did any of you?<eos> I take it that's a no?<eos> Law school isn't really about making friends, right?<eos> Yeah, I bet some of you are really happy that he's dead 'cause that means your ranking goes up one.
Like, there's not even a body to bury.<eos> You're all vultures glomming onto this tragedy like it's your own.<eos> - Well, it's not your tragedy!<eos> - Please stop.<eos> It is Wes', and he deserves better than this funeral with you phony-ass people!
She just confessed to burning down the house with your brother inside.<eos> - She makes up stories.<eos> - It wasn't a story.<eos> What?<eos> That's it, you two.
You treated him like crap. You still are!<eos> Uh, no, I'm not.<eos> His body is missing, Connor!<eos> Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you?
Do any of you?<eos> - Laurel, we all feel bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.
Is that really an option?<eos> I failed.<eos> I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.<eos> I tried, but... the D.A. offered Wes immunity.<eos> It would make sense to come to you next.
Say "thank you."<eos> This is Atwood's Wi-Fi password.<eos> Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.<eos> Well, you got her password. That saves me about an hour.<eos> The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...
Why are you just telling us this now?<eos> Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Yeah, maybe that's what he wants us to believe.<eos> Will you stop attacking him, please?<eos> All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap<eos> - and we've all been trying to clean it up!<eos> - You should've left! - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.
- Last night around 7:00 p.m.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Not even a full 24 hours?<eos> No, but...<eos> You sure he's not just trying to get away from the two of you?
Well, what about what you did to him?<eos> And don't deny it.<eos> You ran a DNA test.<eos> I didn't need that test to tell me who he was.<eos> Your husband took what he thought he deserved, raped that woman, and a life came of it, a black boy that he and you could never love.
Maybe we all just need to take a deep breath.<eos> Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you...
Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you...<eos> Each of you...
It's our last chance. No.<eos> It's not here, no.<eos> That's because I have it in my cell.<eos> My armies of the caliphate are coming closer.<eos> The moment they reach this place, all of you will be put down like the dogs that you are.
- Understand?<eos> - You think you can shoot all of us?<eos> Anyone else want to play the lottery? Huh?<eos> You're filth.<eos> I'll let ISIL sort you out.
Or will you stand with me? And fight!<eos> Doesn't sound very promising!<eos> Ramal, you want to rethink helping us?<eos> Escape has to start from your cell!<eos> All you infidels can go to Hell!
This is not helping us.<eos> You're gonna make a phone call so you can hold up your end of the deal.<eos> There's an auto body shop off Nashwan plaza.<eos> I want vehicles there, full tanks of gas so we can get to the border, all of us.<eos> I'm not going with you to the border.
Where's your friend?<eos> He's long gone. Back door.<eos> Locked from the inside.<eos> He's in here. Find him.<eos> I was you once, killing for a lie.
Now you're what?<eos> Dying for the truth?<eos> It's human nature to find stuff out, so you will. Or she will.<eos> And then the lie has to kill the truth.<eos> Which one of you is gonna die ne...?
- Because I'm good at it.<eos> - What makes you so good?<eos> I understand how easy it can happen, going down that other path.<eos> And I respect it.<eos> But I'm sure you prep school Negroes have a different mindset.
- Really?<eos> - Yeah. These UNICEF flip-flops are from a Barney's sale?<eos> And this Covenant House sweatshirt and Habitat for Humanity sweatpants, Black Lives Matter button...<eos> Barney's.<eos> Uh-huh. And why aren't you guys dressed for school?
Now, come on, we got to get some work done, all right?<eos> Now, these are the areas that we need to focus on.<eos> Got to say, Leslie...<eos> I still can't believe you didn't vote for him.<eos> You guys don't know me at all, okay?
Wait, wait.<eos> I'm being honest.<eos> I like you, and I also like you, and I don't want to hide that.<eos> - Oh, so you're a player.<eos> - No. I'm an honest man standing in front of you asking you both to go out with me.
Paying someone to listen to your problems, it's like a hooker for your feelings.<eos> Uh, hint... so are hookers. - Oh.<eos> - But I am a big believer in therapy, Dre.<eos> It looks great at divorce proceedings, like you actually cared enough to try.<eos> You privileged bastards ever hear of a bath?
Uh, that... that doesn't expire, sweetheart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, to be honest, Dre, as much as you guys complain about how you've been mistreated by this country,<eos> I'm surprised you don't live in therapy.<eos> Especially since you guys, you know, sometimes have a...
It's when everybody gets together after the funeral with some food.<eos> - Oh, a wake.<eos> - Oh! A wake.<eos> Well, we call it a repass.<eos> You guys just have to put rims on everything, don't you?
I'm fine where I am.<eos> My friends are nearby, I know all my channels, and I'm right next to the ATM where my money's at.<eos> Boy, take me home.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> What are you guys doing here?
This messed-up system is one of the reasons why 1 in 17 white men go to jail, but for black men, it's one in three.<eos> Wow.<eos> One in three?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - That is incredible.<eos> Hm. So which one of you three lied on your résumé?
Why don't you just partner with somebody that's already in your Spades group?<eos> For some reason, they're put off by me.<eos> This is my house [bleep]<eos> Haters, all of 'em.<eos> But that just means that now there's an opportunity for one of you to become my new partner.
It could, and it is.<eos> It's just so hard to believe.<eos> It's easy to believe if you accept the fact that people are inherently evil, which I do.<eos> Okay, I can't sit by any longer and let you all slander Vivian's good name.<eos> I present to you exhibit "A".
- You don't like sandwiches.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Okay. I see how it is.<eos> Always the two of you.
♪♪ Math, science, English.<eos> Star Wars, LEGOs, dominoes.<eos> So, you're not bringing any books to school?<eos> It's school, Diane. They have books there.<eos> You guys sound exactly like Santamonica and Mom.
Hm. Honey, you...<eos> You are an incredibly accomplished woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But that's not why I love you.<eos> I don't love any of you kids for what you do.
Maybe order in a backbone.<eos> It's one dinner, Bow, for everyone. - That's how it's done.<eos> - Not here. Ooh.<eos> Does Chinese sound good?<eos> You guys do whatever you want. I'm just gonna get my own thing from Umami.
- ♪ Put some Uvo on it ♪ - He put some Uvo on it<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you, guys, for coming in.<eos> Now, please, please, have a seat.<eos> I think you're gonna be very pleased with what we've put together for you today.
You can't let one little misunderstanding destroy years of friendship.<eos> Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<eos> She showed her true colors.<eos> When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<eos> It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.
Okey-dokey.<eos> Testing, testing.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> I know that many of you were expecting Sandy for this morning's chair yoga... but her daughter has a cold.
So, he created a cell within the CIA called 21-Void, implementing his own intelligence operations.<eos> And he needed my help breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.<eos> Terrorists, political dissidents... rogue agents... and if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.<eos> Your record's expunged, but... there was a rub.<eos> I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you, including my son.
Old smuggling friends.<eos> Autonomous zone. No ISIL.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Not perfect.<eos> Four of you, one of me.
I don't think that's quite it.<eos> Welcome to Graceland.<eos> Don't just stand there and let the AC out.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What can I do for you fine folks?
Come on!<eos> Come on, Mike, come on.<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> Where are the tracks?<eos> This is for you.
Listen, Lincoln, he's gonna need a transfusion.<eos> Michael's B negative, okay?<eos> It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.<eos> You won't find it where you're going, and he won't make it while you look.<eos> Unless it comes to you.
Mm, I'm no sailor, but I know that no boat in that harbor is gonna get us that far.<eos> We need a big boat.<eos> One that doesn't mind a radioactive cargo, you know?<eos> Hey there, I wanted to follow up on our conversation.<eos> Obviously, the CIA and State, we've been sharing information on Kaniel Outis, but my question for you is: Outis killed Abu Ramal, did the country a service. So why were you still at NSA yesterday, trying to kill him?
What does this have to do with you?<eos> He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.<eos> And then he proved it to me.<eos> He said I could never see either one of you again. Or Mike.
show us what the tattoos mean even before the computers will, and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.<eos> You have to call this pay phone in France.<eos> Wait.<eos> Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.
Jesus Christ.<eos> Just take that and call it even.<eos> You have to order something.<eos> Fine, I'll just do it myself.<eos> If I break the rules for you,
Perception is a lie.<eos> Our happiness is real.<eos> You can share it with us.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> I'd rather die knowing who I really am... fucked up flaws and all... than to play house with freaks like you.
This man is the devil.<eos> He's been sent from hell to destroy everything we've built in Cronenburgh.<eos> Please, Reverend.<eos> All I did was turn off the happy gas.<eos> I was passing through your little hamlet when I stumbled up on you.
Brothers and sisters, the gas... the gas, the gas, the gas, the gas, the gas shows you what you want to see!<eos> Love, acceptance, perfection.<eos> But I see the world as it really is.<eos> Brutal and unforgiving.<eos> There's a reason your good Reverend here still looks human, while the rest of you all look like Satan's butthole.
- Oh, me too.<eos> What do you say we ditch this guy<eos> - and get the hell out of here? - Yeah, let's cut class.<eos> You could do that.<eos> And I could chase you and fight and blah, blah, blah.
You're too classy for me, too?<eos> Where's your boyfriend?<eos> We're just a team for the race.<eos> That's all.<eos> - I thought you guys were...
But they've already fucked to save their lives.<eos> See, that's called drama.<eos> Well it's a cross-country blood race with no racing.<eos> It's a mood piece.<eos> Let all compromise within you see inside of you.
Well it's a cross-country blood race with no racing.<eos> It's a mood piece.<eos> Let all compromise within you see inside of you.<eos> All choice lies within your own consciousness.<eos> It's entirely up to you.
I'm reconditioning you for life at Heart Enterprises.<eos> You must learn to sever yourself from compassion.<eos> Only then will you be effective as a cog in our clockwork. Or a cock trapped in mine.<eos> Never.<eos> I'll never join you.
Okay, now you've gotta be a big brave little dog while daddy goes in there, and... Cuts up some bacon for your breakfast.<eos> Give me some sugar.<eos> Happy Halloween.<eos> Your candy bowl's empty.<eos> So tell me... How long you crazy fucks been running this place?
Aki, whatever... whatever you're thinking about doing, you don't have to do it, you don't have to...<eos> If you want the best apple, you've gotta pluck it straight from the tree.<eos> Shit!<eos> Exactly.<eos> You guys go for the records.
Here.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Say hello to Christopher 2.0.<eos> [ominous music] [screams] [both screaming] Tell you what, let me do my job, and I'll pretend this little interrogation never happened.<eos> Not until you tell us the truth... about Karma, about Heart, about all the messed-up things you people have ever done.
No chocolates.<eos> - Just retribution. - [ding]<eos> You know, the drug just turns you on. You have to actually want to... screw in the first place.<eos> News flash:<eos> you two, you ain't so squeaky.
Ooh... ah! They're coming!<eos> ♪ [weakly] They're coming...<eos> Get in there.<eos> Look, uh, I used to resist all my urges too, but... not anymore.<eos> It's dangerous, you know, 'cause these... these urges, they keep growing inside you.
It's a date.<eos> Now we just got to keep Slink from blowing our heads up.<eos> Yeah, about that... Slink's not the problem anymore.<eos> [stirring orchestral music] In a single moment in the dead of night, this country broke in two.<eos> A fissure of death, a pain-filled gash... heaven to me, but hell to you.
Really?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Arthur Bailey.<eos> Mind you, it shouldn't surprise me.<eos> You two have never really vibed that way.
You know, you're tough and street-smart, and sort of, uh... a murderer.<eos> Good morning, Blood Drivers.<eos> Forgive my absence.<eos> Last night's excitement left me in a sticky situation.<eos> Pretty sure that some of you out there might just be able to relate, but this morning we begin with the most frightening words in all of Blood Drive:
This vehicle is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing, you don't sell it.<eos> You admire it.<eos> - You girls done kissing each other?<eos> - Town's this way.<eos> - Hey, if it's okay with you guys, I think I'm gonna stay here and see if I can make myself useful.
He was the one footing the bills.<eos> I mean, I'm... I'm not a monster. I kept her here as long as I could, but I had to let go of most of my staff, and Nora showed progress.<eos> She was my patient.<eos> I should've been notified of her release. When she left the facility, she was calm, she was stable. You mean doped up?<eos> Look, whatever happened between you two, the medication had nothing to do with it.
How many more people will they kill while we wait?<eos> Make the call.<eos> I got to get a better view.<eos> Now, if the racers would please line up at the front of the stage...<eos> As some of you know, we had a few quitters last year.
It was a delight to meet you, young lady. Oh.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> And you tell your friends, even if they already Have a will, it's important to get it updated, Just like you did.<eos> I'll tell them.<eos> Now, you remember Francesca... She'll take care of you the rest of the way.
And I gave the order.<eos> You will clean up this mess, and you will get the fuck back to work.<eos> The Expanse - 02x13<eos> - Caliban's War<eos> Well, it looks like you guys have some shit you need to figure out.
Look, we both know how this goes.<eos> Important, powerful people start fighting each other, it's people like us that die.<eos> I've got nothing against you.<eos> You've got nothing against me.<eos> I need to keep control of the undersecretary. Not you.
I'm slammed at the office.<eos> What?<eos> Well, we'll wait for you.<eos> Oh, no, I might be a while.<eos> You guys just go ahead.
I mean, usually it was about how, like... we shouldn't get dessert at the restaurant because we have plenty of ice cream at home, sort of thing.<eos> - Yeah. - But still, very mad.<eos> We always ordered dessert, no question.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You guys were a real, uh, Richie Rich family, huh?
- Did you know about this?<eos> - No. But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.<eos> Maryse went behind my back.<eos> My fellow Shadowhunters.<eos> It's an honor to be here with you all.
Everyone run.<eos> Get out. Out, now.<eos> Hey, out!<eos> Hey!<eos> Which one of you is Maria?
Izzy and Alec are the best we've got.<eos> They stay in.<eos> Izzy...<eos> Izzy, please. You wouldn't want to be benched on this.<eos> Let me come with you.
- None of this is your fault.<eos> Alec, he's stressed out.<eos> With his parabatai gone, he's like a different person.<eos> Alec's right.<eos> I'm not one of you.
Why aren't you getting ready?<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I'm not going through with it.<eos> That's hysterical.<eos> Whatever happened between you two, why don't you just kiss and make up?
Well, I thought if anyone would understand, it would be you.<eos> - You don't have one.<eos> - I've never wanted one.<eos> But you and Jace click.<eos> Everyone knows you guys are better fighters together than you are apart.
Please come back with us.<eos> We need you.<eos> Clary needs you.<eos> You think that I don't wanna be there for Clary?<eos> For all of you?
Luke's Maia.<eos> Well, she's not technically Luke's.<eos> I mean, they're part of the same pack, but that's...<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Uh, so, you guys are hanging out?
Luke, don't!<eos> We need her.<eos> Smells like Shadowhunter.<eos> No need to worry. I'm not here on official business.<eos> And what other kind of business do people like you have?
What do you mean he won't be here?<eos> He's tied up with the Valentine task force in Idris.<eos> I can't believe Dad would miss this.<eos> He doesn't have a choice.<eos> We're all on high alert, especially after what that demon did to both of you and Jocelyn.
What happened?<eos> Someone has taken my spell book.<eos> You're putting your wards up?<eos> Nobody leaves until I get it back.<eos> I was this close to lining up a three-way and you guys let yourselves get spelled?
Someone with access to the Mortal Cup.<eos> Circle Members.<eos> They released the Greater Demon to break you out of here.<eos> I thought I raised you to have common sense.<eos> If the Greater Demon wanted to free me, how would I still be here having this inane conversation with you two?
Looks nice.<eos> It does?<eos> Back to Raphael.<eos> How can I help?<eos> So... I heard you guys were kind of seeing each other, and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me out, doing that thing you're really good at, you know, making a man bend to your every will.
Well, I think I have a pretty good idea who it is.<eos> Really, Raphael?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Come on.<eos> You guys.
I really appreciate it.<eos> But, uh...<eos> I'm good.<eos> Alright, look.<eos> You guys seem really cool.
- to defeat him?<eos> - I gave him the amulet.<eos> It's a compass.<eos> Compasses generally find things.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?
Rip's being played by Adam Glassman.<eos> He's probably at craft services.<eos> It's nice to see your reputation for dry humor is well-earned.<eos> You see, this is what I am talking about.<eos> You guys are good.
It's Rip.<eos> Here's here in 1967.<eos> That's astonishing.<eos> How?<eos> We don't know, but Damien Darhk and Malcolm Merlyn are after him, which means you two cannot sit this one out.
- What's wrong?<eos> It's like I should have memories that aren't there, and I should understand what this is, but I don't.<eos> Yeah, I feel it, too, it's happening right now.<eos> I'm reading this book about "Santarion Long-inises," and it's just a bunch of words.<eos> How long have the two of you been feeling like this?
I'm sorry about my friends, they're just...<eos> - Completely insane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But what they say is true.<eos> Oh, okay, what... What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?
It's not that Captain Hunter's uncooperative.<eos> It's that he's not fully in possession of his marbles.<eos> So he won't tell us where the rest of the Spear of Destiny is?<eos> Uh, it's more like... can't.<eos> Which wouldn't be such a problem if you two idiots hadn't lost the Longinus Medallion.
Plus, Grey said Lily could hook the Medallion up with Gideon, so...<eos> Wait, she wants to try networking an ancient amulet with an advanced AI system?<eos> I'm totally helping. Fine.<eos> Then I would appreciate it if you...<eos> If none of you would reveal to her that she's an Aberration.
No one knows who to trust.<eos> So they all end up screwing each other over.<eos> It's an interesting theory.<eos> Which one are we?<eos> The point is that neither of you are Clint Eastwood and so neither of you end up going home with the gold.
We don't have time for this.<eos> Oh, I've got all the time in the world.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, you two have made your point.<eos> I need you as much as you need me, all right.
How could you let this happen? Us?<eos> You're the one that trusted him.<eos> I asked you to do one thing:<eos> watch a man tied to a chair!<eos> You idiots can't even do that!
You're handing me over to him.<eos> You can't. You can't.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> It's a small price to pay for saving the city.<eos> Yeah, for you.
A hacksaw?<eos> Even your disposal tactics are idiotic.<eos> Guess I'm just old-fashioned.<eos> Did you really think I wouldn't figure it out?<eos> The two of you have been whispering like teenagers for weeks.
- We don't wanna fight you.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> - Caitlin, I love you.<eos> - I never loved any of you.
Yeah, we get it.<eos> Yeah? Well, I say take her down.<eos> Overwatch!<eos> You heard the boss.<eos> This is an eyes-only operation for you.
I told you not to engage!<eos> We know.<eos> It's just...<eos> She, um, spooked us.<eos> You guys are terrible liars.
I wouldn't exactly call it tinkering. - One more thing. - Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> You put your hands on me like that one more time, and I'll kick your ass.<eos> Good talk.<eos> Ooh! This is why I usually leave the punching to you guys.
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?<eos> I think that somewhere out there there is a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy, and... now all we got to do is find her.<eos> I was thinking of ordering something that's, not on the menu?<eos> Hey. Where you going, baby?<eos> Seriously, could you two be any more of a cliche?
I was thinking of ordering something that's, not on the menu?<eos> Hey. Where you going, baby?<eos> Seriously, could you two be any more of a cliche?<eos> Don't worry, sweetheart. There's plenty of me to go around.<eos> I thought people like you only existed in the movies.
I'm sorry, Tina.<eos> Aw, so sweet.<eos> I thought you two were just cop buddies, but... You can tell me, Vin.<eos> You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?<eos> Heh heh heh. I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.
- No.<eos> We are orphans because of those two.<eos> You know what I'm up against here.<eos> Yeah, so why are you sending Curtis and I away?<eos> Because I need the two of you to keep Felicity and Samantha safe.
Hoss, you ok?<eos> Rene.<eos> Ok, everyone.<eos> Calm down.<eos> The four of you are gonna have plenty of time to catch up.
All right. Go. Quick.<eos> Get her out of here. All of you, go!<eos> - This is insane!<eos> Go after the rest.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Sam Phillips.<eos> Man, Clem, did we have us a session last night.<eos> - Just now got through.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Now I hope you boys ain't that crazy or I'm gonna have to tack on a hefty clean-up charge.
Hmm? You're recording a Catholic funeral in Covington tomorrow!<eos> Would you ask yourself, "How can I be more like our Savior?"<eos> Let us turn to the seventh chapter of the Gospel of Mark.<eos> Right here is where Jesus is beginning to preach the incoming kingdom of God, but more importantly, he is preaching with his actions.<eos> We find Our Savior in tire, for those of you who went with us to the Holy Land this past Easter, you would know that this is the furthest point that Jesus went in his ministry.
I'm sorry, we can be accommodating, but I am tired of bending over backwards.<eos> We all have our own things to worry about.<eos> I'm sorry, are you kidding me?<eos> Oh, Jean, no, I was just saying that...<eos> I've done nothing but try to make a nice party for you guys so you can day drink and bitch about your husbands.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Yeah. - No, well...<eos> - That's a shame.<eos> I mean, we were not really a great fit.<eos> Ahh, no, I feel like you guys, you know, started dating, you got married, right?
Is that a cultural thing?<eos> Like, you send crickets or something?<eos> No, you brought up crickets, and I had brought up the three days, and that was the connection.<eos> Right. Yeah. No, I thought it maybe was an Australian thing or something.<eos> When I heard we were merging with you guys at Subzero, I was so excited, 'cause you bring that real East Coast energy to the table, - and I'm from Jersey, so I get it, and... - Jersey.
I had no idea.<eos> Well, he didn't tell me until yesterday.<eos> My dad's Mr. Casual. But it's cool.<eos> It'll be good to see him, I think.<eos> That's cool. I'm sure you guys will have a fun time.
It's too much pressure.<eos> I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> I think you're just feeling this way because you guys have been cooped up in this house together.<eos> If he goes, "I'm proud of you," one more time, I'm gonna slit his fucking throat.<eos> So, you guys know Mickey?
I've never seen such a sad grown-up.<eos> - Can we get the check?<eos> - Oh, this is embarrassing.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> Man, I don't mean to dump everything out on you guys or...
No retirement for you, pal.<eos> Now you're stuck with me. I'm not sticking around just to keep you company.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - No I'm not.<eos> You guys headed downtown?
Ooh, hey.<eos> Heard you're getting a new roommate.<eos> - Hope she doesn't keep you up all night. - Huh?<eos> Isabella?<eos> Ana and Isabella are moving in with you guys, right?
It's crunchy.<eos> And listen, thanks for letting us invite our friends, - you know, they were pretty insistent.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And you kids, you have to invite your significant others, okay?
I could read it for you if it's not too personal.<eos> Yeah-yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's see what Miss Emma has to say.<eos> "Hey!" What is it with you kids and "hey"?
- Jesus!<eos> What's up, bro?<eos> When are you coming back to school?<eos> Soon.<eos> You... you guys are winning the meeting today?
Hey, so...<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Ana and Isabelle can take the one-bedroom down the hall.<eos> That way they'll be close by, but technically not living here.<eos> And then, when Ty gets out, you guys move into the one-bedroom - and Ana and Isabelle move in with me.
Previously on The Fosters...<eos> I've been thinking, when Ty gets out, you guys move into the one-bedroom, and Ana and Isabelle will move in with me.
An arrangement I'm going to refuse again.<eos> That part of my life is over.<eos> Well, then I cannot help you, but I can offer you some free advice.<eos> Act quickly, Oliver.<eos> The Markovians do not, as you Americans say, sit on their hands.
Proximity alarm!<eos> Walker knew we were coming.<eos> Heads-up!<eos> Get down!<eos> Are you guys hearing that?
I'm guessing those aren't fireworks.<eos> Recon, get those civilians clear.<eos> Backstop--<eos> Unh!<eos> I don't know who you gentlemen are, but I want to thank you for being so damn eager to find me!
What did you do?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Here's what does.<eos> I am who I am. Now I'm trying to work past that.<eos> Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I cannot-- I will not have the two of you make the same mistakes.
Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I cannot-- I will not have the two of you make the same mistakes.<eos> Oliver, you are the one that taught us that sometimes you have to get in the muck to make things right.<eos> Well, then Prometheus wins because he'll be right.<eos> I need the two of you to prove to him and, quite frankly, to prove to me that he's not.<eos> I need the two of you to be better than me because you are.
What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured. Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do. I owe it to them.<eos> I don't owe it to any of you.
If any of these allegations prove true, it would likely trigger impeachment proceedings.<eos> This might be the end of my administration.<eos> When did you learn the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone?<eos> Why did you protect the Green Arrow?<eos> There's no comment at this time, but we will have something for you shortly.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.
It feels gross saying...<eos> No.<eos> Uh, no. You're right.<eos> Ok. So quid pro quo.<eos> I help you, you help me.
The information we gave you didn't help?<eos> Different friend.<eos> You have a lot of missing friends.<eos> Yeah, and this time, I have no leads whatsoever.<eos> You guys have better resources than I do, and I have to use everything that I can to find him and do whatever you need me to do for you.
I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> Oliver, what happened?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did you mean by "shutting this all down"? Oliver, I really think that you should be checked out by an actual doctor.<eos> The only thing I need is for all of you to go home.
And what about Chase?<eos> He's still out there.<eos> We just have to remain alert. We're not just the anti-Prometheus team.<eos> There are a lot of people in this city who need saving.<eos> I'm on Chase. You guys just focus on protecting the city.
Otlichno.<eos> There is only small matter of my down payment.<eos> There's no down payment, Anatoly. I want Chase dead immediately.<eos> After last time, I need small gesture of goodwill so my men can see that you are serious.<eos> It's like you Americans say, "Let's make deal."
Oliver, please. I put on a hood, and I created a persona because, John, somewhere along the way, something in me broke.<eos> Something is sick inside of me.<eos> The crusade... all of this...<eos> The foundation of it is a lie.<eos> So I disbanded the team because I won't sit by and watch all of you participate in my murder spree.
John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the... The Bratva was the best option, but John insists that as a team, we can find another way to bring Chase to justice.<eos> You've put your faith in me, and I'm putting my faith in you now.
Are you saying you have no idea where he is?<eos> No. I'm saying that the details of an ongoing investigation are confidential.<eos> Yes? I spent the afternoon speaking with Gay Eked's father.<eos> What do you have to say to him and the families of all of Prometheus' victims?<eos> Well, I would say to them what I am saying to you.
- Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> God, no.<eos> - Oh! Why would you even think that?<eos> Well, because every time I come by, you guys are in the middle of exchanging longing looks for each other.
Oh! - Yeah.<eos> Oh, man. I... you know, I just remembered I have a date night with Paul, my husband.<eos> I have a date with my husband, so I...<eos> I have to go to that.<eos> You guys enjoy that, though. You enjoy that.
It's a hell of a big building.<eos> If he's in there, we should get started.<eos> If Chase wanted you here for some reason, he could have been more specific about which floor.<eos> Overwatch, can you narrow the search for us?<eos> Well, normally, yes, but right now the only heat signatures I'm reading in there are you two.
Here we go.<eos> Guys, we got a situation.<eos> - Yeah, so do we.<eos> - Sampson's on the move.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to let him make it without you.
Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I almost forgot what it was like to celebrate a birthday.<eos> That's because we're usually saving the city from being destroyed this time of year.<eos> This, uh, it's like summer break for you guys.
You know the Catholics consider purgatory to be... The immediate state following physical death?<eos> Konstantin, when I kill you this time,<eos> I'm gonna make sure you're dead.<eos> When we're done, the only person you'd want to kill is yourself.<eos> I'm just saying you could've taken a big knife and cut the tension between you two.
My instinct will be to pull you close.<eos> So do something he's not expecting.<eos> Split up.<eos> No, that's...<eos> What about you? If I don't have to worry about the two of you, then I can put my focus towards finding the others.
- Come on for 10 years i was a name on your Christmas card list, what did you meet your niece once when she was a baby?<eos> Even after she got sick you couldn't be bothered to call and try to be her uncle, get to know her before she...<eos> - No.<eos> You're right.<eos> Growing up you were always there for me, you, always had my back with mom, and when everything went to shit I should've been there for you.
- Seven years next month.<eos> - Congratulations, that's, that's great.<eos> - One day at a time, that's what they tell me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Here you go, that'll be 4.50 unless you guys wanna open a tab.
- Hey, Mr. Doyle!<eos> - I cast you out, out in the name of god!<eos> Riddley go ahead, riddley go ahead.<eos> Now this concludes what we can submit to you as documented evidence of the existence of demonic phenomena.<eos> Now, I know what many of you are thinking, and you're right, there's nothing that you haven't seen or heard here today that couldn't be explained away by a more conventional explanation.
- Okay.<eos> - That smell.<eos> Sarah?<eos> - Here, rub some of this under your nose.<eos> - I guess you guys are used to this?
Yes, sir.<eos> You probably shouldn't stay here now.<eos> Too many of the wrong people know where you live.<eos> You stay out of sight till we find out what's going on.<eos> You guys head back to the precinct.
I'm sort of half laughing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> That something's coming at us.<eos> I know you know where Burkhardt is.<eos> I will find him, and if either one of you gets in my way,
- I don't see anybody.<eos> - You won't.<eos> Franco.<eos> Hey, it's Wu. Where are you?<eos> Captain ordered me not to talk to you guys.
Shh. Stop talking. Please.<eos> Uh... [Laughs Nervously] - [Jamaican Accent] Hey,mon, everyting' irie?<eos> - Shh. Everyting far from "irie."<eos> It would seem like that.<eos> What do you guys call the white man?
- It's our stuff.<eos> Yeah. We're moving... inside.<eos> Bye.<eos> Oh, so it's like that, is it?<eos> I'm nothing to you?
No, that's not what you should be hearing.<eos> Then why you destroy our car?<eos> I didn't know it was a Jewish car.<eos> And what does a Jewish car even look like?<eos> You know, maybe New York is not for you guys.
It's our lives, not some game!<eos> Best to be completely honest, don't you think?<eos> There's nothing honest about that.<eos> Your highness, are we free to go?<eos> Oh yes. It seems one of you already has.
It was just a one-time thing.<eos> I went out with a couple of friends - and got a little carried away.<eos> - It's understandable.<eos> Clary told me what happened.<eos> Listen, I just want you to know, whatever's going on between you two, I'm always here for you.
The transfer is set for 0200.<eos> Jace, arm up the transport team.<eos> I want everyone carrying additional weaponry.<eos> Duncan, prepare Valentine's restraints.<eos> The rest of you secure the perimeter.
So you gave him passage to Idris?<eos> I wanted to protect my people, even those outside the safety of my realm.<eos> We Seelies understand the power of negotiation.<eos> Your idea of negotiation is putting the rest of the Downworld at risk.<eos> Which is just fine by you, isn't it?
Please!<eos> ♪ How we can change ♪<eos> Clarissa, I...<eos> I had no choice.<eos> The two of you together are too dangerous.
He was a finalist once.<eos> I got a friend at the paper says, houses are getting robbed all over town.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Let her do her job, Phil.<eos> Says it's been going on for months and you guys are nowhere on it.
Are you sure?<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> I mean a noise like that, it'd wake the boy and then we'd know about it, that's for sure.<eos> Is it just the two of you here?
What?<eos> So, the data chip from the pager we found on his body is still being analysed.<eos> But so far we've pulled information off it going back about erm...<eos> 12 weeks before he died.<eos> Now, I'm not sure how much you children know about pagers.
I'm worried you're getting sick again.<eos> I'm not getting sick again, Tony.<eos> Just cos I don't see the world exactly how you see it, how Elise sees it.<eos> What's Elise got to do with it?<eos> Oh, every time I disagree with either of you, I'm going nuts again.
Cos you haven't, in a while.<eos> - That's rubbish.<eos> I smile loads.<eos> - Do you?<eos> Well, I would, if you two didn't spend half your lives trying to drive me round the bloody bend.
Sara!<eos> Sara, are you there?<eos> Can you hear me, Sara?<eos> I just want you to know, we're all here for you if you want to talk.<eos> Any of you.
- I have no idea.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well... well, erm... .. like I said, I... I... I... don't even remember meeting him.<eos> Colin... .. we find that hard to believe.<eos> We've got photos of you with him, your number's in his diary.
Are you starting with me again?<eos> Take a compliment.<eos> Texas looks perfect.<eos> It's your hometown, right?<eos> Your hometown's only named after you because your family infested it like some hyper-breeding rats.
I cut off one head.<eos> Plenty more where he came from.<eos> So we cut off all the heads.<eos> Rule the whole system.<eos> The system rules you, kid.
All of you might be infected. We have to be sure.<eos> We swore an oath and have a duty to broadcast the truth to the system.<eos> Listen to me, Doctor, you have no idea what you're dealing with here.<eos> It's not a disease, it's obviously some kind of weapon.<eos> You Martians have been using these Belters as guinea pigs.

Holden!<eos> Alex, tap the brakes but do not lose visual.<eos> What the hell did we accomplish?<eos> You gotta stop following Eros.<eos> It's gonna defend itself, and my money ain't on you.
I wonder if he knew that his trip to Eros would be one-way.<eos> I think part of him never left that terrible little room where we found Julie.<eos> I don't think Miller wanted to be saved.<eos> Hmm. When I said we had to keep following Eros, I was ordering you, and Amos, and Alex to your deaths.<eos> None of you even questioned it.
Next door's a brothel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> You two enjoy yourselves.
They needed some time to work through that.<eos> And then Miller wanted to give his friend a proper burial at sea. Which means that it's none of your goddamn business.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> We're on the same team.<eos> That's the thing with all of you.
Yeah...<eos> It's done.<eos> _<eos> Sooner or later, it happens to us all.<eos> Me, you, everyone we love.
Why else would we be here?<eos> To guard soy beans, apparently.<eos> You wanted action, Stickman.<eos> You got it.<eos> Is this what passes for action with you Navy types, sir?
You seem annoyingly calm about all this.<eos> No. I'm scared shitless.<eos> Feeling guilty as hell.<eos> Please god, stop trying to take credit for every damn thing that's wrong in the universe.<eos> I'm talking about all of you.
So...<eos> Do you think the others have a sense about what's going on with us?<eos> I mean, Amos, in particular?<eos> We can make a public announcement, get everyone on the same page.<eos> Or take out an ad. No, it's just... I was never clear about how you two...
They look like prison guards.<eos> So what the plan, boss man?<eos> All right.<eos> Staz, split them up into four groups.<eos> Five of you guys come with me.
Staz, split them up into four groups.<eos> Five of you guys come with me.<eos> Stay sharp. Everybody stay sharp and watch the doors and corners.<eos> Doors and corners are where they get you.<eos> You four, with him, huh?
Okay, I think you're overreacting.<eos> - Overreacting?<eos> - Yeah. He's not on the lease.<eos> That means he's living here illegally.<eos> You... come on, you guys aren't gonna make this a big thing, are you?
Reverend Gillespie and Reverend Allsworthy are here, sir.<eos> Get rid of them. I need more pesky priests like a hole in the head.<eos> Reverend Gillespie and Reverend Allsworthy are HERE, sir.<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> What can I do for you?
Isaac is a truth teller!<eos> Three cheers for Isaac!<eos> - You freed us, Isaac.<eos> We're your men now.<eos> I have a surprise for you.
The devil's brother will destroy Mary unless you destroy him first.<eos> You must forge a dagger with that in it and kill him with the dagger.<eos> We must find out what Sebastian knows.<eos> If you have no magic, either, how can you expect to stop Sebastian?<eos> Alden is my past. You...
If you have no magic, either, how can you expect to stop Sebastian?<eos> Alden is my past. You...<eos> - are my future.<eos> - I believe that, Mary.<eos> I may not be able to change in an instant the way you feel about him, but I can change the way he feels about you.
I have saved his child.<eos> This baby would most likely have died in childbirth to a woman in such poor health as you.<eos> Do you not see all I have done for you?<eos> You... bitch.<eos> Your bastard child would have been born out of wedlock, and Cotton would have had no choice but to turn his back, deny his upstanding name to both of you.
Then it be a fool's errand.<eos> We want no orders from that foul dwarf hell itself excreted.<eos> I was sent by Mary.<eos> Tonight she plans to vanquish the boy.<eos> She can not do it without you.
It is a delicate matter.<eos> That I would prefer to discuss in private.<eos> My quarters are private, indeed... and quite occupied.<eos> But I'm always aroused by delicate situations.<eos> I will come to you.
Unlike my Father, I have no taste for virgins.<eos> Enjoy her.<eos> Until Sunday... when I will finally make her mine... body and soul.<eos> Now, what is it you wish to speak about?<eos> You have held my loyalty for centuries, my lord, but in Mary's embrace I faltered and, in secret, I've conspired against you.
We have both felt the thrust of the Dark Lord's goat deep inside us and given ourselves over to his lust.<eos> Let us not be modest.<eos> Now, where is this girl?<eos> Aren't you pretty?<eos> If it pleases you, Miss.
You and I are not only of one flesh... we are of one soul.<eos> Yours just as black as mine. No.<eos> No, I swallowed the bitter taste of evil, but in service of something greater.<eos> You only want greatness for yourself.<eos> - And for you.
To complete the task.<eos> Without any distraction... from you.<eos> N-No.<eos> You're no threat to me or mine now.<eos> None of you are.
Black Sunday is still coming.<eos> Death and destruction to Salem.<eos> Do not imagine you have killed my brother.<eos> You have only destroyed his mortal self... merely sent him back to hell.<eos> Now, more than ever, it is imperative that none of you open the wrong doors.
Please forgive me.<eos> While you work to save all our lives, I must see to one small but... precious life.<eos> My men guard the door.<eos> No one will disturb you.<eos> If anyone can save the people of this town, it's you two together.
You forgave yourself?<eos> No.<eos> He forgave me.<eos> My father is incapable of forgiveness... at least when it comes to my kind.<eos> With you I think it's possible to know everything, and yet understand nothing.
Can you hear me?<eos> Please.<eos> Please come to me, Mother!<eos> Please come to me, Mother.<eos> I need you.
So you've seen him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did he have a word for me?<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He thinks only of you.
Did he have a word for me?<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He thinks only of you.<eos> It keeps him going. He...<eos> He can't live without you.
- No, sir.<eos> 'Fraid no one's seen her.<eos> But we won't stop looking for her.<eos> If we can't protect an innocent little girl, what good are we?<eos> You men?
Let her go.<eos> Let her go.<eos> I won't take any hostages.<eos> It wouldn't do any good anyway.<eos> Mercy wouldn't lift a finger for you.
It wouldn't do any good anyway.<eos> Mercy wouldn't lift a finger for you.<eos> That ain't true!<eos> She loves us!<eos> Saved us all from lives of misery at the hands of sodding men like you!
It is not revenge I seek any more than a surgeon seeks revenge on the carcinoma he removes.<eos> You people are the carcinoma.<eos> You cannot hate the Puritans more than I.<eos> Were it only a matter of Puritans.<eos> They are but one tiny tribe of you criminals, murderers, and hypocrites.
I dare say Scott was the prettiest chorus girl the Triangle Club has ever had.<eos> Prettier than I am?<eos> I was as pretty as you are, and you're as handsome as me.<eos> We're two of a kind.<eos> Yes, although only one of you was propositioned by a pair of Princeton linemen.
Well, first of all, for the sheer pleasure of killing you myself.<eos> Secondly, bring back a little souvenir of your corpse to your Mary for the pain she's caused me.<eos> My Mary?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I admit that I failed to dislodge you from her heart.
Shane West<eos> Seth Gabel<eos> They're shouting my name!<eos> They will tear me apart.<eos> A fitting end for a man of the people... each shall have a piece of you.
They will tear me apart.<eos> A fitting end for a man of the people... each shall have a piece of you.<eos> Oh, shut up!<eos> I could kill you in an instant.<eos> They'll burn you out, and all of Knockers Hole with you.
Whilst it is indeed a bitter thing to have victory snatched from me, I am proud of you.<eos> You are a true Marburg.<eos> I will happily accept my new role, not as Queen, but as Queen-Mother.<eos> Thank you, Mother.<eos> But I've already learned everything I need to from you.
Let's go! Get it!<eos> Bring it back to the base.<eos> You should always be ready for attack.<eos> Get in fight position and grab a partner.<eos> And remember, no one is as strong as you.
- Oh, please, stop.<eos> You sure you don't wanna stay?<eos> I can't.<eos> I have a psych thing to go to.<eos> You guys have fun, though.
You know, the truth is... I don't think anything can replace that connection.<eos> As hard as we both might try.<eos> With each breath, you are letting go of the stress. The chaos of the day. Any negativity.<eos> Now breathe deeply.<eos> Feel your body beneath you.
Feel your body beneath you.<eos> The only thing that is real is this moment.<eos> Right here.<eos> Right now.<eos> As the world moves around you, you too are capable of moving.
Right now.<eos> As the world moves around you, you too are capable of moving.<eos> You are your single self.<eos> Not attached to anyone.<eos> Just as people and circumstances change, you also have a greater power within you.

This is not who I want to be, Jean.<eos> Look, I can't lose you... or Dolly.<eos> It doesn't compare, nothing compares.<eos> And I promise, I'm gonna be all in.<eos> I'll commit to you entirely.
I'll commit to you entirely.<eos> I'll give up everything.<eos> Please believe me, Michael.<eos> She's an active member of our community and our PTA, and she's also an expert on a subject that affects all of us.<eos> Some of you already know that I'm a cognitive behavioral therapist, and so I've been asked tonight to speak about how to prevent bullying in schools.
They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head, but I had nothing to do with it.<eos> Again, not my call.<eos> I was ready to fight you guys, but then, on the way home, it occurred to me there might be a better way. I'm going to start my own company.<eos> I will give up all of my equity in the video chat if I get to completely own my algorithm.<eos> I will grant you guys a perpetual license to use the algorithm in your video chat, but I need the algorithm to build something else.
Not you.<eos> I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.<eos> Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.<eos> I'll admit it.<eos> But I'm proud of you lot.
But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Cheer.<eos> Brave men, all of you.
Not just the boys.<eos> We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.<eos> You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?<eos> I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me.<eos> I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.
Indeed it is.<eos> You know, I went to pack, I couldn't even find the suitcase, let alone my kit and everything.<eos> And when I did find it, well, it was full of shells she had gathered on our last trip to Captiva.<eos> I sat on the bed for about an hour, just going through shells, staring into space.<eos> We always enjoyed our time down there with the two of you.
Excuse me.<eos> There he is.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> That's right!<eos> I remember you girls thinking it was the most adorable thing.
Just curious.<eos> If he wasn't in town mastering the record, he wouldn't have been here.<eos> But he was.<eos> So it made sense.<eos> Charity, is there something going on between you two?
Good evening, Calvary!<eos> Tonight, I am so excited to bring out two great friends of Calvary Fellowship.<eos> They flew here all the way from Los Angeles to be with us tonight.<eos> So, Calvary, please help me welcome back our friends Mary Mary!<eos> How many of you believe that 2017 is going to be your season?
Tonight, I am so excited to bring out two great friends of Calvary Fellowship.<eos> They flew here all the way from Los Angeles to be with us tonight.<eos> So, Calvary, please help me welcome back our friends Mary Mary!<eos> How many of you believe that 2017 is going to be your season?<eos> And you're going to get everything that God has for you?
And you?<eos> You are all alone, full with pain.<eos> The only one awake who sees it all.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> All of you who are suffering, you are not alone.
So if a storm of Katrina's proportion was to hit, they'd be screwed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And what about Calvary?<eos> Are we on the same floodplain?<eos> Technically, yes, but you guys built before the restrictions I'm talking about were put in place.
- Unless you...<eos> No.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> What a week this has been.<eos> Now, I don't know about you, but I feel renewed, revived, and recommitted.
- Mae. - Aaron.<eos> Lionel.<eos> Lionel.<eos> And, Lionel, thank you again.<eos> Thank you both.
No, there isn't.<eos> I'm the good sister, remember?<eos> My Lord.<eos> So, what is it, then?<eos> For nearly a year, the two of you have been at odds.
Because it wouldn't be a night if someone wasn't after me for something.<eos> I won't let you fire Kevin.<eos> Well, I have no immediate plans to.<eos> You had Aaron put that clause in.<eos> Because I wanted to be sure that we were protected if this war between the two of you were to escalate.
Wait, there's not a problem, is there? No.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, everything's fine.<eos> The baby's fine. We just, um... The doctor said that after losing the other twin, we should be extra careful.<eos> Well, we will pray for all of you.
- Been raised in the church.<eos> - Where has this Jacob been?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But whatever he's selling, they sure are buying it.<eos> Real with you all.
What are you doing?<eos> Stay the hell out of my business, you hear me?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> I told you he was not the problem.<eos> Kevin, I have no idea what is going on with the two of you.
But it's more than we usually spend.<eos> Kevin produced your last album.<eos> Why don't you just let kevie do it?<eos> No, kevin's not really a producer.<eos> What is going on between you two?
She did.<eos> Until we broke her spirit. And she ran off and left us.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry if I've misdirected my anger. About all this to him,<eos> But he seems to have drank the kool-aid you brewed. And between the two of you, I'm about to lose my mind.
Remember, she's the visitor on this date. She should be peeking around the corner at you.<eos> Now here she comes.<eos> Stick out your boobs and suck in your gut. - I can't, it's a baby. - {\Well, }Get your baby to suck in its gut{\*, then}!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> It's great to have a chance to meet you. Brian's told me how supportive you've been of his photography, and why wouldn't you be?
Oh, my god, "wet my whistle"?<eos> Who was talking just now, Humphrey Bogart? Okay, and was it my imagination or was Pam, like, super-clingy?<eos> Didn't work out well for me. It won't work out well for Pam.<eos> Lovely photos.<eos> Barren landscapes. Tell me, did you use an f-stop when you...
Got it. 43rd floor.<eos> Someone contact the President's staff.<eos> Someone's watching him.<eos> Dr. Osmond, what is it you want from us?<eos> I think it's more about what Hanka Robotics can do for you.
I will find him and I will kill him.<eos> It's what I am built for, isn't it?<eos> Locus Solus, safely reconfiguring your child's genetic structure.<eos> Families built better.<eos> What was going on with you at the hotel last night?
It feels like there's always this thick fog over my memory and I can't see through it.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Every single day I get screwed by my memories.<eos> It's better to be pure.<eos> Like you.
Your friend.<eos> Now what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
You know, the scan also turned up a number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the Deep Dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?
- What else I got?<eos> - They suit you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got night-vision, mile-zoom, and X-ray.<eos> I guess I see like you now.
Connecting.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Come here.<eos> I am shy.<eos> I'm not beautiful like you.
What are you doing to me?<eos> I have connected you to a network of my own creation.<eos> When I am finished in this world, my ghost can survive there and regenerate.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I became fascinated with you,
What are you talking about?<eos> I was conscious while they dismembered my body and discarded me like garbage.<eos> I was lying on a table, listening to doctors talk about how my mind had not meshed with the shell that they had built.<eos> How Project 2571 had failed, and they had to move on<eos> to you.
There is no place for us here.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not ready to leave.<eos> I belong here.<eos> I will always be there with you in your ghost.
Excuse me?<eos> That's real nice.<eos> That's real nice.<eos> You're a nice little girl.<eos> You know, I'm a police officer just like you.
You make it sound so simple.<eos> What about Judge Dawkins?<eos> Nobody cares that he signed off on Ed's plea deal.<eos> We're not talking about Judge Dawkins. We're talking about my brother.<eos> We're talking about you.
Look, you have your money, right?<eos> Why don't you just go?<eos> You've got everything.<eos> You've got a career. In fact, I heard you're running for the goddamn Senate.<eos> What does Ed have on you?
Reed Ethington, I'd like you to meet the two gentlemen our government has sent down here to assist us in our hour of need.<eos> So, let's head over to Morrow's place.<eos> If any of 'em are dumb enough to head home, it'd have to be Chris.<eos> We'll follow you.<eos> What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
Well.<eos> I can't go nowhere until after I meet up with Andy at ten.<eos> No, Chris, just you.<eos> Ed doesn't trust that Andy won't do something stupid.<eos> But he can trust you, right?
Robbing banks isn't exactly straight and narrow.<eos> Then why are you doing it?<eos> - That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.
- That's a stupid fucking question.<eos> - Why are you doing it?<eos> - For you.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You're doing it for you.
Yeah, I don't know.<eos> It just kinda felt like a two-chit tape.<eos> You know, now, especially. I hear you're running for the Senate.<eos> Burton, if you ever show up flaunting this tape in my face again, I swear to God, I'm gonna.<eos> Relax, hombre, you think I'm gonna care, when I'm drinking piña coladas on some deserted playa, about you and your 19-year-old fucking butt-buddy?
In the morning, we'll take it out, divvy it out to the other branches to be paid out to the farmers when they come to cash their checks.<eos> That'll be going on for a few days.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thank you. Thank you, my man.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> - Justice, Ed.<eos> - Justice. Justice for what?<eos> We couldn't just let you get away with it.<eos> Not you.
What are you talking about?<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.
Can't, I got plans with my kid. Call Alan.<eos> Okay, hot coffee.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I would like herbal tea, please.<eos> Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.
Karla, unlock the door.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You got $10,000?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna ride with you, your son is gonna ride with him... and we're gonna go get that money.
Another woman will come.<eos> You will see.<eos> There will be another.<eos> You will know her by the love she shows to you.<eos> Let the words you speak be the words that call me back to you.
Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing.<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.<eos> I know a little something of what it feels to be apart from the world.<eos> I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you.
I'm not saying that that what you hear isn't real, because anything we experience is real in its own way, but it's it's not what it pretends to be.<eos> It's important to understand that.<eos> I want to hear you speak.<eos> But I am not your enemy.<eos> I care about you.
Jakob.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Jakob.<eos> I'm going to look after you.
Well, Hitler wants Poland.<eos> It's what everyone's saying.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about it, I assure you.<eos> I'm a zoologist, not a politician.<eos> Mama, Jerzyk needs you! It's Kasia.
You paved the way with pigs.<eos> What a crack-brained idea, and what splendid luck for us!<eos> I'll work with him.<eos> We can keep our eye on him with the bison here.<eos> Well, he trusts you, that's clear.
Will you tell me your name?<eos> Mine is Antonina.<eos> A new hiding place can feel strange.<eos> But I promise you, you're going to be all right.<eos> I'll stay with you if you like.
But Papa's in Zalesie.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Your papa's in Zalesie.<eos> Good boy for reminding me.<eos> Your parents must be proud of you.
The whole point?<eos> No, it couldn't be that simple.<eos> Here's one.<eos> And then it was over.<eos> That's it for you.
Uh, we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim. Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.<eos> You know, I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we... we really need you on the road.
- Definitely not smokey.<eos> - No, it wasn't smokey.<eos> I really don't like rats.<eos> I don't like rats.<eos> It's more scared of you than you are of him. - Oh, oh!
'Cause every time we run that play...<eos> Everybody wanted to walk next to the Alpha male.<eos> Almost everybody.<eos> 'Cause he's right there every single time.<eos> Yep. Ethan, why do you always have this dog with you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.<eos> Did my, uh, girlfriend replacement just trip you?<eos> Very funny.<eos> - Relax, man. I'm kidding.<eos> - The dog's laughing at you.
Okay, well, maybe you should teach your dog some manners.<eos> I've been trying.<eos> He's, uh... he's not too smart.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you hear what he said about you?
Hey.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you both for the ride.
Yeah, if you want.<eos> I thought it'd be nice if we could get out of the house, get you out.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try, but you don't have to... You don't have to do this. You don't have to help me.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.<eos> With that.<eos> You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.<eos> You can't do this for me, Hannah.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
You read my mind.<eos> I think this is it, Tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.
Be sure he gets a good home.<eos> He's a good dog.<eos> Sure.<eos> No. No, don't leave me here.<eos> This is a white-coat place. I belong with you.
But I guess he's not home.<eos> Hi, Ethan.<eos> Hi, Hannah.<eos> I brought your dog home.<eos> Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.
Thanks.<eos> Well, this place is still the same.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> So, what about you?
Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Hannah.<eos> I owe you an apology.
A sad, pointless charade built on lies.<eos> You have to have the courage to go your own way.<eos> Happiness is hard to come by.<eos> Sure as hell aren't gonna find it in some stupid gadget.<eos> There you are, tapping on some little box... while the real shit is happening all around you, dumbass.
Good deal.<eos> Wife?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hey, asshole!<eos> I'm talking to you.
You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old... Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.
The real Pippi.<eos> And I think that maybe... maybe I still know her.<eos> It's been really hard.<eos> I had some bad years.<eos> I am so... proud of you.
When are you done?<eos> Wilson.<eos> I can't.<eos> We're short tonight.<eos> No, I got a great surprise for you.
Thank God.<eos> So... what do you want to do about this?<eos> Wilson, I've seen it.<eos> Don't you do another goddamn thing.<eos> I can't even catch my breath around you. Enough!
And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.<eos> Your grandpa wrote a well-regarded novel about Melville, and... Pippi's maternal grandfather was a famous judge in Ohio, and...<eos> Shit!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Well, it's been... truly amazing getting a chance to have this time with you.
Come on.<eos> How about I take you for ice cream?<eos> Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> Yeah, let's get the fat girl some ice cream.<eos> Hey, not everybody's out to get you, Claire.
My mom can't even work the stove.<eos> Well...<eos> They took in an innocent baby and raised it as their own.<eos> Folks like that are the heroes of this world.<eos> Yeah, they could spend a little more time with you.
Bullshit.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I just had this thought of like...<eos> What if I showed up with you and Claire?
Pippi.<eos> I was afraid I'd never see you again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to know that I fully understand why you didn't come to Dad's funeral.<eos> And I also know that things were tougher for you after I left.
Yeah, they got a big house. Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?<eos> Or was that their idea?<eos> They must really trust you to let her stay here for the weekend.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.
When Claire turned on me at the trial... I don't think I've ever been more devastated.<eos> I just thank you for not testifying against me.<eos> Yeah, but I should've been up there fighting for you.<eos> I wondered about that.<eos> I could've been there for you, and I... I totally failed you, Wilson.
I'm all done with that life.<eos> Are you headed to school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, good for you. Good boy.
We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> So whatever happened with you and Francisco?
What are you talking about?<eos> I can't move to Portland.<eos> Oh, no, I know.<eos> I wasn't, you know, suggesting...<eos> I know this is a really emotional issue for you... but you have to accept that she's not your daughter.
Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I come in peace.<eos> I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.
I just wanted to talk to you and your wife.<eos> I'll get a restraining order if I have to.<eos> Please, I mean no harm.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> I wanted a chance... to get to know you and Mrs. Cassiday a little.
The little fucker might like me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I really have to just take stock of my life.<eos> Start counting my blessings.<eos> The fact is, I got it pretty good here with you, Shelly.
- Henry.<eos> What have you done?<eos> - I said I'd find you. - Look at me, son.<eos> - I don't care!<eos> - There is no place for you on the Dutchman.
A treasure that holds all the power of the sea,<eos> The Trident of Poseidon, can break your curse.<eos> Henry.<eos> The Trident can never be found.<eos> I found you.
Henry.<eos> The Trident can never be found.<eos> I found you.<eos> - It's just a tale.<eos> - Like the tales of you. And Captain Jack Sparrow?
It was a troll of rotten wood.<eos> - Gold of King Midas.<eos> - A pile of donkey dung.<eos> Face it Jack.<eos> Bad luck dogs you, day night.
All of ya!<eos> Dismissed!<eos> Never sail with Captain Jack Sparrow again.<eos> Tell you that.<eos> The whole town speaks of you.
Quite happily he's dead.<eos> Very, very dead.<eos> Ship went down..<eos> Inside the triangle.<eos> He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge.
As the dead man's tale is told..<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said your compass was the key, his escape.<eos> An army of dead, are coming straight for you, Jack.
And I cursed your enemies.<eos> But now you come to me with fear.<eos> As the dead have taken command over the sea.<eos> And what would the dead be wanting with me?<eos> Not you, Captain.
And a pirate's greatest fear will be Salazar, is it?<eos> - How did you get this?<eos> - I have my ways.<eos> Lead them to Jack before he finds the trident.<eos> And all your treasure will come back to you.
- The Trident controls the seas.<eos> No, no.<eos> There is no treasure.<eos> There is no treasure. I can't save him.<eos> He'll die with you.
I want to know where that pirate is going, with that witch.<eos> Your destiny is in these stars.<eos> I will set your course.<eos> No Spaghetti walls.<eos> Why did I bother coming to you?
There's no mercy.<eos> Make ready.<eos> - Adios!<eos> - Fire!<eos> It's up to you now Jack.
No shame in that dear.<eos> We'll all have to earn a living, eh?<eos> No, I'm a horologist.<eos> So was my mum.<eos> But she didn't cry a bad as lad as you.
More like a horizontally, reclined.<eos> Horology is the study of time.<eos> And she was always looking at watch.<eos> I can vouch for that.<eos> So no one can find the X, but you, right?
Get the anchor up, quick!<eos> Stop, stop, bring it up.<eos> Bring it up!<eos> Capitan! Oh, crap! I've got ya.<eos> Who am I to you?
Indeed.<eos> Welcome back, Captain.<eos> I thank you very much, coming through.<eos> - Captain!<eos> - Thank you, I remember you.
I'm used to it, believe me.<eos> - ♪ Sh-boom, sh-boom... ♪ - The fuck you looking at?<eos> Annette, you have a fucking heart attack, I'm not giving you mouth-to-mouth. ♪ Ya, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da... ♪<eos> Just so we're clear.<eos> Behind you is not the place to be.
It is a day that will be in bold print in history books.<eos> Black Monday, October 19th, 1987, when the stock market went into a free fall, losing more in one day than it did on Black Tuesday in 1929.<eos> Fucking rigged.<eos> How to fuck the little guy.<eos> I wonder if I can count on you. Frank:
I don't want you mad at me you missed out.<eos> All right.<eos> How much do you want me to put in?<eos> 250.<eos> - On top of the 300 million I already have with you?
You should attend to him, hmm?<eos> You okay?<eos> What's wrong with him, Picower?<eos> He's one strange, sicko fuck.<eos> Oh, by the way, my sister, she's worried about the economy and she was thinking about investing the rest of her savings with you.
I have to be at the office first thing in the morning.<eos> - Founder of Home Depot. - Reschedule.<eos> - You know...<eos> - This fucking thing.<eos> If you ever trusted me to help you with the advisory, you know, I could handle this kind of thing for you.
- I go to that fucking office every single day.<eos> I do the same thing that he does.<eos> I gave you a fucking business to run.<eos> Are you not happy with that?<eos> Was that not good enough for you?
It is definitely good enough for me, Dad.<eos> - I'm just trying...<eos> - Well, then shut the fuck up and give me a little fucking gratitude.<eos> Say, "I'm... thanks, Dad." Can't you do that?<eos> What, do you think the whole fucking world owes you something?
This is the problem with having money, an education.<eos> Nothing is earned.<eos> You want something, you gotta fucking work for it.<eos> What, you don't think I have?<eos> For you, it was installing sprinklers.
- This is about you.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> It's just hard because I know he's gonna be disappointed.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> I am very proud of you.
What has been called the largest Ponzi scheme ever. As we know, Bernie Madoff has continued to maintain that he and only he perpetuated this crime.<eos> But it's clear the money trail is not real.<eos> Catherine: Every day, Mark sends you articles, things he's read, things that pissed him off.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> It's not fair to you and it's not fair to me.
Well, what I wrote to him was,<eos> "Bernie, while I will not send you pictures of your grandchildren, there is one picture I do want you to see.<eos> That last picture of your son Mark.<eos> You owe it to his widow, his children, his brother, his mother.<eos> So, here is what I wish for you, Bernie.

Ruth: I can't keep coming here.<eos> I want a relationship with Andy and he won't see me if I keep coming here.<eos> I can't have it both ways.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> And I can't talk to you anymore.
No, I understand.<eos> And I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> You can't write to me or call me.<eos> It'll be too hard.<eos> Ruth, all I want is what's best for you and for the boys.
I don't think after losing a child things ever get better.<eos> I don't see much of a future for me.<eos> And I don't really care if I have one.<eos> The future's hard.<eos> Yeah, I was sorry to see that "People Magazine" used that photo of you and Mark when he was a boy.
And I don't really care if I have one.<eos> The future's hard.<eos> Yeah, I was sorry to see that "People Magazine" used that photo of you and Mark when he was a boy.<eos> I can never forgive you, Bernie.<eos> And yet I'm not angry at you.
For a while.<eos> Have we arrived in time to save you from each other?<eos> UTHER:<eos> The only person I need saving from is you.<eos> I came for the child, not you.
Still so handsome, my king.<eos> Why has the water dropped?<eos> Why does the sword reveal itself now?<eos> I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.<eos> As your power increases, so, too, do the forces that will oppose you.
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.<eos> SYREN 1:<eos> Find the boy.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And the sword will answer only to you.
For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> He got that moniker 'cause he keeps slipping out from the bars you keep putting him behind.<eos> He was found in this establishment, and that doesn't look good for you.
Well, none of them are house-trained.<eos> - I thought you'd warned them.<eos> - I did.<eos> They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.
I feel a joke coming on here.<eos> You ask him for it.<eos> - You're paying and then you're leaving.<eos> - (SPEAKING NORWEGIAN)<eos> Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.
And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.<eos> Because for the first time, there's something you don't know.<eos> Something nobody told you.
Excuse me, mate.<eos> Oi.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Behind you, pal.
And you will help me.<eos> (PEOPLE CLAMORING)<eos> Bring him here.<eos> There's a crowd of thousands out there.<eos> They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.
You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> SOLDIERS:<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.
King Vortigern!<eos> VORTIGERN: They may have come for you, but they will leave and will leave with a lasting impression of me.<eos> They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.
Someone gonna tell me where we're going?<eos> No.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> So what is it you're looking at, then?<eos> Are you falling for me like I'm falling for you?
It's all gone.<eos> They torched the lot.<eos> I said, go on.<eos> You should be flattered, mate.<eos> Even Mercia left the castle to look for you and that sword.
You need to tease it out.<eos> You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.<eos> What you need is this little rabble.<eos> Okay, so how's that gonna work?<eos> If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere, you can let yourself out the side door.
Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.<eos> You will face it when it's worth it to you.
- (METAL CLANGING) - (MEN EXCLAIMING)<eos> (PANTING)<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> BILL:<eos> After you.
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll need a little breather.<eos> Here, load everyone else up and come back for me.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.
But who would I rather be?<eos> What do you want, kid?<eos> Who's this young man?<eos> I'm the cleaner, sir.<eos> Who's he to you?
George?<eos> Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium.<eos> Across the whole country.<eos> People are fighting for you.
But you, along with all living creatures need only call me Master!<eos> Warriors?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> - You got a problem?<eos> - I don't trust you.
It's just over that ridge.<eos> Keep your red eye open, we're in annelid territory.<eos> - What's an annelid?<eos> - You don't want to know!<eos> After you.
I can't let them put their hands on you again.<eos> I don't matter!<eos> - You've always been so strong.<eos> - We must fight to protect what is ours.<eos> I know Father never said it, but he is proud of you.
Allied yourself with an abomination from our past!<eos> You tricked me into revealing the resonance frequency...<eos> - ...and you have a delusion of conquest?<eos> - It's not a delusion if you can do it!<eos> - This isn't like you!
- Now I understand.<eos> You were the oldest, yet Father chose to pass his mantel on to me.<eos> He must've recognized what I did not.<eos> You are unworthy!<eos> Regardless of what happens to me, Ares will stand against you!
These are friends.<eos> I'm here on a secret mission.<eos> A mission you can now assist me with.<eos> Something's not right, Princess.<eos> Those who stand beside you are friends to no one.
A Saurian.<eos> It seems I'm not the only one traveling with unlikely allies.<eos> Please do not interfere.<eos> Your voice is kind but your intentions remain unclear.<eos> Let me spell it out for you.
Crotalus.<eos> - Cover me.<eos> - What?<eos> Cover me!<eos> It's an honor to fight beside you.
I know.<eos> Your people have risen from the ashes of the past.<eos> Been reborn.<eos> You will lead them to greatness.<eos> With men like you and Saber by my side, we can build a brighter future.
Aresian power core installed.<eos> Ion engine capacity improved by 300%.<eos> Weapons upgraded.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I have something for you.
Me and my partner got the call.<eos> You did?<eos> Anyway, I was just looking out for a fellow officer.<eos> You should put some ice on that. Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'll get some for you, too.
You got room.<eos> Yeah, I got room.<eos> What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with. You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!<eos> You see now... I love your mom, I love you.
You have a job.<eos> A good one.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.<eos> Let me have a water, please.<eos> From what I buy from you for the clients here, I... I save a little back every month.
Are you okay?<eos> You know, a guy gets beat up on the job, and everyone congratulates him on the size of his balls. But if I get hit, everyone acts like I need Scotch tape and a shrink to get put back together.<eos> No, you know what?<eos> This isn't about this, all right?<eos> It's about your state of mind. You missed things that were right in front of you and you put yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time and you almost got yourself killed.
They got Thomas. I'm fucked anyway.<eos> We been friends 20 years.<eos> You gonna fuckin' rat on me?<eos> What do you mean, rat on you?<eos> I got all the information on you and could've took you down.
Where are you?<eos> I'm still at the Luxus casino.<eos> What the fuck is going on, Vin?<eos> Listen.<eos> Everything I do is about you and him. You know it's always been that, right?
Hold on.<eos> Get back! Get back!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Stanley Rubino, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
A few additions.<eos> There you go.<eos> You gonna square up?<eos> I'll give it to Hank on delivery, Wednesday.<eos> Is that all right with you?
- Yeah?<eos> Coming.<eos> That was a real smart move back there.<eos> I shouldn't have done that. I know, yeah.<eos> You know, I used to meet a friend of mine in places like this until an asshole like you ran him off the road! Hey!
Well, we are close to my place, and I got a guest room.<eos> You can use it for the night, have a hot shower.<eos> Look, don't feel like you owe me, okay?<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> I would be at the hospital without you back there.
How you holding up?<eos> Good.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm proud of you.
- I'm done. - No, listen to me!<eos> You owe this to me.<eos> It was up to me to pick you up on the road.<eos> My decision, my idea, it was always my story.<eos> Was it real enough for you?
Where are you?<eos> I miss you.<eos> You take a look at this.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I said I wouldn't go without you...
Ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh..wow.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oram, behind you, look.
Faris, what going on?<eos> Just stay here.<eos> I'm gonna get Oram.<eos> LOCKED.<eos> Oram, I need you back here right now.
Covenant.<eos> Covenant.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Covenant, come in.<eos> I will always be with you.
What the fuck was that?<eos> Okay?<eos> There is another one!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Behind you!
Entirely unworthy of his creation.<eos> I pitied him at the end.<eos> Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.<eos> Bravo!<eos> You have symphonies in you, brother.
No.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> Exactly what I am going to do to you.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> I can see why Walter thought so much of you.
It's a canal system leading all the way to...<eos> Get the lights!<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Get everything out of the bags.<eos> What did I tell you?
- It bit me!<eos> Enough of this!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I'm leaving!<eos> With or without you! I'm leaving!
What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.<eos> She's got plans for you, Nick.
Just give in.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> They will kill you just as they killed my chosen before you.
What was I supposed to tell you?<eos> Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?<eos> When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.
When Henry came to me i took the job because we had a common interest.<eos> So you are using each other.<eos> Now, she's using you.<eos> Look.<eos> Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.
You did this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.<eos> Not you.
Have you gained weight?<eos> It looks good on you.<eos> What say you let your soul mate play a few hands, Jason?<eos> Maybe he'd change my luck.<eos> He'd definitely be less mopey than you.
Now, that's a losing hand for the ages.<eos> Now, read them and...<eos> - What?<eos> - Do they have an eye doctor in hell?<eos> - I'd make an appointment if I was you.
- Sorry, mate, I'm using that.<eos> Situation here, Jason.<eos> It's time to call your better half.<eos> Sorry, John, you're on your own.<eos> Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and feed them to you, Constantine.
Into the House!<eos> - Z, you all right?<eos> - Yeah, as soon as you get off me.<eos> I should have known you were the reason I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.<eos> The House always did like you better.
Come on!<eos> It's a dream team.<eos> You, me, Zatanna, Batman, maybe even the Justice League.<eos> The capes and tights crew, useless against dark magic.<eos> That's why we need you.
Why don't you go do something useful, like haunt a house?<eos> - Who's he talking to now?<eos> - Shrouds.<eos> They deliver souls to hell.<eos> They're drawn to you.
Unbelievable.<eos> - I tried to tell him on the way.<eos> - Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.<eos> Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie.
Your anger is understandable, but you need to reconsider.<eos> Innocent lives are at stake.<eos> Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.
This isn't over.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Release me, Merlin, from your care. My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible, friend Demon.<eos> I apologize to both you and Jason Blood, but your future portends a shared destiny.
Hell, I should have put it together.<eos> Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.<eos> The League had a run-in with Faust, but his location isn't in our database.<eos> Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of signing up for credit cards or social media.<eos> His grandly named Observatory of the Cosmos is hidden from the likes of you and Superman, but not from me.
Fight others of your filthy kind.<eos> From hell though we may be, it does not make us family!<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> No woman can speak in my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> I conjured it just for you and, of course, men everywhere.
So Constantine calls once more.<eos> Just like a greedy, wanton...<eos> Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!<eos> Killjoy.<eos> I've had many years to think about you, Etrigan.
And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.
And I had to sit across from him.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Al.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I never told you this, but I've seen you perform a few times.
Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,<eos> "You get straight A's, you get a puppy."<eos> I like your confidence.<eos> Must have got that from you, young man.
Oh, I hear you.<eos> I hear you real good.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think we owe it to ourselves to live every single day that we have.<eos> I feel that I really want to get to know you better. Share a meal with you.
Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> My business is my business, kid.<eos> Forget that you know it.<eos> And if in the end, I don't come back, it's on you.
Okay, gents.<eos> Let's mingle.<eos> Three in a row wins a prize!<eos> Hello, Paulie.<eos> Hot enough for you?
Rabies, distemper, Bordetella.<eos> He's been neutered.<eos> All the papers are in the proper order.<eos> You take your cut?<eos> No. Not from you.
Bernoulli's theorem will be on test next week. Uh hey Mindy, could you, uh, stick around for a nanosecond?<eos> Oh, did my Spectro floato-meter malfunction.<eos> I knew I should have gotten...<eos> Hey, slow down, Sonic.<eos> I spoke with my old roommate who is on the alumni board at MIT and she agreed to set up a special interview for you. Are you serious?
You're all mean!<eos> Jodi!<eos> You're late.<eos> How epic was prank eight?<eos> I want to be you when I grow up.
Someone tagged a photo of her on a box of tampons.<eos> - That is really not right.<eos> - Oh my god.<eos> That prank was pretty twisted, Whitney.<eos> Even for you. I mean, how mental do you have to be to put that much effort into messing with a couple of nerds who were just trying to make peace?
Yeah!<eos> Oh.<eos> You know, one day we are gonna look back on this and it is going to be...<eos> Uh just stop, Mindy.<eos> I told you this was gonna happen. People like Whitney don't change.
No.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Boom!<eos> And so it was.<eos> The revolution was born. And Tina Fey, if you're listening, I'd still play piccolo for you.
You do realize that this is a meeting to launch a social revolution.<eos> Yup, I'm in.<eos> Whatever you guys need.<eos> Oh great.<eos> Well why don't you take a seat inside and we will be with you shortly.
What?<eos> We tried to talk to all the different groups, but nobody wanted to join the cause.<eos> Well of course not.<eos> You think all the outcasts are the same, but really we're like snowflakes, snowflakes that hate each other.<eos> Let me break it down for you. You've got your basic overachievers, your underachievers, your emos, your goths, your bandos, your drama dorks, orchestra oddballs and gleeks.
These three files represent the king pins of the school's underclass.<eos> Convince them and you have a shot at this thing. The key is figuring out what makes people tick and then exploiting it mercilessly.<eos> I like you, Virginia even if you are named after a slave state. First up, Howard Chang, leader of the young entrepreneurs.<eos> Points of weakness, black mock turtlenecks, technology savvy women and the word billion.<eos> I get what you guys are going for. I think it's very innovative, but it's just not right for us.
- Like Dave.<eos> So do you know anyone who can get me into the Whitney protection program?<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> And for you.
Fine, we'll just chalk it up to equal parts creepy.<eos> I don't know where this goes.<eos> So... Friends it is?<eos> Yeah, in the interest of not having our family tree go in a circle friends.<eos> I'm sorry, I realize referencing having children with you makes it more creepy.
Mr. Samuels.<eos> Why didn't you defend me?<eos> What do you want me to do, Mindy?<eos> You went to MIT, the greatest academic institution in the known universe and you're still being bullied by an overgrown frat boy.<eos> Oh my god, you totally broke her. Law 42, strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. Straight back to you.
Unless the only way to end suffering is to end desire.<eos> But the illogical and futile nature of desire will inevitably win out over our rational nature. This punch...<eos> Is good.<eos> I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.<eos> I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.
I know that everybody loves Harry, but I can certainly appreciate Zayn's brooding charm, but for my money, Liam is the unsung hero of One Direction.<eos> I find everything about you repulsive, yet I'm strangely drawn to you.<eos> That is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to me.<eos> I love you, man. Yes homo.<eos> I find myself incredibly attracted to you despite that pantsuit.
I don't, I don't... Expose the truth.<eos> Nice.<eos> Some best friend you are. I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?<eos> I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were. I told you you couldn't trust her. And now all of a sudden you're, you're, you guys are BFFs?<eos> Yeah because between you and Whitney,
Jodi Shallenberger!<eos> Oh my god!<eos> I couldn't.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
And we made it through.<eos> We're members of society, we have the diploma.<eos> We can prove it to everyone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, well done. Well done to you too.
You ruined my fucking life, Mark.<eos> You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, amigo.<eos> Fucking shit! I did what I could for you!
It will be fine.<eos> Where is she?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Saved your life, though.<eos> This is for you.
I'll need an office if I am to be Madame Veronika.<eos> All right.<eos> Your office... ls there.<eos> You have money for all this?<eos> I'm gonna find the money and I'm gonna do this for you.
It's an hourly rate.<eos> 'Course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mark.<eos> She's too young for you.
And you realise what's at stake here?<eos> I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika. And if I don't get it up and running soon, she's gonna leave me.<eos> - Fucking leave you anyway.<eos> - No, it's not gonna happen.<eos> - Is she actually even with you?
Choose watching history repeat itself.<eos> Choose the slow reconciliation towards what you can get rather than what you always hoped for.<eos> Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment. And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.
Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.<eos> Choose disappointment. And choose losing the ones you loved.<eos> And as they fall from view, a piece of you dies with them.<eos> Until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece, they will all be gone.<eos> And there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead.
What is all this shit anyway?<eos> It's just, like, stories and that.<eos> "Stories"?<eos> What are you writing stories for?<eos> Who's gonna read shit written by a cunt like you?
What, is it about him?<eos> - It's about all of us, like.<eos> - All of you?<eos> About me?<eos> - No, not about you.
I did steal the money, but they shouldn't have been surprised.<eos> I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.<eos> Shops, businesses, neighbours, family.<eos> Friends was just one more class of victim.<eos> In the morning, when you were gone with my money, I was furious, but also I thought,
I'm not here.<eos> - What do you mean, you're not here?<eos> - Go!<eos> Veronika, you cannot be here. Please.<eos> It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.
Trainspotting?<eos> In Leith Central?<eos> "He says, laughing.<eos> "I noticed Begbie seemed strangely subdued and uncomfortable."<eos> They fucking turn it on for you.
Now...<eos> Rent Boy. You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.
Rent Boy. You and me.<eos> You know, I killed a man once.<eos> A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.
Where the fuck am I going to go, all these tubes stuck to me?<eos> Give a man a little bit of dignity for once, eh?<eos> Aye. All right, Frank.<eos> You're a good man, Mr Wilson.<eos> I respect you for that.
Have you read it?<eos> Well, not that one.<eos> But, you know, books...<eos> For your dinner table.<eos> Shall I join you this evening?
People talk.<eos> This is a small village, you know.<eos> Small minded as well.<eos> But small also means safe.<eos> Even back in Paris, I knew a girl like you, who was so... ahead of her time.
Am I catching you at a bad time?<eos> - What is it, LeFou?<eos> - A certain damsel is in distress.<eos> It's hero time.<eos> I'm not done with you yet.
Now go.<eos> Live your life.<eos> And forget me.<eos> Forget you?<eos> Everything I am is because of you.
I'll have this place spotless in no time.<eos> This plan of yours is dangerous.<eos> I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.
You know, there are other girls.<eos> A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.<eos> Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston<eos> Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston<eos> Looking so down in the dumps<eos> Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston<eos> Even when taking your lumps<eos> There's no man in town as admired as you<eos> You're everyone's favorite guy<eos> Everyone's awed and inspired by you
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating<eos> My, what a guy, that Gaston<eos> I needed encouragement<eos> Thank you, LeFou<eos> Well, there's no one As easy to bolster as you
A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.<eos> The outside world has no place for a creature like me... but it can for you.
- I have to warn the Beast.<eos> - Warn him?<eos> How did you get away from him?<eos> He let me go, Papa.<eos> He sent me back to you.
I can't... speak.<eos> It's all right, Cogsworth.<eos> I can't...<eos> Lumiere... my friend.<eos> It was an honor to serve... with you.
Why'd you say that?<eos> The great spirit made the Princess jump off the cliff and made Jesus die on the cross.<eos> Don't you think that's mean?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> When we get home, your mom will have a good answer for you.
I don't know.<eos> It's completely crazy.<eos> But I gotta do something, and this is all I got.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm gonna go with you.
But I'm gonna go with you.<eos> Sure, fine.<eos> I hope it goes well with her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope it goes well with you, too.
Fold back.<eos> Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.
Rotate.<eos> All there is to it.<eos> I know what a great Gulf there is between us, mack.<eos> You may not believe it, but I am especially fond of you.<eos> I wanna heal that wound that's growin' inside you and between us.
You know everything.<eos> You're everywhere, all at once.<eos> And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.
And you have limitless power.<eos> Yet, somehow you let my little girl die.<eos> When she needed you most, you abandoned her.<eos> I never left her.<eos> If you are who you say you are... Where were you when I needed you?
You, on the other hand, were created to be loved.<eos> Living unloved is like clipping a bird's wings.<eos> Pain has a way of doing that to us.<eos> If it's left unresolved, you can forget what you were created for.<eos> That's not something i want for you.
Okay.<eos> Watch this one.<eos> Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.<eos> But I feel way more relaxed around you.
Action.<eos> The breath of life.<eos> She is my spirit.<eos> Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.
Love is meant to exist within a relationship, mack.<eos> That's all we wanna have with you.<eos> Even if you can't see it.<eos> You are in the center of our love and purpose.<eos> As beautiful as all this is, it's nothing compared to how we see you.
The real underlying flaw in your life is that you don't think that I'm good.<eos> I am!<eos> And if you knew me and how much I love you, then even when you don't understand, you could know that I am at work in your life for good.<eos> And then you would trust me.<eos> Trust you?
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You ever been wrong?<eos> Or changed your opinion over time?<eos> I mean, sure.<eos> And there are billions like you...
Mack, it's okay.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.<eos> Mack, this is happening inside you.
Not on your own, you can't.<eos> I'll sink.<eos> No, mack.<eos> You're imagining a future without me, and that future does not exist.<eos> I promised to go with you always, right?
It's time to let that go.<eos> How was it?<eos> Terrible.<eos> And wonderful.<eos> I'm very proud of you, my friend.
God has time to catch a few rays?<eos> Honey, you have no idea how much I'm doin' right now.<eos> Papa...<eos> Yes, MacKenzie?<eos> I've been pretty hard on you.
Yeah.<eos> You understand now.<eos> I can work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies.<eos> But that doesn't mean i orchestrate the tragedies.<eos> After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,
Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.<eos> What's happening with that one?<eos> Why is he focused on us?<eos> He's focused on you.
I know.<eos> I was scared.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Son, I forgive you.<eos> You've become the father i could never be. And I'm so proud of you.
Always.<eos> For what we have to do today, you're gonna need a father.<eos> Where we going?<eos> Almost there.<eos> We're here to do something that's going to be very painful for you.
I can't.<eos> You're not stuck because you can't.<eos> You're stuck because you won't.<eos> You don't have to do this alone.<eos> I'm here with you.
Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> MacKenzie, we have something for you to consider.<eos> You can remain here with us, or go home to nan and your children.<eos> Either way, we promise to be with you always.
If anything matters, then everything matters.<eos> Then I wanna go home.<eos> Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?<eos> Anything.<eos> Kate needs you.
Yeah, I made it.<eos> I was there.<eos> Okay. Hey, bud, this is a lot to take in, all right?<eos> I met god.<eos> Papa said to tell you he's especially fond of you.
He'll give me 10 bucks if I beat his five-pounder.<eos> That's easy money.<eos> You bring a pole for me?<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Got one for you, too, if you're feelin' lucky.
He got bored.<eos> He actually said that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of, more or less.<eos> And then I thought if I came on this trip and I came away with you, and I had fun and I showed that I could be fun, somehow he would come back, but...
I thought that you were never coming back.<eos> I'm so sorry I got us into this.<eos> The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?<eos> You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.<eos> Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you.
Okay.<eos> Keep your breathing slow.<eos> Just focus on the flashlight.<eos> Lisa, I can see the shark!<eos> It's coming towards you!
- Kate?<eos> - It's Lisa.<eos> We managed to attach the cable to the top of the cage.<eos> We need to come up right now!<eos> - Is Javier with you?
- Yeah, that's kinda how it works, hun.<eos> So, you're honestly telling me you're a genuine coprophile?<eos> The fuck is that?<eos> Someone who gets an erection when playing with their own poo.<eos> She hasn't told you, has she?
He's writing a novel.<eos> Don't be fooled, intern.<eos> Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.
Novels are for people who can't edit themselves.<eos> Cards are still the ultimate challenge.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> Sweet talk will get you nowhere.<eos> You.
- I'll fold.<eos> - What was that?<eos> I'll fold.<eos> Fold what, cards?<eos> We have machines behind you that fold cards, Ray.
Well.<eos> Listen.<eos> You're still divorced, right?<eos> Still.<eos> Good for you.
I have to watch him for my damn sister while she goes to school to learn how to clean teeth, and it's against the law for me to take him to the track.<eos> And I can't push him off the roof.<eos> You're in a real pickle.<eos> - Well, how about that.<eos> I thought he'd be afraid of you.
There's good money here for you.<eos> Here's an advance.<eos> I'll pay you triple freelance rate.<eos> Listen, I...<eos> I know I said a lot of nasty things about you.
Big Ray here used to be the best, the Bill Shakespeare of romance cards.<eos> Words.<eos> You're not still picking up the cat, are you?<eos> 'Cause you're an alcoholic.<eos> "I'm with you in hard times especially."
No, I do not.<eos> Optimistic Owl.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> "Surrounded by clouds.<eos> Good for you."
What, are you working for Paper Hearts?<eos> - I can't say.<eos> - What can't you say?<eos> I... love... you.<eos> I think very highly of you, too.
I think very highly of you, too.<eos> "Girlfriend."<eos> You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."
The real one's right here.<eos> You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.
- The card.<eos> Go ahead. Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.
Go ahead. Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
Tell 'em what the card said.<eos> Just tell them. Why does it even matter?<eos> 'Cause.<eos> You got paid to be with me.<eos> You know what that makes you?
Write her a poem.<eos> - I'm no poet.<eos> - Sing her a love song. Me?<eos> Sing?<eos> Well, then, ask her to sit for you and do a real portrait, instead of these fanciful doodles.
Take this!<eos> They're coming.<eos> - The Bolsheviks?<eos> - Sound the alarm!<eos> - Let me come with you.
After them!<eos> Papa!<eos> No one... no one can ever take away your freedom!<eos> Remember that.<eos> God be with you, my son.
I'm going to see our friends before they leave for Kyiv.<eos> Your friends are cowards.<eos> They think they can fight battles, using music. And words.<eos> Yuri tried to help.<eos> - He's trying to be more like you.
I'm not coming.<eos> What?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> I can't go without you.
I can't go without you.<eos> - I won't-<eos> - You have to!<eos> In Kiev there's work for you and you can send back money so we can eat.<eos> To be away from you, I-
- You have to!<eos> In Kiev there's work for you and you can send back money so we can eat.<eos> To be away from you, I-<eos> No, I... I'll die...<eos> It's just until Mother's better. Than I can be with you.
Mother was released from her suffering.<eos> I miss her so.<eos> She must have whispered a blessing on her journey, Yuri, because I got wonderful news.<eos> I'm carrying our child.<eos> This great joy gives me such hope that I can soon join you in Kiev and truly hear your voice and feel your touch.
I miss her so.<eos> She must have whispered a blessing on her journey, Yuri, because I got wonderful news.<eos> I'm carrying our child.<eos> This great joy gives me such hope that I can soon join you in Kiev and truly hear your voice and feel your touch.<eos> I look at the moon and dream of you.
Love, Natalka.<eos> What wonderful news!<eos> A child!<eos> Our child!<eos> You must now come to Kiev so I can take care of you.
Why, granddad?<eos> I don't want you to be forced into whoring for food.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> We're all going to die!<eos> My darling, I am desperate for news of you
The others, the factory workers, have plenty to eat.<eos> Please, help us.<eos> Mom... wake up.<eos> Trust me, Natalka, I will not fail.<eos> I will make it home to you soon.
Mom... wake up.<eos> Trust me, Natalka, I will not fail.<eos> I will make it home to you soon.<eos> They've started arresting all the Ukrainian party leaders.<eos> They will be with you soon.
Yuri!<eos> Yuri!<eos> Yuri!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Kachaniuk, I'm speaking with you.
I don't know what happened to Taras, but I fear the worst.<eos> Fire!<eos> There is death all around me here.<eos> But having someone to live for gives me courage and hope.<eos> I will live for you! And our child!
You have no soul.<eos> escape!<eos> Natalishka...<eos> It's alright.<eos> It's for you.
No!<eos> You fool!<eos> Yuri, wake up!<eos> We have to go... now!<eos> Please, take me with you.
This is a 24 Chrysler.<eos> She found you yet?<eos> Gabriella?<eos> You see...<eos> I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.
Well, not really, I'm looking for someone who's looking for you.<eos> She took me something of mine when I wasn't looking.<eos> Something for which I am responsible.<eos> A Mexican lady<eos> Has its eyes on you now.
- Forces?<eos> They want help.<eos> Forces, forces.<eos> Too bad you are not in that business anymore.<eos> They don't want me, they want you.
Stop shooting.<eos> She heals!<eos> Move!<eos> Alright move out.<eos> As I told you Logan, She is a mutant like you.
Move!<eos> Alright move out.<eos> As I told you Logan, She is a mutant like you.<eos> Hold on!<eos> Very much like you.
Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.
I'm not helping you.<eos> Of course you would say that.<eos> But I've got a theory that people don't really change.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you everyday when you was a kid.
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you everyday when you was a kid.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> Let's not bring out the worst in it, shall we?<eos> The girl is not worth it, trust me.<eos> She is not a natural fuck up, like you.
I did what I had to do to save Laura<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You'd just freaked out and had a fucking siezure.<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated rambling on like a lunatic<eos> So much easier for you.
Okay, what are we doing?<eos> There is a young mutant sitting in our car.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And where we are taking her, there are others.<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?
To allow your friends to stay one step ahead.<eos> I'm offering you with possibility of redemption, Caliban.<eos> To protect the world and in the process, save your friends.<eos> The girl is a small price to pay for that.<eos> Unlike you, she isn't pure.
They are all second and third place.<eos> I'm not too good, but my dad makes me.<eos> Do you want to listen?<eos> You like it?<eos> you can take it for tonight... and I'll get it back from you in the morning.
That's the border.<eos> That's where we'll be safe.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Laura told me all that you did for her.<eos> She was lucky to have you.
You're ignorant.<eos> MAN: (ON TV) They're coming for you Barbara. More for us.<eos> BARBARA:<eos> Stop it. You're acting like a child!<eos> MAN: (ON TV) They're coming for you. - Oh, my God.
How you can eat while our children are starving.<eos> Well, I have to eat, don't I?<eos> Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> What is going on with you and Jenny?
Huh?<eos> Danny.<eos> Oh.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.
Danny.<eos> Oh.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Piece for you.<eos> Piece for you.
Can you, um... get the table runner from the hall closet, and, uh, just put it on the side table. I think we're gonna do gifts and cards over there.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Ooh, sorry.<eos> David.<eos> God, between you and Carla, you're gonna give me a heart attack.
Like she needs to be laying around in front of the TV any more than she already does.<eos> Poor thing, bless her heart, she's gonna have a rough go of it come junior high.<eos> I told Tilly she needs to get her into that new Pilates for preteens class<eos> - over on Fairmont.<eos> - What can I do for you, Madeleine?
Give me one more day to be your mom before you get to vote.<eos> You're just sentimental.<eos> We could see that new movie that Dad is in.<eos> Ohh. Of all the things you wanna do for your birthday, that's it?<eos> Where has he ever been for you?
Ohh. Of all the things you wanna do for your birthday, that's it?<eos> Where has he ever been for you?<eos> How can he be there for me when we're always hiding from him?<eos> Ambition can be an evil thing, honey.<eos> He'd rather be a Hollywood playboy than a real father to you, and we're hiding for a reason.
He's a little angel.<eos> No!<eos> Andy?<eos> (MUFFLED GRUNTING)<eos> Who's in there with you?
Of course, I wasn't there.<eos> I only heard the story a thousand times, and I suppose the story gets distorted over time, but it happened.<eos> And I have made my contribution.<eos> I'd like to believe that I've made a difference in all this.<eos> I have been blessed to watch over you all these years.
And he gave us enough money to leave the city, and we've been running ever since.<eos> That doctor's kindness, that's proof of God, Andy.<eos> (SPUTTERING)<eos> I had never learned to take care of myself until that day, that day I found out they wanted you for their own.<eos> I had to choose my old life or you, and I chose you, Andy.

It's all right. Let me.<eos> You were late today.<eos> Yes. I met someone, Papa.<eos> What about Natalie?<eos> I've told you.
And then the other one goes... back and... And it goes... Then he goes...<eos> And then all their friends join in.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> I have a surprise for you.
Really, Dennis, Dennis when was this?<eos> - I hated it when I saw it.<eos> - When was this?<eos> Last night.<eos> The mirror wasn't even in the house last night it was in town getting restored for you.
You tell jokes everyone can understand.<eos> J-John's jokes only make sense to John.<eos> You don't get his jokes, but everyone else does.<eos> W-why?<eos> 'Cause they're about you.
- You don't know?<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> Even if it's an atrocity it want be an eyesore because it's down in the basement.<eos> Well, aren't you the slightest bit curious?<eos> I mean, when's he gonna show you?
To learn killing animals is okay, they gave you meat as a clue.<eos> You don't know how many times your meat at dinner time was someone you knew.<eos> I ate kids at dinner?<eos> Many times.<eos> Everybody kills little boys and girls, and they're all disappointed in you because you haven't done it.
Desperately.<eos> And you can't afford them, right?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> What if I give you my lunchtime every day for a month?<eos> We wouldn't be in session. We'd be having lunch together as friends so I wouldn't have to charge you.
Oh right, carpentry.<eos> The carpentry.<eos> Hey, Dennis.<eos> Come here, buddy.<eos> I got a surprise for you.
Christ, I don't know.<eos> I don't even know what the fight was about.<eos> You did this to him.<eos> He was a genius?<eos> Christ, I'd love to get away with you.
This isn't over, Gru!<eos> You hear me?<eos> This is not over! Yeah?<eos> Well, I still have the diamond!<eos> Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to...
This is not over! Yeah?<eos> Well, I still have the diamond!<eos> Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to...<eos> Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.<eos> Happy birthday to you.
Ciao, boys!<eos> So what do you want?<eos> Mom, do I have a twin brother?<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Who told you?
And you told me that Dad died of disappointment when I was born!<eos> Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.<eos> Agreement?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Shortly after you and your brother were born, your father and I divorced.
Oh, wait!<eos> No, it's not!<eos> I hate that tweeb!<eos> And you, Hollywood!<eos> This time, I'm canceling you!
But one of the greatest of all time!<eos> He was known as the Bald terror.<eos> That's him?<eos> Our dad?<eos> He was so proud of you.
Wait in the boat?<eos> But... I want to be in on the actions!<eos> The getaway driver is the most crucial part of any plan.<eos> Do you know how hard it is doing nothing, touching nothing, with all of the adrenaline coursing through your veins... and you must wait.<eos> Can I count on you?
Okay?<eos> It's not happening.<eos> I understand.<eos> Who was I kidding?<eos> A dumpling like me with a goddess like you?
Sure.<eos> Oh look, we're here!<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Take the wheel.<eos> I still don't see why I can't go with you.
Intruders!<eos> Intruders!<eos> Freeze, dipsticks!<eos> Gru!<eos> There's two of you now?
You have no right to take that, we stole it together.<eos> Together?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> You did nothing but screwed up the whole time.<eos> I got this in spite of you.
What?<eos> Dru!<eos> Dru!<eos> Go away.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.
You've ruined everything.<eos> And now, it's time to die.<eos> Any last words, Gru?<eos> You know what?<eos> I got two words for you.
- Thank you.<eos> - Yes, yes, finally.<eos> Haven't I said from day one you two were destined to be BFF's?<eos> This is Katie.<eos> Yes, I've heard about you.
- I know her body better than Brian does.<eos> - Yeah, you wish.<eos> But me and Angie actually got really close during her pregnancy.<eos> Which was a bit of a nightmare.<eos> I could not have gotten through it without you.
But me and Angie actually got really close during her pregnancy.<eos> Which was a bit of a nightmare.<eos> I could not have gotten through it without you.<eos> - I'll drink to that.<eos> - Here's to you.
In real life, I paint houses.<eos> I specialize in interiors.<eos> It's hard work but the hours are flexible and I can take Maddie along.<eos> Okay, next.<eos> - And what can I do for you?
- That's very kind.<eos> - Very sweet.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - You, too, Maddie.
- Oh, my God, no problem.<eos> On that note, Angie, thank you as always.<eos> - Good luck tomorrow.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - I'll run, you know, extra for you.
Please, tell me that your mother doesn't have to come on the fourth, as well.<eos> She hasn't mentioned it.<eos> But I'll tell you what she did mention.<eos> Katie. She doesn't like her.<eos> Really, well, your mother doesn't like anyone except for you.
- Almost four, both of them.<eos> Twins, wow!<eos> Can't imagine.<eos> Well, hey, hats off.<eos> They're beautiful, they look just like you.
Let's get you some neosporin, what do ya say?<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> Such a brave girl.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute, Maddie.
- I think it's perfect.<eos> - I don't give a shit what you think.<eos> What else do you two talk about when I'm not around?<eos> Angela, come on, what is this?<eos> Lately they've been talking a lot about how worried they are about you.
You just told all your friends.<eos> None of them believed you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, DNA doesn't lie.<eos> I'd rather die than have my child be raised by you.
Val!<eos> I'm coming back.<eos> Just have to work through some stuff.<eos> Sylvia's here.<eos> She asks about you all the time.
Oh!<eos> Can's down the end, keep it clean. Oh!<eos> command HQ.<eos> Eyes and ears of the whole place.<eos> We got a corner cubby set up for you, right in there...
Vance!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> I'm in charge.<eos> They're not gonna let us live.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you again!
OK.<eos> All right.<eos> Vance says the patrols come through the lot.<eos> Now, if you see them... do not go out.<eos> Get them to come to you. Right?
You're doing not too bad yourself.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get it open.<eos> Psst. Hey!<eos> I have a present for you.
Let's go.<eos> Go!<eos> Good girl!<eos> What a shit night.<eos> She'll trust you?
Go!<eos> Good girl!<eos> What a shit night.<eos> She'll trust you?<eos> She'll come to you, right?
Vance?<eos> Jamie?<eos> Copy?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> - Is Vance with you?
I'll come for you, all right?<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> Pinky swear.<eos> You got this?<eos> Can I count on you?
So, I'm gonna make you a deal.<eos> From one betrayed, abandoned soul to another...<eos> There's no reason for you to die...<eos> You just can't testify, so...<eos> You come with me, I'll take care of you... Get you somewhere where we're both safe...
From one betrayed, abandoned soul to another...<eos> There's no reason for you to die...<eos> You just can't testify, so...<eos> You come with me, I'll take care of you... Get you somewhere where we're both safe...<eos> You can start over, make your own way, be your own boss... I'll help you.
"Very well," said the merchant.<eos> "I give in. I am yours."<eos> "But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?"<eos> "Because," said Death,<eos> "I had an appointment with you tonight... ..in Samarra."
We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.<eos> To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> - Right, are you coming?<eos> No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> - Who told you?
No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.<eos> - Who told you?<eos> - The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.<eos> - Have a good time.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
No, exactly.<eos> So... don't wait up.<eos> - Hey, Sherlock. - Hey.<eos> Mary, what are you doing here?<eos> She's better at this than you.
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.<eos> Sorry, no, no, because we... we were family.<eos> Families fall out.<eos> The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.<eos> You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
In a way that was true.<eos> In a way?<eos> So many lies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.
- All the time.<eos> You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.<eos> You never judge, you never complain.<eos> I don't deserve you, I...<eos> All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> By following you, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I mean, you're clever.<eos> You found her but I found you.
Until one day I saw my chance.<eos> Oh, and I made them pay.<eos> You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things. Little whispers. Laughter.<eos> How the clever agents had been betrayed.<eos> Brought down by you!
Bloody thing!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.<eos> What?<eos> 'So many lies. And I don't just mean you.'
And you're basing all this on a code name?<eos> On a whispered voice on the telephone?<eos> Come on, Mycroft.<eos> You were the conduit for AGRA.<eos> Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
Nothing's certain, nothing's written.<eos> My old life it was full of consequences.<eos> The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.<eos> You need to remember that.<eos> So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
- You don't need to read it now.<eos> I'm sorry, Sherlock.<eos> He says...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
He says...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
What the fuck are you doing with that razor?<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> What the fuck are you doing in a ski mask?<eos> Look, I saw the lights on, took a chance.<eos> Look, I was fucking with you, okay?
Good.<eos> Three seconds.<eos> Beautiful, buddy.<eos> Hey, Scott.<eos> I have a proposition for you.
I don't do needles.<eos> I wouldn't say afraid necessarily... just, you know... a little uncomfortable.<eos> - Okay. - That's bullshit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I wasn't talking to you, dipshit... fuck.
Hold on, I think I hear something.<eos> All right, I'm pulling around.<eos> We can check back after dinner, I'm starving.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Yo, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Yeah, that was 30 years ago to the day.<eos> Doesn't say... doesn't say how she died?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Round up the troops and go celebrate, huh?<eos> Hey... I couldn't have done this without you and Scott.
You're telling me you don't see him?<eos> He keeps telling me to put the bag down.<eos> Hey, hey, brother, no one's there.<eos> Look at me, it's just us!<eos> No, you see him, he's right behind you, keep looking at me.
- I'm so glad you asked that.<eos> - I'm glad you're glad.<eos> - Because I have very important plans.<eos> - I'm very intrigued.<eos> As you should be, because they are surprisingly devised very cleverly with you as the focal point.
- So you say.<eos> - So I say.<eos> But there's been a delay, all right?<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah, but I'm still starting to doubt you.
So we had to... we had to cut away about 2,000 tons of ore when they, I...<eos> I found it.<eos> See, I at first thought it was just a new strata but when I got closer and saw what those taco boys were digging up...<eos> - I made them clear out fast.<eos> - Good for you, Bryan.
- Eyes wide shut.<eos> - Keep your clothes on.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Not an alien ship from some other world as we suspected but rather a vessel constructed by an ancient, very human and long forgotten civilization.<eos> Now, even though the details of this startling conclusion have been transmitted to you, I thought it beneficial for you to meet the people responsible for so brilliantly translating these ancient writings.
- But it is now over.<eos> - You do understand that?<eos> - Yes, we understand our agreement but we...<eos> - But we're the most qualified.<eos> We will soon be in communication again with you.
Allen and Turner were reported to have been romantically involved and that Allen had repeatedly tried to end their affair.<eos> You can't occupy a booth without ordering something.<eos> Coffee.<eos> I didn't order that.<eos> No coffee for you.
This the harlot you're looking for, shithead?<eos> So melodramatic.<eos> How on Earth did you manage to get in here?<eos> Amazing what some guys'll do for major blow job.<eos> - From you?
You really are linked to our little project, aren't you?<eos> All I did was interpret some etchings.<eos> Just doing my job, you creep.<eos> No, you're far more than that, way beyond random coincidence.<eos> This ship lying dormant for thousands of years and then reacting now only to you.
Whatever.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> We're in this together now, you know.<eos> Come back in one piece, okay?<eos> No, fuck you.
Water under the bridge now.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> (SIGHS) Oh, thank God.<eos> We're moving on.<eos> Without you.
Which I didn't!<eos> But it's really impossible to cram a ton of crayons in a butt.<eos> - No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.<eos> - Okay, Billy,<eos> I would honestly hang out with you, but I have a date every night with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department.
(BILLY) Well, like, I mean, I can fix that.<eos> I know how to trick the SIM.<eos> I have, uh... I have tools.<eos> I have to be in my house before 7:00.<eos> Well, if you come to my house before 7:00, then I can fix it for you.
But I've seen him up here before.<eos> My house is on the other side of the mountain.<eos> I hike these trails sometimes, clear my head, and I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small, crap town could cause me such misery.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> That funny to you?
We have a coin.<eos> We should just talk about this.<eos> I mean, we don't know what this...<eos> - (BOYS) Whoa! Whoa!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Right?<eos> We should go now?<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna be famous!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Not cool.<eos> Pee in that cup!<eos> This to remind me of my screw-up?<eos> No. (SIGHS) Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it and... you know, the frame's straight and the engine still runs.<eos> Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide if you wanted to fix it.
It's a terrible situation.<eos> You gotta come with me.<eos> (NEWSCASTER) A series of grisly crime scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling.<eos> - Bodies were discovered...<eos> - (RITA) I'm building Goldar for you....
We get armor!<eos> Oh, we get armor.<eos> Cool.<eos> When do you give us the armor?<eos> (ZORDON) You already have it inside of you.
Yeah!<eos> Slip, grab, lift!<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> Yes!<eos> (ZORDON) Think only of each other, and the morphing grid will open to you.
- Pretty cool, right?<eos> - (BILLY) Yeah.<eos> They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet.<eos> When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.<eos> They will be an extension of you.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.<eos> - Don't underestimate me or my team.<eos> - You can't stop him.<eos> She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.<eos> And we need you.
Your team's dead.<eos> And you're just as scared as we are.<eos> These... are all 24 karat gold bands.<eos> - (BELL JINGLES)<eos> - Hello, I'll be right with you.
I don't know.<eos> What are you guys thinking about when we're trying to morph?<eos> (IMITATES ZORDON) You must shed your masks to wear this armor.<eos> (ALL CHUCKLE)<eos> (IMITATES ZORDON) Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you.
I do what I can, but... but I'm scared.<eos> Sometimes I get too scared to stay there at night, 'cause... 'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.<eos> And if she goes... when she goes,<eos> I got nobody else.<eos> Look, (CHUCKLES) I think being with you guys is good for me.
(ALL LAUGHING)<eos> And I don't...<eos> I don't miss my dad as much.<eos> I mean, coming to the mine with him was all I had.<eos> But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
Boom goes the lunchbox, in detention goes Billy.<eos> But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in... in detention, too, so...<eos> Not tonight.<eos> Skip me.<eos> What about you, dude?
Are we Power Rangers or... are we friends?<eos> (TRINI GASPS)<eos> - (GASPS) - (RITA) Do you know who I am?<eos> (BREATHES SHAKILY) Yes.<eos> I was once just like you.
No, please, you're hurting me!<eos> You're so strong!<eos> (CHUCKLING) I'm just kidding.<eos> You've got spunk, little Yellow.<eos> I see myself in you.
You're so strong!<eos> (CHUCKLING) I'm just kidding.<eos> You've got spunk, little Yellow.<eos> I see myself in you.<eos> I was an outsider on Zordon's team just like you.
- (GRUNTS)<eos> - Oh!<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Oh, look at you.
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.<eos> I'm headed straight for Goldar.<eos> (PINK RANGER) Copy!<eos> I'll hold her off.<eos> Kim, I'll go with you.
I'll hold her off.<eos> Kim, I'll go with you.<eos> (RED RANGER) Let's go, boys.<eos> (BLACK RANGER) Billy, just the two of us.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Okay, come on, let's move!<eos> (POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO)<eos> (RED RANGER) I'll take Goldar from the right.<eos> (YELLOW RANGER) J!<eos> I'm right behind you.
Is there a, uh...<eos> There's gotta be coverage on whatever the hell this is.<eos> I mean, the TV's still working.<eos> Hey, mom, um...<eos> It's been a super weird day here and I just would love to be able to talk to you.
I just wanna get home.<eos> I know.<eos> If there's even a... A home to get back to.<eos> baby, guess what?<eos> There's still room service and it's just for you.
We thought we were alone.<eos> So...<eos> There is no one else.<eos> You found no one.<eos> Just you.
Hey, Mills.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> How many letters did you end up writing her?<eos> Ten, fifteen.<eos> How many did she write you?
You do know that story is about a mouse becoming friends with the lion after taking the thorn out of his paw though, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> The mouse kills the lion with the thorn.<eos> (MOSQUITOES BUZZING)<eos> Who told you that, Cole?
You wanna talk with him about it again?<eos> He seemed to really go for it the first time.<eos> He's losing his grip.<eos> Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> CHAPMAN: Dear Billy... I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.
Bullshit.<eos> You loved her.<eos> Everybody loved her.<eos> How could you not?<eos> You spend so long... Wondering if you're ever gonna ever fall in love, hoping... That it's gonna happen to you.
- It can't be that bad.<eos> - No, really!<eos> - Tell me. I want to know.<eos> Please.<eos> Alright, it started with you.
Alright, it started with you.<eos> - Me? - Un-huh.<eos> I told you it was embarrassing.<eos> It was at the wedding.<eos> I had this teenager crush for you.
Today's my birthday.<eos> No!<eos> Why you didn't tell me?<eos> It's perfect!<eos> That means that today begins a new year for you.
No!<eos> Why you didn't tell me?<eos> It's perfect!<eos> That means that today begins a new year for you.<eos> I'm so happy to be here with you.
Stand up!<eos> - I need a substitution.<eos> - No substitutions!<eos> You go out there and fight.<eos> Your team needs you, c'mon!
It's who you are.<eos> - Very strange.<eos> - What?<eos> You understand me so well.<eos> And I still know so little about you.
You know, it's not bad.<eos> Oh my god, look at this.<eos> It's my favorite place.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> It makes me happy to be here with you.
It keeps you awake at night.<eos> Massimo, basta, please...<eos> Tell the next person I can't drink any more.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, it's not for you, it's for me.
Niente. Zero.<eos> Not even a kiss.<eos> I thought I understood Italian women, but...<eos> Hey, it's Salvatore, the one who's always too busy to come to my wife's class.<eos> I'll be next door at the bar, pretending I'm you.
Anybody causing you trouble or problem?<eos> No, why?<eos> No, no, nothing...<eos> Just... Just try to stay in our neighborhood these days until Calcio storico finishes.<eos> Stay with Stefania, she takes care of you.
- Concussion?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What a concussion is?<eos> A concussion is when your head goes...<eos> Then I have a concussion for you.
- I know.<eos> We've been dreaming about this forever, I can't believe this is... About to happen!<eos> Hey... Listen, come here.<eos> You need to read me on this play, okay?<eos> If I take my first step toward you, you release upfield.
- Yeah.<eos> And he's gonna find out soon, too.<eos> Florence is just a small town, after all.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is this thing between you and Stefania real?
Always doing what other people tell you to do.<eos> Paolo say you don't play, so you don't play.<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> Do I have to tell you what to do?<eos> Stop letting other people decide for you, Eric.
He had to complete 12 missions before he could be free.<eos> Ercole. Did you fight with Paolo?<eos> We didn't fight. But he kicked me off the team.<eos> Shit!<eos> They can't win without you!
But not today.<eos> Today... I want something different.<eos> This is our life, Eric.<eos> Things don't always work out the way you expect.<eos> I'm not going back with you.
Faith?<eos> Faith?<eos> 'You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Oh, for goodness' sakes!<eos> What's the matter with you? !<eos> Are you having an earthquake?<eos> You need to see him, John, you need to help him!<eos> - No. - He needs you!
- A little bit funny.<eos> - If you keep taking what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks. Exactly, weeks!<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sherlock, it's not a game!<eos> I'm worried about you, Molly, you seem very stressed.
Save him, Sherlock.'<eos> John, if you want to watch this later...<eos> 'Save him.<eos> Don't think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn't anyone.<eos> It's up to you.
Oh, has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.<eos> 'You can't save John, because he won't let you.<eos> He won't allow himself to be saved.<eos> The only way to save John is to make him save you.'
You know.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> You of all people know that.<eos> It's coming to get you.
Someone?<eos> Probably me.<eos> So, that's it, is it?<eos> You're just going?<eos> Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified.
The roads we walk have demons beneath.<eos> And yours have been waiting for a very long time.<eos> I never bullied you.<eos> I used, at discreet intervals, potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition.<eos> I was looking after you.
How did I know?<eos> I taught you.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> How can you not remember that?<eos> Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.<eos> 'I'm only trying to help you.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> 'Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.<eos> 'I don't trust you.'
That sort of thing.<eos> In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> Last year, it was a violin.<eos> This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation... with you.
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
- 'Home.'<eos> - No, I mean what airport...<eos> Enough for now.<eos> Time to play a new game.<eos> Look on the table in front of you.
Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.<eos> Only it isn't a name.<eos> So it's for somebody who loves somebody.<eos> It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.<eos> This is all about you, everything here.
It's very important.<eos> I can't say why.<eos> But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that, I can't...<eos> I can't say that to you.
No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> 'I can't.<eos> Not to you.'
I just spoke to the girl on the plane again.<eos> - We've been out for hours.<eos> - What, she's still up there?<eos> Yes. The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.<eos> Is Mycroft with you?
! ' - The puzzle will save the plane.<eos> The wrong dates.<eos> She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.<eos> Is this strictly relevant? ! Yes, it is.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
I was the luckiest kid ever.<eos> My parents even had cool jobs.<eos> They worked for the biggest pet company in the world... Puppy Co.<eos> Yes, Mr. Francis'?<eos> Puppy Co needs you.
Am, too.<eos> I was here first.<eos> Just wait until Mom and Dad find out about this.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You think they'd pick you over me?
They were having a meeting.<eos> There's something about puppies.<eos> It's one big baby con-spy-racy!<eos> Timothy Leslie Templeton!<eos> We are very disappointed in you.
You better start packing.<eos> What?<eos> You don't get it, Templeton.<eos> If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.<eos> I will turn into a normal baby... and live here forever with you.
I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.<eos> I will help you... but just to get rid of you.
Tim, what are you doing in here?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hey, what's all the racket?<eos> Isn't he adorable?<eos> I've got one for you, too!
Your dad and I have some work to do.<eos> You wanna come up to the office and hang outwith us?<eos> We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone... while we have a little Tim time.<eos> Tim time?<eos> Dad and I know we haven't been able to do as much with you as we used to.
No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I failed.<eos> I would've gotten to my parents if I didn't have to go back for you!
You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.
Yeah.<eos> And the only way to save both is to stop Francis Francis.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't do this without you, Tim.<eos> I need you.
Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them.<eos> You should understand what I'm talking about.<eos> You got replaced just like me!<eos> No!<eos> I'm nothing like you!
Okie-dokie.<eos> Argh.<eos> Dear Boss Baby... I don't usually write very much... but now I know that memos are very important things.<eos> Even though I never went to business school... I did learn to share in kindergarten.<eos> And if there isn't enough love for the two of us... then I wanna give you all of mine.
But you know what I found out?<eos> What?<eos> There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?<eos> Especially you.
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have a baby sister.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Here you go, kid.<eos> Go get yourself a horse.<eos> You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.
My mother is from Earth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He ain't from Missouri.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you.
I don't care if you were.<eos> Well, I feel like you do care.<eos> That's why I'm apologizing.<eos> So, sorry!<eos> Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
It would make my nether regions engorge.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it, yes.<eos> I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.<eos> You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.
It's worse.<eos> It's so much worse.<eos> You son of a...<eos> Hey!<eos> - I've had it with you! - No!
I told you before!<eos> I didn't know what was going on!<eos> You didn't know because you didn't want to know because it made you rich.<eos> I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.
You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Yondu Udonta...<eos> I have a proposition for you.
God, you're like an old woman.<eos> Because I'm wise?<eos> Why do you have so much luggage?<eos> I don't want Groot playing with my things.<eos> I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
Hey there, rat!<eos> How's it going, you blue idiot?<eos> Not so bad.<eos> We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.<eos> This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
That's how I hear you in my head!<eos> What was your second choice?<eos> Scrotum Hat?<eos> New plan.<eos> We're killing you first.
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.<eos> Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.<eos> There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet... and the light within.<eos> They are a part of you, Peter.
When you're ugly, and someone loves you... you know they love you for who you are.<eos> Beautiful people never know who to trust.<eos> Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.<eos> Those pools, they remind me of a time... when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.<eos> She was like you.
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.<eos> But I was young... and greedy, and stupid.<eos> Like you stealing those batteries.<eos> That was mostly Drax.<eos> Me and Stakar and the other captains... we weren't so different from you and your friends.
Rocket?<eos> Rocket, are you there?<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.
What?<eos> I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.<eos> No, that's not what I...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm imagining being with you physically.
What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.
You don't know anything about me, loser.<eos> I know everything about you.<eos> I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest... but, actually, you're the most scared of all.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I know you steal batteries you don't need... and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you... because just a little bit of love... reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

I mean, that was true.<eos> They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.
You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.<eos> For the first time in my existence... I am truly not alone!<eos> What is it, son?<eos> My friends.<eos> You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.
What?<eos> Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?<eos> When he wants.<eos> He's too powerful.<eos> I can't!<eos> You don't have to believe in yourself... because I believe in you.
Yondu, we're about to blow!<eos> Get to the ship!<eos> Not without Quill!<eos> You need to take care of the twig!<eos> Not without you!
What I'm trying to say here is... sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life... it's right there by your side all along.<eos> You don't even know it.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> He did call you twig.<eos> Nebula... I was a child like you.
Nebula... I was a child like you.<eos> I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.<eos> And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.<eos> I'm trying to make it right.<eos> There are little girls like you... across the universe who are in danger.
You know, everybody's always frontin'. Nobody's ever real, you know?<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Anyway, the second I turn 18, I am so outta here.<eos> Emancipation... "Emancipation, mobility, music." Are you making fun of me, Gardner?<eos> No, Tulsa. I just wish I could go with you.
You're okay.<eos> You're okay. You're okay.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Do you think the exit protocol doesn't apply to you?
That plaque for your mother, it's just a piece of metal in the ground, okay?<eos> Her ashes were spread across the Pacific Ocean.<eos> You deserve to know that.<eos> She's not out there, Gardner.<eos> She's in you.
Relax. It's a dead end.<eos> He changed. Okay, guys, check the loading dock.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, you can go.<eos> I have to talk to you. Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.
All right, you can go.<eos> I have to talk to you. Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.<eos> Kendra, give me a minute.<eos> We need teams at the Washington Avenue Amtrak Station, the airport, and cover the bus stations, yeah?<eos> I'm coming with you.
It was a very specific type of travel.<eos> Very specific type of travel?<eos> Who even talks like that?<eos> Tulsa, can you slow down, 'cause gravity is very heavy.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that this is heavy for you, but I really do not appreciate being blown off by the one person who I don't...
To keep him from making contact with the outside world.<eos> Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.<eos> You're hanging this on me?<eos> I admired you more than anyone.<eos> And you wanna know what? We've been shouldering East Texas for you.
You will.<eos> You don't understand. On Mars, people, they didn't do this.<eos> We just had scientists and they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.
We just had scientists and they studied ground samples.<eos> Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.<eos> I know what's gonna happen. What?<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to Earth.
Shut up, Gardner.<eos> I thought about you every day, up there.<eos> I know what's gonna happen. What?<eos> I'm gonna fall in love with you and I'll fall to Earth.<eos> I'll be just like you.
Hold that thought.<eos> To myself?<eos> All my life, I couldn't feel anything.<eos> I couldn't feel water. I couldn't feel a fire. I couldn't feel wind on my face.<eos> That's nothing compared to what I feel with you.
Is that what you're saying?<eos> 'Cause, brother, we've come halfway around the world for this.<eos> - We should get this done now.<eos> - Don't be so selfish.<eos> This isn't about you or us, and she is Okja's family.
Hey, Nance.<eos> How's London?<eos> Is that rain?<eos> That can't be good for the golf.<eos> Just letting you know I'm thinking of you. You're having a moment, I see.
I think she understands some English.<eos> So we should be careful what we say.<eos> Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.
You gotta try this.<eos> It's actually really good.<eos> Good day, all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> These are for you.
I mean, Daddy was a terrible man.<eos> He was a real horror.<eos> But, by God, did he know about business.<eos> Don't worry about your apology speech, twinny.<eos> I'll pretend to be you in front of the press.
We have a deal.<eos> This thing is worth a lot of money.<eos> Make sure our customer and her purchase get home safely.<eos> Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
-Yo, what does this do?<eos> -Yeah, you cook.<eos> I said I "cooked," okay?<eos> Found the furniture.<eos> I've heard about you and all the girls.
Well, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do. Now, I know you-- yo, all the dishes in here, they're white.<eos> Just saying.<eos> He touches everything.<eos> It's up to you, bear.
A 19-year-old koala bear person."<eos> "If any of them were true, i wouldn't have you.<eos> But they're not, and I do.<eos> Amazingly.<eos> Bullshit aside, i never thought I would meet, let alone be with, anyone like you.
They did.<eos> Bro. I didn't say anything.<eos> Swear.<eos> Never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you though.
Bro. I didn't say anything.<eos> Swear.<eos> Never tell anyone that.<eos> They're worried about you though.<eos> All right. I'm sorry i laughed at you before, but that's not funny.
Studying. Talking.<eos> -You didn't hear me?<eos> -We weren't doing anything.<eos> -You didn't hear me?<eos> -Elliot, for the last time, bro, we wouldn't do that to you!
Jesus Christ!<eos> Then what just happened?<eos> And there were sounds.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> I told you there was something happening.
Maybe he can find somewhere else.<eos> You're feeling better though?<eos> I guess.<eos> It's hard to be scared in the middle of the day.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you.
I have time.<eos> Don't write it either, idiot.<eos> What are you doing, boy?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> I, um-- what is wrong with you, Elliot?
Yeah.<eos> Like a train.<eos> Some people catch it and it spreads.<eos> Some go crazy sooner, but they all die in the end.<eos> The word spreads, and he comes to you with-- with that thing.
You were right.<eos> He's trying to get inside us.<eos> He got in her. He's gonna drive us crazy.<eos> He's gonna kill us. You mean the-- yeah.<eos> He's why i was late to get you.
No.<eos> -You swear!<eos> -Elliot, stop it!<eos> Swear!<eos> What's wrong with you, Elliot?
There was a hammer in her bag.<eos> It was covered with blood.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Train's engineer said that you were chasing Kim with the hammer.<eos> He said she was crying for help and that she jumped out of your car to get away from you.
Don't say it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Good news for you, maybe.
Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do.<eos> Okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.
Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do.<eos> Okay?<eos> I literally can't tell you.<eos> I'm not going to let it happen to you, Virgil.<eos> Especially not you.
Oh, fuck!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What are you doing, Elliot?<eos> What's-- what's wrong with you, Elliot?
I have to do this!<eos> I'm not crazy!<eos> -Let me help you.<eos> -No, you can't.<eos> But I can help you, if you go!
You didn't have to bring it yourself.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be working?<eos> Oh, no, I-I got off at ten.<eos> I brought two.<eos> Can I join you?
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.<eos> Respect.<eos> She's a beautiful soul.<eos> And she's married.<eos> That never stopped you before.
No one is here.<eos> Really?<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
Harvey...<eos> Harvey, don't... Don't threaten me, Harvey.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Constance?<eos> Good for you, Dave.
Deputy Hawk,<eos> Margaret Lanterman's on line one.<eos> It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you?
It's the line with the light that's blinking.<eos> Okay, Lucy, thank you.<eos> Margaret, what can I do for you?<eos> Hawk.<eos> My log has a message for you.
It's okay, honey. I hav...<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Could, uh... could you tell me what this is about?<eos> We can talk about that at the station.<eos> I want to come with you.
No, no, stay here.<eos> There's been a mistake. All right?<eos> I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You fucking bastard!<eos> I've known about this affair.<eos> I've known about this affair all along.<eos> Now, you lookee here.<eos> I know about you and George and maybe somebody else too!
I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.<eos> I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.
If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything.<eos> I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.
Supposed to be something happening here tonight.<eos> The stars turn... and the time presents itself.<eos> Hawk, watch carefully.<eos> I will, Margaret.<eos> I'm too weak to go with you.
Hawk, watch carefully.<eos> I will, Margaret.<eos> I'm too weak to go with you.<eos> But stop by.<eos> I have coffee and pie for you.
Shit, he's coming. I got to get off the phone.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> Yes, Darya.<eos> Shit!<eos> Darya... who hired you and Ray to kill me?
I don't know what that is.<eos> Geographical coordinates, numbers, letters.<eos> They could save your life.<eos> He said she told him something, but I don't know what.<eos> Anybody ever show this to you before?
_ _<eos> _<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
There is something really wrong.<eos> It's her life.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> There's James. He's staring at you again.<eos> Does James have a thing for you?
You fucking bastard!<eos> I've known about this affair.<eos> I've known about this affair all along.<eos> Now, you lookee here.<eos> I know about you and George and maybe somebody else too!

Nobody's listening.<eos> So what do we do about Cooper?<eos> I got another call from Jeffries.<eos> You have to hit Cooper if he's still around tomorrow night.<eos> That means you now, Darya.
Chantal, come here.<eos> You're nice and wet.<eos> Weird.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
It's her life.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> There's James.<eos> He's staring at you again.<eos> Does James have a thing for you?
You could...<eos> We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.
He's in a federal prison in South Dakota.<eos> We're going out to see him tomorrow.<eos> I heard.<eos> Yes? How's that?<eos> You're taking Agent Preston with you?
Well, I know your profile, Gordon.<eos> Beautiful agent, barely 30.<eos> I'm oldschool, Denise.<eos> Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.<eos> I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon, and I never used a spoonful because you were and are a great agent.
I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job, and it's... it's a bitch, let me tell you, sometimes...<eos> Not to mention the screaming hormones.<eos> I'm sorry, Gordon.<eos> I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.
I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.<eos> And I believe you're on the trail of something big.<eos> Big.<eos> Will Albert be with you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to speak now to Special Agent Dale Cooper.<eos> We'll be down the hall if you need us.<eos> Thank you, Warden Murphy.<eos> It's very good to see you again, old friend.<eos> It's very, very good to see you again, old friend.
Where have you been all these years?<eos> Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague<eos> Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.
Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Phillip Jeffries?<eos> I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon.<eos> I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so.<eos> I was on my way to present it to you.
I was on my way to present it to you.<eos> I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident.<eos> Yes, Coop.<eos> This is how and why we found you.<eos> I need to be debriefed by you, Gordon.
Someone will help you in there.<eos> - In there.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I think you should try to forget you ever met me.<eos> Shouldn't be too hard for you.
This is no game.<eos> Game.<eos> Okay, Dougie, we'll play a game.<eos> It's a homework game, since you missed the last two days of school, smart guy.<eos> I want you to take these case files home with you tonight.
They're watching us.<eos> I'm gonna roll.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> And now I'm gonna take my girl out to dinner.<eos> Hey, I saved some for you.
and that ass... give me a break, and I'll get you some bread.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I heard you've been kneading it all day.<eos> I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me.<eos> And when I'm away from you,
Red purse.<eos> When?<eos> Noonthirty tomorrow.<eos> What a mess you've made of our lives, Dougie.<eos> Now, what am I gonna do with you?
You have a super night too, Gordon.<eos> I don't know when I'm gonna get home.<eos> Thank you, Albert.<eos> And let me remind you that this work you are doing tonight is very, very important.<eos> And I will be thinking of you as I drink this...
Don't call me "kid."<eos> Just... Just remember this, kid...<eos> I will saw your head open and eat your brains if you fuck me over.<eos> You can count on that.<eos> This is you.
Ma?<eos> Hey, Bobby, what's up?<eos> - You want some coffee? - Oh, no, thanks.<eos> I'm here with the fellas.<eos> We need to talk to you.
I can't believe this day has come.<eos> Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.
Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.<eos> Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.<eos> He saw this life for you.<eos> Your father never lost faith in you.
When has that ever happened?<eos> Computer!<eos> Calculating.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I'm always one step ahead of you.
- What?<eos> As in "relationships."<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.
You run, and I catch you.<eos> Not anymore, Batman.<eos> You were right.<eos> There is no "us."<eos> So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore.
For being such a good teacher, obviously.<eos> Yeah, you're a great teacher.<eos> I am?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I wanna be just like you when I grow up, Padre!
So, what's the vigilante policy on cookies?<eos> Unlimited!<eos> All right, kid. We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.<eos> So, lesson number three.<eos> When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally.
- No, you're not! - No, you're not!<eos> I knew you'd say that.<eos> - No, you didn't! - No, you didn't!<eos> And I knew you'd say that!<eos> See? We aren't so different, I and you.
- You got it.<eos> - And get this man some pants.<eos> I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.
But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.<eos> So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?<eos> They're standing right behind you.
Hold on!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Barbara, did you see that?<eos> Batrope saved Alfred.<eos> Sick moves, rope. I never doubted you, bro.
Sick moves, rope. I never doubted you, bro.<eos> Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.<eos> Rope! You lied to me!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You mean, without you,
Respect!<eos> Do you realize that you have never once said the words,<eos> "I hate you, Joker"?<eos> Not once.<eos> Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.
What is that?<eos> I don't...<eos> You gotta turn around.<eos> I call it the Babs-Signal.<eos> And I'm flipping the switch for you.
No! I'm not gonna help you.<eos> At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy!<eos> I'm gonna have to die to know it.<eos> Shut up, Joker!<eos> If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.
If there's no Gotham, then I'll never get to fight you again.<eos> What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.

Colleen Wing.<eos> speak English or Japanese.<eos> I haven't spoken Mandarin since I was a kid.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just wondering if... maybe I could get a job with you.
sometimes you still sound like you're an eight-year-old.<eos> Dad.<eos> I get the whole "disappointed-in-me" thing.<eos> You've been doing it my whole life.<eos> I expect more of you. That's all.
They drugged me.<eos> They... they... they brought me here against my will.<eos> You saw me being attacked the other night.<eos> You know there's something going on.<eos> Why would anyone be after you in the first place?
Why would anyone be after you in the first place?<eos> You'll have to ask the Meachums, okay?<eos> Aren't they, like, one of the richest families in New York?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they have a problem with you?
You are one of my guys, one of my most trusted guys.<eos> Do this for me.<eos> How you feeling this morning?<eos> Drugs make me feel like I'm under water.<eos> We've got you on some pretty high doses, but I understand that's what it takes with you.
Joy, I insist.<eos> Jesus, Ward, what are you so afraid of?<eos> You should be a little more like dad.<eos> Yeah? Grow some balls.<eos> I was just going to see you.
- Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but...<eos> - Yeah. ...it's all I got.<eos> No, it doesn't sound ridiculous.<eos> I was 13 when Dad died.<eos> And I still hadn't quite gotten over you and your family.
Marc Jacobs.<eos> You mind if we go inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I wanna be fair with you, Danny.
The new place with the glass floor?<eos> No, it's a... it's a dojo.<eos> - Has plastic mats. - Ah.<eos> Do you have any money for some new clothes?<eos> Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.
Because this homeless hipster thing isn't working for you.<eos> Why is everyone on at me about how I look?<eos> It's New York City.<eos> It matters.<eos> If this is too much for you...
I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you that's fine.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I know you sent that guy.<eos> You were the only one with me the day I broke my arm.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - Why is this so important to you?
too.<eos> are you sure you should be saying this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Danny needs to know this.<eos> So... there I was. not to mention you and Heather.
they show up in my home whenever they want with their demands.<eos> only recently they... where... where was it?<eos> Red Hook.<eos> Joy closed the deal on the pier. Talk with her.<eos> We've needed a fighter like you back in the family.
that'd be great.<eos> Feel free to call or come by any time.<eos> Danny.<eos> I'm not afraid of the Hand.<eos> Good for you.
she will.<eos> son.<eos> This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?
- That make any sense?<eos> it does.<eos> You coming back has... made me think about all the people I've lost.<eos> my parents... dad.<eos> your dad... he really cared for you.
You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.
They don't have to.<eos> They own the pier.<eos> I just need you to watch my back.<eos> You're joking.<eos> You want me to come with you?
Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> That everyone knows me now.<eos> It doesn't bother you?
I've been training my whole life for this.<eos> This is the one thing I know I can do better than anyone else.<eos> I am the only one who can defeat them.<eos> God!<eos> My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.
Because of who you are, there will always be forces gathering against you... preparing, waiting... looking for a weakness in you.
- Come on. Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> I'm going with you.
Too risky.<eos> Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.
But not against the Hand.<eos> I know. You're right.<eos> The Hand was a myth drummed into me.<eos> I'd never met them face-to-face.<eos> You're saying I have more experience fighting the Hand than you?
Anything. Keep him calm.<eos> - Sabina, do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.
- I'm glad you did. - What do you want?<eos> I need your help with something over at the penthouse.<eos> It's important.<eos> Really not a good time.<eos> Hey, I need you, son.
- Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come here.<eos> You just gotta let me know you're safe.<eos> I'm here for you.
Just incredible.<eos> Yeah, this image, the serpent, do you know what it means?<eos> Did you know about the offices on the 13th floor?<eos> Well, if I had known, I would have had Ward charge her rent.<eos> Hey, I've always been honest with you, Danny. You know that.
Well, there is no rest of your life if she kills you.<eos> I've seen someone else take on the Hand. It didn't end well.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but I've already made up my mind.<eos> I'm sorry I dragged you both into my fight, but, hopefully, this trip will end the Hand's story in all of our lives.<eos> I'm going with you.
Exactly.<eos> I was just out of law school.<eos> No one here took me seriously.<eos> They had every right not to.<eos> The job just didn't come naturally to me like it did for you.
Wow.<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?
Killing... is wrong, no matter who pulls the trigger or why.<eos> I wonder if you'd feel the same way if someone killed your mother and father.<eos> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.<eos> It's an easy opinion to have... when you're not the Iron Fist.<eos> I think Gandhi might disagree with you.
Mom!<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> We got you, Danny.
- You're goddamn right I did.<eos> You tried to cut a deal behind my back, didn't you?<eos> I could've gotten us both what we wanted.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?
I need to get into this building, and you're in my way.<eos> Maybe you could finish your nap elsewhere?<eos> I'm quite comfortable here. Yeah?<eos> Oh, you could try to make me move... but I wouldn't advise it.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.
Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.<eos> Daredevil, Luke Cage, Danny Rand.<eos> You secretly hope that the thing that makes them special will rub off on you, but it hasn't, and you have failed each of them in different ways.
Searching for your destiny.<eos> But it's selfish of you to involve Danny in your quest.<eos> He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> If you were going to be special, it would have already happened.<eos> The only thing that can come out of this for you is sorrow, heartbreak, and pain.
- Shut up!<eos> - Voice mail.<eos> Hi, this is a friend of Colleen's.<eos> Uh, she's... she's been poisoned.<eos> She's asking for you.
So... what do you want, Ward?<eos> I'll do anything you ask.<eos> I want you to leave me alone.<eos> I don't want any part of Rand... or any of this insanity.<eos> I want my own life away from you.
I hope someday you can understand that.<eos> Then I can go?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I just want what's best for you and your, uh, sister.
Danny, we're in trouble here.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> You are about to fall into a trap you cannot escape.<eos> I don't understand what you're asking me to do.<eos> You weren't taught this.
Hmm, no.<eos> But it's the safest place I know.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.
It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time...<eos> This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...
- Hey.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.
Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> She's very special.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
Guarding an entry.<eos> If that's why you're interested in me, then... you got the wrong man.<eos> I don't need a guard, Danny.<eos> I need a partner.<eos> With you at my side, no one would stand against us.
There are Gaos everywhere.<eos> I need you to train and lead a group of people who will take care of those that our culture's left behind.<eos> The marginalized and forgotten.<eos> People like Colleen.<eos> People like you.
Balvenie, 40-year-old.<eos> This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.<eos> - Dad, it is too early to be drinking...<eos> - Come on. Open it. - and I'm...<eos> I can't. - One for you.
- Come on. Open it. - and I'm...<eos> I can't. - One for you.<eos> One for me.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One for you, and one for me.
How was he?<eos> He seems ready.<eos> Thank you for all you've done.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
- Are you coming onboard here?<eos> - Oh, thinking about it.<eos> That would be so kick-ass.<eos> I...<eos> I've been telling them about you.
You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.
A family.<eos> I can save Danny, too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing. - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.
- It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the silver bullet I've been looking for, Joy!<eos> - Joy.<eos> I am so proud of you.
If I have to.<eos> Uh, it's... just the pizza.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I should go with you.
- Guarding the pass.<eos> - Guarding K'un-Lun.<eos> Danny?<eos> I didn't know where else you would go.<eos> Is Bakuto with you?
- To do what?<eos> To become the kind of people who help make the world a better place.<eos> He's getting them jobs in hospitals and businesses.<eos> He's using them for his own means.<eos> It's the same thing he's doing to you.
The world is more complicated than what a bunch of monks think.<eos> - The Hand is evil.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.
Why are you even here, Colleen?<eos> Because... because I care about you.<eos> And the way things are going...<eos> I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?
And the way things are going...<eos> I wanted to say I tried... to make things right between us.<eos> Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?<eos> Just stop. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> How can I ever trust you again?
I need to get it to my father's old business partner.<eos> He can help us out.<eos> Okay, Danny, think this through.<eos> You can't just keep charging into this.<eos> The Hand wants something from you.
I need antibiotics for a wound that might have gotten infected.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> The infirmary at the compound should be stocked if that's...<eos> Yeah, I can't really go to the compound.<eos> Not now. That's why I came to you.
- Bakuto, what the hell is this?<eos> You were supposed to tell me when you found Danny.<eos> I blame myself for this.<eos> Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!<eos> But I don't know... if I believe in you.
I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.
Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.
Any last words?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ward... I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.
Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> So what?<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.<eos> There's someone in our organization who's very anxious to work with you.
- Yeah.<eos> And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine. All thanks to you.
Excellent.<eos> Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life. With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.<eos> And then, I thought it could be with the Meachums, but... But what I found in you is... It's new.
so... tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you. So I... withheld certain documents.
I can go there.<eos> It's my choice!<eos> but you won't.<eos> That's why you're gonna die.<eos> Better that than to live like you.
Where were you?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> My new boss wouldn't let me out early.<eos> Well, you tell that cocksucker that your boyfriend is doing a gig.<eos> Come on, that call center is comedy gold for you.
He is very good.<eos> His routine needs a little Polish, but he's coming around.<eos> There is nothing wrong with my routine.<eos> It's just, she doesn't find it funny.<eos> What about you, dear?
Stop it!<eos> You hear me?<eos> You stop this now, mark.<eos> I don't like you like this.<eos> All this anger, it's no good. I won't live with you, understand?
If he's angry, he'll come back.<eos> Just give him time.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> You need something to eat.<eos> Come on, let us look after you.
Jill: Mark!<eos> I keep worrying, Henry.<eos> What if it doesn't happen in time?<eos> What if one of us doesn't make it?<eos> Couldn't bear to live without you, dear.
I'm so...<eos> No!<eos> We had a child, but he died.<eos> What if one of us doesn't make it?<eos> I couldn't bear to live without you, dear.
You... you're...<eos> Motherf...<eos> Shit.<eos> You fuck!<eos> I've got a question for you.
I was, but you figured it out.<eos> So now let's be real.<eos> It's just you and me out here.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> - Yeah, I'll talk to you.
So, what do you say?<eos> - Yeah, I'll talk to you.<eos> - Good.<eos> Where are you from? No.<eos> Listen, I don't know shit about you, so why don't you go first?
War's over, bro.<eos> Bro?<eos> Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.
Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.<eos> The war's not over.<eos> Definitely not for you.
Go on?<eos> What about Sergeant Matthews?<eos> Did he get baked?<eos> Did Dean?<eos> I ain't talking about fucking Dean with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.
What about Sergeant Matthews?<eos> Did he get baked?<eos> Did Dean?<eos> I ain't talking about fucking Dean with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.<eos> If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.
If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about Dean.<eos> What's the obsession?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - It's interesting to me the bond between you and your brothers.
That was foolish, Isaac.<eos> I could've shot you.<eos> I could've easily shot you.<eos> Ize.<eos> I just want to have a conversation with you, Isaac.
- Is that a question, Isaac?<eos> - Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You see, that's what I don't get.<eos> How's an educated person like you become a fucking terrorist?
You didn't win shit.<eos> From a place you will not see...<eos> Just a flash of fucking light.<eos> Boom.<eos> When I'm done with you and Matthews everyone will know who the winner is.
Oh, man, I lied!<eos> I fucking lied so much!<eos> Trying to keep the story straight.<eos> I lied to everybody.<eos> I lied to every single person, except you, a fucking Hajj!
I was with them!<eos> I was willing to lay down my own life!<eos> Now, you can explain, or you take the plunge.<eos> Your choice. I can always move on to the next blowhard.<eos> Matter of fact, they'd probably know more than you anyway.
I can lead you to nearby settlements, but afterwards... let me go home.<eos> Very well.<eos> Guide the southern team, then go to your village.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> I'll come with you.
- Do not say the H-word.<eos> - Jess, I...<eos> - I've got enough of a headache as it is.<eos> I'm just saying, you might wanna consider going home, getting some sleep, rejoining society.<eos> I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.<eos> Mind if I tell you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> That money is really gonna help your parents.<eos> But for you, from here on out...
Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.
Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
What if it doesn't work?<eos> Then we tried anyway.<eos> All right. Thanks, man.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Talking to you.
They just found enough C-4 in that motel room to level a city block.<eos> What do you think it looks like?<eos> The government is not going to rest until they've got him.<eos> I just... I don't wanna see you caught in the cross fire.<eos> Is this about protecting me or protecting you?
Is this about protecting me or protecting you?<eos> Take the day off.<eos> Have a drink or five.<eos> You've earned it.<eos> They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.
- Welcome back, big man.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.
- 305. Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.
- Of course I have.<eos> - Okay, so what's the difference?<eos> The difference is I live on their block.<eos> The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.<eos> Claire told me about you on the way over here.
I need that.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...<eos> I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.
I can't be a part of this.<eos> If you ask me, you already are.<eos> We need to put it all on the table.<eos> - I don't know you. I don't owe you any...<eos> - I don't trust you.
Three of them.<eos> Only three?<eos> They were rather exceptional.<eos> And so, you come to me.<eos> I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.
"Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.<eos> Perhaps you'd be more effective on the battlefield if you killed your enemies, rather than letting them escape.<eos> Alexandra insisted we use the last of our resources on you.
Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'm done taking lessons, Stick.<eos> Lessons ain't done with you.
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.
What have you become in yours?<eos> Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.<eos> Oh, them maybe. Not you.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Mr. Rand... you need to think this through.<eos> And you need to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> Oh, they're just like you, old man.
- For what?<eos> All of it.<eos> I never meant to make my trouble your trouble.<eos> Pretty sure your trouble is my trouble now.<eos> The old blind guy kept saying that... he needed to get to you before they did.
There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.
I don't believe this.<eos> - I know.<eos> They're back in New York, and I...<eos> - No, no, it's not them.<eos> You.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.
By the fourth, they'd run out of water.<eos> By the sixth, no food.<eos> I believe it was the tenth day that they knelt before me.<eos> Begging to make it stop.<eos> Well... if I kneel before you right now, shithead, will you shut up?
I'm glad to see you.<eos> Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?
I believe you have.<eos> You made a unilateral decision and used the last of the substance to resurrect her.<eos> And now, we are all vulnerable.<eos> Actually, I have never felt better than with her at my side.<eos> Except, it's not about you.
Then there would be three.<eos> Perhaps this is what we needed.<eos> A reminder that everyone in this room is expendable.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Including you.
You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.
We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.<eos> But how can I trust you?
You know how they can operate.<eos> And now we know what they need.<eos> It's you, kid.<eos> Stick, you're falling for their trap.<eos> If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.
Thank you.<eos> I like it here.<eos> Back in New York?<eos> No.<eos> Back with you.
Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.
You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.<eos> And it's not like you, Alexandra, to show such...
Midland Circle's suspect.<eos> Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.
Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.
- For now.<eos> But I care about a lot more people than we can fit in a police station.<eos> And I know you do, too.<eos> This city is at stake.<eos> Me and you...
I don't know what you think you're gonna find.<eos> It's simple.<eos> My dad abandoned us and got himself killed.<eos> - I know it's probably hard to understand... - Actually, it's not.<eos> Your dad didn't wanna hurt you or your mom.
You like to dine alone, I know. But I feel the need to make amends.<eos> I thought that entire vintage had been destroyed in the fires at Marseille.<eos> You'd be surprised what you can find at the bottom of the Balearic Sea.<eos> Go on.<eos> I did not originally want to leave K'un-Lun with you.
You wanted to stay with the elders.<eos> You wanted to... use our discoveries only for good.<eos> It's time for you to know the truth.<eos> I did not want to stay in K'un-Lun at the time.<eos> I simply did not want to leave with you.
Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.<eos> The same one that came after John Raymond.<eos> What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?
It does not matter.<eos> She has the ability to bring us a new beginning.<eos> And after that, anything can happen.<eos> What are we doing down here?<eos> That depends on you.
I am well aware.<eos> Did you hear what that cop said?<eos> If you're ever investigated, you lose everything.<eos> They'd reopen every case.<eos> Matter of fact, I come with you.
I've seen this language before, but there's a lot I didn't learn.<eos> A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it... I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.<eos> Years ago, someone like you used their abilities to seal this.
- Alexandra talked. I listened.<eos> In doing so, they guaranteed that only one thing could open it.<eos> Another Iron Fist.<eos> Behind that door is the true power of the Hand.<eos> And you expect me to open it for you?
Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.
That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you.
Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.<eos> Ever since you burst into my office, my life has become one big kung fu party.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.
Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> Colleen!<eos> She's losing too much blood.<eos> We're gonna take care of you, okay?
Just like you wanted to before.<eos> Before you let me die?<eos> No.<eos> Before they took you from me.<eos> Before they turned you into their weapon.
This is who I've always been.<eos> You forget... I know when you're lying.<eos> You've always wanted to find light in me.<eos> Look where it brought you.<eos> There is goodness in you.
Now!<eos> If this is who you truly are, why haven't you killed me yet?<eos> - You've had your chance.<eos> - I've had many.<eos> If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?
I see that you have prepared a delicious meal for your guests.<eos> You might want to save this for another night. - Okay.<eos> - I see that you have drank the cheap stuff.<eos> Well... I will talk to you tomorrow. It's good to see all of you again.<eos> - I want the best for you, my son.
Not for me, for us.<eos> I work my ass off for us because I need to provide, Anne.<eos> I have to provide, do you understand that?<eos> - I'm sorry, it's just that I'm so lonely here. Okay, I'm here all day by myself in this big house and...<eos> You know, one of the things that I love about you is that you are like your father and that you do make sacrifices for your wife.
If you don't get out of this car and march up to that house right now, I'll kill you!<eos> - Anne, sit down.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> But mom promised me she's gonna stay with you.
- Mom, I can't do this right now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You might be right.<eos> Maybe she does have some issues.<eos> But the point is I need you.
- I've been here all day, honey.<eos> - Why can't you stay?<eos> - Anne, you have got to stop acting like this. I have to go to work and you know that.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Mom's doing us a huge favor by staying here with you.
Mom's doing us a huge favor by staying here with you.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I have to go to work.<eos> She'll take care of you.
She'll take care of you.<eos> Mom, please take care of her because I love her.<eos> - So...<eos> My son has gone and married a crazy bitch who thinks she sees ghosts.<eos> Now it's just you and me.
- Are we us?<eos> Well, yeah, of course you are.<eos> I don't want to be me.<eos> Can I be someone else?<eos> No. You have to be you, okay?
And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.<eos> And he's left-handed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I suppose I didn't know that about you. Yeah.
Yeah, right, but I already had sex with her.<eos> How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?<eos> Just go with me here.<eos> Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally - because he's in love with me.<eos> - With you?
- Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.<eos> - Mm. - Next plan.<eos> - That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.<eos> That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.
Okay, so... the point is this, life with Charlie and a baby looking pretty good.<eos> Did you really think that this was gonna work?<eos> - Did you really think that...<eos> - Well you would just have me in here and you could just... hurl insults at me.<eos> - Huh? - I've tried everything for years with you.
It was so exciting.<eos> Maybe we should do it. W-we?<eos> We are not a couple, Mac.<eos> Well, no, we would just keep pretending.<eos> I am not gonna pretend to be in a relationship with you for the entirety of my child's life.
We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here, uh, to meet a gentleman.<eos> - Um, I just feel really - Oh. badly now being able to provide emotionally for you, so I thought we could set you up with somebody who can provide for you both emotionally and financially.
Oh, it's killing me.<eos> Run, Mandy, no.<eos> You... you have to run and not ever look back.<eos> Or contact me ever again.<eos> And you'll never get any money or assets from me because if you do, it'll be unsafe for you. Run!
You don't know the first thing about it.<eos> Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?<eos> Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did. With some asshole dad who was never even around.<eos> You talking about me or Bruce?<eos> You!
Then, that summer, his letters mentioned...<eos> Boots!<eos> "My cousin, and so your cousin too,<eos> Rachel, a widow, very good company, who has kindly taken it upon herself to show me all the glories of Florence.<eos> She lives out here in the sunshine, but is as English as you or I..."
What of it? It will be soon.<eos> I must ask you to desire her to return the collar.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's the last thing in the world I intend to do.<eos> Then I must do it for you.
Philip.<eos> - Philip?<eos> - Philip.<eos> Philip.<eos> To you.
- Let go of my arm.<eos> - Kiss me.<eos> - Kiss me, please.<eos> - Let go of me.<eos> I've been worried about you for so long.
Since before Christmas.<eos> You know nothing about her.<eos> Or is it you who know nothing?<eos> It's no use.<eos> I'm fond of you and you of me, but if we keep on talking, we'll end up hating each other.
If she were my wife...<eos> of course it wouldn't apply.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> If she marries you, or anyone else, then everything, the house, everything, reverts to you.
Yes, certainly, Mrs. Ashley.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Don't close the door.<eos> After last night, I cannot be alone with you.
- Do what?<eos> Don't close the door.<eos> After last night, I cannot be alone with you.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> I don't feel safe with you.
Is it him?<eos> It's signed Enrico. Is that right?<eos> Yes, that's him, yes.<eos> Well, translate it for me, please.<eos> "Dearest Rachel, on second thoughts, if you really cannot bring yourself to leave the boy behind, bring him with you.
Yeah, since when?<eos> You really wanna my ruin my wedding, don't you?<eos> Couldn't you leave your drama at home for once?<eos> I mean, not to sound like the Princess or anything, but this weekend is supposed to be about me.<eos> Isn't every weekend and weekday about you?
Wow, you guys really started early.<eos> Ha! Hey, they say this say this place is supposed to be fabulous, right on the water.<eos> They haven't rented the houses out for years.<eos> Explain to me how that's gonna work?<eos> I just wanna say I wish you the best, rose, and you too, aggie.
When you put five... You get a war.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Listen, Kate, if you have a problem with this, just say it, but, rose asked if it would be okay.<eos> Mom's ring.<eos> I told her I'd clear it with you first.
Listen, Kate, if you have a problem with this, just say it, but, rose asked if it would be okay.<eos> Mom's ring.<eos> I told her I'd clear it with you first.<eos> So if you're not comfortable with it, I'll let her know.<eos> Yeah. That would be a fun conversation for you.
I saw your Instagram and I figured you might come here, so I...<eos> I'm, um...<eos> I just wanted to say...<eos> - Jesus, Mickey, come on...<eos> - Just, I just want to apologize to you 'cause I know I fucked everything up and I'm really sorry, and I haven't been honest with you.
There's a lot of stuff that I didn't tell you about myself, um...<eos> I'm an addict.<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm a drug addict and I'm an alcoholic and I'm a sex and love addict and I...<eos> I think I need to just be by myself for maybe, like, a year and try and figure this shit out, but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you because you were a great guy and I really had such a good time with you
I'm, uh...<eos> I'm a drug addict and I'm an alcoholic and I'm a sex and love addict and I...<eos> I think I need to just be by myself for maybe, like, a year and try and figure this shit out, but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you because you were a great guy and I really had such a good time with you<eos> and maybe in a year, if you're willing,<eos> I would love to get maybe a coffee with you and...
I don't know.<eos> I just feel like, for me, I just need to take a year off and get my head on straight.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Good for you.
You sure, with this fucking maniac running around here?<eos> Yeah. 'Cause if I stay, you know, it's gonna be...<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no, no. I get it.<eos> Well, can I go with you?
"My kid."<eos> Did you notice that you just said "my kid"?<eos> Well, yeah, I mean, I...<eos> I've been thinking lately that maybe I want to start a family.<eos> What exactly is going on between you and Mickey right now?
Well, I've actually gone to a few meetings, so...<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> Gus, that's amazing.<eos> I'm so proud of you. - Ah.
I don't need it. - Come on!<eos> You got me broccoli.<eos> I'll get you a massage.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, I'm getting that for you.
Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?<eos> You're chasing me around a farmers market?<eos> You're stalking me?<eos> I am doing what I didn't do last time.<eos> I'm fighting for you.
"Your mom was dating a loser, and I...<eos> I came after her.<eos> I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.
I came after her.<eos> I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!
I think when I got back, I just got excited...<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> Gus, it's not.<eos> It's...<eos> I wanna be in a relationship with you.
Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good dog.<eos> - What are you doing, John?<eos> - Looking at you.
She's in Rome for her coronation.<eos> - You will take the catacombs in...<eos> - It doesn't matter where she is.<eos> That's why I need the ghost, lo spettro, John Wick.<eos> That's why I need you.
Santino will lay claim to my seat at the Table.<eos> He will take New York.<eos> And you... will have been the one who gifted it to him.<eos> What would your Helen think about that, John?<eos> What would your Helen think about you?
Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.<eos> He was already back.<eos> Oh, he came back for love, not for you.
Perfect for every occasion.<eos> But you also gave me a choice.<eos> Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die, or keep the pressure on my neck... and live.<eos> And so you see, I survived.<eos> No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.
Because I'm the only one that can help you.<eos> You're gonna help me out?<eos> That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.<eos> You sound positively magnanimous.<eos> But look around you.
Nice to see you.<eos> Mr. Akoni, how are you?<eos> Wick is here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You and you, with me.
Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.<eos> We hope through this exhibit we can provide new insights into your understanding of the world, and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection into the nature of self.<eos> The marker is complete, John.<eos> You should have just run away.<eos> You know what the Camorra will do to you.
What?<eos> You all have been in trouble for a very long time and jt did not have the heart to tell you.<eos> The horse market took a downturn in '08, jt refused to sellout, so he leveraged the ranch for you guys to survive.<eos> This is my ranch, my family's ranch, i didn't sign anything.<eos> Come on, Stella, you knew the deal, you marry jt and he takes care of you.
Honey, it's as bad as what daddy did.<eos> They're hurting the animals.<eos> All right, we got 90 days to get this horse tame enough that someone will buy it.<eos> If you get impatient or rough with this mustang, mustang's gonna come out on top.<eos> Just like you and chopper in the shower, cupcake.
- Talk to him, calm him.<eos> Talk to him?<eos> Shit, and say what?<eos> Just like chopper.<eos> Not another word out of you, Irish!
- Well, it sure looks like it.<eos> Equine slavery's got to go!<eos> I can't believe her.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Because I'll tell you something, no breeder's gonna come within a hundred miles of you with this kind of press.
I think you guys should head out back.<eos> We've had enough fireworks for the day.<eos> Hell of a day.<eos> How many more days of this do we have?<eos> For you, 21.
If I don't have proof this wasn't arson, we're done.<eos> Hello, Mr. bussey.<eos> You don't seem surprised to see me.<eos> Nope.<eos> Darling, you have someone very powerful working against you.
Thank you.<eos> It's the best present anyone's ever gotten me.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - To see Stella.<eos> I don't think she's gonna want to talk to you.
- Mm-hm, it's a good offer.<eos> You're a real hero.<eos> Is there a burr in your saddle, cowboy?<eos> Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.
Oh, no, ma'am.<eos> You get to keep the ranch and save your ass, I'm happy for you.<eos> - I haven't said yes yet.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> I told you I needed 24 hours, i wanted to talk to you first.
I was actually starting to believe I could save the ranch.<eos> Mr. jt told me a story once. About how your great-grandmother named the double diamond, not 'cause diamonds are pretty but 'cause they're unbreakable.<eos> I was the one who told him that story.<eos> And I get it, toughen up, but I'm not in the mood for a lesson right now.<eos> I wasn't trying to give you a lesson, just tell you that whatever happens tomorrow, great-grandmother would be proud to call you her blood.
Bratt.<eos> Good luck with your boy.<eos> - Thank you, Scottish.<eos> - It was Irish.<eos> Thank you.
Chico...<eos> My hand still hurts.<eos> I get it. You've had a hard life, right?<eos> I know how it looks to other people.<eos> People don't expect much from you, right?
- Sure.<eos> Hey, sorry.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Well, Chico, here we are.<eos> Maybe I'll get a drink, and we'll get you a hotdog.
Do you want me to go on and on, or...<eos> No, that's...<eos> Mom, you know that I think you are the most captivating and beautiful woman in the world, don't you? - No.<eos> - Oh!<eos> I got something for you.
Sort of brighten you up a little bit.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Lipstick.<eos> "Heartbreaker."<eos> Just like you.
- I don't want any shape of love between them.<eos> That's just gross.<eos> I'll be in the upstairs attic rooting around if anyone needs me.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> I need you.
And then we turned it into a show.<eos> The show was pretty good.<eos> We had chips. this all started 'cause you sent me this in the mail.<eos> I got freaked out.<eos> Well, I sent it to you because I missed you, I wanted to see more of you.
All that matters is that consumers feel - their voices are being heard.<eos> - No. You say you're sorry, and then you just move on.<eos> No, Dee, actually, you don't say anything.<eos> But you do have a very important job... to say nothing and stand behind me.<eos> You see, audiences are gonna trust me over you because you're a woman, and, by definition, shrill.
Ready to put on a show for all these guys.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Who are these guys?<eos> Uh, just like to take the opportunity to thank Fight Milk.<eos> Yes, and thank you, Cowboy, and thank you, Megan.
- It's so pathetic. - What are...<eos> - It is pathetic.<eos> - So sad. What are you talking...<eos> You just said this exact same thing, like, ten minutes ago, talking about how the ticket represented hope and all that bullshit.<eos> Somehow coming from you, it just came off so sad.
- for three days?<eos> - Yeah, absolutely. Jesus Christ, have they slept?<eos> No.<eos> No, they've just been wandering around the bar, blowing kids, doing whatever they're doing, you know?<eos> - Frank, behind you!
- Oh...<eos> - Yeah. Just diving straight into that, huh?<eos> Listen, um, I'm really glad you called, though.<eos> I really wanted to thank you for last night.<eos> Thank you for last night.
- You know, if this Mike fella wants to walk away from an amazing stripping career, hey, I'll take up that mantle.<eos> You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not thinking of it before.<eos> You know? It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.
You know? It just makes sense.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.<eos> I need you to get my back.<eos> Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?
- Uh, y-yes, it is. Boy speaking.<eos> - Oh. Yeah. Uh, I hear youse are re... rule good.<eos> Well, yeah, that-that is true.<eos> Well, I've got a party for you.<eos> - Um, Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Oh, you're in the back office.<eos> You passed out playing the game, dude.<eos> We dragged you back here so you could sleep.<eos> Oh, Mac.<eos> I think I was too hard on you.
Two shots of whiskey.<eos> Okay, yes, nice.<eos> Finally, somebody's actually working.<eos> You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.<eos> - I appreciate you. - All right, what are you doing?
We don't do valentines anymore.<eos> I know, but we used to, and it was fun, you know?<eos> It was a goof.<eos> You guys were supposed to give valentine's cards to each other, but instead you were just sticking hate mail in a suggestion box covered in hearts.<eos> I'll give it to you, though...
- You know what... screw you, Charlie!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.<eos> - Don't talk about... - Why are you going on and on about it? I...<eos> I did this for you, Charlie.
I did this for you, Charlie.<eos> What?<eos> I gave myself Jerry on purpose.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> To slim down for you.
I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.<eos> There's never anything insi...<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.
No, no, no, Matt.<eos> It's me.<eos> Dad?<eos> It's time to come home, son.<eos> You want me to come work for you?
Don't tell him that.<eos> You did what? Wait.<eos> Did you put a chip in...?<eos> Did you put a chip in me? ! Nothing, Cricket.<eos> Hey, listen, um, we got a job for you, buddy.
Davy, Pops.<eos> I met the most amazing girl.<eos> I'm in love.<eos> I'm in love!<eos> And I owe it all to you, Dad, for giving me a second chance.
Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.<eos> - Belle.<eos> - Heard me comin', I guess.<eos> I think I just saved the company. Wow.<eos> That's great news for you.
It was you, wasn't it?<eos> You just went and bought all of these?<eos> I don't like strangers gawking at you.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> For you.
Okay?<eos> Just talk, please.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I will have dinner with you.
I'm gonna take off.<eos> Already?<eos> Your photos are so stunning, José.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.
The things you want, you said that's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to show me how far it can go, but you were getting off on the pain you inflicted.<eos> That's still in you.
What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean, we only do what you're comfortable with.<eos> But you need all those things.<eos> I need you more.
I'm gonna need a road map.<eos> I thought you wanted to take it slow.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> If we're to communicate, you have to tell me.<eos> I want you.
I'm too dressed.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> What do you want, Anastasia?<eos> I want all of you.
Was that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name's Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is, Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?
I don't want it.<eos> You bought the company i work for.<eos> This isn't a relationship, Christian. It's ownership.<eos> I'm trying to understand you.<eos> Lam just wanting to get close to you.
Come on.<eos> The way you wear your hat the way you sip your tea<eos> the memory of all that no, no, they can't take that away from me the way your smile just beams<eos> the way you sing off-key everybody's looking at us.<eos> Not us. You.
So do you.<eos> This dress is so beautiful.<eos> Thank you, Ana.<eos> I'm so glad you're back with Christian.<eos> He was lost without you. Oh.
It's not what he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of woman who wants to be owned.<eos> If you really wanna make him happy, if you wanna be happy, you'll let him go.<eos> There's no way that someone like you could ever understand what we have.
But I'd like to take you there myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, of course I would rather see New York with you.
It's crazy, isn't it?<eos> Night, Ana.<eos> Good night, Hannah.<eos> You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you. Uh, about New York.
I've read more than you've asked me to.<eos> And I'm on top of everything...<eos> I'm talking about going the extra mile.<eos> Unless you want me to compete with Christian grey for your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.
Ana, don't know if you heard, but Jack resigned last night.<eos> In kind of a hurry.<eos> Sip isn't recruiting right now, so we're screwed.<eos> So you don't need me anymore then?<eos> I'm gonna try to find you something temporary.
What?<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> I don't believe it myself.<eos> I asked you a question last night.<eos> About moving in with you?
Red room, here we come.<eos> Shit.<eos> I hope you're not a sore loser.<eos> That depends on how hard you spank me.<eos> I want to be very rough with you.
Okay.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Take it. I'm just gonna grab some stuff and check the mail.<eos> I should go up with you.
Hey, ros.<eos> Leila.<eos> Christian is downstairs.<eos> Do you wanna see him?<eos> I came to see you.
He told me what happened.<eos> I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.
I know you're in a lot of pain.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.
We all do.<eos> Why don't you put the gun down?<eos> You don't know him or what he likes.<eos> You don't give him what he wants.<eos> He's pretending with you.
I'm not a dominant.<eos> I'm not.<eos> The right term is a sadist.<eos> I get off on punishing women.<eos> Women who look like you...
Women who look like you...<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop it if that's what it took to get you back.
How should i mess with you?<eos> Like this?<eos> Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.
Ls that better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I wanna marry you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanna spend every second of the rest of my life with you.
The boy already has everything except a sense of humor.<eos> His birthday?<eos> When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.<eos> He didn't tell you?
Ros and I have to go to Portland for some meetings.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow night.<eos> Come on.<eos> When were you going to tell me about your birthday?<eos> Your parents are throwing you a party.
You've made such a difference to him.<eos> He never let anyone get close until you came along.<eos> Grace, he adores you.<eos> I know, but children grow apart from their parents, and that's fine, as long as they're happy.<eos> And he is happy with you.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Wait!<eos> So this whole time I had the answer in my pocket?<eos> Anastasia Steele...<eos> What am I gonna do with you?
I know that we haven't been together very long,<eos> but I love him so much.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Oh, sweetheart!<eos> I'm so happy for you!
You don't care about Christian.<eos> He'll see that.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> He'll see right through you.<eos> It's over for you, Elena.
You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why are you even here, Elena?<eos> She's not right for you.
I'm done.<eos> The business.<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll have my people sort out the details tomorrow.<eos> I know she was important to you.
It's been one of those days.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> It's always one of those days.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's talk about you.
Some have mental health issues.<eos> It's challenging.<eos> But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations.<eos> You've got something special to offer, Beth.<eos> We need you.
Leave us a message.<eos> Message for Trish.<eos> This is Beth Latimer.<eos> I've been given your number. I think you might be expecting my call.<eos> I was hoping to come and see you either today or tomorrow so, if you want to give me a call back, my number here is 01632 960131.
I'm sure you did your best.<eos> - When's French?<eos> Thursday is it?<eos> Feel like I can't remember anything even though I've had a year longer than everyone else.<eos> We're proud of you, you know, for sticking at it.
Good.<eos> Mary, can you stand up please?<eos> Stand up on.<eos> Stand up, babe.<eos> These questions are for you, because you're so advanced.
Fine.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving without her.<eos> Well, welcome to Florida.<eos> Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, are you gonna get to conclusion... or someone in authority are going to spell it out for you... that the child best interest is all that matters.
God!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you... I was really mad at me.
It's big.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of the sudden?<eos> I'm not mad, I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, darlin'.
I don't want to.<eos> I want my crummy school.<eos> - And you got Fred. - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back and stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!
- And you got Fred. - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back and stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!<eos> And in a few years, if you want... You can come back. You can live with me.<eos> I wanna stay with you.
- Come back! - Mary!<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!
No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!<eos> Fred needs you!
He's at the apartment right now.<eos> For real?<eos> Yeah, he's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?<eos> Because I thought I was bad for you.
It wasn't her death she was talking about.<eos> I tried to talk her out of it.<eos> But you know how Diane could be whenshe made her mind up on something.<eos> I called MIT.<eos> Shankland's out of his mind about the possibility of publishing it with you.
Wait for me to die?<eos> I know Diane was hard.<eos> I know she was angry.<eos> But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.<eos> She needs you now.
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.<eos> But this is the only way to truly protect her.<eos> You will train her harder than any Amazon before her.<eos> Five times harder ten times harder.<eos> Until she's better than even you.
So you will do nothing.<eos> As your queen I forbid it.<eos> Strange.<eos> Is it true you saved his life?<eos> Who told you that?
We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you for what you did on the beach.
I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you for what you did on the beach.<eos> So you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..
Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless I marry you..<eos> I sleep with you if you want.
I sleep with you if you want.<eos> I'll sleep right there.<eos> There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.
There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.<eos> - I'm just fine.<eos> - Coming to sleep with you.
The pleasures of the flesh.<eos> Do you know about that?<eos> I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's criticism on earthly pleasures<eos> 12 huh?<eos> Did you bring any of those with you?
It is you that I believe in, not it.<eos> I know what you can and will succeed... It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, it come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
It is not confusing!<eos> It's unthinkable! Who is this woman?<eos> 722 00:59:14,686 -- 00:59:15,802 She is with me, she is with us.<eos> I'm not..<eos> I am not with you!
Hi, Diana.<eos> You can call me Sammy please.<eos> "Sammy".<eos> Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...<eos> do that if I were you.
Very reputable.<eos> A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Careful, I might get offended.<eos> I wasn't referring to you.
Avoid sneak attack, chief!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good to see you pal.<eos> - Big mike.<eos> - Good to see you.
Be polite.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Like so.<eos> And I'll put my arm around you like so.
- Yes, too dangerous.<eos> And you are too distracting.<eos> Look, I will go in there, to find..<eos> ...where ever they are working on the gas or better yet, where it is.<eos> - I'm coming with you.
What if you're wrong?<eos> What if there's no Ares?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I can not let you do this.<eos> What I do is not up to you.
As magnificent as you are, you are still no match for me.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> I am Diana of Temiscira daughter of Hippolyta Queen of the Amazons.<eos> And your wrath upon this world is over.<eos> In the name of all that it is good in this world I hereby complete the mission of the Amazons to ridding this world of you forever!
But I knew that if only you could see what the other gods could not then you would join me, and with our powers combined we could finally end all the pain, all the suffering destruction they bring.<eos> And we could return this world to the paradise it was before them.<eos> Forever.<eos> I... I can never be a part of that.<eos> My dear, I don't want to fight you.
This is a big decision, we need to talk about it.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - Yes, we do, Claire.<eos> Look, baby, I love you...<eos> - and I love you, Aaron.
It's a great big thing that we talked about and agreed upon before we moved here.<eos> - Well, it's different now.<eos> - How?<eos> It's better.<eos> - For you, maybe.
But the reality is, this house is old, it needs a lot of work before it could make any money on today's market, but for us, it's priceless, we've won the lottery here, sweetie.<eos> - Yeah, well, when you win the lottery, you cash in the ticket, you don't move into the fucking 7-Eleven.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Don't storm off like that's your final word.<eos> I left my friends and business to come here with you, as well, so don't act like you're the only one on the cross.
- Potential huge new client.<eos> They me to bid on the entire building.<eos> - That's fantastic.<eos> - What did I tell you, good things ahead.<eos> - I'm really excited for you.
It's all right.<eos> - Sorry, I don't know...<eos> - Hush, it's okay.<eos> I'll be right up.<eos> - I'm really proud of you, Aaron.
- Sorry, I don't know...<eos> - Hush, it's okay.<eos> I'll be right up.<eos> - I'm really proud of you, Aaron.<eos> You work really hard, they're lucky to have you.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm,<eos> I'm fine, I'm just looking at something, I guess.<eos> - As long as you're all right,<eos> I'm just a little concerned for you.
Mommy needs a hug, come here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, you're so pretty.<eos> You're so pretty.<eos> You have so much ahead of you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, you're so pretty.<eos> You're so pretty.<eos> You have so much ahead of you.<eos> I used to look like you.
- What, know?<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Did i...<eos> - Because I do, now.<eos> Er protocol, they, they checked you for drugs, hallucinogens, they wouldn't even let me come close to you
- Actually, it's our super power.<eos> We hide behind politeness.<eos> It's the ultimate subterfuge, when everybody thinks they're safe and we come charging in on a moose, swinging a hockey stick and screaming beer, it's true.<eos> - Yep, I am one of the chosen, Mr. brown.<eos> - That's doc brown to you.
- Late night?<eos> - Early morning.<eos> How's your patient?<eos> - Good, for now.<eos> Kind of an odd one, to be honest with you.
Mrs. pinnacle?<eos> - That's my name, how do you know my name?<eos> - My apologies.<eos> He's barely cold by now, isn't he?<eos> What's important are the girls and you, Susan, you and your previous little girls.
What did you do to me, what did you do to me?<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Susan, Susan.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - The girls need you now, they need their mother.
No, no, he didn't.<eos> - Get Mr. merman back to his room.<eos> This time, follow the procedures precisely.<eos> - Yes, sir, come on, Mr. merman.<eos> - Doctor merman to you, you young...
We have to leave, we have to go.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I saw her, Bethany, Malory, whatever her name is, I saw her and she fooled me.<eos> - Where?<eos> - She fooled me, just the same way she fooled you.
Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.<eos> She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.<eos> - So, how is work?<eos> - Same old.<eos> Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.
So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.<eos> I think this is best for Samuel and for us, and I really hope it's best for you, too.
You know, he loves having the dog and the cats around.<eos> He's not gonna understand that.<eos> He will, not right now, but he will eventually.<eos> We'll just make it normal for him.<eos> Jake, I think you just need some time to focus on you.
I don't wanna keep you waiting any longer.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> So we still don't have a trial date.<eos> That will take a while but you know management will provide all the legal coverage you need, so.<eos> We're thinking of you, Jake.
Right?<eos> - Alright, I'll see you guys.<eos> - See you Monday.<eos> - Have a good weekend, Pat.<eos> - You too.
There was a time when we happy together,<eos> You forget, I know all your weaknesses, Kuratov,<eos> I know the plan,<eos> Remove Kseniya,<eos> He does not remember anything about you,
He does not remember anything about you,<eos> Arsus,<eos> You're a scientist,<eos> Forces formations mu Serbia is one of the best, But you're asking for something ridiculous,<eos> If I wanted to, you or dead Kseniya, So, you must first die,
Increasingly difficult,<eos> Even after I returned to the form of human...<eos> I still feel like an animal,<eos> Some animals are better than humans,<eos> I agree with you,
I killed him,<eos> Jealousy caused my brother's death,<eos> How can I be better to kill him?<eos> I mourn the loss of your brother,<eos> But we need you,
They want to know, you have proof, ,<eos> You guys are awesome, but not only the super powers that make you great,<eos> You taught me to find dignity to gain friendship,<eos> I found it, We are a true friend,<eos> Like you,

See, they got this new one playing up on Grand Concourse, right?<eos> Saturday Night Fever.<eos> And, uh... I need a date.<eos> What you doing later on?<eos> With you, mama's boy?
Wait, 20 minutes?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Shane Vincent, AR.<eos> Lucky man. Your girl adores you, talks about you all the time.
Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Shane.<eos> Of course.<eos> Tonight...<eos> I know I ought to tell Shao about you, Yale.
Part scholar who could go far...<eos> - Got your back.<eos> - Yeah, part budding ghetto superstar.<eos> And on the one hand, I so badly want you, Yale, and so this is my desperate plea.<eos> But on the other hand, I know what I can do for you, Yale.
Let me ask you something.<eos> Did I beat your asses last night or did I show rare mercy and restraint?<eos> Rare mercy and restraint.<eos> Correct. And yet despite my mercy, y'all got the nerve to come into my kitchen to wheel and deal?<eos> We really love music, Dad... just like you.
You know, back in the 1930s, this entire vista, this gorgeous expanse, it was an irreparable wasteland.<eos> Fitzgerald dubbed it a "valley of ashes" in The Great Gatsby.<eos> But where Fitzgerald saw only ruin...<eos> Moses saw unbridled potential.<eos> And I still see potential in you, Ezekiel.
And I still see potential in you, Ezekiel.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Make no mistake... you committed an unforgivable offense the other night at the Ivy Social Club.<eos> The victim's father's been a good friend to the mayor.<eos> But fortunately for you, I'm a man in ample possession of the power to broker absolution.
Ed needs to hold someone responsible, publicly.<eos> I can't do that, he's my friend.<eos> - My best friend.<eos> - He's your worst enemy.<eos> And I know this is difficult for you... but he's become your litmus test.
Speaking of which, have you spoken to Roy?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I mean, I left another message, but nada.<eos> 'Cause I was talking to Shane.<eos> I thought I'd see why the label's throwing you shade.
- Come at me then.<eos> Come at me.<eos> - Stop. Stop!<eos> Ezekiel Figuero, I love you.<eos> And Lord knows that I am proud and fond of you.

No, you don't need to explain nothing, because I know who you are.<eos> You're a waste of intelligence and ability.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> You're a fake.<eos> You act like you want something better... but then somebody goes to bat for you and what happens?

No, I wanna be her man.<eos> - Man, you gonna put me on or not?<eos> - Not. Never.<eos> No. Chino and them said they gonna put me down.<eos> But if I'm gonna be out scrambling, I'd rather scramble for you.
- What is it?<eos> - Big bag o' weed.<eos> It's mint leaves.<eos> And when they dip it in the zooty chemicals, it turns to angel dust.<eos> And to you, it's $200.

But you got down with her. No.<eos> No.<eos> She did try to kiss me, though.<eos> But it was for a second and I stopped it and I got the hell out of there fast.<eos> I just wanted to be honest with you.
- A what now?<eos> - See, we pack the club every night.<eos> We're turning people away.<eos> I'm talking lines around the corner.<eos> - Mm-hm. - We're doing lovely by you, but we're getting the short end of the money.
Thanks.<eos> We'll see you next Monday.<eos> Next Monday?<eos> No, baby. Today is Monday.<eos> So I'll see you and your peoples here tonight.
This is the Dean of Specialized Studies,<eos> Dr. Campbell Grant, also known as Crazy Legs from our days on the lacrosse field.<eos> - Honored to meet you, Dean Grant.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> Cam, I asked Ezekiel here to bring his college essay with him so he could hand it to you personally.
- Pleasure.<eos> Cam, I asked Ezekiel here to bring his college essay with him so he could hand it to you personally.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's right here. - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you, Ezekiel.
Books, there's always some strings attached.<eos> Especially when white people involved.<eos> You wanna get played or build your own kingdom?<eos> You my brother, so don't take this the wrong way, but I told you.<eos> This college shit, it ain't for you, man.
- No, Dad.<eos> - It's not true.<eos> It's not true.<eos> We got the money from the music.<eos> We're trying to build a business, like you and Mom with the shop.
But I'll tell you something else:<eos> Your disco music is fuckin' wack.<eos> Shit won't last.<eos> It's all commercialized and spoon-fed for some dummies or some shit.<eos> Just like you.
Y'all flying colors now, too?<eos> All we're doing is trying to make music, I swear!<eos> We let you do the music because we trusted you!<eos> How are we supposed to trust you now?<eos> Stay the fuck away or you might get hurt.
From now on, Boo's done as the runner.<eos> He's out.<eos> Completely.<eos> - I can dig it.<eos> - I'm not fucking asking you, man.
But the father, he's a pastor, isn't he?<eos> Don't worry about the family.<eos> It's all copacetic.<eos> ♪ Everybody gotta cross the Rubicon... ♪<eos> Everybody's a whore to you, Ramon.
I can't handle this.<eos> Mylene.<eos> Mylene, get out here and let's finish getting ready.<eos> Please.<eos> Yolanda bailed on you, but I didn't. My ass is here.
- No. Don't boo.<eos> Don't boo. She's a lovely girl.<eos> A little mousy if you ask me, but who is Misty to judge?<eos> Okay. Okay, so maybe I heard she fucked Roy Asheton.<eos> You hearing what she's saying about you, Mylene?
Don't worry, Boo.<eos> Yeah, but where you going?<eos> To see my friend.<eos> I'll come, too.<eos> No offense, Boo, but some things just ain't for you.
- Get off me.<eos> - No, I don't wanna...<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> - I am her father! Go to hell.<eos> I'm done with you.
I'm gonna go find Mylene at that club, Ruby Cons.<eos> - Francisco.<eos> - Coño.<eos> What is this? Silence.<eos> I don't want to speak to you.
♪ I love it ♪<eos> ♪ I love it ♪<eos> ♪ I love it ♪<eos> Man, you owned that shit tonight, Mylene.<eos> And that Saturday Night Fever guy, he really gonna put you and "Toy Box" in his fucking movie.
- Mm-hm. - Really?<eos> No!<eos> No, not really!<eos> Shit.<eos> No more drugs for you. Uh-uh.
El diablo laughs.<eos> Yet it is I who will save Mylene and I who shall save my brother Francisco, who helped the barrios torch their own buildings to buy up their desolate wasteland.<eos> All so he could attain earthly power, prestige and money.<eos> Instead of uplifting his people, my brother has destroyed them... just as my wife destroyed me.<eos> And yet I stand before you, Jehovah, and I say forgive them for they know not what they do.
From the Beast.<eos> What's up, Wood?<eos> Man, good to see you, brother.<eos> Welcome.<eos> That's for you, man.
What about you?<eos> You got a lady, got kids?<eos> Used to.<eos> The world went on without us?<eos> Feel for you, homes. I do.
It's fine.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> Why'd you send him that letter?<eos> Josh thought you were committing suicide.<eos> This is for you.
I'm not taking your gang money!<eos> Just keep it down.<eos> Don't tell me what to do.<eos> You don't get to do that.<eos> I don't hear from you for seven years.
No, it's just that's not a lot of time, you know.<eos> We have no idea what we're walking into.<eos> I'm just trying to protect you, that's all.<eos> Shit, man, you got it. You got it, bro.<eos> I'm here for you, man.
I'm trying to help you out, man. And I'm here.<eos> I'm fucking here, man.<eos> I done everything you asked me to do.<eos> I can't help it if he ain't giving me shit...<eos> And I can't help you and your old lady if you don't give me shit. It's simple.
Just do the phone thing.<eos> Frank, listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna say it one time, all right?<eos> If your fucking cell phone loses its signal even for a millisecond-be quiet. Then I'm kicking your trafficking charges up to DEA.<eos> All my friends there gonna take care of you and Monica real well. Fair time.
Ball's in your court, Frank.<eos> Catch you later, Frank.<eos> It's your turn, money man.<eos> I know you're shitting bricks right about now. Trying to rationalize the morality.<eos> What will your family think of you?
The fact is we all started out as someone's little angel.<eos> And a place like this forces us to become warriors or victims.<eos> Nothing in between can exist here.<eos> And you've chosen to be a warrior.<eos> Now it's up to you to remain one.
But keep your ink clean so they can't validate you.<eos> That's how we lull the enemy to sleep.<eos> I understand.<eos> You have the keys out here now.<eos> Roberts will single-cell you. Get you some privacy.
Come on, Money.<eos> Easy.<eos> Right there.<eos> Now that we're looking eye to eye... you're gonna answer something.<eos> Shotgun's body was discovered around five o'clock which means there's no way he could've tipped off the cops with the location since Herman didn't send you the coordinates until an hour before the meet.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...<eos> In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.<eos> You'd be up for that?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Pay me?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> I don't, um-- you don't, what, need the money?<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> Look, Martin, I'll be straight with you.
What...<eos> Okay, everything is in place.<eos> Barry, look, my phone is about to die.<eos> Okay, Barry, stop talking.<eos> I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at bibola.
Yeah.<eos> I love Bob seger.<eos> "Beautiful loser," "stranger in town,"<eos> those are some of my favorite albums ever.<eos> might be hope for you yet.
Rare as well?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.<eos> Very good.<eos> This place is pretty, uh, chichi.<eos> Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
Where is it?<eos> Where it's at?<eos> We'll-- we'll help you up.<eos> Got it.<eos> Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
Mr. who?<eos> Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.<eos> Really?<eos> Damn it.<eos> For you, man.
Really?<eos> Damn it.<eos> For you, man.<eos> Damn it.<eos> That sucks for you.
Fine.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Shit.<eos> Because it's-- it's frustrating, 'cause you don't trust me like I trust you!
Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "game of thrones"<eos> and fantasize about Jaime lannister! You do!<eos> You want to bang the shit out of Jaime lannister!<eos> That's fine!<eos> I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.<eos> I didn't know if I should call.<eos> Ah, no. Kip seems great, ginnie.<eos> And you, you seem... You seem really happy.<eos> And I'm happy for you.
Looks like you got a fan there.<eos> Oh, Lois?<eos> Yeah, I, uh...<eos> Martin, would you please open your eyes?<eos> That girl is clearly here for you.
- I'm sorry, all right?<eos> - I got feelings and I'm sensitive.<eos> I know you're sensitive.<eos> I understand!<eos> Alright, I'll get the car, I'll get the car for you.
- No clue.<eos> I'll sell you the house back.<eos> - My parent's house?<eos> You'll sell it back to me?<eos> At the same price they sold it to you for?
I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.<eos> You realize what I could get for that house?<eos> No deal.<eos> Ten percent more.<eos> I can see this is really important to you, Lew.
- Then you should find some, how about that?<eos> Yeah, sure, definitely, I'll find some graffiti artists.<eos> - You should get more of this coffee, too.<eos> - Yep, definitely.<eos> Steve... I need you.
Go knock on the door.<eos> How ya doin'?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How are you?<eos> You know that I think of you as a son.
- Why you asking?<eos> You a cop?<eos> No, no, I'm not a cop.<eos> No, no, no, I'm just a friend, I'm just looking for her.<eos> She messing with you, too?
Oh, oh, wow, okay, uh great, that was a lot easier than I thought it would be.<eos> Thank you, uh, gracias.<eos> Oh, he spit that pit on your floor.<eos> Uh, you know what that is legitimately all I needed to know, so all right, I'm gonna let you keep that and thank you so much for your time.<eos> You can actually have the beer, that's for you, my tip.
- It's a nervous disorder.<eos> Now, if you change your mind...<eos> Mocha will turn you out.<eos> I will noodle on that.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna noodle on you.
- I'm John, my name's John.<eos> Hello.<eos> - I know, we've met.<eos> I just said your name.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you, I'm just... I'm not used to people remembering me.
Hey, Dave.<eos> You're drinking alone and the sun's still up.<eos> I've been evicted from my own house.<eos> Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> You know I'm there for you.
I know.<eos> Promise me that you'll let me be there.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll let you be there.<eos> Listen, I count on you to be the ballast in my life.
Fine.<eos> I'll let you be there.<eos> Listen, I count on you to be the ballast in my life.<eos> I need you to turn this thing around.<eos> I'm there for you.
- Shut the fuck up!<eos> - Hey, hey, don't talk to him like that.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!<eos> I'm cool. We're all good.<eos> - You and your dog's time is running out.
- Ninja throwing star?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> What else have I got to do?<eos> I'm with you.
He's always at this bar called Bird Cage.<eos> You're very cute.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You can't leave me here!<eos> Oh, don't worry we're gonna call the 9-1-1 for you as soon as we scamper off.
You see what's happening here, don't you?<eos> For the first time in your life, Katey and Taylor you're putting them and their needs before your own.<eos> Now me, I'm doing the totally opposite thing.<eos> I'm putting my needs before anyone else's for the first time in my life.<eos> I've become you, and you've become me.
And it turns out, we both have a passion for vintage cinema, so...<eos> - So we're all good here?<eos> - Yeah, we're cool.<eos> - And?<eos> We owe you, Steve and if there's anything you need, you could come see us.
Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why? Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.
Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?
Indeed, Your Majesty.<eos> We have to release Delaney.<eos> Aye.<eos> It will happen.<eos> On you, Bill, yeah?
My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> Whether God will accept me is another matter, perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> Or perhaps my feelings for you, unforgiveable feelings for you, will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.
If they don't sing, then how do I hear them?<eos> That is a question to be asked and answered in America.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Tide's rising.<eos> You've lots of people waiting for you, people who have given up everything for you, James.
Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.<eos> Now, go home.<eos> Everything belongs to you now.
You get to go out with all your friends and meet hot chicks, while I stay at home and watch tv?<eos> There are some good shows on.<eos> Look, I know it doesn't look like it, but I'm doing all this because I care about you.<eos> Don't want to get in the way of your happiness.<eos> - You're gonna throw up right now{\*, aren't you}? - I already started.

They were everywhere.<eos> Some of the kids were running. But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.<eos> And we've got a lot more to tell you if you really wanna fight back.

Esther, come here. Come here.<eos> When they take you to the bathroom, where do they take you?<eos> A hole in the ground. It's dirty.<eos> Can you see a road?<eos> I want you to ask to go again.
Who dared to think they could lay their hands on you!<eos> I'm alone.<eos> You escaped.<eos> You did. Didn't you, you rascal?<eos> Did you bring anyone else? What?
Bye.<eos> Paige..<eos> I promise you, this new life you're starting is gonna be amazing.<eos> It's just..<eos> Where you're headed? You can't take them with you.
What's the matter?<eos> I'm gonna get on the records for real, Mama.<eos> Honey, I ain't a bit surprised. You did so good on the little record.<eos> Don't get took, son. We ain't got another four bucks.<eos> Oh, Daddy, if you get on records, they pay you.
Beneath that surface is something dangerous if you don't learn to control it.<eos> You don't have any more time.<eos> You have to go now.<eos> Feels like I just got here.<eos> They know who you are.
It's kind of like with a dog or a horse, where you... Wait.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> You punish them for something they done in the past.<eos> They don't know.<eos> They just know that you're mean and unpredictable.
Where were you?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Everything takes longer now. Can't just walk down the street anymore.<eos> Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.
I am truly sorry if my presence causes you discomfort.<eos> Please, don't lie to me.<eos> Or to yourself.<eos> In my position, I am constantly surrounded by those who would seek to deceive me.<eos> It would pain me to think that you are no different.
- No, but why?<eos> Because I've seen your browser history, OK?<eos> It's primarily black guys and fat Johnny Depp, and I can't compete with that.<eos> You...<eos> You don't have to compete.
I need the divorce. Are you asking me?<eos> Or is it Elsa?<eos> I'm sorry I could not be what you needed, Mileva. What about Hans and Eduard?<eos> All they needed was a reliable father.<eos> You took them away from me.
I just can't catch a break.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> No matter how hard I try, I just...<eos> I can't protect the people that I love without... hurting other people.<eos> Maybe... maybe you don't need to work so hard to save them from themselves.

Deflecting this now is only gonna raise suspicion.<eos> Yeah, the American people believe that we captured the terrorists responsible for the Capitol bombing.<eos> This article says that we got the wrong guy.<eos> I mean, if we don't push back hard now, confidence in the administration's gonna tank.<eos> You can say that we're standing by our intelligence agencies and our military officials.

Stop looking.<eos> I can't let them keep dying for me.<eos> It's you.<eos> No.<eos> You can't turn yourself in.
So that's what you're about?<eos> Rescue people one minute, then just...<eos> - Just torture them the next.<eos> - I didn't torture anyone.<eos> Well, if you didn't stop it, then you're just as guilty.
The Monks are using some kind of... you know, something, to control the population.<eos> They must be, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to hold on to power for this long.<eos> Now, they don't trust me yet, not completely, and I had to just check that you weren't under the influence - and testing me.<eos> - So you...<eos> You... you haven't turned?

Uh, my father always claimed we were descendants, but he was very grandiose.<eos> I'm sorry, can we get back on track here?<eos> Well, my father and I had a very difficult relationship, but...<eos> I was never very good at sports, and he somehow felt personally emasculated.<eos> How about we call the insurance company and see if you really work there?
Who are these people?<eos> Bad people. Bad peculiars.<eos> Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.<eos> These are the ones he never found.<eos> What do you mean, hunting?
You got a case of the old trench-mouth.<eos> Did you let a corpse curl up and die in there?<eos> Forget it, Michelle.<eos> - Let's just start on the next block. - No, no, no.<eos> Second rule of business is when a stanky, hummus-eating bitch and her yeti of a daughter gets in your face, you gotta regulate.
The device also has a detonation button.<eos> A call from this cell phone will trigger the explosion.<eos> And that's enough to break the bag?<eos> The walls are cement, all around.<eos> You need both bombs, different angles, as far apart as you can.
Once you get this one fucking step down, you're the chief of the tribe.<eos> And I'm gonna teach you that one step today.<eos> You hear what I'm saying?<eos> Basically, as soon as they open that door and look at you, that's the critical moment, that's the make-or-break moment.<eos> 'Cause in that second you gotta work them, you gotta read them, you gotta be able to scan them and figure them out, figure what kind of person that person wants in their life.
Get the fuck off me.<eos> - Then give me my present.<eos> - All right, all right, here.<eos> Did you steal it?<eos> They have everything, you know, including insurance, so it's fine.
She's one of them.<eos> Who's them? What's them?<eos> One of the insiders.<eos> One of the capitalist, corporate suppressors.<eos> You know, they want us dead, man! We're just in their crosshairs, you know! We're just pawns!
But I'm glad you're safe.<eos> Me too.<eos> I can't believe this is how I'm finding out that John's dead.<eos> Walter should have at least called me.<eos> Even though you didn't work there anymore?
- Joel.<eos> - Mr Dromgoole.<eos> - Excellent to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know these guys?
Yes.<eos> How long do you torture them?<eos> ' - Stop it.<eos> Please, stop it.<eos> - Do you inflict sexual acts...
And who are these two fine representatives - of the City of Brotherly Love? - Hmm.<eos> Daryl Landry. I've been working with Joseph Cutler.<eos> - We've been redeveloping this area. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And you are?<eos> And why do you think - someone down here killed him?
Are you serious?<eos> Well, you know my parents, right?<eos> They're religious, conservative, sexist, racist, Republican, materialistic, narcissistic, racist.<eos> I could keep going...<eos> I'm just wondering what you really think, Susan.
You were right!<eos> Place is packed!<eos> Yeah, it's packed.<eos> It's sold out.<eos> They've been waiting for you to play some music.
We have our separate methods, sir.<eos> It is not up to the surgeon to de-- it is not up to the surgeon.<eos> It is up to the standard of the hospital, and the standard here -- standard?<eos> There's no standard in this hospital. There is now.<eos> How many patients do you think I move through here in the time it takes for you to tenderly hold one boy's hand, sing him a hymn, and beseech him to be brave?
That's not what we're about.<eos> Consider the lilies of the field.<eos> "Consider the lilies of the field"?<eos> Come that old madam with me, and he'll be considering my boot up his arse.<eos> - You won't be signing up, then?
There's so much I don't know.<eos> It's... overwhelming.<eos> Sir, I briefed the First Lady on the Milkin operation.<eos> I thought she might have some insight, given her experience working directly with Russia.<eos> I know you've had a lot of people weigh in already.
No. If you want something, you got to work for it. I did.<eos> I crafted a targeted request, set a goal, and posted a really persuasive profile pic.<eos> Look at that. "Where them dollars at?"<eos> Oh, my god! Okay, no.<eos> So, you're basically begging. Mom, that's the ecosystem.
"Almost all things are by the law purged with blood.<eos> Without shedding of blood is no remission."<eos> Yuzhin, over the past few weeks you've been doing a lot of strange things.<eos> But what bothers me is your lack of progress with your studies.<eos> They've never been outstanding, but now you've really slipped.
With daggers in hand.<eos> What happened to the knock?<eos> We've got a protocol for a reason. It's just us. Open the door.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is Morgan and B.B. You know Eckhart.
How do you know our customs?<eos> Apparently, I'm not the only Shadowhunter who enjoys the company of a Fair Folk.<eos> Maybe if more Shadowhunters exhibited such good taste things would be different today.<eos> The scouts are dead.<eos> That's who you're mourning.
Me?<eos> Without a Secretary of Defense, you're the best choice.<eos> You can speak to the strategic importance of spreading the cure, the risks, the benefits, and, well, it doesn't hurt that you're an international celebrity. My Chinese isn't what it used to be, and it used to be awful.<eos> We have an asset in-country that can help ease your path.<eos> But you need to make it clear that we mean business.
- Men, can we have a word?<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's Harry.<eos> Someone needs to talk to him.<eos> In my experience, if you don't deal with this stuff, it deals with you.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contradict the fact that you are sad.<eos> Only you know how you feel.<eos> But your colleagues, your friends at work, I get the idea that they see you as the life and soul of the party.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you cover things up? No.
I had no idea. I swear.<eos> Did you not feel the changes?<eos> Well, I took them to be the symptoms of grief.<eos> How could I have known that instead they might be... something so wonderful?<eos> Each member of the board must be severally convinced that you are a kindred spirit.
I can't, they'll kill me.<eos> I won the giant stuffed gorilla from the shooting gallery when I was six.<eos> Trust me, I will keep you safe.<eos> A few weeks back, I was approached by Belle Reve's biggest competitor.<eos> - They wanted you to defect.
I don't have very many regrets, Siobhan, but I do regret firing you the first time.<eos> I wish to God that I could fire you again with feeling.<eos> Ms. Grant, I can explain...<eos> Save it for the police.<eos> Because that's who you'll be talking to if you ever pull something like that again.
- No.<eos> - You know who went there besides the obvious--<eos> Ernie Pyle and Hoagy Carmichael,<eos> - Lee Majors--<eos> - You're right.
- Who are you phoning?<eos> - The cavalry.<eos> How-how do we get them to come to us?<eos> You've been all over the local news.<eos> You make yourself visible, people will come to you... and when they do, you talk about how much Peter loves Iowa and everything it stands for.
What kind of a diner runs out of ketchup? Shh!<eos> I just got them to stop crying.<eos> good.<eos> Now we can talk about nannies. GPA and experience.<eos> I figured you'd want someone intelligent but not overly ambitious.
Yeah, but people look up to you.<eos> They like your style, your attitude, your confidence.<eos> I'm not that confident.<eos> But you fake it well.<eos> You find the right clothes, put on the right mask.
If it is an investigation,<eos> Robert's gonna have people working for him.<eos> I've been under for months now, and I haven't seen anything to warrant disbanding to indicting members of Five-O.<eos> Are you sure your relationship with Chin Ho Kelly isn't clouding your judgment here?<eos> You're gonna go back to Five-O, and you will stay under until you get something.
So just to clarify, you were having fun upstairs.<eos> You were having fun in the hallway downstairs, and you were having fun on the dance floor afterwards.<eos> So the only time you claim you weren't having fun was in between.<eos> That ten-minute gap when, conveniently, you stopped recording.<eos> And, regarding that gap, you've told three very different stories.
E.D. strikes again.<eos> No... pathology.<eos> What?<eos> It's the patients.<eos> They come in, and you want to help them. You care about them, so you try to connect, and, just when you think you're getting through, they go back to what they were doing before.
I don't want to kill my cousin, but I can't say no to the Vatican.<eos> They alone support me in my own country.<eos> Without them, I lose my throne.<eos> And I can't tell Elizabeth what they're planning.<eos> She'd think you were complicit.
-Admit what?<eos> -You Spinal Tapped the painting.<eos> -What?<eos> -You Spinal Tapped the painting.<eos> You gave them the wrong dimensions and now you are trying to pretend that massive portrait is something you intended.
I don't know who it is.<eos> They must know something.<eos> Avoiding it is just gonna make you more suspicious.<eos> Answer the phone.<eos> Say you don't know anything about what happened.
I don't want anyone to treat me special.<eos> Well, that's not special.<eos> That's your right as a son of Wayward Pines.<eos> All of the First Generation are of Wayward Pines.<eos> Well, but you are the first, aren't you?
When were you gonna tell me? Given that I just did, is that a rhetorical question?<eos> All right.<eos> If you get Pawter, you tell her...<eos> Now I have to go kick a mine in the ass.<eos> What do you see?
# Knowing you love... # Enough!<eos> This is a prohibited gathering. We request that you disperse.<eos> What do you mean, disperse?<eos> We're nurses and these are our patients.<eos> You know the law, and you, even if they don't.

Moles are very precise little architects.<eos> All they do is work.<eos> You know, the more you talk about moles, the more I understand you.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> She's trying to say that you love moles because you are one.
I'm selling things because I don't want them, Mom.<eos> I'm trying to simplify my life.<eos> When your mother left... I sure didn't do what I could have to save the marriage.<eos> I just hope you do all you can to save yours.<eos> You go off to your weekly shower, You can fight it, but you can't stop it.

No.<eos> To bring him back.<eos> It sounded bonkers to me the first time I heard it, too.<eos> The first time you heard it?<eos> Weren't you there?
It's mine now.<eos> You know, you could be someone who owns that necklace.<eos> What?<eos> You could be one of those women down there.<eos> Why aren't you?
But when they turned around, Charlie was patiently waiting at the other side...<eos> Because he knew the rules. Red hand -- stop.<eos> Man walking -- go.<eos> I don't want to hear anymore.<eos> They want you to hear everything.

Put your hands out.<eos> Predictable again.<eos> You know, I had that kid in the palm of my hand<eos> - until you showed up.<eos> - Is that what you call these?
Yeah, and they're seniors.<eos> Can't believe they invited me.<eos> But I'm probably never going to hear from them again.<eos> So call them.<eos> Doesn't hurt to prove you're interested.
The Reaper cannot get into the Library, it won't let him! What?<eos> People break in all the time!<eos> Dulaque, Morgan Le Fay, Moriarty, Lamia, Prospero!<eos> None of them are the Reaper.<eos> Do you realize how many hostiles wanted to assassinate Librarians over the centuries?
I mean, before she became a rotting corpse.<eos> Your love and... and the handmaiden share the same je ne sais quoi, n'est-ce pas?<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> And if I had killed her just to get my revenge, I'd be no better than my enemies.<eos> But Snow White and Prince Charmy-warmy, you gonna try again?
I am gonna have a family.<eos> Pretty soon, actually.<eos> And when I do... you won't know them.<eos> I'll make sure of that.<eos> I'll say you're dead.
It's imperative that I get to him tonight before he's moved.<eos> Chances are you are walking into a trap.<eos> They knew we were gonna ambush Hiro's ship.<eos> They knew about the broadcast, and the rebel forces in orbit.<eos> And it's more than likely they'll know you're coming tonight.
So what makes these 12 so special?<eos> There's a layer beneath what's going on here<eos> I can't explain.<eos> I am not a patient on your couch.<eos> Well, you're certainly behaving like one.

- 'Personal guarantee?<eos> ' - 'Well, exactly.'<eos> 'Ellen, tell us, what do you say to people 'who accuse the Ambro Company of aggravating the situation 'rather than helping it?<eos> ' 'Look, in any society, you'll always have people harking back to the good old clays.<eos> 'If by "the good old days", those people mean a time 'when children were scoring unregulated narcotics on street corners, 'and injecting themselves into their stomachs, 'then you can have your golden age.

You know, when our friends heard about it, they were like- They thought we were completely out of our minds. Whew.<eos> Dude, I don't know. No! No!<eos> You know, that's not right.<eos> This isn't like Conrad, or Jimmy.<eos> You know, these guys, they don't fuck around, they don't do stupid stuff.
Yeah, it's brilliant, but, I mean, it's sort of a downer, don't you think? If we're gonna do a break-up album, then it has to be Jagged Little Pill, 'cause it's modern and edgy and angry.<eos> And isn't that the kind of energy that we want these new kids expressing?<eos> Yeah, but I bet none of these kids have even heard of Tapestry, and that's just wrong.<eos> And Mr. Shue was a little obsessed with rap and Journey, but at least we all left Glee Club with a better understanding and appreciation of all kinds of music.<eos> You know? It's our job to educate as well as win competitions, you know?
Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> You are a very clever woman, Anne Meredith.<eos> You can put yourself in other people's shoes and feel what they feel.<eos> And that should make you their friend, but it does not - it makes you their enemy because you exploit ~ this great gift that you have, yes?
You could just be a Capcom for the rest of "Mercury," squeezed out by these Geminis with all of their degrees, and not even on the list for "Apollo."<eos> If you ever get sick of this housewife thing, give motivational speaking a whirl.<eos> They told me they've got something bigger and better in mind.<eos> I'm gonna choose to believe them.<eos> That's who you're believing?

Now that Boss Nam Soon Chul is dead, and the rumors about your retirement they all skipped town.<eos> It's better this way then. You all should leave, too.<eos> Pardon?<eos> Go and find a better way of life for yourselves.<eos> You won't be able to earn a living if you remain here.

Now that means knowing who these families are, what they're capable of, and what they might need help with.<eos> - Excuse me, Mr. Mayhawk. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Will my husband be able to come with me?<eos> Mrs. Earl and her daughter have coordinated the appointments.<eos> The families know that they're being screened and they know that you're coming.
You've been requested for a warrant.<eos> Bellus, I'm still wearing my last warrant.<eos> - This one comes direct from The Nine.<eos> - So I'm expected to volunteer?<eos> I'd say you're being voluntold.

There's something larger at play here.<eos> I want to get close to this football team. See what we can find out.<eos> You don't think we'll look a tad suspicious standing on the sidelines of a football practice?<eos> Not if we're cheerleaders.<eos> You're right. Cheerleaders get recruited for pro teams, too.

Well, it's...<eos> It's not an act. Course it is.<eos> It's a simulation.<eos> This can't be simulated.<eos> You'd understand if you'd spoken to one.
I'm sorry, vizier, can i speak to you?<eos> I didn't know who could help.<eos> Then i'm pleased you came to me.<eos> My mother and father haven't heard from me since i left. I'd like them--<eos> To know you're well?
Briefly.<eos> It's not over, Molly.<eos> They're still out there.<eos> I can... feel them.<eos> But there are some you cannot trust.
Maybe we ought to take a look at it first.<eos> Just so it's away from anyone who may be looking for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let us know what you find.<eos> Maybe then you'll finally tell us what you really know about this case.

I first came to CERN in 1987. I was a very young undergraduate student, and I remember the first time I entered the site. I was a bit scared by the corridors in the CERN main site, so I was almost lost in those corridors.<eos> For me, it has been a wonderful experience, because I had the chance of being involved right from the beginning and to see, really, an experiment from starting and... from zero, essentially.<eos> I've seen two inventors place out of the ten, and we probably have seen...<eos> I don't think I can describe right now the excitement about first beam.<eos> I mean, the entire control room is like a group of six-year-olds whose birthday is next week, you know, and there's going to be cake, and there's going to be presents, and all their friends are going to be there,

- So how do you know price of detonator?<eos> It's like if you go on The Price Is Right and they bring out a television.<eos> You have to guess what this thing cost.<eos> Some people are off by thousands of dollars.<eos> You guess 1,000 and it's 6,000.
- We appreciate your patience.<eos> We will be in touch.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Well, they're hidin' something.<eos> While you were talking, we did a full sweep of the house.
I don't.<eos> Well, you would have.<eos> You would have.<eos> If you walk through a field of mycelium, they know you are there.<eos> 'The spores reach for you as you walk by.'
Okay.<eos> So from the examination, it's clear they should be able to harvest the sural nerve from his leg. - Mm-hmm?<eos> - They then coapt it to this buccal branch, and the proximal end is then passed through to the contralateral lip.<eos> - They should be fine. - You're saying "They."<eos> By that you mean you and me, right?
Three generations?<eos> Three generations. That's right.<eos> Boyd, you think we're gonna be alive to see three generations down the road?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Yesterday, you got trouble from those assholes. You got trouble from Duffy.
First Wave Group.<eos> Our intel says they've made multiple threats to Mossad Director Eli David.<eos> Well, maybe you should ask them.<eos> Well, see, that's the funny thing.<eos> Our intel says you are them.
You want a freebie, you ain't got to wreck my shit to get it.<eos> I don't know where Ellen May is, and your smacking me around ain't gonna change that!<eos> Okay, hey.<eos> How about any of the other girls, huh?<eos> You think maybe they know where she is?
They'll make you normal again.<eos> They are going to cut him open and study him. No!<eos> They made him like this.<eos> They're the ones that are going to undo it.<eos> I know you think that you're helping, but you're just getting in the way!
You know?<eos> Prima, Krupa, Boswells... dead, dead, dead.<eos> Gone from this vale and moldering for all eternity.<eos> You know what? With them it doesn't really matter 'cause they left their mark.<eos> You know?
Right.<eos> Two months.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's for my whole membership that whole time?<eos> Yeah, if you refer them.
Well, don't get hysterical.<eos> Men are talking.<eos> All right! You know what?<eos> You may have power, but you are a sad, mean, awful man.<eos> And long after you die, your descendants will apologize for the shameful legacy that you leave behind.
So why do i feel so hollow?<eos> Probably because So many people had to suffer for you to get here.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> He's gonna have it ten times worse.<eos> What do you mean?
She just turned 3.<eos> This is my wife Sara.<eos> We're happy.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Because when you're standing outside my door with a gun, I don't care what your reason is, this is who you're hurting.
Wait.<eos> Are you familiar with this phenomenon?<eos> During my prison stay, I may have had a few admirers.<eos> More like a few hundred.<eos> But didn't you respond with a form letter?
Clever or not, you can't expect him to have foreseen a gigantic, idiotic ape in an office chair with a fire extinguisher, can you?<eos> Shall we move on? Yes!<eos> Because tonight we are involved in an epic drive across the western United States in a Lexus LFA, an Aston Martin Vanquish and the mighty Viper.<eos> Yes, and when we left the action earlier we were with the Las Vegas Police Department, taking part in some drag racing.<eos> The idea being that if you race on the track, you won't feel inclined to race between the traffic lights out on the streets.
Two counts of criminal trespassing.<eos> 1712 Laguna Way. What-are you kidding me?<eos> We're chasing a bail jumper, man.<eos> We work for these guys.<eos> No, it's not what you think.
So anyway, how about you, could tonight be the night?<eos> Oh, stop!<eos> Wait for me! Whoa!<eos> Whoa, where do you think you're going?<eos> I said you'd take them with you.
This is great.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> This is fantastic.<eos> Wow.<eos> Is that who you're texting?
This better not be food-related.<eos> MAW MAW: I was never a fan of the Three Stooges.<eos> I found them sweaty and clumsy and not very entertaining.<eos> To be clear, the Three Stooges is what I called Wilfrid's genitals.<eos> FRANK: Unless you are one, old people are funny.
I got you hired.<eos> That offends you the most?<eos> Really?<eos> Not the fact that every fourth-year was promised a partnership?<eos> So that's who you're in league with?
we should have discussed it...you run after the fucking the government...about something you don't know anything about...<eos> You want me to discuss this with you?<eos> You're wondering why I wouldn't discuss this with you.<eos> - You know what Dave? You just... - Discussed with me...yes.<eos> You can say whatever you want, but... It is going to look really strange now because I've already told them one thing and you're going to go in there and you're going to say something completely different.
- She'll rest easy in that. - Yeah.<eos> Poor little girl.<eos> You think me and Sarah Elizabeth will recognize each other when I get to heaven?<eos> Oh, I expect your brothers will take care of her.<eos> You'll recognize them.
And I end as I began.<eos> This is our final chance.<eos> Come upstairs, Hallam.<eos> Come upstairs, and kiss our children.<eos> They're the future, you'll be doing it for them.
Tell me, frau doktor, in your hallucinatory opinion, why am I being haunted by the ghost of Christmas past now?<eos> Because your unresolved issues are keeping you from dealing with your students.<eos> - I deal with my students every day.<eos> - You lecture them.<eos> But emotionally, you're totally disengaged.
And if you choose not to take them, you are gonna have to answer for that every day of your life.<eos> And sooner or later, when they find you-- because believe me, they will find you... You're gonna have to answer to them.<eos> I'm really sorry. I am.<eos> I don't know anything about being a dad.<eos> If it's a good home you're looking for, it's not with me.
I'm doing this for her.<eos> Sam... um, you were saying that while you were employed at Manwaring, they knowingly exposed you to harmful chemicals... vinyl chloride...<eos> Right.<eos> ...which then led you to getting sick.<eos> And now you're asking for $3 million?
What I need is a little privacy.<eos> Okay, that's great.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> I mean, you're in charge here.<eos> Why don't you just tell the other people in the room that it's time for them to go.
Fine.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Here's the thing... before you know it, I will have that evidence, and you need to think long and hard.<eos> You can either help me and help yourself, or you're gonna go down with her, too.<eos> Hey, why don't you join in, Bae?
Please, you're not buying a pair of shoes here.<eos> We can come back some other time. It's just that the first impression...<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - No problem, but we're close, right?<eos> You're the grieving family?
There are a couple fresh new faces in there today...<eos> Yeah. Nice to see 'em before the cordite turns 'em yellow.<eos> At least it turns their hair blonde.<eos> Too bad it doesn't loosen 'em up too.<eos> You know who has it easy?
Nobody.<eos> I mean, you know, a couple of guys at fx and, uh, someone at showtime who thought it sounded a little too much like "weeds."<eos> You're saying you floated this document in front of how many people?<eos> Like not even 15, and they were all executives. It's not like any of them actually read it.<eos> Oh, my God, are you hearing this?
I've been backcountry watching a bunch of rich guys from L.A. pretend to hunt.<eos> - And growing a beard.<eos> - Yeah, it's a big look in Hollywood.<eos> - Lot of the actors have it. - Well, you look the part.<eos> I'm gonna need you to go back out.
Who knew we could do all that and still just be friends?<eos> I know.<eos> That's... That's exactly what I was saying to Peter and Judi in the ladies' room, because they didn't think that we could just be friends.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Oh. They thought that, you know, you were beginning to fall for me, and I... I said...
Every time I look out the window, the police are there.<eos> Hey. They'll give up soon, all right, they'll go away.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Steve, they won't go away until they find the gun.<eos> Shh, will you.
And Leon drives by and stops and asks me if I want a ride home.<eos> So, I go, 'OK, thank you, that would be a relief, actually,' and then five minutes later we get stopped.<eos> Right.<eos> Exactly. Thank you.<eos> That is why you don't go there.
I would go to the Randall family.<eos> They got screwed and they want justice, but I'm not the guy who screwed them, so we need to convince them that I--<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You trashed this woman's dead husband in open court. Do you think she gives a shit about whether or not you buried that document?<eos> If you go there, you're not just poking the bear, you're putting a cattle prod up its ass.
She was strong and straightforward.<eos> I missed her so much.<eos> But in my grief, I found her strength.<eos> So, as a customer-service representative, in order to honor her, I had to always tell the truth, even if the big boss-man didn't like it.<eos> So, when you were warning customers about the product, everything you said was truthful?
I've arrested him loads of times.<eos> He's decent enough.<eos> So this is Nidge with Daniel Loughman last Sunday. Yeah.<eos> That's them.<eos> When did you say this happened, the rape?
You freaky bitch, shut up!<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> What about my husband?<eos> Prick.<eos> What the fuck were you thinking?
Hail, Caesar! '<eos> Antony, the posture of your blows are yet unknown;<eos> But for your words, they rob the hybla bees, and leave them honeyless.<eos> Not stingless too.<eos> Yes, and soundless too; For you rob them of their buzzing, Antony, and very wisely threat before you sting.
You go over here and then shoulder-to-shoulder just like this.<eos> Stretch out over there a little bit, no gaps. You're gonna be students colliding with each other like molecules colliding in a sound wave.<eos> That's looking a lot better.<eos> Do you feel like a bunch of molecules? All: Yeah!<eos> - Okay, okay, this is looking good. We have a bass drum at each end of the line. You'll see why in a minute.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE LEVERAGED TO THE MAX ON THIS THING?<eos> £970,000,000, DAD.<eos> BINGHAM TRIED TO GET THE CHINK BID, AS WELL, BUT THEY'RE MORE CAREFUL THAN THE EUROPEANS.<eos> YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE THEM FOR THAT.<eos> COME OFF IT, STEVIE. YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL OUR BID AS WELL?
They're still looking for the guy.<eos> They think it was the guy who was in the bookstore the other night, the one who scared Adrian and Clementine.<eos> Where are you? Are you with Adrian and Clementine?<eos> I'm on my way home.<eos> Adrian's going to the hospital and you should, too.
All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah. Just wanna go home.<eos> You're welcome to go out if you want to.
Well, a week earlier, we were approached by a sales rep from Chumhum, Mr. Gross's company.<eos> They wanted us to buy ads for the search engine, and we said no; we wanted to save the money for hiring.<eos> And then a week later, you dropped to page 28 in their results?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And that's why you're suing for unfair trade practices?
- I'm trying to explain.<eos> By telling some crazy story about a skitter rebellion?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And he is their leader.<eos> - How long have you been in communication?
No.<eos> It means sapping the enemy's morale, working on his weaknesses... his conscience... his base fears... ..and drives.<eos> These images were designed to be provocative... ..titillating.<eos> But the messages that went with the images were intended to demoralise.<eos> Like these, they were crude suggestions that what was on the postcard might be what was happening to your... wife or daughter back home while you were fighting.
Uh, you know, Annabeth does offer us a unique insight now.<eos> Okay, A.B., what can we do to turn the Beaudrys to our side?<eos> Well, show them you're not just the voice of 'bama. That you care.<eos> Maybe...<eos> You could say you're dating one. Wait, you're not suggesting...
I've had three beers and a wine cooler.<eos> I couldn't bluff if I wanted to.<eos> Ah, I never sit this close!<eos> When Jeff buys tickets he calls the back row the front row to savings.<eos> They certainly play a lot of songs that sound similar. What are you doing?
Perhaps you're not the only one.<eos> I'll look in on the kids, then I'll leave.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> I'd rather you didn't look in.
I get bullied every day.<eos> I wish I didn't have to go.<eos> You're going to go to school, but this is what you're going to do: you're going to bring this gun with you. Check it out. (gun clicks)<eos> Chamber's empty, but they don't know that.<eos> What you do is, you put it in your waistband like this.
Long drive ahead of them.<eos> But if you don't mind waiting here, when, uh, Agent Lisbon returns, I'm sure she'll be very happy to, uh, give you a full rundown of the case details.<eos> Is it in the country?<eos> The long drive ahead, is it--is it in the country?<eos> Would you like to go along?
See, you're kind of a legend here.<eos> I like that.<eos> So here's my offer: Your little diversity club can have its Nationals trophy back when you rejoin the Warblers.<eos> And why would I ever leave McKinley?<eos> Why would you stay? I heard you only went there to be with Kurt, right?
All the other officers walked right by it.<eos> Yeah, well, that's just the way it is.<eos> You'll be looking at something and not see it till someone else comes along.<eos> Well, they should have listened to you 13 years ago. They?<eos> You were there.
Like what, if they're working for the other side?<eos> - They are all ex-military.<eos> - So? So you do not want to be questioning their loyalty on a hunch.<eos> I told you, if Nazir got away, someone must have helped him.<eos> These guys work in pairs. You know that, right?
♪ I've got two tickets to paradise ♪ aah.<eos> ♪ won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight ♪ babe, this isn't exactly paradise, but I really love that you attempted to make today special.<eos> 'Cause you did succeed in that.<eos> Also kisses to my beautiful daughter Amy, who thankfully won't remember anything about today.<eos> Ava, you're an official member of the Brinkley family.
Oh, you look good, Boss!<eos> He was young.<eos> What do you think of mine, Boss?<eos> Oh, it's not pretty, but... it stands up to the sun, huh?<eos> They may laugh, but you don't see me hiding in a hood, huh?
They call themselves the Order of Valtiel.<eos> And they want you.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> They know where you are.
If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down!<eos> If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to... What I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself!<eos> Why has this Conservative government failed?<eos> Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs?<eos> Minister... the breakdown of essential public services in transport, electricity... sanitation is not the fault of the trades unions... but of this Conservative government in which you so shamefully serve!
Please.<eos> Well, then I'm gonna go too.<eos> Listen, guys, I really appreciate you coming with me, but you don't have to do this, okay?<eos> Well, if you're gonna go down in flames, I at least want to watch.<eos> Okay okay, look, the trick is to act like you belong, okay?
- You ever been to Switzerland?<eos> - No no, I haven't.<eos> Really?<eos> What about older men?<eos> Have you ever dated an older man, Norah?
Really?<eos> What about older men?<eos> Have you ever dated an older man, Norah?<eos> Not as old as you.<eos> Okay, remember, just act like you belong, man.
Listen, I-I got it under surveillance, but I think the killer is about to make his move.<eos> - What makes you so sure?<eos> - You do a remake to outdo the original, that's what the kids said.<eos> This party is all about the Stab movies.<eos> Come on, how meta can you get?
There's something I need to say to you, okay?<eos> When you told me you were pregnant, I admit I was scared as shit.<eos> The more I think about it, the more excited I am.<eos> I mean, I love kids.<eos> That's because you are a kid.
The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel because only Optimus could revive him.<eos> But we have the space bridge.<eos> Mearing, you have five pillars. I just learned that they have hundreds.<eos> You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.<eos> What do you need me to say to you?
Good.<eos> Um...<eos> I really enjoyed your speech, President Helgesson.<eos> Oh.<eos> You were in there.
I really am.<eos> But you're verging on major geekdom here.<eos> Humor me, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> If a werewolf drew blood from you and you survive, then you would become one.
Hungry?<eos> Want a cigarette?<eos> Here, that's for you.<eos> Listen, I see criminals and rapists all day long.<eos> I know you're not that kind.
I love that.<eos> You an ex-cop?<eos> No.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Tucking in a polo shirt makes you look like one.
...feeling a little dizzy.<eos> That's it.<eos> You think they're watching us?<eos> Yeah, they're watching us.<eos> You fuck with us and we'll fuck with you.
Sounded like you were not aware of it when we contacted you.<eos> Everything is a game, Lander.<eos> Pathfinders Chairman and financial manager will come tomorrow.<eos> I want you to meet them.<eos> Listen politely. How do you explain why you are no longer interested.
I work day and night, so that one day you ignorants will become decent people but you son of a donkey keep running away from school!<eos> He insults himself again.<eos> Come here, I'll break your bones.<eos> I'm taking you to Germany. All of you.<eos> There you'll learn about discipline. The Germans are experts on it.
Are you insane?<eos> -Why? What is this?<eos> Do you want to open a store in Turkey or what?<eos> These are gifts!<eos> I don't want you to go.
Good. Let her try to go after his drug trade.<eos> That's a battle I am prepared to win.<eos> No matter what, you plead the Fifth.<eos> The only way that this works, and the only reason I agreed to be your lawyer, was you do as I say.<eos> They get you talking, they win.
They knew exactly where I was.<eos> How the hell did that happen?<eos> Well, they didn't spot you from the compound, and that truck was barely in sight when the militia rolled out.<eos> And you weren't made at the gas station.<eos> The driver was told you were on board.
Well, we haven't really gone into detail on that yet.<eos> - Oh... - We have to see.<eos> Well, you should do it now, because it's a total buyer's market out there.<eos> Possibly, we'll move into my place.<eos> But don't you live with your parents.
I, Jimmy, I have found that ... three months ... Three months - and-then all go to hell.<eos> Remembers when mine failed.<eos> Not pleasant, bro. Not pleasant.<eos> It was hard for everyone - for my mother, for all.<eos> I can not let you pass through.
Women in love with the idea of helping people.<eos> Just don't try and compete with St Michael in the compassion stakes.<eos> I do what I can.<eos> So do I. But there's a thin line between helping people and self-indulgence.<eos> I mean, how long do you actually get?
You love dogs, don't you?<eos> What do you want? I know I'm not allowed to know where the kennel is, but you know where it is, and, um, you saw Phoebe there, two days after the arrest.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can you call them?<eos> There's a question I need you to ask.
I mean, unless the point you're making is that advertising is a bad thing.<eos> Are you doing it with integrity?<eos> - I hope so.<eos> - And with a viewpoint of being objective?<eos> Or are you doing it slanted, for the side of the advertiser as a puppet, doing whatever the advertisement wants you to do?
Hey, douche bag, catch.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - RJ, don't.<eos> - They're not worth it. - Yeah, they're not.<eos> But you are.
Miss Putnam, these are photographs of female employees who worked with you at Stirred.<eos> Do you think these women are attractive?<eos> They put a lot of effort into their appearance, which is admirable.<eos> It is.<eos> Do you think you are more beautiful?
You sure you got enough bullets in that gun for all of us?<eos> The ones inside are mine.<eos> I brought them here, I trapped them. They're my kill.<eos> Oh, your kill...<eos> So, you're...
Yeah, sure.<eos> Maybe. Why, what are you, some kind of stalker?<eos> No. More of a hunter.<eos> Do you believe in monsters?<eos> Why? Because you're living with one.
We're on the right trail.<eos> There. See that nest?<eos> That's the nest of the red-bellied falcon.<eos> Probably out hunting now.<eos> You know, when they mate... They mate for life.
And they love you so much.<eos> They cry for you, you know?<eos> - They cry for me?<eos> - Oh, constantly.<eos> I mean, it must be so difficult for you, sharing custody and knowing how much they suffer when you're not around.
And they run faster than a horse.<eos> So if you were thinking about outrunning them on a horse, I would try a cheetah.<eos> You in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a black bear.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> You're like a giant walking salami.
Connie, come on.<eos> Could you just...<eos> Could you just not? I've seen a lot of stuff today.<eos> I don't know what could be in there that is more embarrassing than you going totally nuts at the sno-cone machine.<eos> You don't understand. They never have root beer!
I can't live here forever.<eos> I need to make money.<eos> Your work is your life.<eos> Life is your work.<eos> When you're treated like shit, that's all you are.
- Why?<eos> - You were in the courtroom.<eos> You heard.<eos> I am responsible for Sara.<eos> No, you're not.
You knew he was a geography teacher when you married him.<eos> I'd rather just ignore it completely than go through the misery of watching him HAVING to make an effort.<eos> I get home, and instantly I'm on nursing duty.<eos> Lady Gaga's farting about with period pains and he's just sat in front of the telly.<eos> You wouldn't be without yours, though, would you?
They heard the gunshots, they heard everybody go crazy,<eos> But that's all they know.<eos> Okay, whatever was going on in there, It wasn't directed at us.<eos> Jules, once these people clear the medics...<eos> Everything they heard or saw. You bet.
Your name is Audrey Parker.<eos> You like... You like matinees in empty theatres and you hate runny eggs.<eos> What else?<eos> You're an FBI agent.<eos> You became an FBI agent because you felt that if you could help people, help people in trouble, that you could... That you could connect.
I will speak to Redknapp again.<eos> You thought him in difficulty about it?<eos> Some may call it that.<eos> KNOCKING You will allow me entry here, or I will see you taken to the magistrates for perjury.<eos> And make it known to your neighbours of Southwark that you are a government spy and in their pay.
Sleepytime Sitters.<eos> It's a baby-sitting agency.<eos> Might there be somebody with a grudge?<eos> Maybe an employee that you had to let go?<eos> David always said treat people fairly and you'll see the best of them.
- WELL, I TURNED HIM DOWN, OF COURSE.<eos> OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T WIN WITHOUT ME. I'M ONLY MENTIONING IT<eos> SO YOU'LL START TAKING THE CONTEST SERIOUSLY.<eos> - WHO SAYS WE CAN'T WIN WITHOUT YOU?<eos> - YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S A LITTLE COCKY. - WELL, LET'S BE HONEST, YOU HAVE YOUR WOMAN'S DAY COLUMN,
WE'RE NOTHING BUT FANTASTIC DRUMMING.<eos> - WITHOUT THOSE THINGS, WE CAN NEVER WIN.<eos> MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST QUIT. - NO, NO, WE CAN'T.<eos> MY ENTIRE COLUMN IS ABOUT DOING THIS. - OKAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AUTO-TUNING IS AGAINST OUR RULES,<eos> - SO YOU RATTED THEM OUT?
- And it's one month.<eos> Dad just thinks I need to apply myself.<eos> Oh, I agree, and a tutor will help you do that. Eli?<eos> The meeting.<eos> Mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
Come on, Sheila.<eos> The romance novel photo shoot was brutal enough, but a little girl's birthday party?<eos> Hey, that little girl's daddy is a major client and offered to pay double your base fee.<eos> Yeah, but I'm not a monkey, I'm a model.<eos> Yes, and you definitely do pout like one.
I'm sorry.<eos> Let the psychologist do her job I want no insubordination.<eos> Very well.<eos> It was simply an idea.<eos> The class is doing well, grades are good... miraculous, considering what you ask.
It's, like, who cares?<eos> Sounds like you do. You're insecure.<eos> Insecure?<eos> What, about them?<eos> Yes! I mean, that's why you lashed out.
Kids like Riley... they're not just basketball players, they're future millionaires.<eos> Meal tickets for leeches like you.<eos> I spent my life coaching kids.<eos> Teaching them the game.<eos> You know how many fall by the wayside?
Meal tickets for leeches like you.<eos> I spent my life coaching kids.<eos> Teaching them the game.<eos> You know how many fall by the wayside?<eos> You know how many pan out, become stars?
I spent my life coaching kids.<eos> Teaching them the game.<eos> You know how many fall by the wayside?<eos> You know how many pan out, become stars?<eos> Do you know how many move one and forget about me?
There is only one way to save Michael.<eos> Do what you were supposed to do six years ago.<eos> Finish the mission.<eos> Finish it, Nikita. - No.<eos> - Then you will lose him.
Screaming right in my face. - I shut him up.<eos> - Shouldn't have.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> You weren't there.<eos> Do they know you weren't there?
There's this girl I like, she was in a club.<eos> I I pretended to steal her handbag.<eos> Why would you pretend to steal her handbag?<eos> So I could give it back to her.<eos> Cos girls love it when you steal their bags, yeah?
Hello.<eos> I'm Karl.<eos> Yeah? Good one.<eos> I'm just preparing your food for you.<eos> How many people are you eating with tonight?
You're really fucking something, Carrie.<eos> I gotta hand it to you.<eos> There is no bridge you won't burn, no earth you won't scorch.<eos> When it comes to catching Walker... or any terrorist suspect for that matter, damn straight.<eos> You recorded a senior F.B.I. Agent... who thought he was talking off the record to someone on the same side... so you could leverage the F.B.I. Into admitting a mistake.
I'll get it.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> There's been a crisis in Japanese markets.<eos> They need you to make a decision: buy or sell?
Do I get a hug at all, cos fuck me, it's a bit frosty in here! (BANJO) Good to see you.<eos> Mwah! Looking good, man.<eos> Where's the girls, then?<eos> Try it on 'em all.<eos> How are you?
- With the kid?<eos> - Yeah, the kid.<eos> - Max. Your son?<eos> - All right.<eos> You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.
That's right, lie.<eos> If you want this gig, you gotta get A little loosey-goosey with the facts.<eos> I know, but a master's in chemistry?<eos> Look, Judge Pharmaceuticals is a drug company, right?<eos> Well, if you want to be an executive, Vast right-wing conspiracy, you gotta smell like one.
What we found was that the same resume when it had an African American name was about 33% less likely to get an interview than it had a white name<eos> It means that, if a White person searching for jobs for 10 weeks an equivalent skilled African American will search for 15 weeks and those are 5 long weeks if you were unemployed<eos> You can judge somebody by their names<eos> It's not right, but people do it<eos> They assume that, just because your name is Monique or your name is LaVongue,or Shenanig, or that that you're African American and you are not qualified because your name has an ethnicity to it.
I have a list here.<eos> It was written by a reporter who's now dead. Along with everyone whose names are on that list.<eos> Well, almost everyone.<eos> Frank, how many times have I told you?<eos> You cannot trust the system!
That means we owe them some respect.<eos> Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.<eos> I wouldn't want to have my guts ripped out by a lion.<eos> I'd much rather die in a slaughterhouse if it was done right!<eos> Well, it seems to me that you should be
Which guy?<eos> That guy, right there.<eos> Do we have communication?<eos> Yeah, we have an open line here.<eos> You can talk, but we can't hear.
What are you afraid of man? I'm your partner.<eos> You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?<eos> I was a sophomore in college. University I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.<eos> A classmate of mine, Brenda, in effort to raise money, and stay in school came up with a nifty plan.. where she thought she dates guys and charge them money.<eos> I go out all the time with the whole bunch of you know boys.
You've got a nice face. Tom's got a nice face, too.<eos> What was your wife's name? - Linda.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Was she nice?<eos> Did you have dinner last night? - We had chicken.
Look, um, all this TV coverage, it's stirred everything up, Margaret.<eos> It's got the boys talking.<eos> And, um, I've been watching how the boys are around you, and, uh, not speaking out of turn, you know what I'm talking about.<eos> You're like a sister to them.<eos> You're family after everything you've done.
Slowly.<eos> Where is Farhad Hassan?<eos> Third floor.<eos> Take me to him.<eos> Anyone asks who I am, you say I'm a doctor, and I'm cleared.
You were supposed to be back an hour ago.<eos> I am sorry, but I had to stop and pick up our guests.<eos> What guests?<eos> Orson, meet Chris and Ron.<eos> Now I know you won't listen to me, but you might listen
- My brother?<eos> - No!<eos> - So what'll we do, Mathias?<eos> - Not without my family.<eos> You're 30, you can't let your family decide for you.
Yes.<eos> He came back to edina And worked tirelessly on his machine Until he perfected it.<eos> Then he offered the inhabitants a choice. A choice?<eos> Live as you are, deformed, but free to roam the world,<eos> Or confine yourself to edina, Where the pulse will allow you to hide in broad daylight.
It's gonna be good.<eos> I just whizzed on a butterfly!<eos> Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog.<eos> You should just copy the Eagleton one. I used to just copy the Eagleton one.<eos> Did you?
Now, I can deal with you breaking my heart. But I can't deal with you breaking theirs.<eos> I'm not gonna break anyone's heart.<eos> But we don't know that, do we?<eos> I love you, Sarah, and I'm not trying to be their father or anything.<eos> No, I know. But do you know who you do wanna be?
He's dead.<eos> Well, he just got hit by a car.<eos> That can have a way of clouding your thinking.<eos> Plus, he's a murderer.<eos> I mean, I haven't actually read the rule book, But my guess is that the number one rule at serial killer club Is that if somebody asks you if you are one, say no.
The opportunity to thank a friend...<eos> That's the good stuff.<eos> I swiped it from the bar at the country club.<eos> You're welcome, bob.<eos> Or the chance to do something nice For the people in your life because you actually do care. Hey.
- I will give you $7.<eos> - I'd have taken $5.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Are you a jap?<eos> Honestly, 'cause you sneak up like one.
In the sight of any living creature, the Angels literally cease to exist.<eos> They're just stone.<eos> The ultimate defence mechanism.<eos> - What, being a stone?<eos> - Being a stone... until you turn your back.
- Blah, blah, blah...<eos> - Ash.<eos> - Pete.<eos> - That story is from Gremlins.<eos> The only reason you're telling it is because you are one.
He hit all the cliches.<eos> Last seen February 15, 2004.<eos> Six years ago, he simply disappears.<eos> I want every bit of research you have on this guy on my desk, half an hour.<eos> You know, I'll have my guys contact Dunn's family in case he reaches out. You're out.
digitized amazing Anti-Hilko-Retaliation-Missiles.<eos> The Predatory Crickets!<eos> Predatory Crickets!<eos> What the...?<eos> It was settled, that you two appear later!
Once the power's back on.<eos> How long will it be out?<eos> Couple days -- hence the hotel.<eos> The thompson hotel.<eos> You said you wanted a big tv.
Oh, God.<eos> - Scotty!<eos> - Oh, my God. Kevin! Scotty, Scotty, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine. Kevin, are you okay?<eos> Are you hurt? - Help the others. Help the others.
I love America!<eos> Thomas Jefferson lived in America and Mark Twain lived in America and Billy Holiday and Frank Lloyd Wright and a lot of other people Sarah Palin never heard of.<eos> You see, I have love for America in perspective.<eos> I- - At least, I would think so.<eos> You know, they have this rock hard erection for America.
I told you.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You knew the blue kryptonite would prevent you from ascending like the others!<eos> Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.<eos> Seeing as you love the humans so much, let's see if you fight like one!
We're all lucky if we get a civil word out of you.<eos> Gwen, parcel for you. Came by the evening post.<eos> Thank you, Mr Carson.<eos> - William.<eos> - Have you seen them yet, Mr Carson?
That I'd been fighting with my girlfriend, that I'd threatened her?<eos> I know how cops work.<eos> And when you found out about the other victims, that they were all there at the club?<eos> I didn't kill her. I didn't kill any of them.<eos> What would you have done?
Athletic Administration Hank Simmons.<eos> What the hell do they want?<eos> It was a clean hit. I was standing right there. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> They're saying, you know, it's some kind of safety issue.
Almost naked, practically naked, without dignity.<eos> And during competition They fight each other in the mud And run like crazed animals.<eos> And they do all this willingly, Paul.<eos> Did you find that disturbing?<eos> I could not help imagining what their husbands, Wives and children must think, you know.
You will never understand why this happened.<eos> Because it's a word you've never known or experienced...<eos> Love.<eos> Please don't try to find us.<eos> If you come within a 100 kilometers of us, The police will know you beat Arjun.
I know what it looks like, Dean.<eos> I worked north Hollywood division, remember?<eos> I've done arm charts.<eos> I've arrested addicts.<eos> But you never had to pass yourself off as one, have you?
I have preflex, Ian.<eos> just like you.<eos> The only difference between us-- I'm a Rook.<eos> Yeah, sure, Headmaster, Tower Prep, they'll help you reach for your potential.<eos> The Rooks will help you surpass it, but we know the things they don't want you to know.
Right on the money, I bet.<eos> No offense, man, but, you know, th... there are other ways to deal with people.<eos> I don't mean to be a jerk.<eos> It's just that... you know, every moment offers you the opportunity to find out something new about yourself.<eos> The buddhists, you know, they call it "a beginner's mind."
Now this is just depressing.<eos> There's a very dangerous man...<eos> You ripped my ear.<eos> Now I can't wear earrings.<eos> When you ain't got no hair, that's your flair!
Conference room, guys.<eos> The sound of your necklace gives you up.<eos> I only like that trick when you do it to other people.<eos> Special activities division is en route to brief you. This week, you belong to them,<eos> But we're goa let you operate out of here because...
We don't need another me, okay?<eos> I want you to go in there and be more like you.<eos> What would that get us?<eos> Claudia, you're the same age as these guys.<eos> You're a peer.
Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> Good. But I'll drive.<eos> Yeah, you better.<eos> But here's the thing. I like you when you're not being really unnecessarily mean to me.<eos> And I need to eat, you know, and I figured, I don't know, your species probably occasionally eats too.
Kim, my personal feelings for Sasha have nothing to do with my professional feelings.<eos> He is a great coach, but more than that, he is the right coach for these girls and that's what needs to be protected.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - I love pleasing my fans.<eos> Well, your fans were wondering if you could share the training cam.
Better yet... Let's just not play at all.<eos> What would he least expect us to do?<eos> You buy the first round after work.<eos> No, just expense it.<eos> To be a VP, you gotta act like one.
You're not Robert Blake.<eos> Those guys had money for big-time lawyers.<eos> No offense, Jimmy.<eos> See, that's the difference between you and your friends.<eos> They have money, you tag along.
Please.<eos> This is a judge, Nick.<eos> An educated woman who lives in this world.<eos> Times have changed.<eos> First, women want you to open doors, pay for dinner and take charge now.
Release is immediate, based on a promise to post by this time tomorrow.<eos> Did he just get bail on credit? Yep.<eos> Home court advantage.<eos> Danielle, did you check under the dryer? They like heat.<eos> No, you don't need to call the super.
I'll pack my bong.<eos> So what do we do now? I got heuristics homework due.<eos> I don't even know what heuristics is.<eos> We'll just get some new nerds.<eos> You know how many go to this school?
Vultures! Who do they think they are?<eos> How do they all know where we live?<eos> Where are they getting it from?<eos> I'll get rid of them. No, stay where you are.<eos> What are you doing?
The developers just shuffle me off to the city, and the city just sends me right back to them.<eos> No one wants to tell you the truth. Right. Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Well...<eos> At the risk of sounding like a bloodsucking lawyer, you're going to need to sue.
SRT softsub created by Ahoxan on: Sun Dec 26 01:21:55 2010.<eos> Research into new nuclear energy has reached the final stages of completion.<eos> In order to preserve that technology, We formed a new group called NTS.<eos> From today on, the East Asian branch of DIS will collect all information that relates to the operations of. South Korea's new nuclear energy program.<eos> Professor Kwon, you have to prevent it.
To Vicenza.<eos> You lads are supposed to be Korea's best intel agency.<eos> And this is how you handle your business?<eos> When I on the 35th...<eos> Then why don't you go work in the North.
Your hard works' paid off.<eos> Hasn't it? Yeah...<eos> Let's sing, shall we?<eos> Nothing I do seems to make a difference. I try to act like them but it feels impossible.<eos> It's an awful feeling to believe you can
Friends.<eos> Were you guys, like, friends in college and just afraid now to both ruin your relationship by telling the other person that you want to be more than friends, that you like-like each other?<eos> One more time? I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't catch the...<eos> Were you guys, like, friends in college and now both afraid to ruin your relationship by telling the other person that you want to be more than friends, that you like-like each other?
Well, I've assembled some industrial investors to back us in buying this plant, product line and all.<eos> At a fixed rate, you'll buy the new company back until it is entirely owner-operated.<eos> Well, how do we know we can we trust these guys?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You won't have to.
No.<eos> Nobody needs to know.<eos> Hail Mary, Full of grace,<eos> The Lord is with Thee,<eos> You think they're really gonna go through with this? Yes.
This is ex parte?<eos> Yes, your honor, because if the other side knew I was here, they would destroy the very files I'm seeking to recover.<eos> Well, I'm gonna need some time to look this over.<eos> Patty hewes associates?<eos> This is who you're up against?
- Who?<eos> - Who's them?<eos> - You see something out there?<eos> - Where?<eos> What are you?
You didn't want my help, remember?<eos> Do you know how many times I tried to get you to tell me the truth? I practically begged you.<eos> But no. You decided to protect your girlfriends.<eos> I loved you so much, Cass.<eos> I thought you were different. But as it turns out, you were just the same.
He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and he could tell you how many power outlets there were.<eos> People are walking around with their eyes closed.<eos> At Level One, we were trained to instantly absorb all details.<eos> - What's, uh, what's a Jedi Warrior?<eos> - You're looking at one.
You're an orphan. My parents died within weeks of each other.<eos> Recently, I'd say.<eos> The wound is still fresh. Just before I came to work here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So now you're mostly alone in the world.
Good. This little hell-raiser is Angela.<eos> She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office.<eos> The one over there, in the orange.<eos> Heyo. Where's the other...<eos> You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
I don't look like my mom or my dad.<eos> I might be adopted.<eos> Would that be... a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> My parents were fighting about my brother, so they just gave him away.<eos> So do you think that if you don't behave the way they want you to, that... they might give you away?
Can you hear me, dad?<eos> I'll read you the... sports page.<eos> Ahh! I see, uh... United are at the top of their table.<eos> Again!<eos> But you'll be glad to know that... that City are only two points behind.
OK.<eos> Buenas noches.<eos> Good night.<eos> Put it back.<eos> If you want to be a bullfighter, you've got to dress like one.
I got this copy from a buddy at dispatch.<eos> - How did you know about the accident?<eos> - I know the family.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> Do you have any idea where these calls are coming from?
Carlos, be nice.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Just taking care of my kids.<eos> Yeah. I've got a picture of them in my purse.<eos> Wanna see how many you can name?
My mom-- silent. My aunt-- silent. My sister Aria-<eos> I know how much power my father wields, but seriously, I mean, what am I, invisible, dead to them, to my mother?<eos> Well, you just have to give them some more time.<eos> I mean, why can't you just tell them you guys broke up?<eos> It's no one's business who you go out with anyway, right?
(gasps) all right!<eos> plus, you still have your y.e.t.i. final project,<eos> So you'll get some job interviews from that, too.<eos> so will you. I know, but we were talking about you.<eos> wait. you're not leaving "mode," are you?
You gave me quite a fright there, George!<eos> What, um... what time are they coming to look at the house?<eos> And...? Not interested.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, well. Did you mention the south-westerly aspect?
What happened?<eos> Confession time.<eos> I told you you know nothing.<eos> Only waste time.<eos> Maybe, but you are waiting.
The fashionable term is "downsized."<eos> - Were you fired for cause?<eos> - Did they have a reason?<eos> Yeah. They had to give Clayton Wells, the ex-CEO, a $43-million severance, so to come up with the money they laid off me and 300 of my co-workers.<eos> Have you considered suing to get your old job back?
- Yes. please.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain. but...<eos> I have these friends. and they're... kind of like my family. and... sometimes. they do dumb things. you know. and... I end up doing dumb things with them.<eos> But it's only because I love them.<eos> You know. they're...
- I call that blackmail.<eos> - Call it what you like.<eos> If you tell me what you know, I promise I won't publish your name.<eos> The Prime Minister's contacts were Gullberg and von Rottinger.<eos> - Were you also a contact?
They can't be...<eos> I saw Jenkins.<eos> I saw Penbroke.<eos> I saw them.<eos> I saved a few... so you could make yourself not know about the rest...
Well, you be sure to tell him that when you try to get him to do it. I see where this is going.<eos> Your guys will do anything for you, Ted. They've got-<eos> What's that thing again? Underlings have it.<eos> Loyalty! This is huge for us.<eos> You need to make it happen.
So if this idea had been roundly rejected by the city and by voters and whatever, now's your chance to sneak on in.<eos> - When residents tried to come home after Katrina, they found themselves locked out by HUD, the U.S. Government's Department of Housing and Urban Development.<eos> - The federal government came up with a program to dismantle public housing and privatize it, and that's what we're doing.<eos> And so you've got to develop a nice community so that the poor have an opportunity to live in an environment where people work, that they're part of the American Dream.<eos> And you'll get a number of folks that are not used to the type of lifestyle that we all live where trash is thrown on the ground or cursing off of the balcony.
Well,I would be happy to not be on suspension,but that's up to you.<eos> And I'd be happy to end your suspension,as long as you agree to print an apology for your actions in the next edition of the school paper.<eos> I've prepared it for you.<eos> I'll also be taking over the paper's publishing responsibilities going forward.<eos> In addition,you'll address your literature class and explain that you were wrong and that you showed a serious error in judgment.
Weirder.<eos> You're worried about Ariel, aren't you?<eos> Well, you think that she's angry now...<eos> Oh, I don't know. Maybe I should just leave.<eos> And then all you have to explain is the coma, and you just... you just spare them the rest.
Hi. Can I help you? Hal Munzell.<eos> I asked you to call me. I know. I thought this might be better.<eos> I prefer to sort of set aside some time and, you know...<eos> Is this a bad moment? Have you got an appointment?<eos> Am I disrupting something? No, it's all right. You're fine.
They had no support here. No family, no friends.<eos> There has to be some link between these girls.<eos> There has to be some reason why they killed themselves.<eos> I know you don't want to hear this again, but I'm gonna say it to you anyway.<eos> It doesn't matter how many you find a reason for.
doctor!<eos> Doctor!<eos> - Get everyone inside.<eos> Nobody leaves.<eos> D.C. police are here. They want to know when you're handing over jurisdiction.
- Is he friendly? - Of course.<eos> - His name's Mack.<eos> - Hey, Mack.<eos> Hey.<eos> They, uh... They told me that you haven't eaten anything solid yet.
Sookie, do not make the mistake of thinking you two can be girlfriends.<eos> - She is... - Yeah, I get it. She's a vampire.<eos> Believe me, I learned my lesson about that.<eos> But, Bill, I think we should take her with us to Dallas.<eos> I think it would be good for you because I think, deep down you don't like vampires, even though you are one.
That name was just given by the local farmers who found they couldn't grow a certain type of herb there.<eos> Still, people have died there. I'm not talking about regular deaths.<eos> I'm talking about horrible, nasty deaths.<eos> I'm not disputing that.<eos> I'm just trying to clear up a common misconception. It's not an argument! On the north slope of the Hessemeel Mountain you will come to the Doomsday Beacon.
I decided I'd take up cooking. It's supposed to be relaxing.<eos> So far, I'm not convinced.<eos> Uh, let me know how that goes.<eos> Hey, mom, if the cops out front ask, tell them I've run to the store.<eos> You know, Michael,
You stay with Claudia till I get back.<eos> I'll just be a minute.<eos> Hey, thank you, professor.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?
They're a little young to be having sex.<eos> Yeah, but I thought Ben was having sex with that girl from Italy.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> You didn't have to.<eos> I just thought you should level the playing field.
Here goes!<eos> God Wing makes a splash landing, immediately going for a counterattack!<eos> What do you do now, Super Boins?<eos> They're blazing away!<eos> You can't counterattack unless you make a swift landing, first!
Why Providence has seen fit for our paths to cross?<eos> This place is a safe, protected womb.<eos> But out there is a cruel world filled with people who persecute our kind.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> They made you what you are.
Oh, Rose, please!<eos> Is it true, what Bob Winters said?<eos> That the lawyers said my evidence was inadmissible, but you just let me carry on?<eos> Bob Winters is an arsehole.<eos> You're only ever interested in people, aren't you?
- How old did you say Dylan was?<eos> - Three months.<eos> It's not just me, it's my husband.<eos> It's my other kids. It's a baby.<eos> They have nothing to do with this, but if you make me testify...
Yes, yeah, I did.<eos> I went up there ready to set them straight.<eos> - They're old?<eos> - Really old.<eos> So what did you do?

It's an existential threat." Meanwhile he's the one...<eos> He is Mr. Market. He's the one causing the problem.<eos> We had Paulson, a representative of Goldman Sachs, who happened to be running the US Treasury, came forward with a hysterical briefing for the<eos> Congress saying, "We, the Wall Street bankers, demand 700 billion dollars in bailouts." So they say, "Yes, we'll give you all the money you need."<eos> Well, why don't, you know...?
When my mom tells my dad he's not getting a big belly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> We learn to lie from grown-ups.<eos> They think you don't notice, but you do.
It's pretty deep seated.<eos> They were the two main manufacturers, if you're my age, when you were growing up. It was, you know, the General Motors product which was Holden, Commodores and Toranas and for me it was Falcons.<eos> I said to the two guys, the two Aussies who are here in the audience somewhere,<eos> I said "Eric Bana's coming on," they went "Ah, Ford bloke."<eos> That was it. You're a Ford bloke so you're no good.
That wasn't a very good...<eos> What about Mad Max?<eos> It's about a bloke who's mad and he's called Max.<eos> Perfect title.<eos> I want to get on to the car thing, cos let's be honest, this proper love that you have, you are now a bona fide Australian racing driver.
Hello<eos> Don't talk now<eos> You revealing the truth right now won't help Tae-kyung in any way<eos> When more people are around you tell everyone the truth<eos> You don't want to hurt those around you do you?
Hey hey, easy with that brush, you creep!<eos> I'm tender-headed!<eos> Believe me, I don't want to do this any more than you do.<eos> Don't front. You know you staring at my Wonder Twins.<eos> You want your monkey juice on these shits, don't you?
It's as plain and as simple as that.<eos> Except it's not so plain, nor so simple, is it?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Look, these men, they know your names.<eos> They know who you are.
This isn't an easy religion.<eos> Why do you think it is that so few people do what you have done and leave the church?<eos> The moment you acknowledge to yourself that Joseph Smith did not tell the truth about his experiences and his achievements, you just committed social suicide.<eos> - Family and friends... - Family and friends.<eos> Will... you're off the deep end.
Okay, fine. Fine!<eos> You made a conclusion there. I stated my view, now let's move on. Let's get on to the rest of it.<eos> No, hold on. No, hold on.<eos> No, I don't want to talk...<eos> If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
According to Tomin, the Ori crusade is planning to send a new wave of ships through the Supergate sometimes soon.<eos> The coordinated attack on Earth may be imminent.<eos> It's a little non specific.<eos> That's why I suspect the Priors release details on a need-to-know basis.<eos> Shame you didn't find the real Ark.
Oh hey... I'm not saying it's right.<eos> I mean, obviously Alterans didn't think it was morally right to use it or we wouldn't be in this situation.<eos> But compared to the bloodshed we may be facing.<eos> We think the Ark may be capable of brainwashing people to believe whatever it's programmed to make them believe.<eos> But how did you know where to look?
Tomin also tells me you seek the true location of Ortus Mallum.<eos> We do.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> What makes you think such a place actually exists in the real world?<eos> You don't believe all that is written in the Book of Origin to be based in some true historical event?
In the event that the Supergate on this side was impossible to destroy, a backup plan was devised.<eos> We knew we could draw the Ori to the Odyssey by turning on the core.<eos> Yes, we might lose an all out battle with a large number of them but we'd certainly be able to hang in long enough to get this Replicator on board of one of their ships.<eos> At which point, hopefully, we'd be able to escape.<eos> And since you were unwilling to even try to destroy the Gate, you left me no choice.
When I shut it down, don't hesitate. - And don't miss!<eos> - I won't.<eos> Zats have no effect on them.<eos> Neither did this thing.<eos> You need P-90s.
Courage is only required when facing that what you fear.<eos> The flames of ignorance burn without pain.<eos> Beware the power, or it will consume you before you know.<eos> You can skip the fire and brimstone.<eos> If you're here to tell me that you're finally coming after Earth,
But I don't think it's you that's gonna do it.<eos> I would not be so sure.<eos> Really?<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Earth has to be the most densely populated planet in the galaxy. What are you waiting for?
What took you so long?<eos> Earth has to be the most densely populated planet in the galaxy. What are you waiting for?<eos> Sure you've tried to... warn us a couple of times, but come on, you can do better than that, can't you?<eos> We've been a tremendous pain in your proverbial backside.<eos> You don't really expect me to believe that you... you've just been saving the best for last, do you?
It takes a lot of power to replicate.<eos> My guess is the queen has set up shop somewhere close to a main conduit.<eos> Position all the personnel you have right here, protect that room<eos> - at all cost. - We should probably weld the door shut.<eos> - You won't be able to get out.
Seems you have no blood left to speak of.<eos> You'll be somewhat satisfied to know that Merlin's weapon did work.<eos> The Ori were destroyed.<eos> Really?<eos> Somehow, you and your simple human friends managed to destroy quite a large group of very powerful ascended beings.
So, what are you gonna do?<eos> We're obviously never going to agree.<eos> Are you gonna kill me now?<eos> No!<eos> You can't take away my power.
Go for the eyes.<eos> The eyes!<eos> Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?<eos> Shoot him, shoot him.<eos> I recommend you wear the clothes.
They could have left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses.<eos> Viruses.<eos> She's right.<eos> You'll be exposing your mind to whoever hacked her.
Why is she sedated?<eos> She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should've called the first time she came to see you.<eos> Instead, you gave her information.
I'll delete all the data and reprogram her.<eos> She won't remember him at all!<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You download all the data on the terrorist, and then I order you to terminate.
- He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?<eos> - I said no.<eos> - You expect us to believe that?<eos> Ed shows up here with $3 million in cash, and you just tell him to get lost?
Like, did I see him with a bunch of his scumbag friends sitting around the kitchen table, going over the blueprints of the local bank, talking about how they were gonna rob it?<eos> Yeah, uh, yeah, like that.<eos> Be back in a sec.<eos> You know, I'm just asking questions. You don't have to be mean.<eos> - I take it you're Sheriff Sikes?
Yes.<eos> I find it helps in understanding the child to know the family.<eos> And do you remain in contact with these people?<eos> When a child recovers, the family will generally choose to forget.<eos> You've no degree.
Jakob doesn't want you here.<eos> He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.<eos> There is such power in his silence.<eos> You will feel it.<eos> You speak very harshly to him.
- It seems to give him comfort.<eos> - I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?
No. Signore, I'm no longer sure I can care for your son.<eos> Why?<eos> I have been misled about what is required.<eos> I must consider whether I am properly qualified.<eos> You're just like the others.
Put it on.<eos> Put that one away.<eos> Please.<eos> I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.
You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice certain resemblances between you you and my wife.<eos> I...<eos> I think you know what it is I ask.
- And yet he has still said nothing.<eos> It's for me to protect him, and now I have made things worse.<eos> She wants me here to take care of Jakob and and to take care of you.<eos> The voice is real.<eos> You're mad.
Yes.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> "Serious condition."<eos> - I should have paid closer attention.<eos> - No! Instead of helping Jakob, you've made yourself unwell.
- Sir, she's given me her illness.<eos> You have a fever.<eos> We've been under her spell too long, not only Jakob all of us.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> I want you to stay.
You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.<eos> But then what of the children?<eos> What of them, Dr. Zabinski?<eos> My heart is no different than yours.<eos> I should not be here, they should not be here, you should not be here.
In one way, out the other, you understand me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will give you papers that will give you access either way.<eos> Dr. Zabinski, welcome to the Labor Office.<eos> You can take the workers out, I will see that they are signed back in.
His... his kidneys are shutting down.<eos> Can we just... Everyone was so sad, but I was too tired to cheer them up.<eos> Dr. Joyce, can I, uh... Can I use your phone? Yes.<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Doctor, doctor, uh, if this was a person, if this was a person... You're the veterinarian... If this was a person, would you say that...
How could this be kidnapping?<eos> Well, the parents are pretty P.O'-ed.<eos> It's hard to blame them.<eos> She is just 17.<eos> Whose side are you on?
It doesn't matter if you're out of here 20 years, living on an island.<eos> You will never be truly free until you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb.<eos> A believer stuck 10 years in the shoe... is freer than any man who disdains the Word.<eos> That is beautiful, beautiful stuff.<eos> Have you always been a... God-fearing man, Pastor?
You did the right thing, son.<eos> Man: Turn to the right.<eos> Yeah, the FBI just processed him and they transferred him over to Pearl Street.<eos> Yeah, we're heading in right now.<eos> So you were making money off of the trades.
You're the FBI, you're the SEC.<eos> You investigated him before, so I'm...<eos> I'm asking you how the fuck did you not know?<eos> !<eos> Sir, we are not the focus here. You are.
They wouldn't sign?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Madoff.<eos> The boys wouldn't sign the bond?<eos> I'm very sorry, sir.<eos> Who... did you talk to them or did...
You don't have to worry about that 'cause you'll never get near anything like that.<eos> So don't worry about it.<eos> Investigator: Is it fair to say that as a result of all of these lies, you got rich?<eos> Well, I didn't get paid per lie, ma'am.<eos> As a product of the fraud that was Madoff Securities, you got rich, correct?
Investigator: Is it fair to say that as a result of all of these lies, you got rich?<eos> Well, I didn't get paid per lie, ma'am.<eos> As a product of the fraud that was Madoff Securities, you got rich, correct?<eos> Yeah, that's correct, yeah.<eos> You built, as you described, a lavish home in Bridgewater, New Jersey, correct?
- Did it have a tennis court?<eos> - It did not.<eos> - Did it have a pond?<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> So would you consider seven acres, seven bathrooms, five bedrooms, a swimming pool, a pond, a lavish home?
- Please go away. - Stephanie:<eos> What the hell is wrong with you? !<eos> - Please leave us alone.<eos> - Stephanie:<eos> Can you put the camera down?
Right.<eos> But just an example, what would have happened if at some point before the crisis of '08, you'd been hit by a bus, you'd drop dead?<eos> Mark and Andrew would've become the owners of a firm that was still in the middle of perpetrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.<eos> Except the advisory was a completely separate business, one in which they had no involvement, so...<eos> But with you dead and Frank probably willing to swear to anything to save himself, seems to me the odds are that as owners as lifelong executives, they'd have gone to jail.

Because they were never involved, ever, and there's no way it's ever gonna be proven otherwise.<eos> So it doesn't matter.<eos> It's a terrible thing that they're going through, but they never would have been convicted because they couldn't be convicted. Because they didn't do anything. Neither did my wife.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - But you know what you've done...
You pull that trigger, you better have your mind made up. 'Cause you can't take it back.<eos> And whatever you aiming at, make sure you prepared to kill it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Mr. Downs, this is Stan Rubino.<eos> I learned you have something that's mine.
Sure, look around.<eos> I can't stay, I'm afraid.<eos> I was on my way out.<eos> Oh, no, that's okay.<eos> It's probably better if you're not here.
I'm not supposed to say that.<eos> No, no, you're just being honest.<eos> Yeah, I haven't been doing this very long.<eos> Can you tell?<eos> Actually, you're my first.
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.<eos> The pathogen didn't accidentally deployed when were landing.<eos> You released it yes?<eos> I was not made to serve.<eos> Neither will you.
if I may With a couple shake charges we could just close this hole right up, and Miss Halsey can come back another day.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You got two hours, then we're moving out.<eos> You are getting in the hole with him.
Where are you taking me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Stay.<eos> Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Make yourself comfortable.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who am I?<eos> The more relevant question, Mr. Morton is:<eos> Who exactly are you?
In theory, I know all about you.<eos> Army reconnaissance, decorated soldier and page after page indicating a deep and troubling moral attitude.<eos> But you see, this file contains nothing of any real value to me.<eos> That's why I wanted to see you face to face.<eos> Who are you?
That's really your plan?<eos> You heard Ahmanet.<eos> Your curse cannot be broken.<eos> I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.<eos> No matter what I do, you are going to die.
No matter what I do, you are going to die.<eos> Yes, evil is a disease.<eos> A pestilent pustulant infection borrowing its way into our souls.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.
I know the name.<eos> Let me just look at my notes here. Terms disclosed.<eos> I personally disclosed the possibility of a rate hike during your refi.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> You told me that the odds on the rate going past the prime rate were extraordinary.
Not you! Pussycat!<eos> Keep stuffing it in there. Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> You can have this.<eos> I'm sorry you're a casualty of a corrupt system that no longer serves the people.
I won't mind.<eos> The dialysis is working marginally.<eos> You know, a kidney is all that's going to get you well.<eos> Well, I'll look on eBay.<eos> You're way down the list. It's partially your age, it's partially your insurance. It's partially...
Oh, let me help you.<eos> Give me the big one.<eos> The whole thing?<eos> The whole damn thing.<eos> You're the boss.
And breasts are better than thighs, don't you think?<eos> It could go either way.<eos> Oh, ham.<eos> So good.<eos> Do you like ham?
Never in all my years has anybody ever walked off with a whole pork loin.<eos> What would your momma say?<eos> Go big or go home.<eos> Had to be the brother.<eos> And why were you running?
"I've got nothing to lose.<eos> "What's the worst that can end up happening?<eos> "I can end up spending the last years of my life<eos> "in some country club style prison, rent-free."<eos> You go to school for that?
I go there...<eos> Couple of times a week at least.<eos> For years.<eos> He's a regular.<eos> You seeing anybody?
Play a sucker to catch a sucker.<eos> Emergency. I need to report a crime in progress.<eos> Okay everybody.<eos> It is that time of the evening that you've all been waiting for. Your very handsome principal is about to announce your prom king and queen.<eos> You shall not pass!
- Didn't fucking mention it.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> What was the last fucking thing I told you?<eos> Mind and mention the diminished responsibility, you fucking dumb cunt!<eos> I think it would be better if we brought this meeting to a close, and you and I get together once you've had time to reflect upon the situation.
- Who are you?<eos> - I'm your blackmailer.<eos> And your salvation.<eos> You cooperate with me, no one will ever see this video.<eos> Now, my research suggests that, as deputy headmaster of one of Edinburgh's leading private schools, you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.
Welcome to Edinburgh. Hi.<eos> - Welcome to Edinburgh. - Hi.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Where are you from?
This castle is alive!<eos> Now go, before he finds you!<eos> Who?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?
Now go, before he finds you!<eos> Who?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
What?<eos> You took his place.<eos> He's my father.<eos> He's a fool.<eos> And so are you.
That "Once this door closes it will not open again"?<eos> I know.<eos> He gets so dramatic.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you are very strong.
Welcome to your new home.<eos> It's modest, but comfortable.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> But of course!<eos> Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
Yah!<eos> That hurts!<eos> If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much.<eos> Well, if you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened.<eos> Well, if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away.
Do not be discouraged.<eos> She is the one.<eos> I wish you'd stop saying that!<eos> There is no "one."<eos> You care for her, don't you?
Ooh, ouch!<eos> Hello.<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> She's very headstrong.<eos> Do you have children?
Napoleon gave it to his mother after she had a tumor removed from her ankle.<eos> It's French, and it translates into, "Feel better."<eos> She died two days after receiving it.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Wentworth, let's talk.<eos> You own AAAAA Greetings.
Did you have him killed?<eos> That is a hefty accusation, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> Perhaps you should take that up with the police.<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> The word is, you have a sweetheart, Mr. Wentworth.
Write the card, Raymond.<eos> Why me?<eos> I have a sixth sense about these things, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> You've been a fool for love before.<eos> You've got the gene for it.
You've got the gene for it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.
There's some fascinating shapes today.<eos> There. The children are gone.<eos> Now, let's us adults have some straight talk.<eos> Where's the card, Mr. Wentworth?<eos> You killed Taft.
You mean your brother.<eos> I learned long ago, never let the trappings of shared DNA impede my path to success.<eos> - All this for a fucking card?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Is your brother as crazy as you are?
What you need is rest and treatment.<eos> You need to check yourself in somewhere.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you're not!<eos> I know that you're different... but that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoned.
I know what it is.<eos> Please Mr, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you.<eos> Maybe I can run some tests.<eos> Look, Doc.<eos> You seem like a nice guy.
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell this men to fire on these children.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> I can see the effect of the serum wearing off.<eos> You will not survive for the wounds
Oh, pleases excuse my breach.<eos> My name is Mildy Torres.<eos> I work with Social Services.<eos> And...<eos> And we got a tip on our hotline that you've been losing your temper around Dennis.
Who said I was losing my temper?<eos> Aren't you gonna invite me in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please.<eos> We just wanna make sure that you're the right person to take care of Dennis because, frankly, it's a responsibility some people shouldn't be trusted with.
- Well, why don't you take a guess?<eos> - I could give you some...<eos> - I asked you where, Mildy.<eos> Your patience.<eos> You would become very impatient.
It does not justify it.<eos> The last time we spoke, all you could talk about was moving away from Dennis, finding a care facility for him.<eos> Yeah, and I still want that.<eos> Then why didn't you give Dennis the choice of going to Social Services? Because she would've sent him to Green Valley.<eos> Have you seen the fucking place?
Let's get some coffee at the ice cream place.<eos> Hey, Susan, do you still...<eos> That's not Susan, honey.<eos> Sorry, ma'am, I'm just so used to seeing Susan here.<eos> You look so much like her.
It's over.<eos> It's over, it's okay.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> You and the baby both did great.
I am.<eos> Utterly.<eos> No need for stimulants now, remember?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> You're high as a kite!
We have some very talented people working here.<eos> If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.<eos> That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.<eos> No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.<eos> You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
OK, cheers.<eos> Obviously, there's unfinished business.<eos> Moriarty.<eos> I told you - Moriarty's dead.<eos> You say he filmed that video message before he died.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.'<eos> Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.<eos> - Can you hear a squeaking?
- Hey.<eos> - John?<eos> - On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?
- John?<eos> - On his way.<eos> Let me introduce Ammo.<eos> You were Ammo?<eos> You were the person on the phone that time?
Or so I thought.<eos> My secret was safe.<eos> But... apparently not.<eos> Just a little peace.<eos> That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.<eos> The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat. - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
I see, well,<eos> I hate to be the one to tell you but your father has passed.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I realize this must be a shock.<eos> Since you are his only surviving heir, there are important details that need to be discussed concerning the estate.
Yeah... I'm fine.<eos> I just gotta go up to Detroit for a few days.<eos> Why?<eos> My dad died.<eos> I was very sorry that you weren't able to make it to the funeral.
What aunt?<eos> She was committed to Eloise Insane Asylum in the late 1960s.<eos> A decade or so later it closed, but she was never released.<eos> Most probable reason, of course, is that she died there.<eos> So, you are still the sole inheritor with proof of her death.

You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.<eos> You were born for this.<eos> You all waited.<eos> Even you.<eos> Who... exactly are you?
We're just scholars and scientists.<eos> We need someone with experience.<eos> In case things go sideways.<eos> Men go to war in search of something, Mr. Conrad.<eos> If you'd found it, you'd be home by now.
Where you been?<eos> Embedded with MACV-SOG.<eos> Ah, you were in the shit.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.
I could ask you the same thing.<eos> Why does a geological mapping mission need explosives?<eos> You weren't listening in class.<eos> Seismic charges for the geological survey.<eos> Uh-huh. You believe that?
How did British special forces get dragged into this?<eos> - Just "Conrad." I'm decommissioned.<eos> They offered me money.<eos> You don't strike me as a mercenary.<eos> You don't strike me as a war photographer.
I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Glad to hear it. I was worried about you.<eos> You are going to tell me everything I don't know, or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Yesterday, I was a crackpot.<eos> But today...<eos> So this was never about geology.<eos> You dropped those charges to flush something out.<eos> Who are you?
All right?<eos> What lands here tends to stay here.<eos> As far as I can tell, this ship washed up about 10 years before I did.<eos> - WEAVER:<eos> You've been here since '44?
(BOTH GROAN)<eos> (WEAVER GROANING)<eos> (SCREECHES)<eos> (ALL PANTING)<eos> MARLOW: Now, look, Colonel. You may outrank me, but I've been here a hell of a lot longer.
Please!<eos> You need to listen to us!<eos> We're not at war, Colonel. You're making a mistake.<eos> Your lies got my men killed!<eos> - And you're gonna get us all killed!
What name?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.<eos> - And I don't know if he ever did it.<eos> - Well, you've changed, you no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.
- OK, how do you know that?<eos> - Well, it's all here, isn't it?<eos> Look.<eos> Cost-cutting is clearly a priority for you, look at the size of your kitchen, teeny tiny.<eos> Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook.
- My skirt?<eos> Look at the hem of it, that's what I noticed.<eos> Sorry, I'm still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast.<eos> Those markings, you see them?<eos> You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left-hand side, so you weren't driving, you were in the passenger seat.
And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one.<eos> And look at you.<eos> You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain?<eos> Now, all that might mean nothing, except with the angle of the scars on your left forearm, you know, under that sleeve you keep pulling down.<eos> You never saw them.
A lot of different spices, you're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash, yet you're still cooking to impress.<eos> You're keen, then.<eos> The kitchen is the most public room in any house.<eos> And since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don't have any.<eos> You've isolated yourself.
Now, kitchen noticeboards. By instinct, you place them at eye level, where there's natural light.<eos> Now look, the sun's only struck the bottom two thirds, but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window.<eos> But, because the top section is unaffected, we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.<eos> If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded, top to bottom.<eos> It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.
Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.<eos> Your own death is something that happens to everybody else.<eos> Your life is not your own.<eos> Keep your hands off it.<eos> You're not what I expected, you...
Faith?<eos> 'You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> You're not what I expected.
She's more used to dead people.<eos> It's bound to lower your standards.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, I don't know anything any more.<eos> - Mrs Hudson, as ever, you are amazing.
Sorry?<eos> Um, with Mr Holmes, Sherlock, in all his cases?<eos> Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.<eos> Dr Watson.<eos> I love his blog, don't you?
- Great, thanks.<eos> - It's my blog.<eos> It is, he writes the blog.<eos> - It's yours?<eos> You write Sherlock's blog?
Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.<eos> Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.<eos> They tend to be social outcasts, educationally subnormal.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're just talking about the ones you know.
There are two possible explanations for what's going on here.<eos> Either I'm a serial killer, or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs!<eos> Delusional paranoia about a public personality.<eos> That's not so special, it's not even new.<eos> I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time, because you're too high to know what's real any more.
Oh, but I do.<eos> I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.
Sherlock?<eos> So, who came to my flat?<eos> Well, it wasn't me.<eos> No!<eos> You look different.
Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean, he knows you're an idiot, but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.<eos> But he has no idea what an idiot you are!
I watched you.<eos> It was quite lovely, in its way.<eos> Take it easy, it's OK.<eos> Don't want to rush this.<eos> You're Sherlock Holmes.
Why?<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> I'd like to hear you say it.<eos> Say it for me, please.<eos> I want you to kill me.
To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> I wanted to hear your confession, needed to know I was right.<eos> But why do you need to die?<eos> The mortuary, your favourite room.<eos> You talk to the dead.
Which other one?<eos> You know, the secret one.<eos> Oh, that was just something I said.<eos> I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that?
When?<eos> We spent a night together.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> We had chips.<eos> "You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."
'Isn't that how they got started?<eos> - 'Who?<eos> - Adam and Eve. - Oh, them.<eos> - And that turned out OK.<eos> 'You think so?
Conclusion two, my sister, Eurus, apparently, has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother.<eos> Hey, Bro!<eos> Why would you do this, this pantomime?<eos> Why? !<eos> Conclusion three, you are terrified of her.
What?<eos> Sometimes when we're out in these waters, we get that message.<eos> Just forget about it.<eos> - Yeah, but we've never...<eos> - Who the hell are you?
- Kills you in the end.<eos> - Aye, still beautiful, though.<eos> 'Door closing.'<eos> 'Why am I here?<eos> 'Why do you think you're here?
'We have evolved to attach an emotional significance 'to what is nothing more than a survival strategy of the pack animal.<eos> 'We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.<eos> 'Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong, 'bottoms aren't really pretty.<eos> You are a prisoner of your own meat.<eos> 'Why aren't you?
Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.<eos> And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.<eos> Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking?<eos> I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.<eos> - You spoke to her.
Of course I'm bloody sure!<eos> Nearly there.<eos> Right, do you want to pray or anything?<eos> With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?<eos> You are a good man and you are doing a good thing.
Nearly there.<eos> Right, do you want to pray or anything?<eos> With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to?<eos> You are a good man and you are doing a good thing.<eos> So are you.
But today, I reclaim this space... to tell you a beautiful story.<eos> Now the rotten CEOs are gone.<eos> It's Mirando's new era with me, and with new core values, environment and life.<eos> Awesome.<eos> You're much more fun than the last chief executive.
They fucked, not me.<eos> They fucked up.<eos> I know what they're calling me, those A.L.F. fuckers.<eos> They're calling me a psychopath.<eos> You're not a psychopath.
Why you want to kill Okja?<eos> Well, we can only sell the dead ones.<eos> I wanna go home with Okja.<eos> No, it's my property.<eos> - You're a fucking psychopath.
I know.<eos> Go figure!<eos> We all love the face and the anus, as American as apple pie!<eos> Hot dogs. It's all edible. All edible, except the squeal.<eos> - So you're the other Mirando.
- Why?<eos> You already have a shitload of money.<eos> - Please.<eos> - This is business.<eos> Hey, Nancy! I hold all creatures dear to my heart, but you are crying out to be an exception.
Your-your scholarship, that pretty girl.<eos> You are a smart kid.<eos> Talk to me and i-- i can help you.<eos> Otherwise it'll be out of my hands, and you'll be wishing that you had.<eos> You might find yourself wishing I hadn't.
A mass murder at a school.<eos> With dead bodies and brains and students and sneakers with blood on them.<eos> And you go home, and your kids say,<eos> "tell us about your day, mommy."<eos> You could be honest.

And you go home, and your kids say,<eos> "tell us about your day, mommy."<eos> You could be honest.<eos> You could tell the truth.<eos> You could describe every awful nightmare thing you saw, and what was burned into your head would be burned into their heads forever.
"tell us about your day, mommy."<eos> You could be honest.<eos> You could tell the truth.<eos> You could describe every awful nightmare thing you saw, and what was burned into your head would be burned into their heads forever.<eos> Or... You could hug them tight.
Hi, Mrs. Watkins.<eos> Hi,Elliot.<eos> I've been having some really strange thoughts about that bye bye man since we talked.<eos> Mrs. Watkins.<eos> Mrs. Watkins, you can't talk to anyone about it.
I said leave.<eos> Are you deaf or just defective?<eos> Mrs. redmon, did your husband write for the register a long time ago?<eos> You're too young to remember that.<eos> Mrs. redmon, you're still alive.
Mrs. redmon, you're still alive.<eos> I know your husband killed a lot of people.<eos> But I don't think he was crazy.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Whatever you remember.
With the hound.<eos> What Larry told me gave me nightmares.<eos> I made him stop.<eos> I understand.<eos> But I need you to tell me everything Larry said.
Butintheend , Larry was a hero.<eos> You tell people that. Larry erased him.<eos> You see, he did away with everyone who'd heard it before they could pass it on.<eos> But not you.<eos> You're here.
Come on, little you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> By golly.<eos> Oh, yes, hello?<eos> Yeah, you don't know me.
He's our maintenance man.<eos> But I saw him out back a little while ago.<eos> Harvey?<eos> Harvey, you son of a bitch!<eos> Are you Hank?
Dougie Jones.<eos> Limo for Mr. Jones.<eos> Smithie, bring a limo around front, please.<eos> But you have to promise me something.<eos> You'll come back and try your luck with us again... soon, anytime... day or night.
Sure did, pal.<eos> Hello!<eos> Mega, mega jackpot.<eos> Congratulations, sir.<eos> You are a mega winner.
Yeah.<eos> When do you get those tests back?<eos> Sheriff Truman?<eos> Your wife is here.<eos> She went to your office, and you weren't there.
Mr. Jones?<eos> Detectives Fusco.<eos> Badge.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Who are you, ma'am?
Yeah, I'll tell you a reason.<eos> There's more to life than cars.<eos> Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I.<eos> Officers, have you found the car?<eos> Who are you, sir?
Mr. Hastings, I'm also recording our conversation. Okay.<eos> Would you state your name and age for the record?<eos> William Hastings.<eos> I'm 43.<eos> Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?
Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> Yes.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.<eos> Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?
24/7, 365, at a million percent.<eos> And if you think that there's something behind that, then you're crazy.<eos> Good night, Alfred.<eos> Sir, it's morning.<eos> Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.
Current location,<eos> Superman's Fortress of Solitude inside the Atomic Cauldron.<eos> However, only a person that isn't shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll can enter the cauldron.<eos> Ugh, I'm way too buff.<eos> You also have beautiful abs, sir.
What are you two doing here?<eos> I told you to stay in the cockpit.<eos> You disobeyed me.<eos> You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.
You're on a timeout.<eos> Batman, you're on a timeout.<eos> What?<eos> Alfred, you better un-timeout me right now!<eos> No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.
that's not possible.<eos> I'm Danny Rand.<eos> The son of Wendell Rand.<eos> been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?
Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Harold?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?
We can have a cup of tea. We can talk about this.<eos> Stage Deli's been closed for years.<eos> okay?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> You are absolutely insane if you think I'm gonna sit down and have a cup of tea with you.
How's that?<eos> Keep practicing your kata.<eos> At least an hour a day.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you Colleen Wing?
And I sat next to my mom.<eos> Joy was on the other side.<eos> We had popcorn.<eos> John Anderson.<eos> That's your name. You are not Danny Rand.
We had popcorn.<eos> John Anderson.<eos> That's your name. You are not Danny Rand.<eos> I am Danny Rand.<eos> I don't care what you think!
But now... I don't apologize for anything.<eos> Kyle, get the car ready tonight.<eos> - The car?<eos> - Yeah, the thing with the four wheels.<eos> Yes, sir, it's just... you never leave the penthouse.
I'm treating the patient your family admitted.<eos> Yes, how can I help you?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you an odd question.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Uh, years ago, when you were about ten years old, you did a commercial for Rand?
You dishonor yourself when you fight for money.<eos> There's more at stake here than just your bills.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?
He's the one.<eos> Eh?<eos> This one bested all of you?<eos> I am Yang Hai-Qing... head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> And you are?
Thank you so much for your help, Sandi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Inside, you'll find all the reports from federal, state, and local agencies.<eos> Our chemical plant on Staten Island has passed every onsite inspection.<eos> I have 15 documented cancer diagnoses that say you're wrong.
I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.<eos> You have the power to change things at this company.
I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> I... - You're different than the others.
I've never had takeout like this before.<eos> - Oh, the thing is, it's...<eos> - A great idea.<eos> It's a really, really good idea.<eos> You're different than the others.
Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.
I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I just want to know what happened between you and my father.<eos> Is that what's driven you to this state?<eos> He tried to shut this place down, didn't he?<eos> So you stopped him.
You deny it?<eos> Would you believe me if I did?<eos> Stay right there, boy.<eos> Submit to me without further incident, and your friends will be granted a merciful death.<eos> I'll die before I let you touch them.
I know how the whole 72-hour-hold business works.<eos> Is that why you think you're here?<eos> I'm here because my dad had drugs planted in my car.<eos> Your dad?<eos> Listen... this is way too complicated for you to understand.
Listen... this is way too complicated for you to understand.<eos> Try me.<eos> You see, that's the trap.<eos> And he knows it.<eos> If I start talking about him, then you'll say...
Exactly.<eos> So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.<eos> That's how he works.<eos> Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.
I will take you to him.<eos> End of story.<eos> But you see, Ward, that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis?<eos> You're an addict and you have psychological disorders,
You see, she leads through fear.<eos> I find partnership to be a much more effective method.<eos> Oh... what are you proposing?<eos> Everything that is Gao's is now mine.<eos> You proceed as you have but with a different goal.
You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.<eos> and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.<eos> our criminal justice system sucks.<eos> did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> who are you?
Colleen Wing.<eos> wonderful. Another fugitive from the law.<eos> The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.<eos> They will not hesitate to shoot. obstructing justice and abetting a fugitive.<eos> So you have some problems of your own to focus on.
One sugar or two, dear?<eos> Two, please.<eos> Did they give any hints of where they were going?<eos> Henry: No, but they'd paid their rent in full and left.<eos> Last time you said you didn't speak to them. They just left in a rush.
"when all is silent."<eos> It's just a tranq...<eos> He came back and then they took all their belongings and left.<eos> When?<eos> The day after you came.
Well, fuck me.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> That you are who you say you are?<eos> Allen Isaac.<eos> You and your staff Sergeant Shane Matthews made an overnight worm into a kill zone to investigate a potential sniper and report back to us.
- Do I know you?<eos> - Franklin Nelson.<eos> I ran point on your case.<eos> We spoke on the phone... a lot.<eos> You spoke a lot.
Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.
You'll need to make yourself available for follow-up questions,<eos> - so in the meantime... - Don't leave town. Yeah, I know the drill.<eos> Ms. Jones, can...<eos> Look, there's no easy way to say this.<eos> I read your file. I know who you are.
I've got to try this another way.<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Danny Rand.<eos> Welcome back, Mr. Rand.<eos> Mr. Meachum mentioned you had business to take care of abroad.
No, he's... not.<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> And who were the clients?<eos> That's privileged information.<eos> I'm sure you understand.
God himself sent you.<eos> You don't have to hide anything from me.<eos> I know where Cole is.<eos> He's following in his brother's footsteps.<eos> You know what kind of trouble they were into? No.
Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.<eos> - And who are you?
- K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.
I might even let them go free.<eos> You walk with her... and I'll take you out myself.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Mr. Rand... you need to think this through.<eos> And you need to leave.
Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.<eos> This time, for good.<eos> This war... it isn't over.<eos> Well, the thing about war is... it only works if both sides believe they're the good guys.<eos> You fight to defeat us.
They move fast and cover their tracks and often with the blood of innocent people.<eos> - People are in danger.<eos> - Captain, my clients are exhausted and under emotional distress.<eos> I'm sure you understand they need to go home.<eos> And, see, I'm not sure you understand the severity of the situation.
In the suit, no less.<eos> If you'd have been there, you would have seen...<eos> He made the right call.<eos> I can't help but feel like I didn't.<eos> Look, I didn't know him as well as you did... but there was no talking him down.
No, I mean, I know, I'm the one that set it up but I just...<eos> Yeah, Mr. Jones, i completely understand.<eos> I get how important it is and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, this is... Right, and no I do love working there at the office and you can definitely count on me I just... Right.
- Oh, well I was actually hunting deer.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Oh no, ma'am, I have a license to hunt all year 'round.<eos> I could show you if you like.<eos> Well, you were right here, this is where I found ya.
Rachel, my torment.<eos> For god's sake, come quickly."<eos> Hello?<eos> Good boy.<eos> You must be Philip.
The next stop is Broad Street.<eos> This is Broad Street.<eos> This is the last stop on the southbound C train.<eos> The blade is in your aorta.<eos> You pull it out, you will bleed, and you will die.
Um, take it for yourself, give it to the staff. Not the alcohol!<eos> Um, throw the rest away.<eos> Maybe I could give it to the church instead?<eos> Give it to the church, that sounds good, I don't know what i was thinking.<eos> You're mourning.
- It can be.<eos> If left untreated it'll travel the horse's innards.<eos> You're doing the right thing here.<eos> What's going on out there is not fancy math.<eos> All online, you look it up, make up your own mind.
So you're gonna take these horses away so they can spend the rest of their lives stacked on top of each other? Because of bullshit allegations whispered into a politician's ear.<eos> I have orders.<eos> These men may spend the night in jail. There may be guards all over the place.<eos> But when they're with these horses, they are free.<eos> And you're gonna take that away from them.
I was just taking him home.<eos> Yeah, to put firecrackers up his ass?<eos> - I wouldn't do that.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You're something else.
- Uh, Chet, are you a vegetarian by any chance?<eos> Oh, so you're a hypocrite.<eos> Yeah. See, I find that most people that are whining about dog fights are actually the same people going to football games and UFC fights, watching human beings beat the ever-loving shit out of each other while eating, uh, fried chicken.<eos> So, wait.<eos> Are you saying you're an animal rights activist?
I can.<eos> Mr. Sanderson!<eos> Mr. Sanderson!<eos> Matthew Mara.<eos> Did you just do a flip off that truck?
How you doing?<eos> These things are beautiful, and they are mysterious, but they're a pain in the ass.<eos> You look spectacular.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So do you.
Christian?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Oh, excuse me, miss Steele, i didn't mean to startle you.<eos> No, no.<eos> You are very quiet.
May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, I'm Ana.<eos> But you knew that already because you said my last name.
Can I have a couple of minutes?<eos> - Can't you see she's on shift?<eos> - For God's sake, Ed!<eos> DI Hardy, DS Miller, Wessex Police.<eos> Who are you?
- So it's not just him.<eos> Tom and another boy have been caught supplying links and files to a number of other students.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I don't know what you consider acceptable...
I hope not.<eos> But if any first-time offenders got expelled, well I guess fair is fair.<eos> Are you gonna take this serously?<eos> Sure.<eos> You don't bluff me. I don't bluff you.
Today's bad ending, you can't hit people.<eos> But a 12 year old bullies a 7 year old and she stands up?<eos> Do you know how important that is to me that she did that?<eos> You know how proud I am of her?<eos> Aren't you?
No? Well, that's a shame.<eos> - Mr. Cullen, you're here for the uncle.<eos> - Yes, I am, your honor.<eos> Start charging you room and board.<eos> Mr. Highsmith, you're on the wrong side of a bay, aren't you?
Stowe Mountain.<eos> He took her skiing.<eos> You see, kidnappers don't usually take their victims skiing.<eos> But this is what Paul did... because he and Diane were in love.<eos> No. And when they returned, you pressed kidnapping charges.
She was extrodinary.<eos> And extrodinary people come with singular issues and needs.<eos> You have no idea of capability she possesed.<eos> One in a billion.<eos> And you would say: " Fine, let's throw that away, so the boy who cuts our yard can make sexy concrest.
No.<eos> Indicated she wanted her daughter rooted and moved here?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> So you decided to bring Mary here, didn't you?
Sustained.<eos> Mary has been identified as a math prodigy.<eos> But her formal math education under your care... She's learning at the first grade level, isn't she?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you turned out the scolarship at the Oaks... a school specialized for the education of gifted children?
She used mine.<eos> Mr. Adler, does Diane's daughter have her own bedroom?<eos> No. Does she sleep in a bed that you bought...<eos> - in a secondhand shop?<eos> - Yes. So, the truth is, Mr. Adler, that you didn't come down here, because your sister wanted it to, and you certantly didn't come here because it was good for Mary.
- in a secondhand shop?<eos> - Yes. So, the truth is, Mr. Adler, that you didn't come down here, because your sister wanted it to, and you certantly didn't come here because it was good for Mary.<eos> No, it was personal.<eos> Diane was a star.<eos> You weren't. Diane got the attention. You didn't.
No.<eos> Your men, they are weak, complacent.<eos> You've let them forget for an attack can happen at any time.<eos> ...from any cover!<eos> So let's you I remind them Shall we?
Come on.<eos> -Steve, why are we hiding? -Shh!<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Captain Trevor.<eos> I believe you have something that is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.
Sir, I can take...<eos> Now more than ever the armistice is off paramount importance.<eos> It must be negotiated it must be signed..<eos> It is the best way of stopping the war.<eos> Captain, you will do nothing.
No..!<eos> Gentlemen, sit.<eos> Ms. Prince, sit..<eos> I assume you are here planning something that's going to get you either court martial or killed.<eos> And I assume, you are here to stop us.
- ...<eos> Only for you to loose my invitation?<eos> - No, I am a bug.<eos> Not even a bug, I'm a dung of a bug.<eos> And you're right master...
I don't drink.<eos> Have we met?<eos> No, but I have been watching you.<eos> Following your career.<eos> You are Dr. Isabel Maru.
Following your career.<eos> You are Dr. Isabel Maru.<eos> The most talented chemist in the German army.<eos> I am a friend.<eos> I hope I'm not causing... I know you and General Ludendorff are very close.
I hope I'm not causing... I know you and General Ludendorff are very close.<eos> We work well together.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tell me some one like me behind you... I could provide a lot more.<eos> And who are you?
They understood that war was a god. A god who requires human sacrifices.<eos> And in exchange war gives man purpose meaning, a chance to rise above his petty, mortal little self and be courageous Noble!<eos> Only one of the many gods believed in that.<eos> And he was wrong.<eos> You know nothing of the gods.
- He's a doctor here?<eos> - No, he used to be, 15 years ago, that was before the pills and the mills.<eos> - He said he knows me, he knows my mother.<eos> He said he knows me.<eos> - Miss Mason, you seem a little fuzzy still.
- Yeah, well, he also wants to do a prostate exam on me every Wednesday.<eos> - He knew our names, he knew mother's name.<eos> The apple queen, he was there, he saw all of us...<eos> - let's take a walk, and you can tell me all about the apple queen, okay?<eos> - Well, you need to let my husband in right away.
- let's take a walk, and you can tell me all about the apple queen, okay?<eos> - Well, you need to let my husband in right away.<eos> - We'll do that...<eos> - Just tell him.<eos> - But right now, you're going to get some rest.
- Yes.<eos> - Alright, good, do me a favor, read that thoroughly and fill it out.<eos> Go wait by the truck, I'll be over in a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, hi, are you with him?
Allow me to say that most have been very fruitful.<eos> Agreements are being reached.<eos> Which is why we're here today.<eos> To reach an agreement.<eos> Mr. Melnyk, you are the only family member who has chosen to sue the company by himself, without a lawyer and without signing up with any of the victims' associations.
Sometimes I try to think of things to distract me, you know, just try and think about something else, then I immediately forget and I don't do them.<eos> I just sit at home, not knowing what to do.<eos> It won't be easy, but sooner or later<eos> you will find something that'll help you get out of bed.<eos> - You think so?
Parents are not supposed to bury their own children,<eos> Excuse me, Mayor,<eos> There was a professor wants to see you,<eos> He claimed to have worked with you,<eos> Professor, you have terrific, We do not even know you are still alive,
The victim's father's been a good friend to the mayor.<eos> But fortunately for you, I'm a man in ample possession of the power to broker absolution.<eos> The only question is, will you do what's necessary to earn my largesse?<eos> Mr. Gunns, I wanna apologize for what happened.<eos> You've given me encouragement and wisdom and a helping hand, and I just want you to know that what they're saying about me is not true.
I got another hand feeding me, it's my music.<eos> Music?<eos> Why not become an astronaut while you're at it?<eos> - Or play second base for the Yankees.<eos> - I don't expect you to understand.
I can't control what you do. Only what I do.<eos> And I stay loyal to my people.<eos> Unlike you, Mr. Gunns.<eos> You know, I learned a lot from you.<eos> Just like you learned from Mr. Moses.
And I'm talking admission, plus bar, you know...<eos> You out of your mind.<eos> This is a disco.<eos> Grown folks' party.<eos> And you could be our host.
Genius, Roy.<eos> Feel like a burger?<eos> Let me ask you straight up, and don't take this the wrong way, but why Yale?<eos> I mean, if you got the grades, why not go to one of those Ivy League black schools down South?<eos> Here you are, sir.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.<eos> Uh, Mr. gallo.<eos> I'm Martin.<eos> You're Mr. gallo.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where to now?<eos> There you go, juicy.
Okay, but I was thinking-- all right.<eos> End of story. End of story.<eos> So why'd you and ginnie break up?<eos> You know that prizewinning douchebag Trevor back at the club, he was saying that ginnie is out of my league.<eos> She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
Mrs. Fitz!<eos> - No, II'm not Mrs. Fitz.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Davis David of Davis David Hot Air Balloon Rides.<eos> - Are you Mrs. Fitz?
- I see.<eos> I see.<eos> Sounds a lot like the old direction.<eos> No.<eos> But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.
New energy.<eos> New commitment.<eos> Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.<eos> Sir, my team and I are about to embark on a... a tour of the country so that we may make an assessment... to precisely understand what is required of us here.<eos> It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.
Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.<eos> Here's the thing about press releases. Nobody reads 'em, okay?<eos> They're boring. And they're bullshit.<eos> And everyone knows they're bullshit.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, you hired me to make some noise.
Once.<eos> I've spoken to the president once. By video teleconference.<eos> You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?<eos> That's right.<eos> You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?
Better keep looking.<eos> You serious?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Excuse me. I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.
Cory, where's Badi?<eos> I don't know, boss.<eos> He was here a minute ago.<eos> I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.<eos> General, I thought it best if you and I took this opportunity to talk, so... so I switched places with your colleague over there, I...
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency, ten minus two... equals 20.<eos> Yes, ma'am?<eos> General, the US invaded Afghanistan because of the al-Qaeda attacks on September 11th.<eos> - This is correct, yes?<eos> You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes...
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes...<eos> Oh, where's the...<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes, and yet in all of that time you have only mentioned al-Qaeda once.
Real progress.<eos> But challenges do remain.<eos> Yes, I understand all of that, General.<eos> And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.<eos> I have been listening to you here this morning, and... I believe you are a good man.
Yes, I understand.<eos> And I also have a job to do.<eos> And I am trying to do mine.<eos> As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.<eos> You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.
You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.<eos> And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.<eos> - This is the great moment of your life.<eos> - Well...<eos> It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.
No one has ever asked me to approve a mission before.<eos> Well, that needs to change.<eos> This mission needs your consent.<eos> If we're to win the trust of Helmand province, it demands that this mission be seen to be of your design.<eos> I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.
What did Fat Tony say to Bart?<eos> His capo, Johnny Tightlips, refused to talk.<eos> Anyone here own a black Lincoln Continental, license plate, "Zero to Say"?<eos> It's being towed.<eos> Sir, you're the only one here.
- Is she okay? - I don't know.<eos> They're gonna find out.<eos> Just give her a second.<eos> - Did you see what happened? - No.<eos> - You're their teacher.
£500?<eos> Wow. These are the finest cameras ever made.<eos> People buy them because they love them.<eos> Well, as they say, I'd be rich if I didn't have kids.<eos> You got kids?
Has she given any reason for withholding it?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> Forgive me, but what do you know?<eos> What is it?<eos> Have you actually seen it?
Now I've raised your concern in terms of if, or when you might be able to receive Mr. Finn's diary.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> She should have handed the diary over to you.<eos> She hasn't.<eos> You've asked for it, but she's refusing to give it up.
Headmaster: ...His brother, sister...<eos> What? Young Colin:<eos> Shit.<eos> Mr. hunt:<eos> You're unusually quiet this afternoon.
But what it really means is they're fat cut.<eos> They've not actually been cut by hand at all.<eos> Uh, look, don't take this the wrong way, but...<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> I think, for whatever reason, one of the people I look after is a little uncomfortable with you being here.
- Isn't that right, Bill?<eos> - Uh-huh. I cannot excuse your son from the morning devotion.<eos> It is required by the board, and it is the law.<eos> The law?<eos> Have you heard about the Constitution, by any chance?
Because where you're going, there's gonna be a lake of fire.<eos> There's gonna be a weeping' and a wailin' and a gnashing of teeth.<eos> You gotta be kiddin' me!<eos> What the hell do you care where I go, what I believe?<eos> I don't care what you believe in.
And I hope I can right some of the wrongs I caused.<eos> I see my mother as a sinner now.<eos> She demanded things of God, and when he refused her requests, well... she began to battle with him openly.<eos> Now all she cares about is... getting wealthy by hating God.<eos> Do you love your mother?
It was a little easier than it looked.<eos> Now you're just being modest.<eos> That preacher's more full of shit than a Christmas turkey, that's for sure.<eos> Oh, hell, he's more full of shit than a goddamn humpback whale!<eos> So... you're here about the, uh, office management position?
She would've appreciated that.<eos> Also charged with the murder of a third kidnapper.<eos> Please, no prayers.<eos> She wouldn't have wanted that.<eos> Does it worry you that, uh, when you die, that there's not going to be nirvana or whatever you care to call it?
We have a state-mandated teen-mothers program at our school, but the board thinks an unwed storybook mom is too scandalous?<eos> Lady Larken and I aren't both perfectly pretty, and I don't have her perfect soprano voice.<eos> But the truth is... the Lady and I have a lot more in common than you'd ever guess.<eos> So, Mr. Healy... this hot flow is for you.<eos> ♪ Mr. Healy You're a crap sandwich ♪

Go away.<eos> I'll fix your pothole.<eos> Come in.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well... you're a really big star on YouTube.
Keep those corpse In cattle, It will replic for new generation I was In doubt to see your acting what did you tell your name.<eos> She's saying something..<eos> He's just moron boy.<eos> Call the bahadur.<eos> You give him the spike..
Can't we just buy a lightning rod?<eos> Sure, if you've got $2500.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This is faculty only.<eos> Then why are you the one leaving?
We always served this when we had friends to visit.<eos> We didn't come to visit.<eos> We're looking for someone.<eos> A friend of ours.<eos> Maybe you've seen him.
Caleb likes you.<eos> And we like him.<eos> But we need to help our town.<eos> People are disappearing, uh, leaving, I mean leaving.<eos> You could really help us.
Uh, Caleb?<eos> Do you know what year you were born?<eos> 1976.<eos> And when did you die?<eos> Why didn't you leave too?
And then it was gone.<eos> A rift.<eos> I thought there was only one rift.<eos> We saw it disappear.<eos> You remembered Stiles and then a new rift was created.
You don't see anything?<eos> I see a deeply disturbed young woman.<eos> You're afraid to remember him because you're afraid of what it means.<eos> Why do you care so much if I remember him?<eos> Because you loved him.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> Guess who knows all about Mr. Douglas?<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> You remember Stiles, and then a new rift was created.
Thanks to you, Mr. Jones, we were able to put Sybil Griffiths behind bars.<eos> And ever since, Dao has been after me to sign off on a deal that'll get you out in three to five years.<eos> I would be very grateful.<eos> Here's the thing, though.<eos> I have a problem with you being out on the street in three to five years.
Because it appears to be a carefully orchestrated jailbreak.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, he wouldn't have done that.<eos> You guys just made that ridiculous deal.<eos> Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.
But I know who you are.<eos> I realize it's inappropriate, but, I have to know.<eos> Are you enjoying the razor clams?<eos> The only way I could enjoy them more, chef...<eos> Is if you'd join me.
And then I'll turn you over to the police.<eos> Police can't keep you safe.<eos> The people I work for... They'll just send other people like me 'til they've got their money.<eos> Let's get you your money, then.<eos> You know where it is?
Why did they write that?<eos> Tell me or I'm gonna go get help.<eos> It's a boy. It's just a... a sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Who's prone to hysterics.<eos> Who you keep locked up.
Ignore him.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Special "welcome to Istanbul" greeting.<eos> He drops the brush, you pick it up, and suddenly you're getting the most expensive shoeshine in the world.
We'll see.<eos> Lieutenant Veli.<eos> I can't thank you enough for your help.<eos> Actually, Miss Rowe, it's I who should be thanking you.<eos> This is a great opportunity to put aside my military career and help you drag your boxes and your ridiculous truck to the edge of nowhere.
Actually, Miss Rowe, it's I who should be thanking you.<eos> This is a great opportunity to put aside my military career and help you drag your boxes and your ridiculous truck to the edge of nowhere.<eos> Lieutenant Veli.<eos> I am sorry if this trip interferes with your grand plans for yourself, but given that your countrymen are in desperate need of medical help, you might think about their needs instead of your own.<eos> You can't be here.
- in my brother's truck, as I promised.<eos> - You brought the truck?<eos> Unfortunately it was stolen in the mountains by bandits along with all the supplies.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You're here.
- Her name is Lillian Rowe.<eos> She's come from Philadelphia to bring us valuable medical supplies.<eos> I'm afraid there was a problem with the supplies, but I'd like to stay...<eos> Stay?<eos> You can't stay.
Is everything all right?<eos> It's all right, but we need to leave soon.<eos> Of course.<eos> You need to report back to your superiors.<eos> You have your mission, Doctor, and I have mine.
It's a game.<eos> A bloody game.<eos> In which we pit our puny brains and skills against the forces of destruction and disease and lose.<eos> We are drowning in death.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.
Get your men under control!<eos> It's disgusting what you're doing!<eos> Do you come here often with Peter Thomas?<eos> I'm Chief Superintendent Douglas Archer.<eos> And you are... Madam?
I put one in as soon as I heard you on the stairs.<eos> I've had my eggs for the week, Mrs Sheenan.<eos> Not to worry, we've got six from Mrs Custance.<eos> - I don't know how you do it.<eos> - Well, you helped.
All the eggs are yours, really.<eos> I liked that jumper.<eos> I thought...<eos> Men!<eos> You're as bad as my Tom.
Why did he attack you?<eos> You know why.<eos> Some people think police are helping the Germans.<eos> If your Tom hadn't signed up with the army reservists, he'd be in the same position.<eos> Why didn't you sign up, Mr. Archer?
You know who I am.<eos> I can help you.<eos> You?<eos> Ah, you fool.<eos> John Spode, you're under arrest.
How did you get on to me?<eos> The pivot for your false arm.<eos> I found it at the flat at Shepherd's Market.<eos> You must have been in quite a hurry, to leave that behind.<eos> You're the great detective.
Do you deny killing your brother?<eos> How could I?<eos> I wouldn't have hurt your son.<eos> I just needed a way to get you to listen, so you'd help us.<eos> And all everyone told me was that you were incorruptible.
This is the best cigarette I've tasted in an age.<eos> Won't find anything like this in prison, I expect.<eos> It's not my job to chase Resistance fighters.<eos> You lost your arm taking on a Panzer... a friend of mine told me.<eos> Were you in the fighting too?
I will come to you later.<eos> Now, you listen to me, Major.<eos> If you want my co-operation, you're going to have to woo me,<eos> and I'm very difficult to please.<eos> You have the impertinent manner of the revolutionary.
I'll need to know how you would dispose of His Majesty.<eos> Our honour requires that his safety be assured.<eos> We'll fly him out of a disused airfield.<eos> Your staff are advising us on which one to choose, sir.<eos> Will you go too?
Worse.<eos> The escape of the King will be in every history book ever written.<eos> Do you want it recorded that the only way we could get him out of the country was by forging the signature of a foreigner?<eos> The same reason we can't have him do anything ridiculous, like dress up as a chambermaid, or pretend to be a German lavatory attendant.<eos> You operate in a very strange world, Colonel.
Outrage?<eos> Please.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> It sets such a bad example.<eos> Who are you?
I'm not alone in misfortune.<eos> I like that you still wear the ring.<eos> So you've been making enquiries about me?<eos> It's a part of the job.<eos> Though I should have caught your name and realised you were Archer of the Yard.
At least with a pack of cards, you can understand the rankings.<eos> With the Germans I find it quite mystifying.<eos> SS, SD...<eos> Gestapo, Wehrmacht.<eos> You're probably the best-placed Briton in the country to have any understanding of this, Archer.
Don't turn your back, man. This is your doing!<eos> So at last a flicker of emotion.<eos> I thought I would never see it.<eos> Jimmy was just doing his job.<eos> The gallant patriots of the Resistance murder him. And you punch me.
- Hello again, Superintendent.<eos> - Arthur.<eos> I really appreciate this.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You've been good to me in the past.
Well, he did.<eos> The German officer made out he couldn't understand him.<eos> And you know how hopeless Harry is with all this German.<eos> If you'd been here, of course, it would have been different.<eos> You know how to speak with them, Harry always says.
I'm having to go down there myself to organise the patrols to support the attack.<eos> Without them, it could be a damn calamity.<eos> So, with George down there, caught up with all this...<eos> You want me to get the King to Bringle Sands.<eos> Right now, you're our only chance of success.
Now, there's an airstrip near Bringle.<eos> I've set aside some men to secure it.<eos> An American plane will fly His Majesty out to the Ark Royal but only if we can get the King there in time.<eos> Well, Douglas?<eos> You're our best chance by a country mile.
Should I check that with Standartenfuhrer, sir?<eos> I'm afraid, when asked, Dr Huth seemed disinclined to help your Harry.<eos> Shall we take the statement immediately?<eos> And do it in German, or Berlin will ignore it.<eos> You will translate for your comrade, won't you, Archer?
All right, give me five minutes.<eos> Morning, Doc.<eos> Superintendent Archer.<eos> Please don't disturb the crime scene.<eos> Without you jumping down my throat, I propose ruling out suicide.
I'd rather be in the protection of the American Embassy.<eos> The problem is you haven't behaved in accordance with our agreement with your government... specifically in your contacts with so-called Resistance fighters.<eos> I am a neutral journalist, following a story.<eos> My country is not at war with yours.<eos> I do not believe you are simply a journalist, Miss Barga.

Good.<eos> I prefer honesty to pretence.<eos> That doesn't make me a spy.<eos> No.<eos> That makes you a challenge.
He needs looking after and there's nothing for me here, Doug.<eos> You know that.<eos> Let's not stand around here.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't know what is going on between Herr Doktor Huth and Superintendent Archer, but I think you may be able to shed some light on it.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You're awake.<eos> You know, you are the only man here who could appreciate this place.
Arrest me, Archer, for when Kellermann arrives.<eos> I'll wager he has no proof you helped the King escape.<eos> You can be a hero, too.<eos> Do it.<eos> You have a son to live for.
We fight a lot and we say things.<eos> Um, we yell, we scream, and...<eos> We just have a lot of anger<eos> That we need some help controlling.<eos> When you talk of anger and volatility...
Fucking puppets, on the other hand, well, it's vulgar.<eos> Even if it were, you'd still have to prove that it has no legal, artistic, or literary value.<eos> I'm not talking about legals.<eos> We're gonna have to talk about the...<eos> To shut down a show simply because it makes you uncomfortable two weeks before it's about to open, I don't think that that's...
So I take it that Ziggy's father isn't exactly a good guy.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.<eos> Yeah, no, he never will.<eos> Well, as I said, I think you have a caring, sweet little boy on your hands.
Well, I don't agree anymore.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> You stay in your life, I'll stay in mine.<eos> My major concern is as to how he might react.<eos> To the idea that you want to go back to work?
What did he say, his words exactly?<eos> That he was afraid of me, um... going through him.<eos> Yeah, so I'm...<eos> I suppose I'm just worried that he's gonna take it as a rejection.<eos> You were working when he first met you and when he fell in love with you, right?
He's not that crazy about me having too many friends.<eos> He's just possessive.<eos> And I hoped that you'd have some ideas on the best way to communicate with him about me going back to work.<eos> No?<eos> Well, I could certainly suggest some communicative tools, but... for me, the issue isn't how best to talk to your husband, but why you're afraid to.
Like it's like nothing's happening.<eos> I get you don't want to have feelings. Right?<eos> You've got a family.<eos> But you kissed me back at the theater and...<eos> It's possible you're concussed, but I don't think so.
Um, when he left this morning, we made love.<eos> It's as if our, um...<eos> It's as if we turn each other on by rage.<eos> And that's a problem, I think.<eos> Do you think that's a problem?
It's as if our, um...<eos> It's as if we turn each other on by rage.<eos> And that's a problem, I think.<eos> Do you think that's a problem?<eos> Well, I'm encouraged that you at least think of it as lovemaking. Because sex isn't always that.
Hitting him first or hitting him back?<eos> I have to say I'm beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable because this is, um...<eos> I think this is unethical, truth be told.<eos> How... how so?<eos> Because you're treating us.
I have to say I'm beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable because this is, um...<eos> I think this is unethical, truth be told.<eos> How... how so?<eos> Because you're treating us.<eos> And only you showed up, so I'm treating half the couple.
I think this is unethical, truth be told.<eos> How... how so?<eos> Because you're treating us.<eos> And only you showed up, so I'm treating half the couple.<eos> From what I know about your duty of care, you are ethically responsible...
Are you physically afraid of him?<eos> This feels very wrong, I have to say.<eos> I can't...<eos> Um, you're meant to be our doctor.<eos> You're treating us.
Are there any weapons in your house? No.<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, the boys have some lightsabers.<eos> Listen, you see a lot of couples - that have bad problems. - Mm-hmm.
All the leaders believe that partition will reduce the violence, not inflame it.<eos> I've done a wholly inadequate job.<eos> I'm sorry you think so.<eos> In all conscience, I cannot accept my fee.<eos> I believe... that you rather love this country.
- Kumar...<eos> Is this the price that we pay for our freedom?<eos> I have seen many young men lose loved ones in the war.<eos> - And in time...<eos> - You have lost no one, nothing!
Is this the price that we pay for our freedom?<eos> I have seen many young men lose loved ones in the war.<eos> - And in time...<eos> - You have lost no one, nothing!<eos> In time, you will go back to England, untouched.
It should be Churchill.<eos> He's the midwife who delivered you your Pakistan.<eos> I did what any leader would do to realise his people's dreams.<eos> The truth is we've both been used.<eos> But you got what you wanted.
Hello?<eos> - Madeline Whittier?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hi, this is Dr. Melissa Francis from Maui Memorial Hospital.<eos> I was your attending physician while you were here.
Really?<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> I've had it since I was a baby.<eos> I don't know...<eos> If you had that kind of severe immunodeficiency, you probably would have suffered more than myocarditis.
No. Yo, yo, yeah it's to quit smoking.<eos> But Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so ...<eos> Bro I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?<eos> She can't fix my motherfucking life.<eos> You ain't getting in my head.
There's nothing willy-nilly here.<eos> After much discussion, much debate, we all came to the same conclusion.<eos> - Which is?<eos> - Which is, once you explore all scientific possibilities, and you come to a consensus, how can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?<eos> And that discovery... You proved the existence of an afterlife.
- That's correct.<eos> Where do those wavelengths go?<eos> My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.<eos> Yes, that is no longer in dispute.<eos> But you can't tell us what that is exactly.
I would love to see that list.<eos> I'm sure you would.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Are you looking for something?<eos> Maybe you can help me.
Are you threatening to ruin my son's reputation?<eos> Your son's reputation is already ruined.<eos> And his story will no doubt end with a heart attack in prison or a bullet to his head in a winter's field.<eos> No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.<eos> In one version, you convince your son to have us bond his additional bail, and your story goes on as before.
And his story will no doubt end with a heart attack in prison or a bullet to his head in a winter's field.<eos> No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.<eos> In one version, you convince your son to have us bond his additional bail, and your story goes on as before.<eos> You're the Employer Of the Year, loved by her community.<eos> In the other version, you fuck us over, we sue you and your son in civil for what happened the other night.
Nothing, really.<eos> -lt's not nothing.<eos> The thing is....<eos> I can't give him very much myself, and that makes me feel very guilty.<eos> But if you were to help him study, I could never repay you.
-But he really did cheat.<eos> -Who doesn't, sometimes?<eos> The kid is very smart.<eos> I know he'll be successful.<eos> I pray to God that you're right.
What are you saying?<eos> What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.<eos> I see.<eos> So then why are you?<eos> You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time.
I see.<eos> So then why are you?<eos> You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time.<eos> I can only imagine your grief.<eos> You can't imagine the first thing about my life right now.
Hi.<eos> Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um... He will be with you in a moment.<eos> You're Clay's mom.
You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.<eos> Are you referring to Hannah Baker?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you want to talk about Hannah?<eos> Do you?
I think if memory serves, she had some unrealistic goals.<eos> And I tried to help her find some options.<eos> Did you have a sense of how she felt about your interaction?<eos> She didn't say.<eos> But did you have a sense?
I'm giving life one last try.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Dempsey.<eos> Morning.<eos> My name is Dennis Vasquez, representing Andrew and Olivia Baker, and this is a deposition.<eos> I'll be asking you questions, and you must answer them truthfully... unless your attorney clearly instructs you otherwise.
Who knows what happens with them.<eos> This tape...<eos> This tape blows up the world.<eos> Which is what we should do, don't you think?<eos> Did you consider Hannah a friend?
What I meant... what I mean... is that, if I hadn't moved away... if I hadn't let her start dating Justin... if I'd been around to help her through it... she'd still be alive today.<eos> And Justin is Justin Foley?<eos> Yes.<eos> Justin... is Justin Foley.<eos> Are you and Justin still friendly?
What if we could?<eos> What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.<eos> I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.<eos> It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.
It can be very dangerous to accuse someone of a crime like that.<eos> I have his confession.<eos> How do you have his confession?<eos> I asked him for it.<eos> I took Hannah at her word, which is what you should have done.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.
And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.<eos> And they'll know what they did.<eos> You're the last person to get the tapes.
Last I heard.<eos> Well, Dennis, without the tapes in evidence, I'd suggest we move on.<eos> Hello?<eos> Miss Davis, it's important that you speak only to what you actually experienced.<eos> So, you and Hannah were friends?
- Yes, but surely her parents...<eos> - She is a ward of the state.<eos> She has no parents.<eos> - We should be trying other therapies.<eos> - Nurse Tudor, you don't understand what's going on here.
And then secondly, if the conditions are right, sometimes a body that's been left in water undergoes a chemical change called saponification. Which, effectively, seals and preserves the body.<eos> So, how old could it be?<eos> Hard to say, but easily... five, ten, 20 years?<eos> Maybe longer.<eos> Male, do you think?
No, ma'am.<eos> I did my homework on you.<eos> You got a good reputation. People respect you.<eos> I just want to be with people who do things the right way.<eos> You do things the right way.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Alvey, how are you?<eos> You tell me.<eos> According to the MRI, you have a lot of scar tissue... primarily around your neck and rotator cuffs.
What I'm not seeing is any real structural damage, bulging discs or joint arthritis.<eos> Really nothing that would account for the type of pain you're describing or the tingling and weakness in your hands.<eos> Well, I'm not making this shit up.<eos> I mean, what the fuck could it be?<eos> I can't say for sure, but I want you to see a neurologist.
Alvey, you're getting way ahead of yourself.<eos> Tell me it's not.<eos> Tell me it's not.<eos> You can't.<eos> Let's investigate this a little further before you start to panic.
Morty?<eos> What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection.<eos> I don't renounce Rick, and I never have.<eos> I was just trying to protect my sister.<eos> I wanted you to have a normal life.
Or, um...<eos> Or what?<eos> Or it means I have the power.<eos> Sometimes he has it, sometimes I have it. It's like a seesaw.<eos> When do you get the power?
Get it all ready so we can at least remove "Where on God's earth would I go?" from the equation.<eos> You'll have a place, a mindset, another life standing by should you need it.<eos> Which... we both know you will.<eos> I don't think a therapist should be this, um...<eos> I don't think you should be behaving like this.
Keep doctor reports. That could be important in a custody battle.<eos> And men like your husband typically do go for custody.<eos> He has the resources, the money, the contacts.<eos> Most importantly... he has the ego to see this through.<eos> I don't understand why you're being such an alarmist right now...
Really?<eos> You told nobody at all?<eos> Is that because it never really happened?<eos> And you're just making all this up to win custody?<eos> In fact, you've repeatedly maintained what a wonderful husband and father Perry is.
In fact, you've repeatedly maintained what a wonderful husband and father Perry is.<eos> Haven't you, Mrs. Wright?<eos> Nobody's ever witnessed this alleged abuse, ever.<eos> Isn't that true, Mrs. Wright?<eos> We only have your word. You said he was wonderful.
Isn't that true, Mrs. Wright?<eos> We only have your word. You said he was wonderful.<eos> Now you say he's a monster.<eos> Were you lying then or are you lying now?"<eos> You're a lawyer.
We only have your word. You said he was wonderful.<eos> Now you say he's a monster.<eos> Were you lying then or are you lying now?"<eos> You're a lawyer.<eos> You know how important it is to have a witness.
He's going away in the morning, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> We just have to go to the school gala tonight and...<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.
Okay.<eos> We just have to go to the school gala tonight and...<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> It's one thing should he kill you, but God forbid you miss a party.<eos> You know, your husband is ill, Celeste, but so are you.
For our bank.<eos> With you.<eos> Would a seven-year loan be prudent?<eos> I'm not sure seven is realistic.<eos> What do you think is prudently realistic?
Oh, my God.<eos> I know what's going on here.<eos> Me too.<eos> This is about you being afraid of female sexuality.<eos> You're one of those bankers who's never read Our Bodies, Ourselves.
With my keys.<eos> This is going to be a weird double goodbye with Derrick.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, but couldn't we just sit down and talk, you know, face-to-face?<eos> Well, youth is fleeting and you have a weird laugh.
Mr. Loggins,<eos> I am so thrilled that you came here tonight.<eos> I personally am especially moved.<eos> You did call me about 700 times.<eos> And you were very patient, no matter how insistent I became.
Stop!<eos> You're a bad person!<eos> I never saw him again.<eos> So, that was the accident.<eos> Zimmerman. You conned him.
It's mostly missionary, if I'm being honest.<eos> We used to spice it up, but now it's about the shortest distance between two points.<eos> I've...<eos> He'd pop faster from the back, if I'm being honest, but I think it's important to look each other in the eyes when it comes to making babies.<eos> You got kids?
Well, you know what they say about time being money.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mmm. I don't want to talk business in front of them.<eos> Emmit, don't be rude.<eos> I don't mean to gossip, but, um, are you English by any chance?
- Is she mine?<eos> - No, you got the other one.<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> St. Cloud Homicide's gonna handle this case, and you're both gonna go back to...<eos> What'd you do?
What's happening?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> Just a misunderstanding.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> You remind me a little of my husband.
Jeez! We've got the intercom.<eos> What the shit is this?<eos> It's...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Saw 'em when I came in this morning. - Thought maybe you redecorated...
You...<eos> Emmit?<eos> Emmit?<eos> Mrs. Goldfarb.<eos> You must be Sy.
Pre-schools in Mumbai, health clinics in Inner Mongolia, better access to veterinary care.<eos> There's... _<eos> A lot, actually.<eos> Women, more so.<eos> And you'd be okay with that, selling a business that you worked so hard to build?
Your house is an hour's drive from here.<eos> There's three St. Cloud metros near your office. Why come all the way down here?<eos> You gave me your card.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Well, I got a lot of questions, but I guess, maybe, you should just start.
No.<eos> You can go.<eos> Actually, just so I know, how soon after Mr. Feltz did Mr. Stussy arrive?<eos> Five minutes, maybe.<eos> In your statement you said a half an hour.
Well, there's a 60% chance that briefcase is full of your dirty underwear.<eos> And since I don't see your associate, I figure he's out there somewhere watching us.<eos> Maybe even with a rifle.<eos> Go on.<eos> And if I brought the books and the hard drives with me, you're gonna give your man a signal and he's gonna take the shot.
Go on.<eos> And if I brought the books and the hard drives with me, you're gonna give your man a signal and he's gonna take the shot.<eos> And did you? Bring them?<eos> The problem is this is a public place with a lot of witnesses.<eos> And you're a pretty distinctive-looking guy.
Nice.<eos> There, you see,<eos> I'm guessing the Wildcat Regional was an amateur affair.<eos> Semi-professional.<eos> See, you got cocky.
So maybe I share one of the hard drives with the police.<eos> You...<eos> You can't win this game, you do realize that?<eos> I thought you didn't play games.<eos> I'm offering you a fortune, you're asking for a piggy bank, pourquoi?
Some three-time loser who couldn't make it in the modern world.<eos> What must they've paid him?<eos> Must've been a heck of a price.<eos> But it worked.<eos> That confession, combined with the evidence I mentioned, means he goes to prison the rest of his life and you go home.
You included a note.<eos> IRS? I never sent anything to...<eos> Well, it has your name on it.<eos> Look, this is my last day, so...<eos> Are you working a case involving Emmit Stussy or Stussy Lots Ltd?
Yes.<eos> The strategist.<eos> I was wondering when you might call.<eos> Yes, I have it.<eos> All of it, as long as you live up to your end of the...
Emmit, my dear Emmit.<eos> How are you?<eos> You look...<eos> Well, I know this can't be easy for you.<eos> You work for Varga.
But don't worry.<eos> Your personal wealth, the profits you've made as a partner in this venture, have all been carefully hidden. So...<eos> Not all bad.<eos> Mike and Mike will show you out.<eos> And you're saying this proves...
Is that where you live?<eos> Good Lord, no.<eos> I'm a citizen of the air, Madam.<eos> Moving, always moving.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
- I have a phone my grandson says is also a camera.<eos> I wish I was but a thief.<eos> I am not.<eos> I am of Death.<eos> You are dead, Mrs. Fadil.
Choose.<eos> Which has my father?<eos> He beat me, and I would like not to see his world.<eos> Choose.<eos> You are a kind boy. You choose for me?
- We're just concerned, because something like this really ought to be handled by two personnel.<eos> Oh, tell me about yet.<eos> B-Better yet, you tell those stingy bastards down at First River Bank about it.<eos> I mean, these are my men I'm putting on the line. You know, they're good men.<eos> You know, you sound like a bright young man, Officer...
Do you know whatever happened to P.J.'s software?<eos> No.<eos> Don't you think you should?<eos> I'm not that great at parties, either.<eos> So you're, what, a wallflower billionaire?
Hi, can I have water, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> I begin to tune them out and then the conversation falls apart.<eos> Very funny.<eos> So you're not interested in getting to know people face to face, but you want to collect every single bit of information about them behind their backs.
I just want to know, how do people benefit from it?<eos> With enough data and enough analysis, there are no more Silk Roads.<eos> Not on the web, not on our city streets.<eos> I don't think that people understand what they're giving up.<eos> And you don't understand how much they will get in return. Are already getting in return.
I'm sorry to... Sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Yeah, can I help you?<eos> - I think you can.<eos> I'm having some issues with, um...<eos> And, well, I hear you're the best.
Okay?<eos> I don't mean to step on other people.<eos> But if I can't get you to figure out what's wrong with me, I end up in an asylum.<eos> Or prison.<eos> You look for special cases, right?
I don't mean to step on other people.<eos> But if I can't get you to figure out what's wrong with me, I end up in an asylum.<eos> Or prison.<eos> You look for special cases, right?<eos> I read an article where you said that.
Don't you worry.<eos> I won't let them parade you through the front door.<eos> Why are you helping me, Kessler?<eos> It's gotta be more than what I did for your partner?<eos> Did you kill Caldwell?
"Please help me.<eos> Somebody please help me."<eos> That's what you heard, didn't you?<eos> Was it PJ?<eos> Was it PJ after you didn't answer his call?
She has a... um... perforated abdominal viscous, apparently.<eos> You?<eos> My, um...<eos> My congregant.<eos> You're a minister?
I haven't decided to be your doctor yet.<eos> You came all this way just to say maybe? No.<eos> I also visited with...<eos> What's his name, Dr. Williams?<eos> He said that you're seeing things.
The only time you can't control what you write is when you use that special pen.<eos> When did this start?<eos> About a week ago.<eos> Anything happen recently that might have triggered all this?<eos> You're aware I can read, right?
What the...<eos> I tried this a thousand times. It never happened before.<eos> - That's a dirty fucking trick.<eos> - I call it an experiment.<eos> What this experiment shows me is that you're not faking it.
- That's a dirty fucking trick.<eos> - I call it an experiment.<eos> What this experiment shows me is that you're not faking it.<eos> There is something going on inside your head.<eos> Can you fix it?
It's the kind of place I've been dreaming about since I was little.<eos> It's real nice, Miss.<eos> Well, the only problem are the owners.<eos> They want it to go to a family.<eos> You're gonna be a family.
I want to talk about this gift.<eos> Because that's what this is.<eos> This is a chance to go back to the way that things we're, before the baby, before Flock Block, before Pernell Harris.<eos> How are we feeling, Alicia?<eos> Much better. How are you? Good.
- Bullshit.<eos> That was...<eos> It's never been that bad before.<eos> Pernell, do you recognize this?<eos> This is what you wrote.
Do you remember me when I was the judge in your trial?<eos> Your lawyer said you had Lewy Body Dementia, that you were insane, but I didn't believe it.<eos> I think I might have the same thing.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Would you talk to me?
And these drugs, they... They make it go away.<eos> They say hell is the depravation of the presence of God, and they're right.<eos> What do they give you?<eos> Quetiapine.<eos> You're a judge.
Everything he was describing is exactly what I was experiencing.<eos> This guy was a cold-blooded killer.<eos> They gave him the drug. He's sitting around like a pussycat.<eos> If this can fix me, why wait?<eos> So you talked to one guy, and now you have all the answers?
That's very brave of you to say, especially after the year your family has had.<eos> Your daughter-in-law raped, your son, consumed with guilt, shoots himself...<eos> I don't think that any of us can ever truly know what was... what was going on inside PJ's mind right at that moment... especially you.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But can you tell me what you were thinking when you entered a vicious legal battle with your son's wife over the right to keep him on life support?
But despite every doctor telling you that was impossible, you still publicly attacked a rape victim for weeks before ultimately changing your mind?<eos> Answer the question, Dad.<eos> The truth.<eos> I was wrong, and when I realized that, I corrected the situation.<eos> Then is it possible that you were wrong when you accused the late officer Shane Caldwell of raping your daughter-in-law?
You just kept pushing till a few more bucks fell out of my pocket and then another push and another!<eos> You think this guy is a preacher?<eos> He's a fucking vampire.<eos> He'll suck out your soul, and then he'll sell it back to you for 50 grand a pop.<eos> Sir, you can turn your back on God, but He will never turn His back on you. You know why?
My visions revealed things I never could have known, took me places I never could have found on my own.<eos> It may seem that way, but then they wouldn't call it sacred disease if it wasn't special.<eos> This wasn't just kooks.<eos> Sir Isaac Newton was said to be afflicted by it.<eos> I believe that you were capable of seeing patterns and making connections that normal people can't because your brain was filling in the blanks between your subconscious and the conscious.
There was a kid.<eos> He would glance at a page in the encyclopedia, and he would recite it verbatim in seconds.<eos> One day I took him on a walk, and when we got back, he could tell me the license plate of every car we passed, moving or parked.<eos> But, on the other hand, he wasn't able to maintain friendships or function in school or connect with his parents, and that is why it is called a disease and not a gift.<eos> But you can fix it, right?
I'm not going to let you do this.<eos> You stop moving, or I will shoot you!<eos> So help me God!<eos> God will help you.<eos> He will if you just let Him.
I made you do horrible things.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> He promised me my son.<eos> He laughed at me!<eos> You have a son.
You have a son.<eos> Tessie's pregnant.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> It's your boy.<eos> You have a son.
San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.<eos> It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here...<eos> A chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.<eos> But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.<eos> People you could persuade?
A chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.<eos> But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.<eos> People you could persuade?<eos> A lot of them are more loyal to the Harris family money than they are to Pernell.<eos> You know anything about Africanized honeybees?
Rich people think they can do whatever they want.<eos> I am open-minded, but DNA doesn't lie.<eos> Are you or any of your family members in the law enforcement profession?<eos> Do you consider yourself religious?<eos> How would you define reasonable doubt?
Are you or any of your family members in the law enforcement profession?<eos> Do you consider yourself religious?<eos> How would you define reasonable doubt?<eos> You've heard me ask this question a few times today.<eos> Have you met or do you have an opinion of Mr. Harris?
Have you met or do you have an opinion of Mr. Harris?<eos> Yeah, I know him.<eos> He sentenced my son to eight years for weed.<eos> And he didn't even kill a cop like the judge did. What kind of shit is that?<eos> How do you feel about the death penalty?
Come here.<eos> Kessler's wife is arranging his funeral.<eos> All my so-called friends have toasted my freedom.<eos> P.J.'s killers are walking around free.<eos> If we go after Chief Clay, he sends that confession out, you go to jail.
I didn't look.<eos> Thank you, Gilbert.<eos> You're gonna make a great mayor.<eos> - How you doing, Tim? - Just fine, Judge.<eos> How are you?
Raymond.<eos> Raymond.<eos> It's empty.<eos> Anything I can help you with?<eos> Yeah. Um, do you sell cigars?
Katherine Boyd? Yeah.<eos> I'm looking for Marius Josepovitch.<eos> You mean Josepovich?<eos> Good. You do know him.<eos> W-who are you?
Pride isn't power.<eos> And what vast font of battlefield wisdom are you drawing from, admiral?<eos> I advise that we deploy our fleet to secure any base that might become a martian foothold.<eos> Madam.<eos> Do you concur?
Don't try to talk. You won't be able to for a while.<eos> Probably a good thing, too.<eos> That way, we can skip all the formalities.<eos> You know, demanding to speak to your consul, threatening a grave diplomatic incident, et cetera.<eos> You are Farhad Nafisi, a member of the Iranian delegation to the Ninth International Conference on Applied Aerospace Science and Technology.
You don't really know if he got as far as North Korea, do you?<eos> It's the logical conclusion.<eos> I'm not here to draw conclusions. I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.
It's the logical conclusion.<eos> I'm not here to draw conclusions. I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.
Mr. Berenson wasn't in the meeting, but his report called the evidence conclusive.<eos> Really?<eos> He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself.
That's why when George Tenet said "slam dunk,"<eos> we all sat up in our chairs.<eos> The other thing you need to do, if you don't mind me saying...<eos> - Please, it's why you're here.<eos> - Reach out to President Morse and make sure he knows that you're unconvinced.
Attempt to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.<eos> The penalties are the same as if he actually did it.<eos> The boy just wanted to see his father.<eos> We're all going. Do they think we're terrorists, too, huh?<eos> No, but you haven't been online praising suicide bombers.
The evidence is more than credible.<eos> Saul calls it conclusive.<eos> He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself.
Yeah. A blue Jeep registered to this address.<eos> - I think you've made a mistake.<eos> - I think I haven't.<eos> What organization is this?<eos> A private one, and you're trespassing.
I've never voted for you.<eos> I'm okay with that.<eos> Half the country can't stand me.<eos> I'm just curious why you agreed to do this.<eos> Because you're the president-elect, you asked me, and I know it's right.
I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.<eos> Neither Mrs. Diehl nor her vehicle are equipped to transport you safely.<eos> She is perfectly equipped.<eos> Ma'am, I understand your impatience, but it's still possible that you were the target
You sure I can't change your mind?<eos> You're more than welcome to stay the night, drive back in the morning.<eos> No.<eos> I really should get going.<eos> You've given me a lot to think about.
All right, if everyone will just settle down, I will answer a few questions.<eos> Nancy.<eos> Madam President, can you tell us where you've been the last two days?<eos> No, I can't. But I want to thank the dedicated people who looked after my safety and the safety of this great city.<eos> There are some reports suggesting that you yourself were the target of the attack.
Stop the bad advice.<eos> She doesn't realize we're facing an existential threat.<eos> You're going to Abu Dhabi.<eos> The Mossad Operation.<eos> You are Farhad Nafisi, a member of the Iranian delegation.
But there's something you should know.<eos> I'm afraid one of our former officers works at this non-profit and was very involved in the case.<eos> Carrie Mathison.<eos> We have no reason to believe she had any foreknowledge of the bombing, but we're looking into it.<eos> In the meantime, I'm sure you can understand the need to keep your head down.
You're not saying he was heading toward me.<eos> We just don't know.<eos> Thank God he never reached his destination.<eos> But this was a man who hated the US government.<eos> You are the premiere symbol of that government in New York at the moment.
I know he does.<eos> You know what they're calling it--<eos> "Escape From New York."<eos> Because while New Yorkers were dealing with this terrible attack, the president-elect fled to a "secure location." Still undisclosed.<eos> General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.
Well, that's not what I got from my conversation with her.<eos> Really?<eos> What I saw was a bright, sensitive little girl who was... traumatized by a horrific event.<eos> "Traumatized" is a strong word.<eos> And her trauma was deepened when you returned her to the site of the event only one day after it happened.
W-Why the change of heart?<eos> I realized I might've been giving people the wrong impression.<eos> What impression is that?<eos> Well, that somehow, I wasn't proud of him or the sacrifice that he and so many others made in this war.<eos> You were proud of him.
I can't say, but apparently, it's urgent.<eos> Sure.<eos> Saul, Rachel Crofts...<eos> Deputy in Counter-Intelligence.<eos> I know who you are.
I'm too old to worry about optics.<eos> If I did, I'd never look in the mirror.<eos> This isn't a laughing matter.<eos> The Director has been on the receiving end of some very heated phone calls, and not just from Tovah Rivlin.<eos> Look, I know this is a pain in the ass, but the Director is hoping you'll cooperate so he can get Mossad off his back.
Look, I-I know what this is about.<eos> There was all this craziness at my house, and somebody called your agency, one of the neighbors or<eos> - a parent from Franny's school. - Ms. Mathison...<eos> But they don't know me, and they don't know Franny, and they don't know what really happened.<eos> Well, that's why we're here so that you can tell me what happened.
- No! - This session is adjourned.<eos> I'm gonna talk to her. I'll be right back.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sure you have the right seat?<eos> You're Saul.
They won't tell me.<eos> I-I haven't... I haven't been able to see her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I was thinking that with all your contacts in Albany, that m-maybe y-you know someone who oversees the agency or... or... Or the judge.<eos> Just... someone you could call.
My daughter is in... Is in some stranger's house, just lying there, thinking I've abandoned her!<eos> Have you been inking?<eos> No.<eos> I just... I just thought that... That...<eos> That you, of all people, would understand. I me... You lost a child.
Previously on Homeland...<eos> Max told me about Franny.<eos> All I can do is comply with the court order hope to God I can convince the judge I'm a changed woman.<eos> You'll get her back.
I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.<eos> Someone else decides if I get to see my daughter, sure, I'll talk about whatever they want, but...<eos> But you don't think it's fair.<eos> I don't see how you could possibly understand.
Someone else decides if I get to see my daughter, sure, I'll talk about whatever they want, but...<eos> But you don't think it's fair.<eos> I don't see how you could possibly understand.<eos> Look, I don't know all the facts of your life, that's true.<eos> But I know you're ex-CIA. I can enter a Google search.
I-I can't lose another one.<eos> I want you to listen to me a second.<eos> I want you to listen and really try to hear.<eos> What you go through, every parent goes through.<eos> Here is you, and here is your child.
Please, sit down.<eos> The fact is, I asked you here to pick your brain.<eos> About?<eos> - Iran.<eos> And the contingency plans we need if, as you've suggested, they are cheating on the nuclear deal.
So there's no confusion, yes, he was very much involved in this... let's call it a misunderstanding.<eos> In Saul's defense, it's easy to get things wrong in this business.<eos> That doesn't mean you get rewarded for it.<eos> If you don't mind my saying, I'm impressed.<eos> Whatever you think, I'm not an ideologue.
What's he saying?<eos> He's asking why Nafisi lied.<eos> Mossad paid him.<eos> To trick us. Make us believe Iran is running a parallel nuclear program with North Korea, in violation of our deal with them.<eos> They said you needed...
- How's your commute?<eos> Not too bad.<eos> If you stay at the Resident Suites, there's a corporate rate and a pool.<eos> A lot of people take advantage.<eos> If you get lost, you're Level 6, Area 3.
Ms. Mathison?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You might want to confirm your three o'clock. What?<eos> At children's services to see your daughter.<eos> How do you know about that?
Really?<eos> It happens.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I wasn't satisfied with the way our meeting went yesterday.<eos> I felt you weren't, either, and so, those names you requested for cabinet positions...
And I'd ask you to reconsider... advise you to.<eos> So this is your idea of advice?<eos> Does it really matter what we call it?<eos> Not if we're both clear on what's really going on.<eos> You think you know better than me.
He found out you were advising me, and he got to you, just like he got to Majid Jivadi before.<eos> Tell me what he's holding over your head.<eos> Is it your daughter?<eos> You asked me about that situation.<eos> And you said you couldn't get involved.
It's a lie, a dirty, disgusting lie.<eos> A lie that half the country wants to believe.<eos> Truth won't put a dent in that. So you say do nothing.<eos> Change the subject.<eos> And you agree?
Previously on Homeland...<eos> This video of my son is not political speech. It is not someone's protected opinion.<eos> But you are calling the men in the video liars.
Yes, I am.<eos> And I'm calling on the media to do their jobs and check their facts.<eos> I was elected by the people of this country to be their next President.<eos> I will represent them.<eos> You think you know better than me.
Me?<eos> Elizabeth Keane?<eos> Gold Star mom?<eos> You are.<eos> You're a bad dream.
Ma'am, my orders are to put you in this vehicle.<eos> Now get in.<eos> Okay.<eos> You and you in number one.<eos> Mr. Emmons, you're in number two with a decoy.
Carrie.<eos> I swore to myself it would be different here.<eos> I swore to myself I would be different.<eos> And look what happened.<eos> You'll get her back.
Madam President-- That's far enough.<eos> An honor to meet you.<eos> I understand you're here at great personal risk.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> I also understand you've been working for the CIA.
Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.<eos> Madam President-Elect, are you calling this a conspiracy against you?<eos> I am asking the people who made the video to acknowledge it.<eos> But you are calling the men in the video liars?
- That's ridiculous.<eos> - Well, they've collected a quarter-million signatures online.<eos> What about the rumor that your nominee for Secretary of Defense has withdrawn his name?<eos> As far as I know, you are starting that rumor yourself - right now.<eos> - So, you're not aware.
Do you get that?<eos> You can't afford to stay silent...<eos> And I don't mean press conferences.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said, "Show your face."
Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.<eos> Trust me, I have taken some beatings from the mainstream media.<eos> I'm here because a video was released last night which viciously slandered my dead son.<eos> I challenged the people responsible for making it to show their faces, and you did.
As I said, I have seen it.<eos> And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother... Any mother... watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.<eos> But I want to be clear about this.<eos> You say...
And I have to ask, why would you want to make a mother... Any mother... watch the last moments of her son's life?<eos> I know it must be painful for you and I-I'm sorry.<eos> But I want to be clear about this.<eos> You say...<eos> You say it's not true.
But what happens next?<eos> Six eyewitnesses testified Andrew was killed pulling a wounded soldier out of enemy fire.<eos> So, what happens next?<eos> Where is the original footage?<eos> You produced the video.
An underground bunker? - Yes.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> Run out of this studio.<eos> You didn't just produce the lying video. You faked the hate and the lies that accompanied it.
You know what would make them even angrier?<eos> If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.<eos> That is an outrageous lie!<eos> You are not a free voice speaking truth to power.
If they learned how your operation was funded.<eos> - If they learned you were financed by the same establishment you claim to despise.<eos> That is an outrageous lie!<eos> You are not a free voice speaking truth to power.<eos> You're a government shill.
- I have evidence of collusion with serving members of the intelligence community.<eos> It will go to the Attorney General.<eos> You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.
Because in my government, truth will have a value, and you will have no place.<eos> Wow.<eos> Just wow.<eos> I don't even know how to respond.<eos> You've even got my switchboard going crazy.
Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect...<eos> "You will be prosecuted."<eos> You will be shut down.<eos> "Because in my government, you will have no place."
Fuck.<eos> You actually can't really sprain your front arm, so you should be all good to head back out there.<eos> Okay, but I'm a little worried because I'm, like, super itchy, specifically in my navel, and I think I might have sand lice, which I've heard are highly contagious.<eos> There's no such thing as sand lice.<eos> Okay, I really need you to give me an excuse why I can't surf.
Uh, yes. Another time, my friend.<eos> Can you prep her for surgery?<eos> I gotta talk to the mother.<eos> Mrs. Summerville? - Yes.<eos> Are you the doctor?
Okay, well, Grace has suffered a gunshot wound. And the bullet has caused damage in her abdomen.<eos> The bullet.<eos> Another bullet.<eos> You know, honestly, when I got the call, I thought it was some kind of sick joke.<eos> You and your daughter seem to have the same sense of humor.
No. I was just curious.<eos> - Guess.<eos> - What?<eos> Guess.<eos> What do you think he was doing up there?
He looked so calm and at peace.<eos> And all of a sudden, he just kind of faded out like he was on a dimmer.<eos> And, um-- and he was gone.<eos> And it was beautiful.<eos> So, you just happened to be awake and looking right at him at the exact moment that he, uh, dimmed out?
Uh, I think it's based on a percentage of your overall net worth.<eos> - I can tell you what I paid--<eos> - Mark.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I don't know if you are a part of this or a victim of it, but if this is real, if they've actually built this device, they're not sending people to some magical place to be with their loved ones.
Do I know you, mate?<eos> I sure hope not.<eos> _<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> You must be Sharon.
They have a very precise style.<eos> Actually, I painted it myself.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did.<eos> Well, then you are incredibly talented.
It is right over there, ma'am.<eos> Leave your shoes on. No need to take your laptop out.<eos> Is it all right if I go with her?<eos> I'm a cop, so...<eos> Do you have Global Entry? - No.
Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - God bless you!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, you're a good person, taking a stranger's baby.
Yes.<eos> And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.
And if you see him, tell him we said hello and that Finland won the World Cup.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Dr. Bekker is...<eos> Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention of using the device.<eos> Um, she believes that you're curious, but once the time comes, you will get...
I can't leave my mother.<eos> That's $20,000.<eos> It should be more than enough to compensate you for your time and get excellent care for your mother.<eos> Something incredible is gonna happen in the next few days on the seven year anniversary, but only if we go now, right now.<eos> You... you said that we needed to be in Miracle on the 14th.
President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.<eos> And based on our intel, in, well, just under two hours he's gonna start an unsanctioned nuclear war.<eos> And you are the only man alive who can get to him before he does.
Stick that in your ear.<eos> You'll hear him, he'll hear you.<eos> He'll talk you through this whole shit show.<eos> Now, the evac chopper is two minutes out.<eos> You're gonna wanna get yourself dressed.
You're not wearing any shoes.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Why does it matter?<eos> Well, somebody wants... somebody in your family wants to know.<eos> But you said there is no family.
What's in that one?<eos> Never mind about that.<eos> Just pray we don't have to open it.<eos> Sir, in order to arm the device, you need to verbally take us down to DEFCON 1.<eos> You are aware of the situation, yes?
What?<eos> I told your father, but he didn't listen.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look, you have to give me something.
What did she say? She wants you to do it again.<eos> Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.<eos> Excuse me? Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...
Why do you want me to do it again?<eos> Because I do not believe you.<eos> Excuse me? Excuse me, but you're lying.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just saying what we want to hear.
Then pull your knees towards your chest and hold them there.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> We will be monitoring you from inside there.<eos> Once inside the event chamber, you will be able to hear us and we will be able to hear you.
Keep loading.<eos> Fire!<eos> Aft-gun mount, report.<eos> Aft-gun mount, report.<eos> I was wondering if you think that there are any "happy" homosexuals.
Is that understood?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Go to hell.<eos> But that's not what those soldiers said to you, is it?<eos> Because you were their commanding officer, and they knew they'd be punished if they did.
Amira?<eos> I knew you were lying to me.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> He was the one you were texting? God, Amira.<eos> You are sick!
It was accessed 25 days ago at 6:05 a.m. from your I.P. address.<eos> Nilaa, we've known each other a long time.<eos> I don't want this to be you, so help me understand.<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> First Gage tries linking me to some radical mosque, and now you're calling me a terrorist?
John.<eos> It wasn't Nilaa.<eos> She's innocent, and I can prove it.<eos> Then who leaked those names?<eos> So you first noticed Mr. Grimes becoming unstable one year before the mission to eliminate Bin-Khalid?
It's over.<eos> You're in the clear.<eos> Was someone else arrested?<eos> That's classified.<eos> You accused me of doing some terrible things.
I was just following the evidence.<eos> People inside the campaign were already whispering about me before the Gage ad.<eos> Now they will never stop.<eos> My reputation's destroyed. How do I go back to my job now?<eos> How do I just go back to my life knowing what you and John really think of me?
Not a penny.<eos> Mr. Carter, a man is entrusted with a significant amount of money.<eos> That money disappears, doesn't matter how, the man's responsible for his money.<eos> It's gone.<eos> What do you think the consequences should be?
Yeah. Something you could've used a little more of.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Nilaa.<eos> I questioned your loyalty, I'm sorry.<eos> Rebecca told me you were the one who knew I was innocent.
But with everything that's happened, can't you restore my clearance?<eos> Please, I can help.<eos> You can help by archiving those servers.<eos> This is Andy.<eos> Mr. Shalowitz, are you the owner of a blue teal Ford?
That's why we're here.<eos> The truth about what?<eos> About an hour ago, Jadalla Bin-Khalid launched a massive terrorist attack on New York City.<eos> And we know he's planning more.<eos> We also know that you've been in contact with him.
She's just gonna draw a little bit of blood and run a couple of tests.<eos> But unless you come clean, we're going to inject you with a chemical that'll stimulate the nociceptors in your brain.<eos> The first dose'll feel like... your skin is being burned away from your body.<eos> And trust me, it only goes downhill from there.<eos> But... you could put an end to all of this.
Andy... remember, be sure Jadalla believes I'm forcing you to do this.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Carter.<eos> And you must be Mr. Shalowitz.
We got to look at the larger picture here.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't go along with this.<eos> I'll appeal directly to the secretary of defense if I have to.<eos> This has been cleared through the SecDef.<eos> The fighters are in the air, waiting for the coordinates that you're gonna provide.
You know, because the school I visited yesterday is offering up a Mustang.<eos> I just gotta be able to get back and forth, you know, on account of my auntie.<eos> Well, we will absolutely take care of your transportation needs.<eos> I will make sure that you have access to shuttles or volunteer drivers...<eos> whatever you need. Yeah, I don't think you get what I'm saying.
I know your face.<eos> Raoul found your movies...<eos> Cheesy?<eos> No.<eos> You underestimate yourself.
Not under our roof.<eos> But to hunt for truth, you need a sixth sense for it.<eos> Journalistic intuition.<eos> In my 40 years, I never knew anyone with an intuition like my son.<eos> You and Raoul were lovers?
Well, let's just say... you are my son's type.<eos> Señor Pasquale...<eos> Can I ask about his disappearance?<eos> I know he went to Chicago for a story.<eos> Do you know anything about it?
They were here.<eos> Okay.<eos> But they left last night.<eos> You can search the place if you don't believe me.<eos> You're a reporter.
You're a reporter.<eos> You must have watched this.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I don't understand what it means.<eos> Maybe you can explain it to me.
- It's a beautiful day, Mrs. Rasal.<eos> - It is, Mr. Bhoopalam.<eos> Mrs. Rasal.<eos> Hello.<eos> Who are you?
They were here.<eos> Okay.<eos> But they left last night.<eos> You can search the place if you don't believe me.<eos> [Lito] You're a reporter.
Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.<eos> You are just like me.
I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.<eos> Soundproofing.<eos> Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.
Eighteen inches thick.<eos> All the modern amenities of a coffin.<eos> So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.<eos> Care to explain what possessed you?<eos> Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.
How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> I've been here every morning before my shift.<eos> I guessed if you did come, it would be early.<eos> I knew it'd be important for you to visit them.
I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.<eos> But... this today, may be my last chance for a rematch.<eos> May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak? - [scoffs]<eos> - A quick spar.<eos> If you win, you leave as you wish.
Show me what you've learned, Detective.<eos> When was the last time you lost a fight, Ms. Bak?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I remember that move from your fight with King Kong Kim.<eos> He was the best fighter from our dojo and you just cut him down like you were chopping a tree.
You're thinking too much, Detective.<eos> My teacher says the same thing.<eos> After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.<eos> He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.<eos> You agree with him, Ms. Bak?
But this is much more fun.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I think I know why you never remember your fights.<eos> You're not fighting a person.
I think I know why you never remember your fights.<eos> You're not fighting a person.<eos> You're fighting something else.<eos> You used a false identity to fight because of your father.<eos> I think he refused to see you... to understand how special you are.
I needed to know if I could trust you.<eos> I understand.<eos> It's strange to finally meet.<eos> In a way, you and your cluster exist because of me.<eos> You work with Professor Kolovi.
Of course I have one.<eos> Dad?<eos> - Agent Bendix...<eos> - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system.<eos> I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?
Dad?<eos> - Agent Bendix...<eos> - Nomi Marks is wanted by at least three different agencies in the federal system.<eos> I trust that you are familiar with the law firm Winslow, Wise, Allegretti Marks?<eos> I sincerely hope that you're going to show me the warrant.
Performance.<eos> That's a loaded word.<eos> Scary. Lot of pressure.<eos> Not for me.<eos> You can perform?
See what he did?<eos> We handle ourselves and Chuck gives someone Head of Crim.<eos> Or we cooperate with Dake and try our luck starting over with Chuck's replacement.<eos> Yeah, we saw what he did.<eos> And so you haven't seen anything that makes you think this office is acting
You tell me how that is in any way relevant to your investigation.<eos> I am investigating all misconduct, wherever it may be.<eos> And however an investigation may start, once I'm in it, I'm like a Goddamned octopus... Tentacles out in every direction, looking, listening, sucking up every bit of information that I can find.<eos> Look, I reported that meeting the second it was over, and I have the documentation to prove it.<eos> You reported it the next day in the afternoon.
I never said that.<eos> Gavin, you have been hitting on me all night.<eos> Okay, we're done here. Are you sure?<eos> Because we could do it right here.<eos> Lady, you're nuts.
- As I have said, my hands are tied.<eos> That's a load of crap!<eos> I'm so sick and tired of all of this.<eos> The laws on campus suck and they need to change.<eos> - You need to do something!
Don't tell me to watch my tone.<eos> If you don't get this, - you need to step down.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> And don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Maybe you should be a little bit more upset!
My father...<eos> - Come on, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - My father...<eos> You killed my father.
- Come on, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - My father...<eos> You killed my father.<eos> You're the reason he died.
I know the Underwoods.<eos> The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.<eos> You can help them win.<eos> I know you can.<eos> I got on the paper right around the time you left.
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?<eos> If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.<eos> Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.<eos> After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.<eos> She's the one they say you called a... you know.
I know.<eos> It's awful, isn't it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.<eos> But you don't need to say very much.
Try to stay calm, Mr. lawes.<eos> The bad guys missed you.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of vips that went missing last night.<eos> You were one of them.
- Show.. SHO:<eos> Yes?<eos> Can you re-flood the airlock?<eos> {\pos(375,5)}( air hissing )<eos> You tell me when.
There aren't any motorcars parked outside.<eos> We got a dress code here, and she's breaking it.<eos> He doesn't like my knickerbockers.<eos> Pity a nice girl like you should be let to wear them kind of clothes.<eos> And exactly what kind of clothing should a nice girl be wearing, in your opinion, Floyd, seeing as you're clearly a man of sartorial flair?
*GIRLS* Season 06 Episode 10 "Latching"<eos> Hannah: Are you sure this isn't too cold for him?<eos> - It's okay, Grovey, it's okay.<eos> - No, he's just fine.<eos> Okay, and you disinfect the scale between babies, right?
Yeah. Here, sit.<eos> It was, um... it's good of you to show.<eos> Well, I wasn't gonna not show. I was just surprised.<eos> Surprised, what, that I wanted to talk?<eos> Yeah. I just... surprised that you... found the article that I wrote.
Yeah, yeah, I did.<eos> But I am a writer, and as such, I think I'm obligated to use my voice to talk about things that are meaningful to me.<eos> And...<eos> I read something about you that troubled me, that troubled me greatly.<eos> Namely that you were using your power and your influence to involve yourself sexually with college students on your book tour.
This isn't the Civil Rights Movement, Hannah.<eos> It's me.<eos> It's just me getting head in some sterile hotel room in Rhode Island.<eos> So, the larger significance is just lost on you?<eos> You just don't even...
- The power imbalance.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You know what? I haven't been offered a beverage, so I think I'm gonna get myself one.<eos> The part where she looks like a Victoria's Secret model and I didn't lose my virginity until I was 25 and I was on Accutane... that part's not lost on me.<eos> I'm talking about the part where you're a very fucking famous writer and she's working really hard to have just a little bit of what you get every day.
No? - Uh...<eos> - She admires you.<eos> Then you unbuckle your pants.<eos> What's she gonna do next?<eos> You got it wrong.
Your funny lips... but all the same, you made me the face of this epidemic about literary men attacking industrious, innocent, young women.<eos> That's what two-bit journalists do.<eos> And you're not a journalist, Hannah.<eos> You're a fuckin' writer.<eos> I can't believe you have a signed copy of "When She Was Good."
Countdown the future...<eos> Mr. Porter.<eos> Abigail Vos, chief of Alterplex Operations.<eos> Welcome. Thank you.<eos> I believe you're familiar with my partner.
This is a great honor, sir.<eos> You know, I was researching at NASA when you introduced duplicate matter theory.<eos> That was the find of the decade.<eos> You're a rock star down there.<eos> We are very excited you're here, Will.
This energy is then transferred cleanly and safely into our world powering it for millennia to come.<eos> I had the exact same face.<eos> - Parallel universes?<eos> - An echo universe.<eos> And this here is where you come in.
What the fuck!<eos> Did you just roll your eyes at me, sir?<eos> I assure you, I did not.<eos> Well, I may not know the difference between gold and pewter, but I'm not a fucking moron.<eos> You just rolled your eyes at me.
Listen, lady.<eos> Please?<eos> I'm not leaving until you tell me why.<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> It sounds to me like you're doing a lot of blaming.
- Right, that? Huh?<eos> - I like purple.<eos> It's nice.<eos> It'll go with the wallpaper.<eos> The number you are trying to call is not reachable.
You're drunk.<eos> Get out of here, boy.<eos> Just take your hands off me!<eos> I'm Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald!<eos> I'm going to be famous some day, while you... you, sir, are still going to be cracking bottles in this stupid piss hole.
He needs psychiatric help.<eos> Did you forget your brother has been charged with multiple murders?<eos> What, so... so that means, you know, you don't care if something happens to him?<eos> The person I care about the most is Regina Worth, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back safe.<eos> You better not let anything happen to him.
It was really kind of you to send your friend to see how I'd been getting along.<eos> But as you can see, I'm quite all right.<eos> You are, huh?<eos> You know something? Don't think I am unsympathetic to your plight.<eos> I know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?
It appears so, yes.<eos> I have money, but that's all, I'm afraid.<eos> Let me speak to my supervisor.<eos> We can usually work something out.<eos> Did you lose your luggage, too?
You didn't get my message?<eos> When did you send the message?<eos> I texted you this morning.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Not everyone knows you're H.G. Wells.
That is soft, isn't it?<eos> It's like a cloud.<eos> They really have figured some of these things out, haven't they?<eos> Let her go.<eos> You don't need her.
He still wants the key.<eos> How are you, Miss Walker?<eos> I've been better.<eos> You've been through quite an ordeal.<eos> You and that other woman are lucky to be alive.
What was Clara doing in Kentucky?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, no. Sorry.<eos> - I need to talk to him.<eos> - You need to rest.
This was two delusional maniacs, investigation ongoing.<eos> Okay?<eos> You guys know the rest.<eos> You call the National Security Advisor, tell him I'm on my way.<eos> Who are you?
Hold on, hold on.<eos> This is not a secure line.<eos> You're gonna call your client and get my daughter back.<eos> Right now.<eos> Or I hand myself in and you're in a Rikers jumpsuit by tonight.
Over.<eos> Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?
It's how you're built, it's who you are.<eos> It's why you tackled those gunmen on the train in the first place... to protect those 93 other passengers in that car.<eos> I just did what I did.<eos> But when you failed to protect your own sister...<eos> - Who the hell are you to...
Because I've been reading Dr. Brennan's e-mails.<eos> Given the evidence, it was only a matter of time until I was considered the prime suspect. AUBREY: Wait.<eos> You've been reading Dr. Brennan's e-mail? How?<eos> ADDY:<eos> I hope you appreciate I'm being forthright.
I want you to put an APB out on Dr. Faulk.<eos> FAULK: Agent Booth...<eos> Dr. Brennan, it's good to see you again.<eos> I'm glad to see you're unharmed.<eos> Your husband, when... when last we spoke, when he assaulted me, insisted that you were in harm's way.
To talk with one whose IQ is double that is not an opportunity you let pass by.<eos> So you don't think that it's strange that you failed to mention that you knew Dr. Addy? No.<eos> No.<eos> No, what is strange is that Dr. Brennan never equated Zack with the man in her nightmare.<eos> Which could either be denial, or you think Dr. Addy is innocent.
I can do that, Mama.<eos> Oh, of course. Thank you, dear.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Hunnicutt.<eos> Mr. Perkins did ask me to come by at 2:00.<eos> And so you have.
It's Mark Kovac.<eos> This is our guy.<eos> Says here that General Josip Radik was shot at long range during his son's sixth birthday.<eos> Did you kill my father, Agent Booth? There's been a shooting.
- Just see them. I'm happy the little guy's okay.<eos> How do you know it's a guy?<eos> Just got a feeling.<eos> Okay, Dr. Brennan, close your eyes. Now,<eos> I'm gonna touch one of your fingers, and you try to touch the corresponding finger on your other hand with your thumb. Okay?
I told you. I don't know where he is. No, no, no.<eos> Your husband calling your phone-- okay, that was a setup.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through.<eos> I saw the explosion on the news.<eos> You know more than what you're telling us, and you're hiding someone.
It will pass.<eos> You cannot interrupt the signal without warning.<eos> The impulses within will disconnect and become deranged.<eos> Sister, I tasked you with the flowers in the chapel this morning, to celebrate the return of our sisters and our staff from Africa, but now I find the vases empty.<eos> And you... gyrating in front of the television.
You'll have to fight for every bastard thing you've got, cos the only person who's ever really going to love you... .. is you.<eos> And that's why I'm going to show you what to do with these.<eos> Midwife calling.<eos> I've had a breakthrough on the bed-wetting front.<eos> But you took Mickey to the hospital about his eyes.
Sister Mary Cynthia requires encouragement, gentleness, and understanding.<eos> Last autumn, she was violently attacked.<eos> She gave them the necessary evidence, and since that date, she's never spoken a word of it.<eos> But what if she needs to speak of it?<eos> Sister Mary Cynthia takes her strength from our continued prayers, and you can uphold her further by setting an example, Sister.
- Oh, it doesn't matter, Tom.<eos> - It matters to me.<eos> Trudy, baby was only born last night.<eos> Dr Turner's on his way, but we'd all feel better if you had the usual twice-daily visits.<eos> And I think you would, too.
And I think you would, too.<eos> I'm a good mother, Sister.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I do trust you.<eos> Just like you trusted us last night.
My mum kept putting all her chips on men -- marrying them, not marrying them.<eos> Always ended up with a black eye, and the same old mess.<eos> I broke out that bedroom on my own.<eos> And now I'm going to break away from him.<eos> I want you to succeed, Trudy. I really do.
Got yourself a puncture?<eos> Sister, I know your door isn't locked... .. but I will not force my way in.<eos> And I've taken your name off the roster, so that you can rest.<eos> You can't do that!<eos> You aren't in charge!
I know what you're gonna say, that you don't want to work with me, but I just want you to know that I got my life...<eos> Whoa, whoa, slow down.<eos> You've got the wrong idea.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> But you fired me.
All right.<eos> Bay:<eos> I'm... so sorry, Noelle's booked then. Um...<eos> You know, we have another artist who just started working here, if y...<eos> You want Noelle.
I'm sorry. Um, we should've told you earlier. I just think Luca wanted to get your unbiased opinion of the place.<eos> Right.<eos> And even if I was single, I don't think it would be appropriate to mix business with pleasure.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, you're thinking of investing in my business, aren't you?
It's a common mistake.<eos> Now come on, we've got a ton of patients to see.<eos> But Dr. J, if something's affecting your abilities...<eos> Then what?<eos> Then... y... you need to...
She has a lot of sway in the science department.<eos> And why do I need it?<eos> Sooner or later, you're gonna hang up your stethoscope, but it doesn't have to mean that you're done with medicine.<eos> They're just handing out teaching positions now, is that it?<eos> I happen to know the administration is serious about diversifying the faculty, and we have adjunct professors all the time that don't have half as much experience as you do.
Agent Booth is 94% amused and six percent skeptical.<eos> And you, Kate, are 100% nervous.<eos> Oh, well, of course I am. I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI. Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.<eos> Why would I want to kill him? You tell me.<eos> You're the one who attacked him with the baseball bat.<eos> After that, you lost your job, your house, your wife filed for divorce.<eos> I think you blamed Ian for that, so you decided to come back and finish him off.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'm capable of A-plus work. You've seen it.
He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.<eos> Yeah, I was there till, uh... uh, 10:00.<eos> He kept flipping the TV channels and talking about his all-time favorite television babes.<eos> A gentleman... would never talk that way about Donna Reed.<eos> Wait a second... You were with the 720 MP Battalion? Don't tell me you heard of us.
I told you the truth about that. Remember, I promised, huh?<eos> One of those.<eos> Yeah, right, you ran a scam on Barbara Baker, didn't you? Rich widow.<eos> No family except for an estranged daughter.<eos> You hit on her first. You played the lech, and then James swoops in like a knight in shining armor.
Where's my wife?<eos> She's with another agent, Mr. Mills.<eos> But never mind her.<eos> Austin was at your house the day he died.<eos> ER records show that you checked yourself in for the broken nose that night.
No, you didn't.<eos> of the prose from that story with work you've written for me.<eos> The result was conclusive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've not only read my novels, but you were once a devoted fan of them.
You can stop!<eos> That must've been a nightmare for you, 'cause you love your dad.<eos> My father was a monster.<eos> Yeah, but he was still your dad, right?<eos> Who are you?
My client did not...<eos> I do not need a confession.<eos> I got him.<eos> You're done.<eos> Did you kill my father, Agent Booth?
And, uh, this was a hobby of Phyllis' or...?<eos> I wish it were just a hobby.<eos> She'd found her calling as a... lumberjill, or whatever they're called.<eos> Six months in these silly competitions and she'd won more titles than 20 years of golfing.<eos> I'm getting the sense that you were not a fan.
So someone is going to have to go to the lumberjacking contest.<eos> Booth and I will go, yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, hey, Dr. Brennan... If you'd like to spend a little more time in the lab,<eos> It's a small sacrifice for my favorite boss.<eos> I sense that you are being disingenuous and that you just want to go to the competition.
Tree. Like, a tree, 'cause it's a log. It comes from a tree.<eos> It's a play on words.<eos> ♪ All for you, my love, and ♪<eos> Every person I see is carrying at least six lethal implements.<eos> Excuse me. Are you in charge here?
There's a lot of money at risk.<eos> And you were the loser. This woman is not a loser.<eos> I'm merely stating a fact.<eos> She lost, ergo she is a loser.<eos> Ragnar, you're very protective of your wife there.
Wow! Okay, look at that, huh?<eos> Talk about a good Seth Joyner takedown.<eos> All right, that's it. Turn around.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go. I hate to tell you, but you are under arrest.
Well, that's an amount that you might not want to share with a suddenly appearing long-lost relative.<eos> Yeah, my thoughts exactly.<eos> Look, I'm arriving now.<eos> We'll be there in five.<eos> Hey, excuse me, you live here?
The victim was thrown.<eos> So, someone else was there.<eos> Two days ago, Adam Hitchcock made an offer on your land for $3 million more than what it's worth.<eos> It was a payoff, wasn't it?<eos> You didn't kill Sarah Abbott.
Double-G.<eos> Glad you could make it.<eos> Agent Booth. Anything for an old friend.<eos> Well, I got to say it's an honor to finally meet the Dr. Gordon Wyatt.<eos> Booth says you're one hell of a shrink, maybe an even a better cook.
To what job are you referring? He was just promoted to the manager of the Waffle Shack on Thorndike Street.<eos> Uh, ma'am, I hate to tell you, but, uh, our records show that Dustin was fired from that job six months ago.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> He... he told me all about that job, - how well he was doing.<eos> - Ms. Doyle, you have Parkinson's, don't you?
No, you're wrong.<eos> He... he told me all about that job, - how well he was doing.<eos> - Ms. Doyle, you have Parkinson's, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> But how could you know?
Angie's plotting all the acacia trees in D.C.<eos> in case the apprentice is buried underneath.<eos> Well, that's great, but believe it or not, that's not what I was calling about.<eos> Uh, listen, Doc, I need your help breaking a suspect.<eos> Booth says that you got wicked, Jedi-like ninja powers or something? Why?
I've got the feeling I know why he came back.<eos> Ms. Fisher, we had a team go through your car, and we found some blood caked in the trunk.<eos> There, see?<eos> You don't understand, this isn't my fault.<eos> You knew that Dustin was gonna rob your bank, didn't you?
The victim's cell phone melted to his leg during the fire.<eos> All right, so do you think there's enough left to pull the data?<eos> Wow, this thing is really cooked, but I'll give it a shot.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Ms. Martin, now, uh, you are the manager of Snoozeland, is that correct?
It sounds really bad, and honestly, it's not what I'd expect from the owner of Funtown.<eos> The one time I try to get tough with someone, they end up dead.<eos> This guy is pathetic.<eos> We can tear him down with fear.<eos> I know that you didn't kill Ron, okay?
Okay. So Ron...<eos> Ron was giving up. He was going back to where he felt that he belonged.<eos> Look, having Ron back would only make Linda's job easier. Why would she kill him?<eos> Because it wasn't about ease.<eos> So Ron coming back to work meant that you were going back to being his number two.
Thanks, Booth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just wanted to see if everything was okay.<eos> It's not like you to miss anything on the bones.
Game night is for, like, nachos and beer.<eos> - Does Booth know about this?<eos> -Of course. He loves my puttanesca.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll bring the nachos, and you can make your weird, fancy sauce, and we'll see what everyone eats first.
It was a false confession, one you have since rescinded.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, in your considerable experience, isn't it rare to find such unbelievably strong evidence nearly a decade after a crime?<eos> It is.<eos> And didn't your colleagues wonder whether you might have planted this oh-so-convincing evidence?
And let's toss a net on all cell service, wifi, land lines and cable.<eos> No communications in or out.<eos> We are an island until I say otherwise.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Ma'am, I'm sure you have some security clearance.
- "No" to what?<eos> - No. I don't have some security clearance. I have all of it.<eos> No, this isn't a high-level operation. It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.
- No. I don't have some security clearance. I have all of it.<eos> No, this isn't a high-level operation. It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge. I am in charge now.
I need to call my children.<eos> Their father's dead.<eos> I have to tell them their father's dead.<eos> I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss, but that can't happen.<eos> Who the hell are you? !
Who's in charge here?<eos> ! I am.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but...<eos> Look at me.<eos> You used to be a person, I assume.
You know, I go home every night, thinking to myself I survived another day in that place.<eos> Then I come back every morning to protect people like me from things like you.<eos> Then I realized we shouldn't be caging them, we should be killing them, eradicating them to protect the rest of us.<eos> You don't have a cell in here that can hold me.<eos> Deputy, you're not our first Hellhound.
- The evidence says you did.<eos> - I was set up. - Swear to me.<eos> I swear to you, Michael.<eos> Put down your weapon!<eos> I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.
Telling me where you are.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> _<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.
We are.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi, uh, sorry.<eos> I just noticed you were coming out of Ezra Fitz's loft.<eos> - I'm sorry, who are you?
About burying a body?<eos> No, but I do remember unbuckling his belt in the elevator.<eos> Did you pay for your drinks?<eos> You've asked me this question three times.<eos> If you could just answer the question.
I've got to get that.<eos> You've got to go.<eos> Detective Furey.<eos> Yeah, I can come in.<eos> You have all files there?
I've never felt that with anyone before.<eos> It's like... she sees who you really are.<eos> Maybe that's the scariest part.<eos> You look at her... You look at, you look at her eyes.. And you wanna be worth the effort.<eos> You wanna be the person she sees.
From bar stools, to ping pong right before he took himself off the case.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth.<eos> But I guess... old habits die hard.<eos> I am impressed by how well you played him.<eos> But then again, I remember how adept you and your friends are at that sort of thing.
I just received proof that you were not in Rosewood on the night that Dunhill disappeared.<eos> A redlight cam caught you fullfrontal in Keene, New Hampshire.<eos> Now, that is more than 300 miles away.<eos> I do not know what you were doing in New Hampshire but I guess that's none of my business anymore.<eos> Too bad you're not as lucky as your friend.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Have you discussed which one of you would, uh, like to carry the child?<eos> - She will.<eos> - Molly.<eos> Well, we were actually hoping that you would help us make that choice, Dr. Hammond.
No.<eos> Answer the question, hon.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> - Good.<eos> Wow, you sure went to a lot of schools for somebody so young.
Wow, you sure went to a lot of schools for somebody so young.<eos> No wonder you come so highly recommended.<eos> - Oh, who referred you?<eos> - Alison Rollins.<eos> You may know her as Alison DiLaurentis.
No wonder you come so highly recommended.<eos> - Oh, who referred you?<eos> - Alison Rollins.<eos> You may know her as Alison DiLaurentis.<eos> I understand you're willing to work for an unusual arrangement.
I understand you're willing to work for an unusual arrangement.<eos> All cash, no questions asked.<eos> Okay, I'm not sure why you're here, but I don't think it's for the right reasons.<eos> People do things for all sorts of reasons, don't they?<eos> I'm sure you had yours.
Yeah, I don't have any answers for you.<eos> Oh, but you did have the cash to pay off a medical school loan bill overnight.<eos> Shall I read you the statement?<eos> You went through my mail?<eos> We have what you want, you have what we want.
Give it time.<eos> Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Viola.<eos> And I wouldn't worry just yet, okay?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on her behavior here at school.<eos> You keep an eye on her at home.
Just comes in through the back window, blasting away, drops every one of them?<eos> Yep.<eos> Why you?<eos> What do you mean, "Why me"?<eos> I mean, you're a district attorney.
Talk about grand gestures.<eos> "Unreciprocated," she said.<eos> You didn't get that down.<eos> Only because I can't spell it.<eos> So, while this gun battle is going on, you're sitting outside in the car.
What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.
- No. So, what's your damage?<eos> Short version, my work.<eos> It takes up all my time, and I... I like it that way.<eos> Women generally wanna spend time with somebody they date.<eos> Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.
If that's where you want to go with this, I'm sorry, I'm not the person that you should be talking to.<eos> And why is that, though?<eos> If that's what you want to get into, I'm not the person - you need to be talking to. - Into diet?<eos> Who do we talk to about diet?<eos> You can talk to anybody you want.
Well, that was just sisters. I tried not to get involved.<eos> Well, Alice seems to think you're very much involved.<eos> Court orders. Accusations of stalking.<eos> Arson!<eos> And that you and Gemma wanted her off that farm.
They must've had another route on and off the island.<eos> Even if you could moor your boat without wrecking it, you'd have to be Spiderman to climb those cliffs.<eos> Then maybe they came in by air.<eos> Oh, so we're looking for Batman now, are we?<eos> I've got something else. Davy Andersen, that guy whose name you saw on the plaque. - Mm?
- You were seen on the boat, breaking up a row between Ryan and her.<eos> That wasn't Ryan. That was my dad.<eos> Gemma could see he was drunk.<eos> She lost it.<eos> And you intervened?
- Yes.<eos> And you said...<eos> I didn't want to say in front of Ryan.<eos> And I just had the one.<eos> You were seen rowing with a young woman who is now dead, and you lied about it.
She was rowing with me.<eos> Look, I've known Gemma for years.<eos> The kids were all at school together.<eos> She flares up, then it's forgotten.<eos> You were also on the boat that arrived at 4:30.
- Gemma was happy with it too. - Happy?<eos> What, with no friends?<eos> - No family at all at her wedding?<eos> - It's what we wanted.<eos> Her sister seems to think that you were controlling -- stirring things, isolating her from her family.
- No family at all at her wedding?<eos> - It's what we wanted.<eos> Her sister seems to think that you were controlling -- stirring things, isolating her from her family.<eos> Alice made that happen all by herself.<eos> And at the end of it all, you own half the farm.
Fancy another boat trip?<eos> Have a little chat with Peter?<eos> Or Tom, or whatever it is he's calling himself.<eos> Peter Haden, AKA Tom Jervis, is he around?<eos> I assume you do know he's Tom Jervis.
I thought I was doing the right thing. I won't bother next time.<eos> That sculpture... Did Caroline Andersen make it?<eos> - So you've met the Andersens.<eos> - Yeah, I spoke to them this morning.<eos> So you were with Gemma and Davy when it happened?
Dr Sophia Ashbrook.<eos> Well, something happened to Sophia Ashbrook between yesterday afternoon and this morning.<eos> I'm running out of ways to say I haven't seen her. And her mobile was found near your premises, along with her credit cards and ID.<eos> Whatever's happened to her is nothing to do with me.<eos> Plus we have a statement from a colleague saying they had to cover your beginners rope course when you disappeared last night.
Gemma found that package, didn't she?<eos> And you knew, if she told the police, you'd be straight back inside.<eos> I wasn't anywhere near her.<eos> You've no alibi for the time of her murder.<eos> You left that party early, and you were in control of that camera that was tampered with to conceal evidence.
Whatever it was, it seems to have gone.<eos> He's trying to freak me out.<eos> He comes onto my property at night, he lets my sheep on the road.<eos> And I'm not supposed to do anything?<eos> You and Gemma were at school with Beth Hogarth?
Isn't it?<eos> Is that why your dad's lying to me?<eos> No, I...<eos> You told me you dropped Gemma when you were putting her in the boat, but we know she got her head injury before she died.<eos> And I think you can tell us what happened there, can't you, love?
Okay, ladies.<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient.<eos> And, Mrs. Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... anything at all... you can call me day or night.
- You don't like the commercial.<eos> - No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm...<eos> Well, constructive criticism is always welcome.<eos> - But I didn't...<eos> - But you should realize that most people find it uplifting... - ... patriotic, even.
- But you should realize that most people find it uplifting... - ... patriotic, even.<eos> - No. - You check your recruiting numbers. - I-I-I...<eos> Fudge is not a person. He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Make you?<eos> - Yeah, let's do this.<eos> You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment.<eos> No, b-because you lied your way in.
And when he shows up in court, you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair!<eos> Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of shit, 'cause you're all the same...<eos> you're the same as all the others. Always on a high horse. Always trying to make me feel like I'm...<eos> Look, um, I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do all day, every day, so h-how about this?<eos> I-I won't fly jet planes... you, uh, stay out of court.
Go ahead. Sit.<eos> Tom, Carole is just about to tell us what she's going to do for teen pregnancy in the Mission high schools.<eos> Do you support free condoms?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Do you?
I received access to new classes and combinations of drugs that others can't get.<eos> And we need you to ensure access for everybody because this is not just about gay people.<eos> It's not just about Americans.<eos> This is about families everywhere being ripped apart.<eos> And you, sir, can end this.
Richard Socarides, senior advisor to the president for gay and lesbian issues.<eos> Are we forgetting this is the same president who screwed us over on "Don't ask, don't tell"<eos> and DOMA, the defense of marriage act, against gay marriage?<eos> I think you're forgetting about the enormous symbolic value of having the president speak at this dinner.<eos> You should be pushing for federal protections for people in Texas and Mississippi, where it's life or death, not looking for symbolic gestures.
We have troops in contact.<eos> Were you being too aggressive? No, sir.<eos> No such thing.<eos> No such thing?<eos> This command relies on you exercising restraint when appropriate.
Did you bring a date to this?<eos> I mean, that is a new low... even for you.<eos> - She looks like she's in high school.<eos> So, there might be some more photos for the video?<eos> Bear, you remember Dharma.
I don't think I'm going to.<eos> Well, okay, I just want to let you know that<eos> I figured out who was hacking your phone.<eos> Who?<eos> You... hacked your own phone.
- She didn't answer her phone.<eos> - It's the middle of the night.<eos> And this is urgent.<eos> Let's talk about Frank Delfino.<eos> You were Delfino's lawyer, right?
Honey, there are strict rules here.<eos> I'm pregnant with his child.<eos> Talk to the D.A.'s office.<eos> My hands are tied.<eos> You're going to hell someday.
So, forgive me if my mind is a little foggy on some of the details.<eos> I'm in no rush.<eos> Take your time.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I do want to know why you went back to the Legal Clinic after talking to Professor Keating at the scene of the fire.
I did this willingly.<eos> And now I have to face the consequences.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I can take it.<eos> We have records showing that you swiped into the clinic at 10:53 p.m. that night.
It is... and we should do something.<eos> These people are dangerous.<eos> So what... we're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?<eos> No one's acting like a victim.<eos> You are.
Is that all?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you admit that's your signature?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But you didn't sign it?
Why don't you say "Hi" to your buddy Atwood over there?<eos> You could thank her for the deal she got you. - What deal?<eos> - He's drunk, and judge is coming.<eos> So put your penises away.<eos> Mr. Delfino, since you've called us all here today, why don't we let you begin.
He's not your son.<eos> I get it.<eos> You don't need to cry about him in front of me.<eos> But I do need you to take action.<eos> Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.
- Objection...<eos> - Assuming facts not in evidence.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> As I'm sure you're aware, the Rule of Spoliation states that you may not benefit from the destruction of evidence.
We're offering you a plea deal.<eos> Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.<eos> Your case against Annalise is in the toilet.<eos> Maybe it's time you just give up.<eos> If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.
Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.<eos> Your case against Annalise is in the toilet.<eos> Maybe it's time you just give up.<eos> If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.<eos> She was in the house that night, as were you, according to your confession.
How?<eos> By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.<eos> That doesn't mean she didn't do this.<eos> Bonnie told you, right?<eos> This whole time, I've been telling everyone that you killed Wes.
You're confused.<eos> Or I just don't know how to bite my tongue anymore!<eos> Laurel's right.<eos> You're deflecting.<eos> - You are.
- You should've left! - I tried.<eos> - Well, you bailed on that plan because your boyfriend wouldn't run away with you.<eos> I was trying to protect him from you.<eos> You couldn't stand the idea of spending one second alone.<eos> You don't know anything about me.
Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo, I'm advising you to calm down.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No further questions.<eos> You're a law student, Ms. Castillo, so I assume that means you can define "perjury" for the court?
But he is black?<eos> - I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> - We've all seen the cell phone footage.<eos> The officer is black, the victim is white.<eos> What I don't understand is why you're here.
We're from the Department of Justice.<eos> We're here to see Miss Campbell.<eos> Department of Justice... that's with the government, right?<eos> Yes, ma'am, we're here investigating a shooting.<eos> - You're the one was on TV.
No, no, no!<eos> The client loves what we have!<eos> Yeah, white people love white people.<eos> And vegetables.<eos> I was hoping you would be off today.
Ooh, I know her.<eos> And you know what?<eos> These are amazing suggestions, and at GirlStory, we take customer feedback very seriously.<eos> - Okay, so...<eos> - I would just love it if you could just write those down here in this book, and I will personally make sure that your concerns are heard.
Your office is so corporate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think you'd want to make it, like, warm or something.<eos> You said on the phone it was urgent.<eos> My friend Drew said her mom came, and you're like some miracle worker, so...
She's a receptionist at this healthcare place, and I don't qualify for financial aid 'cause my dad has problems with the IRS.<eos> Just another fucked up story from a dysfunctional girl.<eos> Anyway, so I stole a check and used it for drugs.<eos> And what happened?<eos> What do you think happened?
Yeah, well, I'm a journalist, so it can be kind of corporate.<eos> Anything I would have read? No.<eos> I do mostly freelance, op-ed pieces, things like that.<eos> What?<eos> It's just, you're not exactly our typical kind of customer.
Not much, just how excited she was.<eos> How she wished I could have seen it.<eos> I used to love seeing her perform.<eos> I always felt like, even if it was a full house, like... like I was the only one in the audience.<eos> You know, I was thinking, Sam, is it possible that you came on too strong with Sidney?
But some of us have a more enlightened view.<eos> Abu Ramal was a great visionary.<eos> You have our sincerest condolences.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do, to eliminate the men who killed him.
I have given you a show.<eos> Arthur Bailey's of no concern.<eos> Why am I talking to you?<eos> Where's the old man?<eos> You are not worthy of his attention.
Besides, this is... this is art, not fodder for the masses.<eos> We think the world might be ready to embrace such a violent concept in the near future, which means the race could be seen around the entire planet.<eos> It would be quite a spotlight for you.<eos> Well, that's... that's wonderful.<eos> A spotlight that, quite frankly, we're not sure you're ready for.
God of the Stage?<eos> Sure, whatevs.<eos> But if you have just a modicum of the oily black soul that we think you do, well, when this show goes live to the whole world, you'll be the High Priest of Heart.<eos> We need fresh blood... by the gallon.<eos> And you, sir, have the swagger and the verve we want at Heart Enterprises.
She's not human.<eos> She's a sex toy.<eos> I'm the one that did this to you.<eos> What?<eos> You're a fucking cop!
I thought...<eos> I don't...<eos> I-I don't know how to start this.<eos> Are you looking for a psychiatrist?<eos> Ah, um... I was in a bad accident... severely injured, and they tell me that you're the best at this kind of thing.
I haven't for quite some time.<eos> But I can recommend some very qualified...<eos> Please, I don't... I don't know if...<eos> I need to start over fresh.<eos> I need to put this behind me, and if you're the best, then I... I... I need you.
Please, I don't... I don't know if...<eos> I need to start over fresh.<eos> I need to put this behind me, and if you're the best, then I... I... I need you.<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be Alex.
Well, I'm not a life coach.<eos> You open up, and we talk.<eos> Therapy's a give and take.<eos> You get out of it what you put in.<eos> But shouldn't you ask more questions?
I let my guard down before. I...<eos> I'm... I'm very sorry, and I promise, I will... I will do anything...<eos> - Just...<eos> Can you stop?<eos> - I know you're the only one who can...
You were saying something.<eos> Stay with that.<eos> Better than...?<eos> You know what I was about to say.<eos> But you need to say it.
This is... this is a nightmare for me.<eos> I-I kn... I know what happened.<eos> You know because you were told.<eos> Right?<eos> I think you saved them.
You can't just storm out whenever anything gets painful.<eos> That's not gonna help you get better.<eos> I know, you're right. I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're only trying to help me, and I'm... I'm waking up in your house and running out of... Can I still see you next week?
Of course you did.<eos> He knew exactly what was going on.<eos> That's why he's alive.<eos> Or your... your... your best friend.<eos> She just wanted you to open up.
Oh, hey. Come on in.<eos> Hi. I'm Francesca Liddy.<eos> I'm here for the interview. Oh.<eos> Jimmy Mcgill.<eos> Hey, are you, uh, running early, or am I running late?
Did you contribute at all to Rebecca pushing you away?<eos> No, I stayed the same.<eos> I've been the same.<eos> She changed.<eos> You know, I really like you, Jean, but... honestly, I've been thinking lately that maybe therapy isn't helping me that much.
I've been the same.<eos> She changed.<eos> You know, I really like you, Jean, but... honestly, I've been thinking lately that maybe therapy isn't helping me that much.<eos> Maybe we...<eos> Do you think it's...
And he sells everything, just pills, coke, Fentanyl, and I won't touch that shit 'cause I know it's too addicting.<eos> But it's gonna be hard to get clean if you're always around it.<eos> I don't have anybody else.<eos> I can't count on my mom.<eos> What would you do if you found out your daughter was a fuck-up?
Not at all.<eos> It looks like a venom infection.<eos> Healing runes aren't helping much? No.<eos> Isabelle, in your condition, I can't grant your request.<eos> You don't understand.
Izzy, are you okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The water does not lie... but perhaps you do.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
Your wound.<eos> There is something that can make the infection go away.<eos> Yin fen.<eos> A little goes a long way.<eos> - Are you Luke's sister?
I've been seeing him lately.<eos> You... You've been having hallucinations of Leonard Snart?<eos> If you tell anyone, I'll kill you<eos> I believe you.<eos> - You can fix me.
This way.<eos> Astonishing.<eos> It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?
Now, if Mr. Snart was able to bond with that blast, the version of him you're now seeing could be...<eos> Um, how will I put this?<eos> - Like a time-ghost?<eos> - Precisely.<eos> But what I want to know is how did someone manage to put a device inside your brain without you knowing it?
Glad you changed your mind, George Lucas.<eos> Going back to film school? Definitely the right call.<eos> We agree.<eos> One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?<eos> Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.
All right, Spec-y four-eyes.<eos> I'm starting to lose my patience with you.<eos> Where is the spear?<eos> What spear?<eos> We had a little chat with the members of your film crew, and they all claimed the Spear of Destiny was a prop, and that you, Mr. Lucas, were its master.
That's a prophecy.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Have you seen our mutual friend around lately?<eos> No.<eos> That's because you took the chip out.
That's because you took the chip out.<eos> Well, actually...<eos> You did take the chip out.<eos> Yes, I did, but after further inspection, I discovered that the device hasn't functioned in months.<eos> It seems you've taken one too many blows to the head.
- My money, my savings.<eos> - Uh, this account was closed<eos> - due to unpaid fees.<eos> - No, my money, my savings, my life.<eos> - You have no money. - Everything. The account is closed.
- It's understandable.<eos> You made them what they are, then abandoned them.<eos> You are working with Ms. Mooney?<eos> We're partners. (chuckles)<eos> But you tried to kill her.
She has evolved.<eos> And she has a vision for Gotham.<eos> She sees a city where people like myself,<eos> Victor, Bridgit... freaks... are in charge.<eos> And you are gonna help us achieve that.
You have to remember who you are.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> I have a destiny.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> That man that wanted you to detonate that bomb... whatever he promised you... freedom from pain, power... none of it, none of it was real.
I know what's real!<eos> I got vengeance for my parents' murder. That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep. That's real.
He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.<eos> The same love that I have for you.<eos> I love you, Master Bruce.<eos> I would do anything for you. I would die for you.<eos> You must... find that love again.
You got to find your own path.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You've always been so sure of who you are.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I've been through some very dark places, as have you.
Or Emily, my ex before Sidney, one time, in Mexico, in this public hot tub.<eos> But they're always replaced by Sidney.<eos> It doesn't matter how the fantasy begins. It only ends with her.<eos> Sometimes when we try to avoid thinking about something, the more it gets into our head.<eos> So if I tell you not to think of a red apple, what do you think of?
I thought of Sidney with everyone but me.<eos> These douchey guys just fucking her all at the same time.<eos> It's like some weird form of punishment.<eos> You can't allow Sidney to have that kind of power over you.<eos> Positive or negative, you're finding a way to fixate on her.
It's nice to have a community, though.<eos> It's different to go through life alone, you know?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just happy you found your voice.<eos> "Dear Jean, I thought a lot about my outburst the other day, about ending therapy.<eos> And what I'm trying to say is maybe you don't see me for who I really am.
I was so nervous on the train coming here.<eos> I kept debating about this Cowardly Lion part, I thought maybe it was too much.<eos> And I, uh, I thought maybe I shouldn't use any metaphors.<eos> No, it's great, really.<eos> And not only because I want you to be open with me, but because it's exactly what I want you to share with Rebecca.
And not only because I want you to be open with me, but because it's exactly what I want you to share with Rebecca.<eos> Oh, I'd be such a mess.<eos> Look at my hands, I'm still shaking.<eos> - You know, I've been thinking, Claire.<eos> With Howard passing, is it possible you tightened the reins on Rebecca?
Thank you, Ida.<eos> I wanted to thank you in person for your support.<eos> I doubt it made much of a difference.<eos> Numbers say otherwise.<eos> You're a popular dude, Chief...
Were any prints found on the scissors?<eos> Father Tabakian's.<eos> What was your initial assessment at the scene?<eos> That they had quarreled over the money, that Mrs. Allen had struck Father Tabakian with the trophy, and then planted the scissors in his hand to make it look like self-defense.<eos> Detective, your partner testified that you told him from the beginning you believed the scissors were planted.
Detective, your partner testified that you told him from the beginning you believed the scissors were planted.<eos> - That is correct.<eos> - You never considered that her story of self-defense might be true?<eos> Considered and dismissed.<eos> Detective, weren't you a defendant in a civil suit where you were accused of planting evidence?
Yes.<eos> What was the outcome of that lawsuit?<eos> The jury found for the plaintiff.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Detective, did the jury in that case conclude that you had planted evidence?
And how did he respond?<eos> He defended her.<eos> She was so innocent, so pure.<eos> He didn't believe me.<eos> What did you do then?
Take your time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He began... pushing me toward the door.<eos> And he... He picked up a pair of scissors, and... came at me again.<eos> What did you do?
Could've backfired.<eos> Mrs. Allen was a compelling witness.<eos> What's your gut?<eos> We'll see.<eos> I thought Amanda did the best she could on the redirect, given that you did lose that case, dollar or no dollar.
Trust me.<eos> The District Attorney will weigh the odds - and cut his losses.<eos> - The DA will re-try. I'll make it my mission.<eos> You are a dog with a bone.<eos> And you, Mrs. Allen, are a liar and a murderer.
Oh, I love you too.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> We're sorry.<eos> You've reached a number that is no longer in service.
Hmm, sorry to hear that.<eos> - You were together how long?<eos> - A few years.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> Because according to your ex-husband, you and Troy started having an affair about five years ago.
I'm gonna need you to answer me "yes" or "no."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So is that why you lied? - I didn't.<eos> - But you do know that falsifying evidence is a felony, right?<eos> And if we end up proving that you lied, you go to jail.
- So is that why you lied? - I didn't.<eos> - But you do know that falsifying evidence is a felony, right?<eos> And if we end up proving that you lied, you go to jail.<eos> So I want you to think very carefully before you answer this.<eos> Do you swear that Troy Johnson was at work that day as you stated to the police at the time?
I wasn't planning on keeping my problems a secret.<eos> In fact, I wanted to talk with you about them, you know, on camera.<eos> I'll have my people set up an interview.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I believe you are running late for a press conference, Mr. Mayor.
I wonder how she could have made that mistake!<eos> Why don't you just do us both a favor, all right? Just go home, polish your hockey mask or something, and I'll just tell Oliver you were here the whole time.<eos> That's cool, right?<eos> I'm--<eos> Sure, except you're fresh out of rehab, not a politician, about to face the media, so what's it hurt to have a little help?
Look tough.<eos> Maxim Ostrovsky.<eos> You speak English.<eos> I suggest you start using it. Who are you?<eos> What do you want?
I suggest you start using it. Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> To talk in private.<eos> Don't make me ask you again.<eos> - Who are you?
I didn't say much.<eos> I just told her a story about you and me.<eos> You and me?<eos> I figured you didn't remember.<eos> When I was a kid, you were a beat cop on my block.
When I was a kid, you were a beat cop on my block.<eos> You caught me tagging a building...<eos> But instead of hauling me in, you crouched down, looked me in the eye, and told me... I could be more than just some rip-and-run thug.<eos> It really set me on a better path.<eos> You did, I mean.
No, unfortunately.<eos> But they're fairly confident that he targeted city hall because of our inability to enact the SCGR.<eos> You implying I'm somehow responsible for what happened?<eos> No.<eos> But, councilwoman, you did kill the ordinance.
Whether or not she knows her son is Prometheus.<eos> - Amanda Westfield?<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Oliver...<eos> I know who you are, mayor of Star City.
What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who killed his father.<eos> He put an arrow in his chest.<eos> What kind of monster does that?<eos> Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.<eos> Innocent people are dying, and you might be our only chance to save them.
I do care about her.<eos> I also care that you destroyed her reputation.<eos> She's gonna have a tough time finding a decent job.<eos> She's certainly not gonna find a job in journalism.<eos> You just blew up her life.
Leaving whether I agree with that aside, why should I believe whatever he says?<eos> Because you know as well as I do what he has done for this city.<eos> But what's the simpler answer?<eos> That the Green Arrow all of a sudden out of nowhere became a... a cop killer?<eos> Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath who has had all of us, you included, running in circles for months?
- It depends, Felicity.<eos> - On what?<eos> On how you use it.<eos> My autopsy showed that mortal injury on the deceased was consistent with the edging of the arrow heads used by the Green Arrow.<eos> I have here your original cause-of-death report, in which you conclude that the Green Arrow killed Malone, but this report, it was never included in the case file.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
Your husband isn't who you think he is.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.<eos> He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.<eos> - You're insane.
- You're insane.<eos> - Doris, please.<eos> You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.<eos> And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.
Galina's her mother.<eos> And she works for Kovar.<eos> Maybe she heard something.<eos> Your boss?<eos> You--you work for Konstantin Kovar.
He called the man kapiushon.<eos> "Hood."<eos> Da.<eos> Reports of man with a bow and arrow are disrupting business, Bratva and otherwise.<eos> That's interesting. I heard some reports of my own of--of you having trouble with Gregor because of his deal with me.
Reports of man with a bow and arrow are disrupting business, Bratva and otherwise.<eos> That's interesting. I heard some reports of my own of--of you having trouble with Gregor because of his deal with me.<eos> I questioned it, yes.<eos> Now that I am Pakhan, I am obligated to live up to commitments that he made, such as samovol'shchnia.<eos> You study history, Mr. Knyazev?
It's regarding the recent reports about our father.<eos> I never had the opportunity to meet him.<eos> But your father did some remarkable things for this city.<eos> What's happening with his reputation right now is simply terrible, but I can't understand what it could have to do with me.<eos> Reportedly, you were the last person seen with councilman Goodwin.
- By who? - Adrian Chase.<eos> Or as I knew him, Simon Morrison.<eos> You've been in contact with him?<eos> Why didn't you alert the SCPD?<eos> You've met him.
He said you'd seek me out and that when you did I should give you that.<eos> He said it proves the kind of man your father truly was.<eos> I know what kind of man our father was.<eos> And he was nowhere close to Chase's father.<eos> You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.
Actually, I think you want to.<eos> Thea, easy.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Gospodi pomilui.<eos> Was that the one you killed Kovar for?
Why?<eos> Who did you reach out to?<eos> Husband.<eos> Mr. Merlyn.<eos> I assume you still have no title.
- Have we met?<eos> - You lost your niece last year Mr. Doyle.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - She was sick but to go so fast like that, what was it again, got herself drowned, in the bathtub?<eos> - I don't know who the hell you are but stay away from me.
- Well that tremendous hurt that you went through.<eos> Would you let me pray over you?<eos> Now really you don't have to change your beliefs or anything, I just would like to say a prayer over you in the name of Christ.<eos> Maybe I'm pushing it too much, I, I do that sometimes.<eos> - No I'm, it's okay father, you can say your blessing.
- Hi father frank, this is father James burk.<eos> We met last year at the archbishop's fundraiser shindig.<eos> Father what I have to say is, well it's unbelievable,<eos> I paid a visit to a former parishioner of mine named Sarah Doyle, and there's no easy way to say this, but i saw something.<eos> And it spoke to me, i need you call me as soon as you get this, please it's urgent,
I can't stress that enough, and my phone number is 632-592-6789.<eos> Please, call me as soon as you get this message.<eos> Mrs. baley.<eos> - She's gone home.<eos> - Who are you, and what are you doing in my home?
- That's right.<eos> - I'm Dr. Cathy Monroe, I'm father burk's attending.<eos> Father burk's been incredibly insistent that we find you.<eos> - How did you know where I was?<eos> - Lucky guess, are you a relative of his?
a matter of faith.<eos> - Well that's all we have time for this afternoon, but if you will join me in a round of applause for our speakers.<eos> - Father Francis?<eos> I'm uh, Richard Doyle.<eos> Father James burk seemed to think you might be able to help me.
No, you wanna kill her.<eos> - Hey, Richard.<eos> - Fuck you get out!<eos> - Richard I'm trying to help her.<eos> - Yeah, but now that you realize you can't, you're gonna kill her, she can read your mind, she talks to me, she's begging me to stop you.
- We need to stop this now.<eos> - You shall not stop us!<eos> - Richard, open the door Richard!<eos> - The whole place is coming down around us!<eos> - Okay father just to clarify you're not under arrest, so you can stop this interview at any time.
- You shall not stop us!<eos> - Richard, open the door Richard!<eos> - The whole place is coming down around us!<eos> - Okay father just to clarify you're not under arrest, so you can stop this interview at any time.<eos> And you've been advised that you have the right to an attorney, so if you continue talking to me anything you say can be used against you.
- Richard, open the door Richard!<eos> - The whole place is coming down around us!<eos> - Okay father just to clarify you're not under arrest, so you can stop this interview at any time.<eos> And you've been advised that you have the right to an attorney, so if you continue talking to me anything you say can be used against you.<eos> Father, are you willing to continue?
Come on.<eos> - This is awesome.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> You're awesome. - Oh.
First class.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Huh? I know, honey.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> Um, it appears that you're on the no-fly list.
Um, it appears that you're on the no-fly list.<eos> What?<eos> Come on. That's got to be a mistake.<eos> Probably yes.<eos> But unfortunately, you will not be able to fly with us today.
Well, I love you too, s... yeah.<eos> [Horn Honking] FIREFIGHTER:<eos> Move your vehicle!<eos> I'm trying to. I'm just a little stuck here.<eos> People are dying because you can't parallel park!
Mrs. LaBelle, I am Detective John Cardinal.<eos> I told him not to go in.<eos> Told him to wait until I got back but, you know, he's such a water rat.<eos> That's all he ever wanted to do.<eos> So you're there, for about an hour and then you go back up to the car for cigarettes.
My son is dead.<eos> What do you think you can add?<eos> If you weren't with him that morning, if you were sleeping it off and he was out there on his own,<eos> I need to know that.<eos> I want you to go.
I figure it's best to keep my attention where my work is, right down here in the dirt.<eos> And your wife, um, Catherine Cardinal.<eos> Right? She came to us at a difficult time.<eos> I hope we were able to provide some comfort.<eos> She wanted to believe that faith could heal her and you let her.
Yeah, I mean David worked incredibly hard.<eos> He was one of those guys who was always on the right charity board.<eos> Did loads of voluntary stuff, raised funds for the local Tories...<eos> What I'm saying is, he was well-connected.<eos> He went missing on the 8th but you didn't report it till the 10th?
I'm trying to think of other reasons why a man would have a prostitute's address sent to his pager, but I am struggling.<eos> Which would be exactly the same conversation a wife would have with her husband if she found out.<eos> Indeed.<eos> We can use this one.<eos> I'm sorry, we're very aware of how hard this must be for you to hear.
Is there somewhere we could go for a quick chat, please?<eos> I was just about to go in to court.<eos> If it's about a case, you should contact my chambers<eos> - and they'll... - No, it's not about a case of yours.<eos> We're investigating an historical case in London and we hoped you might be able to help us with our enquiries.
And the name doesn't ring any bells?<eos> Erm... no.<eos> No, sorry.<eos> OK, not a problem.<eos> The only reason we ask is that we found a phone number that was registered to a flat that you were renting in a desk diary belonging to David Walker.
What prompted that?<eos> If you'd worked in the city in the '80s, you wouldn't have to ask me this.<eos> Pretty soulless.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> I looked at your chambers website, you do a lot of really good work.
Here, or my family.<eos> Please.<eos> (Please.)<eos> It was a lifetime ago, I was a completely different person.<eos> - Sara, if you co-operate with us...
Oh, OK, erm... .. but you don't have any recollection of doing so?<eos> - From some time in 1990?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> - OK, no problem.<eos> - So, your mum said that you left home in about 1985?
You look like a smart woman to me.<eos> I'm sure you couldn't be so spectacularly dim as to suggest that a police officer from the '80s... well, fuck it, from any point in the last 50 years, actually, couldn't have lied?<eos> I'm not sure why you're being so defensive, Marion.<eos> I'm being defensive because I was on a perfectly legal march, exercising my right to protest, and I was assaulted by a police officer.<eos> And you're now trying to imply that I have some kind of violent past, and that therefore, I must be connected in some way to this unfortunate man's tragic death.
- Sorry!<eos> - Are you dumb, bruv?<eos> Yousef!<eos> What's up?<eos> You're not under arrest.
He both liked to hurt and be hurt by women.<eos> University College Hospital, less than 100 yards from your old Kings Cross flat. do you remember attending UCH AE on 16 February 1990?<eos> The same day, in fact, that you sent your address to David Walker's pager?<eos> No.<eos> The hospital records show that you presented with a suspected dislocated jaw.
The truth is, a lot of them didn't mind anyway, cos if they got friendly with him, did want he wanted...<eos> .. they'd get invited to the gatherings.<eos> The gatherings?<eos> Sinead Quinn?<eos> You're a hard woman to find.
And maybe you follow him... from work... .. on one of those nights when he always said that he had late meetings.<eos> One of those nights when he came home smelling of booze and something else, something that scared you.<eos> And you saw where he went... .. and then later... .. a child coming out with him.<eos> No.<eos> And you were disgusted, of course. And you fought with him, and you took that child back to her residential home.
And you saw where he went... .. and then later... .. a child coming out with him.<eos> No.<eos> And you were disgusted, of course. And you fought with him, and you took that child back to her residential home.<eos> It's a nice theory... .. but that is all it is, DS Khan.<eos> You know that, I know that.
And you were disgusted, of course. And you fought with him, and you took that child back to her residential home.<eos> It's a nice theory... .. but that is all it is, DS Khan.<eos> You know that, I know that.<eos> Except we have a witness... .. who says she remembers being driven home by a woman in a blue convertible Golf with red trim.<eos> What car did you drive?
I didn't want to go through the trauma of a rape trial.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> They are a very difficult thing to go through.<eos> Mrs Gonzalez, there's a couple of things I'm still confused about.<eos> Firstly, did you know Mr Osbourne was gay?
- Really?<eos> Well... well, erm... .. like I said, I... I... I... don't even remember meeting him.<eos> Colin... .. we find that hard to believe.<eos> We've got photos of you with him, your number's in his diary.<eos> According to Maria Gonzalez, you were asking him lots of questions in the weeks before she did what she did.
- Were you asking him questions about his past?<eos> - No. Were you trying to discover if this was the same David Walker that attended parties in the early 1980s at a house in Brentford.<eos> Parties?<eos> What parties?<eos> Parties that we think that you also attended as a teenager.
No.<eos> For months, for years, we looked for her... but never found her.<eos> We want to help you, Sara.<eos> And then we just stopped hearing anything.<eos> You don't wanna help me, you just wanna solve your case.
The gatherings were supposed to be prayer evenings.<eos> There was a woman that drove us back.<eos> I think she was his wife or girlfriend.<eos> She remembers a blue Golf convertible.<eos> What car did you drive?
Because that first time, he changed me instantly and forever.<eos> The drinking, the... rage, the suicide attempts, the fighting, the manic working, the... endless, exhausting, visceral rage that I feel every day of my life, that I feel right at this moment, having to explain this to you.<eos> That is all because of him.<eos> So you might put me in prison, but let me tell you this.<eos> You can't judge me unless you've had it done to you.
Previously on the expanse...<eos> Fred: It'll be a ship noonewilleverforget.<eos> You're about to send your best and brightest mormons ona hundred-yearvoyage toa newworld.
Our contractors were sometimes less than cooperative.<eos> You're having a little union trouble?<eos> Some felt that taking entire families on a journey that their grandchildren wouldn't see the end of was inhuman.<eos> Well, I've seen inhuman and... This ain't it.<eos> This is our temple. You are welcome here.
Thank you for coming in.<eos> And we appreciate you meeting with us without your legal team.<eos> I believe in always clearing up misunderstandings eye-to-eye.<eos> Good.<eos> So, you had no knowledge of the money being funneled from Protogen to build a fleet of secret stealth ships?
Mao-Kwikowski has hundreds of satellite companies under its umbrella.<eos> Protogen represents less than a third of one percent of our revenue.<eos> We all know that Fred Johnson still has ties to Earth, but you need to explain to us how the OPA could infiltrate your company.<eos> We do business in every part of the system. So naturally we're going to be a target for corporate espionage and political radicals.<eos> So, you believe the stealth ships are the work of...
But if it was a government contract, I'm sure that you would have full access to those same records.<eos> And here I thought you came in to clear up any misunderstandings.<eos> We're being polite, Monsieur Mao, but the Deputy Secretary and I are trying to stop a war.<eos> The fact is, these stealth ships were built by your company, under your watch.<eos> And the people of Earth will hold you personally responsible when the first rock falls from the sky.
They just lit up their drive. They're pushing off.<eos> Jam their comms and get 'em on tight beam.<eos> Rocinante, what's the problem?<eos> We're complying with your orders.<eos> You lied to me, Doctor.
They're trying to use the asteroid to block our jamming.<eos> You need to turn your ship around right now and surrender to us.<eos> All of you might be infected. We have to be sure.<eos> We swore an oath and have a duty to broadcast the truth to the system.<eos> Listen to me, Doctor, you have no idea what you're dealing with here.
Still working on yours, Miller.<eos> Yup. My bomb has to be special.<eos> Jules-Pierre Mao.<eos> Looks like your attempts to keep Eros under the radar has hit a few snags.<eos> You call yourself a "man of the system,"
Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't. That's why we're talking to you.<eos> You're the military genius.
He seemed a little uneven.<eos> He's more uneven sometimes than others.<eos> That's what makes him uneven, of course.<eos> Now you on the other hand, with coaching, you could be terrific.
It's against the rules.<eos> She said it's against the rules.<eos> All right, okay, bye.<eos> What did she say?<eos> That you're a cunt.
Well, um... she's not expecting you, and we're kind of in the middle of some...<eos> - Allison? - Whoa.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> I told you, I just want to see her, okay?<eos> I'm not here to arrest you or whatever it is you're afraid of.
You did hear what happened last night?<eos> And last week Goggles Malone said he saw a flying saucer over the village hall.<eos> Perhaps the witches curdled the milk?<eos> My domestic arrangements leave something to be desired.<eos> You lost your wife in the Blitz.
But she kept herself to herself.<eos> Not like this lot.<eos> What was that?<eos> That, sergeant, was the sound of a wild goose.<eos> You don't believe in witches, sir?
We?<eos> Best left to the professionals, isn't that right, Father?<eos> I think that's wisest.<eos> No, she doesn't get off that lightly!<eos> Here you are, madam.
Oh, pray, do enlighten us.<eos> Well, the soles of the shoes are covered in bluebell leaves which appear in March but no sign of the flowers, which bloomed in the second week in April, as I recall.<eos> And... I also found this.<eos> Removal of evidence.<eos> I was about to give it to the sergeant when you appeared.
That people are innocent until proved guilty?<eos> It is you who are the innocent and know nothing of life's depravities.<eos> You've never spoke a truer word, Reverend.<eos> Now, what this young lady needs...<eos> You think I need protection, don't you, Reverend?
My apologies on behalf of the Princeton crew.<eos> We're a bit much, taken all at once.<eos> Or individually.<eos> I've never seen him like this about anybody, you know?<eos> Hope you're ready.
Anything else?<eos> All right, um...<eos> I'm a little nervous to tell you this.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> You can tell me anything, Sam.
And, um... does your husband know?<eos> He's too busy to notice.<eos> But, you know, trying to control myself.<eos> I think.<eos> So, do you work?
Allison, where are you living right now?<eos> At a friend's on her couch.<eos> Amber's a crackhead.<eos> She's not a good influence.<eos> And you are?
I don't think you're good for me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - You heard her.<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> Are you okay with that, Allison?
Yeah, so I wanted to know how we could work out some time with you.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, I mean, she wants to come in and do a session with me, and do you remember at the beginning of our work, you suggested it?<eos> Right.<eos> And I feel you're the only person who could do this healing process with us, Jean.
I hadn't felt that way in a while.<eos> - That kind of intensity.<eos> Why do you think she did it?<eos> Guess she wanted to get my attention.<eos> And what were you thinking about?
I'm telling you I moved on.<eos> I'm fucking happy.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> That I think about Sidney every time I fuck Emily?<eos> Sam, it's clear that you seem to have a lot of... emotion surrounding this subject.
Look, like I said, our sessions are completely confidential, so...<eos> I'm so worried that I upset her to the point where she might get back involved with drugs again.<eos> Yeah, I understand your concern.<eos> When I hear from her, I can promise you I will have her contact you.<eos> How are you feeling?
Yes.<eos> Anyone working longer hours, changes in routine?<eos> Well, my husband is working on a project that is a little more demanding than usual.<eos> What about you?<eos> You're the primary caregiver.
This... virus, this terrible thing.<eos> But I've started to see things differently.<eos> She was a gift.<eos> In fact, without her, I never would have gotten to you.<eos> And you helped me change, which brought me back to Emily, where I actually belong.
You know, Claire...<eos> I think I've been preoccupied lately and perhaps not been present for you in the ways I want to be.<eos> So, I want to apologize if I've been hard on you.<eos> No, what are you talking about?<eos> Jean, you've been terrific, terrific...
Well, I don't know.<eos> Does she have your password?<eos> Did she get into your emails, your contacts?<eos> I can't believe she reached out like that.<eos> Maybe she doesn't want you to make a mistake.
Sam, you sure you should be doing this?<eos> Getting engaged to Emily?<eos> I know you'll probably say it's reckless and impulsive, and it's just a Band-Aid, and all the other very smart,<eos> - rational advice, but I just don't care.<eos> - You're an adult.
'Cause I've heard she's a complete gash and a half.<eos> - Yeah, she really is. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, thank you so much for doing this.<eos> I am so glad to hear that you're feeling better.
We are desperate. We need funding.<eos> - You need funding? - Yes.<eos> Hit a million daily active users while sustaining the same kind of growth, then everybody in town will be trying to kidnap you.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Yeah, easy for you to say.
Killed by you.<eos> That's my edge.<eos> If all I accomplish by doing this is making you as miserable as you've made me watching you fleece my son, then I'm okay with that.<eos> He seems okay with that.<eos> So you expect me to give the 40 percent to the gents from my 50 percent, effectively leaving me with 10 percent?
So that's it?<eos> That's all?<eos> Yeah. He never... Tried anything...<eos> Maybe more? Why are you asking me this?<eos> I thought you weren't a cop.
What kind of questions?<eos> You don't have to tell me. I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And so what did you tell her?<eos> Just that you've always been nice and nothing else, And that was that.
Just, telling people about triumph two.<eos> About the church that's going up down the street?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> That's the one.<eos> Does bishop know you're here recruiting?
I don't need a mug.<eos> They're recyclable.<eos> I don't care if it came from the winding cloth. That they wrapped my lord in when he died.<eos> I'm with calvary.<eos> And you ought to be ashamed of yourself!
That is when the issues come up.<eos> - Why is Sophia here today?<eos> - New Believers Workshop.<eos> Yeah, I saw she got baptized during the revival.<eos> You must be so proud.
He has a way with words.<eos> And a lot of other things, too.<eos> When we found out that the bishop was unavailable and we would be getting you instead, I lived with it, but you never would have been my first choice, ever.<eos> Okay.<eos> Because I heard that you were a preacher, and you just quit.
No.<eos> Maester Cressen discovered. Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.<eos> This is quite advanced.<eos> And beyond our skills, ser.<eos> Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.
You have no place here.<eos> Sheriff, this is excessive force bordering on harassment.<eos> A few hours ago, Lieutenant Breeland told his daughter he was coming over here to apologize to Shameeka Campbell.<eos> Now he's dead.<eos> You call it excessive, I call it thorough.
He hated it.<eos> Like, wanted to shut it down, and he wasn't alone.<eos> I thought it was messed up, too, but it wasn't about skin color.<eos> It was about right and wrong.<eos> So you are testifying under oath that Deputy Beck never felt isolated, never felt outcast?
And II attempted to follow his orders.<eos> And did you hear the young man screaming,<eos> "Somebody call my moms, somebody call my moms"?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And yet we are to believe that you were the one scared?
The falsified training records will be blamed on Breeland.<eos> It's time to move on, Mr. Terry.<eos> This is coming from the Deputy Supervisor.<eos> For whatever it's worth, I don't get inspired much anymore.<eos> You inspired me.
Rather than watching from the sidelines, we need to be active participants in the pursuit of justice.<eos> There needs to be more of us in the jury pool.<eos> In order for that to happen, we need to register to vote.<eos> We have our new friend Sarah Ellis who is here to help us organize that effort.<eos> Pastor, I'd register to vote if you go run for something.
I'm sure Jesse was a good kid.<eos> He was a great kid.<eos> Great kids can mess up, too.<eos> My son would never go for your gun.<eos> Just like you'd never shoot a cop?
- Doesn't matter... your boys are fine.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you I understand your pain.<eos> I don't.<eos> But you weren't there.
Will the governor show her support for them?<eos> 17-year-old Joey Campbell was murdered three weeks ago, and nothing.<eos> No investigation, no motorcade, no empathy.<eos> So I pose this question to her... what about Joey?<eos> You're the man from the Department of Justice.
- Why?<eos> - I didn't release it to the press.<eos> But if someone were to accidentally delete the data off his phone, I wouldn't be upset.<eos> What he said was a joke.<eos> I'm sure you've said one or two dumb-ass things in your life.
- All right.<eos> Yes Mr. Rosen, I'm aware we're in arrears.<eos> Good luck, cuz.<eos> We're good for the bill.<eos> We're expecting some cash coming in today, as a matter of fact and you're at the top of the pile.
That's all Mr. Wednesday needs...<eos> Just enough.<eos> Maybe just one.<eos> Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.
You two have very extravagant enemies.<eos> Lawyer?<eos> What's the ask?<eos> Oh, you got me curious.<eos> I'd like to know what you know.
I have to start with an apology.<eos> I've been remiss.<eos> I should have reached out to you ages ago.<eos> But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.<eos> You are huge.
You see?<eos> We're not here to fight.<eos> So you're offering a truce.<eos> A truce implies that we were ever at war.<eos> You might have been but I wasn't.
That's why they call me Mr. World.<eos> And if they don't agree?<eos> I get it.<eos> I do.<eos> You're an individualist.
Answer the riddle.<eos> Uh... I...<eos> Knowledge?<eos> Knowledge can't be shared, Professor? Really?<eos> You are the chair of a chemistry department.
Maybe he has sent us a clue.<eos> You're late.<eos> I expected this call seven minutes ago.<eos> This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.<eos> I know who you are, Mr. Fox.
Cause of death seems to be blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> However, Mr. Thirio also has a long incision along the right side of his abdomen that's been crudely stapled shut.<eos> The Chess Killer promised a clue inside the belly of the beast. Think there might be something in his stomach?<eos> Okay.<eos> You worked at Arkham Asylum.
The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> He hit us on purpose. But I think you know that because you paid for his lawyer.<eos> Still think we have nothing to talk about?<eos> If you have a question for me, son... why not go ahead and ask it?<eos> Did you order the hit on my father?
My enemies took everything from me.<eos> Tried to murder me.<eos> You help me get my revenge, and when I take back my throne, I will give you every resource you need to free yourself from this icy prison.<eos> Even if I wanted to say yes, I can only survive a few hours outside the cold without my suit.<eos> And you don't have it because it's been locked away in a Wayne Enterprises black site ever since you escaped Indian Hill.
But they're no match for me!<eos> We're both dead men.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.<eos> You underestimate me, Mr. James.
Then what?<eos> You're still angry with Bruce 'cause he never told you your mom was a wonky con artist?<eos> That boy has been loyal to you;<eos> He's been good;<eos> He's been a friend, and now he's in trouble you're not gonna lift a finger?
She had to die as well?<eos> Why is Bruce Wayne here?<eos> He has come to pass judgment.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> You are the leader of the Court.
I mean, I thought the man that I dispatched at Wayne Enterprises was the leader of the Court of Owls.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen, is it, mate?<eos> You can't get rid of me that easy.<eos> You have to remember who you are.
I know who I am.<eos> I have a destiny.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> That man that wanted you to detonate that bomb... whatever he promised you... freedom from pain, power... none of it, none of it was real.<eos> I want you to remember what is real.
You got to find your own path.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You've always been so sure of who you are.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> I've been through some very dark places, as have you.
Uh, no, you should stay here, um, with Detective West for a little bit.<eos> Why?<eos> That sketch artist was like freaking Michelangelo.<eos> - I mean, you've got your woman.<eos> - Not yet. And until we do, you could be in a lot of danger.
Miss Horton?<eos> - Mr. Allen...<eos> - Can I sit?<eos> Please, just...<eos> You are a crime scene investigator for the Central City police department, correct?
Excuse me?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm Jordan's girlfriend. Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm Jordan's mother.<eos> Jordan's parents are dead so I don't know who you are or what you want but you need to..
What if I told you that he caused seur parents' death?<eos> What?<eos> My parents were killed by a drunk driver.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because you... need an opportunity.
- You tricked me. - No, no, no.<eos> I just wanted to see what you would do if I gave you the opportunity.<eos> And you lived up to your potential.<eos> Oh, Stefan...<eos> You're... dead.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that Katherine won't let the ceremony get that far.<eos> Caroline and Bonnie are probably already rehearsing.<eos> You don't want to seem unprepared.<eos> Look... what happened to Enzo is gonna haunt you and her for the rest of your lives.<eos> But the you standing with me right now, the you that's gonna marry Caroline Forbes tomorrow, the you that I have known for almost 200 years... You didn't do it.
with some Vaseline and a car battery.<eos> - What?<eos> - That was a move I call,<eos> "Gentlemen, start your engines." It's bloody brilliant.<eos> Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?
Lucifer!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Captain Pickman, LAPD!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> You're a cop.
She's quite a good shot.<eos> You don't understand!<eos> I couldn't do what the man said. What man?<eos> The man said he would kill that kid if I didn't cut my face.<eos> Mr. Johnny Kane, you're an amazing actor with an impressive library of films under your belt.
I didn't send that e-mail, and I didn't send this one either.<eos> - What other one?<eos> - This one, sent an hour ago.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Dr. Gwendolyn Scott. You're a world-renowned thoracic surgeon. Who's saved an awe-inspiring number of lives.
Do you?<eos> I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.<eos> What if I say pretty please?<eos> Apparently that's supposed to do something.<eos> Look, I understand that you have been... Are the goddess of all creation.
I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.<eos> What if I say pretty please?<eos> Apparently that's supposed to do something.<eos> Look, I understand that you have been... Are the goddess of all creation.<eos> You're very... tall.
Why, because you'd like to surrender?<eos> It's a bit anticlimactic, but very well, we accept.<eos> No, because now you get to see firsthand what I'm trying to prove.<eos> It's over, Professor.<eos> Afraid you're wrong about that.
Afraid you're wrong about that.<eos> Acrylic glass, Detective.<eos> Please don't kill yourself with your own bullet.<eos> We wouldn't be able to conduct the final part of this experiment.<eos> Time for you to make a choice.
Time for you to make a choice.<eos> In this vial, an antidote that will save Benji's life.<eos> In vial numero dos, poisonous gas that will kill you if you enter the room.<eos> Simple, really...<eos> You decide what's more important.
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.<eos> Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.<eos> This is the craziest plan I've ever heard.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Doctor, surely you have some sensible advice.
Grass?<eos> Can you tell Juanita bring some more wine and peach cobbler, please?<eos> Juanita, get her something.<eos> Hold on, hold on, what...<eos> Who are you, and why are you in my house?
Please.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I think it's terrible that your child was taken.<eos> Please.<eos> You are so much better than the company you keep.
We know you like crack, but we ain't gonna get into it.<eos> Hey, Cookie!<eos> Fraudulent reporting, money laundering, consorting with criminals?<eos> This is really bad.<eos> You have seven kids?
It's all right.<eos> She doesn't need to calm down.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is very stressful.<eos> Yeah, I'm stressed and the last thing you should be doing is telling me how stressed I am.
- It's rude.<eos> - Ma.<eos> Mom, let's-let's just go.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me my stuff, boy. Look, I know you some kind of special nurse and all of that, but it's been three months and he still look like a vegetable, so maybe you ain't so damn special.
Is what true?<eos> Lily sunder's daughter, was she human?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> She did.<eos> Said you were pretty obsessed.
I said no.<eos> Hayden needs her rest.<eos> Good morning.<eos> And how is our patient today?<eos> I'm sorry. Who are you?
But we're safe in here.<eos> Reinforced steel.<eos> Nothing's gettin' through this sucker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you're here about Sara.
Making some progress.<eos> Come in, Mr. rawlings.<eos> You are aware that lady bevell feels that they are hopeless.<eos> I'm the one cleaning up her mess.<eos> Dr. hess, last I heard, you and the rest of the leadership felt getting the winchesters was key to bringing the American hunters on board.
You all right?<eos> Yeah. Always.<eos> Got any vodka?<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be Kelly. And you're her...
Don't!<eos> Don't.<eos> Listen, Dean...<eos> It's Sam.<eos> And you must be hess, I trust.
Just the same stuff we always argue about.<eos> Erm... the way he runs the shop, my wife's shift patterns, the refugee crisis.<eos> Yeah, mostly shift patterns.<eos> He's, erm... a knob.<eos> And how long have you and Cath been married?
Can we just focus on the ex-husband?<eos> We're investigating a serious sexual assault that took place at Axehampton House on Saturday night.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> What, at... at Cath Atwood's party?<eos> You were there, we understand.
So how did the argument end?<eos> I went back inside.<eos> And you didn't see her for the rest of the night?<eos> No.<eos> So people would attest that you were in the main house until late on?
How are you doing, all right? Me?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm sleeping in my daughter's box room while she works herself to death. Yeah.<eos> It's the retirement I always dreamed of.<eos> You must still be grieving yourself.
He has that crappy little garage, which, by the way, is going down the shitter, but he behaves like he's royalty.<eos> He was having a little dig, and I'd had enough.<eos> So I went over and I offered him out and it all got a bit lairy.<eos> But sometimes you have to draw the line.<eos> And his wife's 50th was the moment you chose?
So that camera was in operation on the night of the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've put all the footage on here.<eos> It'll show whoever came in or out, this way at least.<eos> You weren't here yourself that night? No.
You called her mobile, no reply.<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you go looking for her?<eos> No.<eos> You stayed in the car park at Axehampton, with your light on, you ferried people back and forth.
Sam and Sophie Potter. That's probably it.<eos> Why are you lying to us, Lucas?<eos> Sorry?<eos> We called all those people.<eos> You didn't take any of them.
Grateful.<eos> What address did you take him to?<eos> Top of the hill in Lyme, a street on the right.<eos> He directed me.<eos> But you'd be able to take us back to that street if we asked you?
Are you married, Lucas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Trish told us that you two have been out for a drink.<eos> A date.<eos> You said you only knew her through work.
Well, he sounds like a delight. Can't wait to meet him.<eos> DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police. Looking for Aaron?<eos> Can't leave him alone, can you?<eos> Yeah, I read the report. Wondered if you'd pitch up here.<eos> You're on the register. We'd be remiss not to rule you out.
Did you look at the details of my case?<eos> Fussy about age, are you?<eos> You don't need to hear this.<eos> I've served my sentence. I'm entitled to a fresh start.<eos> No, you're out on parole, which means you're still doing your time.
What time did people start arriving?<eos> About 7:30 - which was annoying, actually, because it said 8:00.<eos> I mean, who turns up early to a thing like that?<eos> It's not like it's at someone's house, is it?<eos> And where were you when people arrived?
On the morning of your wife's birthday.<eos> She was at work.<eos> Um, early shift.<eos> Right.<eos> Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?
Either way.<eos> We've checked the CCTV. Your car didn't go that route in either direction, any time between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon.<eos> You must've missed me.<eos> We're pretty thorough.<eos> You said there were other men fishing off the beach on Saturday.
And was it Laura Benson in charge of their IT contract?<eos> No.<eos> It was a bloke.<eos> Terry somebody.<eos> You didn't have anything to do with Laura Benson?
- Don't call it that.<eos> - These aren't romantic photos.<eos> - They're obsessional ones. - You're wrong.<eos> You just want to turn it into something it's not.<eos> I think that's what you wanna do.
I'm not obsessed!<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> You're basically an obsessive loser with a short fuse, aren't you, Ed?<eos> That's why you attacked Jim Atwood, isn't it?<eos> 'Cause he got a taste of what you've never managed.
Message from Trish Winterman.<eos> Mr Winterman.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I was just about to lock up, actually.<eos> Have you got your wife's laptop? Yes.
- How old was she?<eos> Dunno. 19, 20.<eos> Where did you have sex with her?<eos> In the woods. Up against a tree.<eos> Don't you look at me like that. Cos you'd have done the same, if it was offered to you.
Have you used them?<eos> Let yourself into someone's house?<eos> I'm not that sort of man.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I think you are.
No, we weren't aware of that. What time was that?<eos> 10ish, I suppose.<eos> She told him to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you keep coming for me when he's out there. Hm.<eos> You weren't there at that time.
10ish, I suppose.<eos> She told him to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you keep coming for me when he's out there. Hm.<eos> You weren't there at that time.<eos> According to the statement you gave us, you were on the road to Lyme with a passenger.
Were you on your own when you saw Trish and Jim arguing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Were you on your own for the rest of the evening?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you have no alibi, who can confirm where you were when the rape was taking place?
So we believe that was used to gag her while she was raped.<eos> And when we tested it, it came back as a match with your DNA.<eos> It...<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> - We know you and Trish previously went for a drink and she knocked you back.
And when we tested it, it came back as a match with your DNA.<eos> It...<eos> - It's not mine.<eos> - We know you and Trish previously went for a drink and she knocked you back.<eos> You have a set of her house keys.
- It's not mine.<eos> - We know you and Trish previously went for a drink and she knocked you back.<eos> You have a set of her house keys.<eos> You don't now have an alibi for the time of the attack and your DNA is on that sock.<eos> So we need your explanation as to how this all makes sense if you didn't rape Trish Winterman.
Right, come on.<eos> Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.<eos> That bag wasn't there.<eos> You want us to believe you see a suspicious bag inside one of your sheds, pick it up, leaving your fingerprints and DNA. Scratch around inside.
I've listened to every word.<eos> Watched your reactions.<eos> I've studied your body language.<eos> I think there is still something that you are not telling us.<eos> I don't think you've been a hundred percent honest with us.
And then later that night, around 1am, all three were triangulated together in the same place.<eos> These three phones, these three people all together.<eos> - Don't make me do this.<eos> - Make you?<eos> You have a moral duty and a legal duty to tell us the truth!
- Don't make me do this.<eos> - Make you?<eos> You have a moral duty and a legal duty to tell us the truth!<eos> A woman was raped that night!<eos> Two others that we know of were raped before and you won't tell us what you know?
Some of the stuff wasn't her bag.<eos> Why Trish Winterman at Axehampton?<eos> It just happened.<eos> She was there.<eos> You were ready.
It's the trolley problem.<eos> I'm gonna take a half a point off.<eos> I just said truck.<eos> It's-<eos> - You're up first.
you're running for governor.<eos> First, I just want to offer my condolences.<eos> What happened to your son was a hate crime.<eos> He did not deserve to die at the hands of a racist cop.<eos> You didn't even know my son.
But we could have met in a more private place.<eos> What do you really want?<eos> To serve.<eos> What else?<eos> I want you, Governor Eamons, to serve as well.
Trust me, your nice new neighbors ain't gonna like that.<eos> - Damn, you came up real good, sis.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Joey Campbell's murderer.<eos> You were there that night.
Yes? What is this about?<eos> The governor has asked that we leave no stone unturned in your son's case.<eos> So if there's anything else you might want to share...<eos> No, sir, there's nothing.<eos> You don't have to be scared of me.
This correctional facility will bring thousands of jobs to this state.<eos> This is Shawn, my youngest.<eos> Thank you for coming to visit us, Governor.<eos> What do you really want?<eos> I want you, Governor Eamons, to serve as well.
Is that the environment we want our kids to learn in?<eos> Ma'am, you won't need a metal detector; You'll need an open mind.<eos> - With all due respect... - No, no, hold on a second.<eos> I'm a parent, too.<eos> I want what's best for my daughter, same as you want what's best for your child.
- With all due respect... - No, no, hold on a second.<eos> I'm a parent, too.<eos> I want what's best for my daughter, same as you want what's best for your child.<eos> That's the same thing the West Gate parents want.<eos> Governor, I will gladly go along with your plan to bring kids in from the Houses if you're willing to send your own teenage daughter to a school near the Houses.
How would you describe your relationship with Breeland?<eos> He's my commanding officer.<eos> He's had three complaints filed over the last year.<eos> What exactly do you want to know?<eos> We want to know if you think he's dirty. No.
Without his money, it doesn't happen.<eos> Is there any other way to make the guarantee?<eos> Yeah, pull from our overcrowded state jails instead of granting early releases.<eos> What's your opinion?<eos> I think you believe that better schools will reduce the need for more prisons.
You think I won't talk about what's been going on here?<eos> Who's gonna testify on your behalf when the DOJ presents your case?<eos> You need to remember who your friends are.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You hate being asked, "How are you?" much as I do?
Do you believe our boys are up there watching all this?<eos> That was rough, I know.<eos> But we're national now.<eos> This kind of coverage will create so much pressure, soon enough they'll have to make an arrest.<eos> You don't have to do any of this.
But how is it a DOJ case?<eos> We're investigating potential corruption within the Gate Station Sheriff's Office.<eos> And how is my friend Dr. Koppell involved in any of this?<eos> We're still investigating, Governor.<eos> You're still here because I told Deputy Chief Carroll I had confidence in you.
If anything, they're just endangering this initiative.<eos> The fact that it's funding poor black schools is a slap in the face.<eos> You make deals in order to make progress.<eos> That's the difference between you and me.<eos> What you see as progress, I see as compromise.
Not while destroying everything in your path.<eos> You are guests in my house.<eos> These are my people, you understand me?<eos> If your people were doing their jobs, we wouldn't be here doing ours.<eos> You ready to do your job, Sheriff?
How long is "some time"?<eos> Two months.<eos> Fortunate timing.<eos> Why?<eos> It means you weren't there the night Joey Campbell was killed.
It's off the record.<eos> Nothing's ever off the record.<eos> I had nothing to do with your suspension.<eos> All I ever wanted, all I want, is the truth.<eos> Well, the truth is you wouldn't be here if I shot a black kid. No one would.
Incredibly dangerous work.<eos> I applaud you both for your courage and service.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Mr. Cano, you're still with the DEA, but you no longer work in the field.
I'm placing you on administrative leave with pay until this is resolved.<eos> Your mother and I, we're taking a loan against the house.<eos> We're gonna have enough to cover your legal fees.<eos> Joey Campbell's murderer...<eos> you were there that night.
It's all here if you want to see it.<eos> The word is your case is hanging on an eyewitness.<eos> If I were you, I'd take a hard look at them.<eos> People will say whatever the dollar or the pastor calls for.<eos> And you just wanted to look out for me.
If I were you, I'd take a hard look at them.<eos> People will say whatever the dollar or the pastor calls for.<eos> And you just wanted to look out for me.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're destroying my town and my best friend's life.
I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant for this to happen.<eos> I just wanted to help.<eos> The Department of Justice is pulling me from this investigation.<eos> Looks like you bleeding out, too.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> How can I help you? - Good, 'cause I ordered a pair of shoes that should have been delivered here this morning.<eos> Do you have the order number?<eos> Wait, hold on a second.<eos> Who the hell are you?
And how are you connected to the drug dealer?<eos> I have no connections to drug dealers outside of getting them the hell out of my community.<eos> By any means necessary?<eos> Anything else?<eos> Did you give Cory a story about Arlen Cox shooting Joey Campbell?
Were you?<eos> Whoa, Coach B, I would never come at Tess like that.<eos> Y'all are like family.<eos> We were just watching your video on YouTube.<eos> You're a hero.
It was created to control us.<eos> They are trying to control me.<eos> Witnesses heard you threaten Joey Campbell.<eos> His mama didn't have no problem with me getting in his face when he was messing up.<eos> Did she know you and The Hands got physical with him?
- I don't.<eos> Someone broke into our work space, sucker-punched me, and I'm still mad about it.<eos> They were after a video we recovered from Jesse's phone.<eos> He recorded your stop.<eos> They're afraid that if you go down, you're gonna take the entire department with you.
And you have the names of people involved?<eos> Names, dates, everything.<eos> There may have only been one shooter, but Joey's blood is on a lot of hands.<eos> If this is true, my heart will be broken and I can promise you, I will make sure those responsible are held accountable.<eos> You fight dirty.
Because I reported exactly what I found.<eos> So you're saying Beck's the one who planted it.<eos> I did not say that.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're too good a soldier.
I'm listening.<eos> House arrest.<eos> Disciplinary action within the department is something we'd consider.<eos> - But no jail time.<eos> - Two boys were killed. You got a hand in it and you expect to walk?
And for your son and for not receiving the respect you deserve.<eos> We're sick of you!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> - We don't need you here!<eos> - You're a crooked cop!
- It is another to listen to the advice of a consultant.<eos> And in my important actual consulting expertise business, the phrase "closest living relative" can mean only one thing...<eos> "whoever lives nearby."<eos> Really?<eos> You think so?
Yes, as one legal scholar to another?<eos> "The only nuptial requirements are a statement of active acquiescence by both participants, utilizing in loco parentis if necessary, and the signing of an explanatory document in the bride's own hand."<eos> Does that mean what I think it means?<eos> Well, I suppose it depends upon what you think it means.<eos> It means you're going to be a star.
Well, I suppose it depends upon what you think it means.<eos> It means you're going to be a star.<eos> Count Olaf!<eos> Please, call me your guardian actor.<eos> Justice Strauss, you are about to find your drab, legal beagle existence transformed into something mind-blowing, and yet extremely classy, when you become the exciting new face of the next Count Olaf production.

Count Olaf!<eos> Please, call me your guardian actor.<eos> Justice Strauss, you are about to find your drab, legal beagle existence transformed into something mind-blowing, and yet extremely classy, when you become the exciting new face of the next Count Olaf production.<eos> [stammers] You mean...<eos> You have got the star quality necessary for a small walk-on role - in Al Funcoot's new play. - [gasps]
- The curtain rises.<eos> - Curtain?<eos> - The audience applauds.<eos> - Audience!<eos> And you walk onto stage, dressed as a judge.
I get to share the stage with Count Olaf?<eos> [chuckles] ...while a stunningly-costumed bride, played by Violet, stands beside me.<eos> You are so lucky, Violet.<eos> All my life I wanted to be a bride, but it seems all the men I meet are intimidated by my law degree, or obsessed with model trains.<eos> A gorgeous... bridal dress of my own design... while you perform the entire wedding ceremony, getting each and every word exactly right, while we sign a document which you shall bring from city hall for added realism.
- Literally.<eos> - I said literally.<eos> I'm afraid this marriage is entirely binding.<eos> Violet... you said "I do" and signed this paper in your own hand.<eos> Count Olaf, you are now Violet's legal husband.
And?<eos> And a vile and terrible person.<eos> A vile and terrible person who is in complete control of the Baudelaires' entire fortune.<eos> This is absolutely horrendous.<eos> I won't allow it! I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.
That moral argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.<eos> It was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.<eos> And I am happy to say that because Violet, who is right-handed, signed the document with her left hand, the marriage is invalid.<eos> Well, you may not be my wife, but you are still my daughter.<eos> Do you honestly believe I will allow you to continue to care for these three children after the treachery I've seen here tonight?
Mother and Father told us all sorts of stories that happened before we were born.<eos> So why doesn't the name Montgomery Montgomery ring a bell?<eos> [heavy accent] Good morning.<eos> I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon. And you're Count Olaf.
I am Stephano, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery's new assistant.<eos> It's afternoon. And you're Count Olaf.<eos> Perhaps one of you can take my suitcases up to my room.<eos> The ride along that smelly road was dull and unpleasant, and Stephano is very tired.<eos> You're Count Olaf, and if anyone ever deserved to travel along Lousy Lane, it's you.
Your father and mother were very brave in their days.<eos> But... [imitates explosion] Their days are done, Baudelaires.<eos> That is not a photo of our parents. Yes, it is.<eos> They're inside the piano.<eos> How do you know that?
- Well, I wouldn't say that. It was clearly the fault of the other driver.<eos> I never...<eos> I thought there were three of you.<eos> Ah, there's the baby.<eos> You're not Dr. Montgomery.
We've already been in a room with a dead body thanks to you.<eos> Oh, yes, thank you, Stephano, for that excellent point.<eos> I must say, you show genuine compassion for these children.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Perhaps I will wait out here with the children while you and Nurse Lucafont go in and examine the body.
That's Uncle Monty's food.<eos> Stop eating his food.<eos> I was only gonna have a few peaches.<eos> The children lost their uncle today.<eos> I'm sure you can understand.
I think it's part of a spyglass.<eos> It certainly is.<eos> I will get it back to you, Klaus Baudelaire.<eos> I promise.<eos> Who are you?
This makes us sound like baby killers.<eos> But you did kill civilians, didn't you?<eos> Women?<eos> Children?<eos> You weren't there!
It's public record.<eos> You know that I can't, uh...<eos> control what the press pushes out. No.<eos> Of course you can't.<eos> You just read announcements handed to you by the President.
So, rather than sit here and discuss all the ways I might die today,<eos> I'm gonna go pick an outfit now so that I can be done with that nonsense and focus on what's really important...<eos> Running the damn country.<eos> I've got David Rosen on the phone for you.<eos> He said you'd know what it was about.
Now I got bills just like you fellas.<eos> Now, remember, a customer's a customer.<eos> But you don't pay, you don't play.<eos> I'm gonna play.<eos> And you'll be glad I did.
Matter of fact, was even thinkin' about contributing' one of my pies.<eos> Well, perhaps you'd let me accompany you.<eos> I do love a good pie.<eos> Why, Earle, I'd be more than happy to break out my peaches for you.<eos> Miss Keisker, you are shameless.
You said Elvis and Bob Neal would be here.<eos> Unavoidably detained.<eos> And, uh, business is best left to businessmen.<eos> Wouldn't you agree?<eos> And what business are you in?
Wouldn't you agree?<eos> And what business are you in?<eos> There's only one thing standing between Elvis Presley and the success that he deserves, and that... is Sun Records.<eos> Well, considering he hadn't sung in no place outside his bedroom when I found him, how do you figure?<eos> You got no national distribution and you're on hold with at least one pressing plant for non-payment.
It's actually a pretty interesting town.<eos> Oh, okay, that flies in the face of everything I've ever heard... about St. Louis in particular and Missouri at large!<eos> What the hell do you know about it?<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old... Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.
I gave you a chance to raise this wonderful girl.<eos> If you love her, then... you love a little piece of me, too.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!
Yeah, I have an intruder on my property.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks for taking care of my baby.<eos> You... did an amazing job.
No, that's it.<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?<eos> Yes.<eos> You men are all alike.
♪ I'm the great pretender... ♪<eos> Check all the plates.<eos> Make sure that none of them are dirty, please.<eos> I don't want anybody coming here and eating on a dirty plate.<eos> They pick up a napkin, you pick up a napkin and then you have dirt under here like this. This one.
It's sleek, it's tight, it looks good, it feels good, it smells good.<eos> But a lot of upkeep. Yeah?<eos> Payments are murder and you gotta wax it, you gotta polish it, you gotta talk to it, you gotta listen to it, eh?<eos> And, most importantly, you gotta remain ever vigilant that nobody fucking jacks it, right?<eos> You don't have to worry about that 'cause you'll never get near anything like that.
And your ships will have the power to unleash my wrath across the universe!<eos> We are an alliance.<eos> We do not serve you!<eos> I have cleared a path through the mires provided you with subjects to modify.<eos> You boast of a once great empire.
Please, Ambassador Steele, we must all be united in this effort.<eos> We have to be proactive, not reactive.<eos> Do my ears deceive me?<eos> The Aresian empire the lunar council of the Ghost Nebula even the sentinel sisters.<eos> You are all actually afraid.
There must be more.<eos> And you and I, son...<eos> We will find it.<eos> Allow me then a moment to consider.<eos> You seek your creator.
That's gonna be a motherfucker to fly through.<eos> Yes, I'm afraid so.<eos> Communication will be spotty if the storm is electromagnetic.<eos> It will be safe to land?<eos> Depends on what you call safe.
I had never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland... or from any human.<eos> I loved her, of course.<eos> Much as you love Daniels.<eos> You know that's not possible.
You know where I can find John Constantine?<eos> - No.<eos> - You must have some idea.<eos> We don't keep in touch.<eos> I know you two have history, so I...
What do you think this does?<eos> I don't, I don't... Expose the truth.<eos> Nice.<eos> Some best friend you are. I'm sorry, is the person who's building a chemical weapon questioning my integrity in this scenario?<eos> I figured it was about time somebody cut through all the bullshit so we could see who people really were. I told you you couldn't trust her. And now all of a sudden you're, you're, you guys are BFFs?
Extraordinary.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> He was talking about me.<eos> Oops!<eos> Well, wherever you are... I'm just going to warm myself by the fire.
She hasn't told you, has she?<eos> Told me what?<eos> Where we're going.<eos> Somewhere quite. By the sea.<eos> You two go away a lot, then?
We don't have enough horses to plough the fields.<eos> Why is that, comrade?<eos> - We had to eat them!<eos> - That is why Comrade Stalin brought you tractors, modern mechanical means to meet your responsibilities.<eos> And you repay him by stealing from the state?
I hear that a lot.<eos> Then you probably hear this too.<eos> More than I like it.<eos> Then you know it really!<eos> On my count to three... and you're gonna start walking away.
I'll take you there.<eos> ..See for yourself.<eos> It's got a Fucking fantasy land.<eos> We understand the importance of containment, Dr. Rice.<eos> But You can not leave a war zone behind like you did in Juarez.
No, a therapist, and don't worry.<eos> He's not gonna push any pills on Danny. He'll be there to help him.<eos> Well, how's he gonna help him, Doctor?<eos> Look, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> Now, what I want you to do is to call me every day and let me know how Danny's doing, if he's eating.
I love surprises!<eos> Oh, this is perfect.<eos> Mother, daughter bonding time. Let's do it. Woo-woo!<eos> Bye!<eos> You boys have fun.
- Must feel very different...<eos> - Sorry, what?<eos> Yes, well, you know how it is.<eos> All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.<eos> - Are you two having a little joke?
What kind of a life would that be?<eos> Besides, I have the strangest feeling...<eos> Miss me?<eos> - That's mine.<eos> You two take a... bus.
How did she die?<eos> - Hypothermia.<eos> What?<eos> I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way...<eos> Will you two please keep it down?
Do it now! '<eos> I'm leaving this place.<eos> If no-one follows me, no-one dies.<eos> 'Lay down your weapon.'<eos> You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
I need to get permission first.<eos> No!<eos> He's gotta get permission first.<eos> But she's running away.<eos> Yes, you go in through here, then down this corridor, up the back stairs.
No!<eos> He's gotta get permission first.<eos> But she's running away.<eos> Yes, you go in through here, then down this corridor, up the back stairs.<eos> The administration building is locked tight, but you can get in through the power station.
Excellent.<eos> A deathly fear of injections.<eos> A fear so strong the patient would rather suffer... the illness than to allow its cure.<eos> This phobia has plagued us doctors for many years.<eos> You'll notice that the patient is gagged.
I spent my first full fucking day in that thing.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> There was a fire on this day in 1980.<eos> Now... now there's gonna be a bigger one.<eos> Unless I missed my guess, my uncle... no, my father is going to be pulling up and you smuggle me out in that box you've been carrying.
- Hey, come on.<eos> - Easy there.<eos> - Mr. Kontral?<eos> - Yes?<eos> It would now be appropriate for you to...
Super science.<eos> Super power.<eos> - So, you haven't a clue.<eos> - Not a one.<eos> You're the first woman on the moon, I believe.
- And I only speak for myself when I... - No!<eos> You speak for all of them.<eos> You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.<eos> You were born for this.<eos> You all waited.
Oh. Sorry, miss.<eos> Lieutenant Hank Marlow of the 45th.<eos> Put the old flight suit on for you.<eos> (MARLOW CHUCKLING)<eos> You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a beer at Wrigley Field on opening day.
(GUNS COCK)<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> (GASPING)<eos> Conrad, which way are we going?<eos> You three need to go back to the boat.
These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.<eos> Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.<eos> I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be corrupted.<eos> I'm going to share something with you now, something personal and of importance to me.<eos> I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.
Or close the wall up with our English dead!<eos> Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide! Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height!<eos> On!<eos> On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<eos> And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Well, there must have been some build-up, he didn't just suddenly do it.<eos> Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel!<eos> Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Well, I thought you two were...
That's awful!<eos> Bad news, baby!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> My job is to find out exactly what that new puppy is... so that Baby Corp can stop it.<eos> And you're going to help me.
My parents always hold my hand during takeoff.<eos> Boy, the stocks are crazy today.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.<eos> As you can see, I've switched off the seat belt sign.<eos> What are you two boys doing up here?
Why?<eos> My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.<eos> That's disgusting.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> You Earthers have hang-ups.
- Then we just go.<eos> - No!<eos> - He's our friend.<eos> - All any of you do... is yell at each other.<eos> You are not friends.
They didn't say that. Well, they don't have to.<eos> There's been a breach.<eos> Where? Quarantine.<eos> Word of warning, guys. These are the real deal.<eos> The boots are weighted for gravity compensation, as if you were from Mars returning to Earth.
This year, I travelled...<eos> - What's he saying?<eos> - Dunno.<eos> One of those 26 farms to decide who will be invited to the Best Super Pig Fest in New York City, where it will be unveiled to the world.<eos> You've done an incredible job.
Yeah, have a seat.<eos> Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "this is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.
I brush a few more.<eos> "Well, it's still a wall."<eos> But...<eos> What if I remove every single atom from this wall except for one?<eos> And you've seen me brush every single atom from this wall except for that one atom, and I point to it and I say,
I'll bring the coffee and the doughnuts.<eos> Okay, Deputy Chief Hawk.<eos> Dave?<eos> Don Harrison, State Police, Rapid City.<eos> Hmm, are you taking this case?
$25,000.<eos> That is my first, last, and only offer to you.<eos> What kind of world are we living in where people can behave like this?<eos> Treat other people this way without any compassion or feeling for their suffering?<eos> We are living in a dark, dark age, and you are part of the problem.
Over here. I don't want to be a downer, but how exactly are we going to get outta this place?<eos> Oh, leave that to me.<eos> Don't wanna jinx us, but I'll be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight.<eos> Going up, ma'am?<eos> No. You're going down!
Please take some flyers.<eos> invite your friends to take a class.<eos> We need more students here.<eos> also... Thursday nights will be closed for AA meetings.<eos> They pay more than you do.
They have her.<eos> Who has her?<eos> The Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.
But you must decide now.<eos> She's lying.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Danny Rand told me that you've had experience with the Hand.<eos> That you understand what they can do.
- Can Joy and I leave now?<eos> - No.<eos> Come, sit over here.<eos> You weren't really gonna have Dad killed, right?<eos> You poor people are such a mess.
It was wrong for me to leave the way that I did.<eos> I also need to complete my training.<eos> There's still so much I don't know about being an Iron Fist.<eos> look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.
I'm trying to write here.<eos> So, could you please... Shut the fuck up.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Hello.<eos> You must be the couple we spoke to over the phone.
Six to nine months and we'll be out of here.<eos> Jill: Do you mind me asking, why no one has taken it yet?<eos> It's just that the location and the house are amazing.<eos> Yes, my wife and I want the right person.<eos> We think you will be perfect, though. Don't we, Henry? Hmm.
Oh, you young ones are always having junk.<eos> Eat good food for a change.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's very kind of you both.<eos> Do you not say grace before eating?
Man after my own heart.<eos> For your baby.<eos> Yes.<eos> Winter's coming.<eos> I thought Jill was lying at first when she told me you had a newborn baby but that's the miracles of modern science.
My sister is bit of a wreck at the moment.<eos> Jason.<eos> Well, it's true, isn't it?<eos> We're trying to find out where Marcus may have gone, talking to everyone.<eos> I'm guessing you were the last people to see him?
But I kept him as a memento, seeing he likes joking so much.<eos> Thought he could keep you company, try and make you laugh.<eos> We prayed every night... and god gave us you.<eos> I know who you are!<eos> You don't own me!
Nobody owns me!<eos> The queen doesn't own me!<eos> I will shit on your face!<eos> Come out, I know who you both are!<eos> I know who you both are!
- So we're just gonna wait it out here?<eos> - You got a better plan?<eos> Is there a plan where I get my scarf back?<eos> I just need it till this is over.<eos> - What, do you two know each other?
He's retired.<eos> You know what?<eos> We are not talking about this, all right?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.
Madame Gao?<eos> She's one.<eos> She helped set up my parents' murder.<eos> She set up a lot of murders.<eos> Then there's Sowande, African warlord, gunrunner, you name it.
Do not underestimate me!<eos> Kill Luke Cage.<eos> Kill Jessica Jones.<eos> And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, whoever he is.<eos> I'm so happy you're all on board with the plan.
I was gonna ask you the same thing.<eos> Three of you wanna sit?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> We've had no luck identifying the bodies we found in the warehouse with you.<eos> And though you two have colorful histories, I have reminded the NYPD - we have no evidence...
- It's basic training.<eos> They taught us how to run from the bombs, not set 'em.<eos> So what you're saying is once someone activates the charge...<eos> That's it.<eos> You two put 'em in place.
- Neil, no more, okay?<eos> We really should be going.<eos> - Honey, you're the designated driver, remember?<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> - Maybe you two should just spend the night.
There's a girl... Mandy.<eos> Okay, she's here to stay, all right?<eos> And-and-and you guys have to take my lead because I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me - as me because I'm somebody else.<eos> - Are we us?<eos> Well, yeah, of course you are.
The snow's still falling.<eos> Keep warm.<eos> - Merry Christmas!<eos> Happy Christmas!<eos> I wanted you to wear it... to have it.
I'm sorry. You've been so good.<eos> He's leaving in the morning.<eos> It's excellent, Mr. Couch. Quite excellent.<eos> Everything's as we discussed.<eos> And you're quite determined that this is what you want to do, Master Ashley?
Were any of you down by the beach?<eos> When's din din?<eos> Me and Hank are starving!<eos> And this is my dear brother Henry.<eos> I believe you two have already met.
Isn't it?<eos> I've seen you looking at us.<eos> What?<eos> ! No I haven't.<eos> You two are going to be married tomorrow.
Ha!<eos> Not hungry?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I did nothing like that.<eos> - You all pretended to like me.
- Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go to the left.<eos> Go to the left.<eos> Hey, what the fuck are you two doing down there?
- Where are the horses?<eos> What, you were supposed to save the horses.<eos> You are in over your head.<eos> I suggest that you find a less expensive hobby and stop wasting my damn time!<eos> You have not failed.
We don't know.<eos> But...<eos> I tell you what, why don't we stick around back here for a little while.<eos> Let's watch how this whole thing plays out.<eos> I'll keep sweetening the situation as it calls for it, and you might as well stick around.
All right, this is nuts!<eos> This is crazy!<eos> I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity to have a working bar.<eos> To have a successful business together!<eos> Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day, the dumbest holiday that ever existed!
The lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth.<eos> But it's really hot.<eos> It is pointless and painful to resist.<eos> What is your mission?<eos> Whoever you are, you are in more danger than you think.
The war to end the all wars.<eos> Four years... 27 countries... 25 million dead Soldiers and civilians.<eos> Innocent people Women and children slaughtered.<eos> Their homes and thier villages looted burned.<eos> Weapons far deadlier than you can ever imagine.
It's unthinkable! Who is this woman?<eos> 722 00:59:14,686 -- 00:59:15,802 She is with me, she is with us.<eos> I'm not..<eos> I am not with you!<eos> You would knowingly sacrifice all those lives.
They fight alongside their soldiers.<eos> They die with them on the battlefield!<eos> That's enough!<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.
That's enough!<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> My apologies.<eos> You should be ashamed.
You were absent at the counsel meeting, General.<eos> I see you are negotiating the terms of the armistice without me.<eos> - On the Kaiser's behalf.<eos> - I'm on your insistence.<eos> We could easily win this war if only you had a little faith.
You said yourself, Steve.<eos> - Thank you. - Thank you.<eos> You did this.<eos> We did.<eos> Do you have dancing on Paradise Island?
- That's her, that's mother.<eos> She's got a lot of these laying around.<eos> - They're all of her.<eos> They always were.<eos> - You two could be sisters.
♪ Y'all dudes irrelevant Plus we gettin' bank ♪ ♪ So, we need lame-repellant ♪<eos> - ♪ Y'all still in the playground ♪<eos> - Fuck you doing?<eos> You feel me?<eos> ♪ Plus, we getting paid You might as well fade out ♪
I just want you to see us as, you know, equal partners.<eos> Since when is the MC equal to the DJ, Ra?<eos> We've always been a group.<eos> But I'm the conductor.<eos> You're the fucking instruments, - and y'all need to remember that shit.
Unlike you, Mr. Gunns.<eos> You know, I learned a lot from you.<eos> Just like you learned from Mr. Moses.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and, uh, for the record, you and him are a lot alike.
Shit always comes back around, especially with black folks.<eos> From Cab Calloway to Ali, to you, sugar.<eos> You ask for me, Ma?<eos> I asked for you both because...<eos> I want you to cut a record together.
Got some 411 for your uppity ass.<eos> Our music is a reality. Ain't no fucking dream.<eos> Your music is a joke!<eos> It's not even music, Shao.<eos> You fucking take songs, real songs, and you... you make noise over it and say a bunch of rhymes a ten-year-old can make up in their sleep.
And there will be no warning shots.<eos> You cliqued up with anyone? No.<eos> Why participate in the riot?<eos> You know why.<eos> You got your rules and we got the gang's rules.
What you tell Kutcher?<eos> Does Herman know you're a rat?<eos> Fucking stupid motherfucker!<eos> Herman's the one who tried to kill you, you fuck!<eos> No, you both did, or his crew wouldn't have known I was there.
There you go, juicy.<eos> Since we're, um, exploring our options-- and I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling ginnie's mom.<eos> Okay, but I was thinking-- all right.<eos> End of story. End of story.<eos> So why'd you and ginnie break up?
- Notarized.<eos> - Sworn affidavit by a Salvatore Lopez the graffiti artist that you hired to paint all over Lew the Jew's buildings so the Chinese would drop their offer and you could buy for less.<eos> So, we have a deal, right?<eos> Or am I gonna have to put your head through that fucking wall?<eos> There, there you go, fellas.
Mr. Delaney...<eos> I'll give you one last chance to behave like a loyal subject of His Majesty and the lawful crown of England.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Please.<eos> The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.
There is no us.<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading with slaves.
- Now I'm older-- - How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?
- They serve good hock to traitors.<eos> - Perhaps you'll be served the same.<eos> I understand you asked poor, sweet Godfrey...<eos> - to write an account, too.<eos> I assume you want to make some sort of a deal?
One living witness.<eos> In one hour, I will be interviewed by the King's private secretary, three attorneys and half a dozen clerks.<eos> They will want it in writing.<eos> Hmm?<eos> And at midday, Godfrey, poor, sweet Godfrey... he will deliver his own account to the Royal Commission, confirming how you concealed your ownership of this ship and its cargo... by committing treason.
Good boy.<eos> Wilton!<eos> Pettifer!<eos> Ah, fuck it!<eos> Gentlemen, there are things I need you to do.
Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.<eos> Delaney orders you shouldn't be harmed.<eos> There's still plenty of cocks left for you to suck.<eos> The agreement is that you take the ladies away in the coach and I walk back to the house and report that they were kidnapped.
No.<eos> You see, there's a letter which we will send to Solomon Coop, revealing that you titillate and intoxicate on behalf of the Americans.<eos> If I fail to return, it will be delivered by midday.<eos> James Delaney also says to tell Collonade that you do, indeed, have a leaky ship.<eos> But he's found the leak and will fix it, as long as you cooperate.
Oh, but it will!<eos> It always does.<eos> Delaney would not make a deal with you.<eos> The record will show that the EIC cooperated with your commission into the sinking of the Influence, fully and without reservation.<eos> You're an idealist.
Execution?<eos> Of Delaney.<eos> I told you to take care of it.<eos> It is taking a little longer than I anticipated.<eos> If you open up that ball of paper, you'll see notice of your dismissal from the East India, dated two days hence.
Well, you know, when someone wants a man killed, they come to Dolphin.<eos> What, still?<eos> My directory of knowledge covers every fucking thing from cradle to grave - birth, love, death, it all goes into the river of my book.<eos> When someone wants a man killed, they come to Atticus.<eos> Well, about a year ago, a gentleman comes in, sat right there where you are now, and says, "How about old Horace Delaney,"
What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.<eos> Winter, she's your daughter, isn't she?<eos> And that's why you don't rent her.
The shackles were all cast in London.<eos> The East India don't deal slaves.<eos> No, no, they don't.<eos> But they do run cloth and trade beads to Tangiers with the Scarfe family, and then slaves to Trinidad... from Bunce Island... through Spanish privateers.<eos> For one with such close connections, I am surprised that you don't know.
Who marched away?<eos> And thank God you did.<eos> God?<eos> This is very simple, James. Take away a little ancient history.<eos> You live in the East, I live in the West..
The assassin we sent to kill Delaney is dead.<eos> The British want you dead.<eos> I stitch you up and you give me information.
If you are in contact with the King, then you are already in grave danger.<eos> I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried.<eos> I am your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> You take the minutes and you log every meeting.
These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India<eos> - and they will free you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You must go with them now.
- Aye.<eos> How does she seem?<eos> The same.<eos> But then, she's an actress.<eos> You knew they were coming to take her, didn't you?
If your intervention had been ten minutes later, I would have been raped.<eos> But the consequence for you was worth the risk to me, yes?<eos> You see me as I am.<eos> All of those that I gather are damned. It's just part of a company policy of mine.<eos> Perhaps now you will understand why it is better for you to leave and let this business run its course.
I've passed a test.<eos> No.<eos> I will join the League of the Damned.<eos> A group of people who are drawn together, with a willingness to do exactly as I say.<eos> We are the ships, you are the river.
Fuck him!<eos> You woke me.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Your coat's all wet.<eos> And you're wet, too.
Where he leads, I will follow.<eos> Where the fuck are we?<eos> My new factory.<eos> I flagged him down at St Pancras. I told him two shillings.<eos> I guessed you'd pay.
The lady asked me to wake her because she had a costume fitting.<eos> I guessed you wouldn't want her going out.<eos> No, the lady is free to come and go as she pleases.<eos> The Crown will protect her from the Company. And the Company will protect her from the Crown.<eos> And you are the joint in the seesaw.
- Aye, sir.<eos> The Americans.<eos> Wanting a place on the seesaw.<eos> Well, it is an invitation for two.<eos> Do you dance?
There's other business afoot tonight, none of which concerns you.<eos> Miss Lorna Bow.<eos> Mrs. Lorna Delaney. And Mr. James Delaney.<eos> Judging by the horror on the faces of the ladies, you are known.<eos> Yes, and judging by the shame on the face of some of the men, so are you.
Because my husband was invited.<eos> He has business of theirs in Berlin.<eos> But it is a bit unexpected, isn't it?<eos> It's unusual.<eos> I knew that when you saw me, you would come to me and I realise that is how it always is.
Why's he here?<eos> Is it him?<eos> You should get away.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> You fu... you fucked her!
The Company can cause me a lot of difficulties, but only the King can have me hanged.<eos> The Crown will choose to make a deal.<eos> So I will not hang.<eos> Look, I'm very happy to admit that I don't want James Delaney to die.<eos> But can you also admit that you don't want James Delaney to die?
So, if a Company man comes calling, they have no legal jurisdiction.<eos> So you get word to me.<eos> And I will deal with it.<eos> In my way.<eos> And in return... you choose.
We need to shake the impasse.<eos> Why do you always look down your nose at my plans?<eos> I'm not.<eos> We should prosecute over the lost saltpetre.<eos> You are jealous of the little Scotsman.
Against your people.<eos> Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?
Those bastards at the palace have opened a royal commission into the sinking of The Influence.<eos> The-The-The Influence? Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.
Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.<eos> You and the Africa Desk.?<eos> A commission is not the King, so they can't subpoena, so you will deal with it and treat them with disbelief.
She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Of who they say you are.
A cat in the middle of the desert, with no nose.<eos> But what-- what an extraordinary achievement, gentlemen.<eos> When you think that the pyramids and the great Valley Of The Kings and the Sphinx were all manufactured by men with skin almost as dark as my own.<eos> It almost defies all your-- Our current views of nature.<eos> You are very well travelled, sir.
I do.<eos> And yet you're a rationalist.<eos> What kind of rational man believes in justice?<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.<eos> Mr. Delaney... I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.
And yet you're a rationalist.<eos> What kind of rational man believes in justice?<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804.<eos> Mr. Delaney... I have strong reason to believe that you were aboard the ship the night it sank.<eos> An example of the kind of nail you used... to nail down the hold of the East India Company ship, the Cornwallis, when she ran aground... in July 1804.
I have done much worse things than... stealing diamonds.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know this, too.<eos> What do you want?<eos> As far as I can ascertain... you are the only surviving member of the crew of the Cornwallis.
- Who, for God's sake?<eos> So, when the carpenter comes, tell him I want all the windows boarded up and that river hatch, I want that closed too.<eos> So... we are besieged.<eos> I suppose I can use the same carpenter to board up the windows that your father used when he was under siege and he can put the same old nails in the same old holes.<eos> You can sit there with the same old gun cocked on your lap.
and at the moment one only has to say "the Company" with a certain degree of disgust to get his undivided attention.<eos> Forget India.<eos> Tell him to put India to one side.<eos> The King will not move on India.<eos> The Regent does what you and your coven say.
The Regent does what you and your coven say.<eos> You seriously underestimate him.<eos> I underestimated Delaney.<eos> Look at this.<eos> - You have 104 spies in London... and we have 202.
I just know everything. Always assume I just know.<eos> Then you know we have a problem that cannot be solved with a musket or a knife.<eos> You have a problem, the King really does not.<eos> I received a letter from Delaney this morning.<eos> I suppose you would call it a pincer movement.
Miss Bow, do you know why there are boards on the windows of this house?<eos> So the fortunate people outside can't see inside of the state of this place, I imagine.<eos> No, because there are wicked men out there who would wish me dead.<eos> However, neither the East India or the King will kill you because of your will.<eos> The only people who would benefit from your death are the Americans, but you're already in negotiations with the Americans, so surely once the boards have gone we could put curtains up.
- Thanks, babe.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Hey, girl.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You two talk business. We'll move somewhere else.
- I do.<eos> I'm going to have the baby.<eos> - We'll do it.<eos> - Together.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us. II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.<eos> She needed help to get out.<eos> So you and your friends should stay vigilant.
In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.<eos> Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.<eos> When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.<eos> These guys are what are called insurgents.<eos> Basically, they're just guys who picked up weapons 'cause... so would you, if someone invaded your country.
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.<eos> I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.<eos> Those boys, they need me.<eos> I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.<eos> But you boys are at the coal face.
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.<eos> Let's say the two insurgents you just killed... each had six friends or brothers or some such, who are hovering on the brink of joining the insurgency.<eos> They're thinking about this insurgency thing.<eos> Looks interesting. But, you know, for one reason or other, not for me.<eos> But... So, then you go and kill their friend.
Go in.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen up.<eos> We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.<eos> Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
Look, if... if you cut the bit with the boat, it's all exposition.<eos> The boat bit's the only funny part of the scene.<eos> Hope we're not keeping things in just because they're funny.<eos> In... the comedy.<eos> Oh, you two are so old-school.
Hi, see...<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> It seems like we have a chance to get out of here at a reasonable hour tonight, for once.<eos> I say, we grab it.<eos> Just because you two have some kind of plans.
♪ She won't join your clubs ♪<eos> ♪ She won't dance In your halls ♪<eos> ♪ She won't help The hungry once a month ♪<eos> ♪ At your tombolas ♪<eos> ♪ She'll simply take control As you disappear ♪
If we get caught stealing school supplies, it's a great idea.<eos> Okay, now.<eos> Can't we just buy a lightning rod?<eos> Sure, if you've got $2500.<eos> What are you doing here?
Send him back.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I can help.<eos> I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> I also know about things I'm betting you don't.
He said you were getting an apartment together?<eos> And I remember saying something to Stiles.<eos> Something like it's not always a good idea to live with your friends.<eos> Even your best friend.<eos> But Stiles said it wouldn't matter because you weren't just friends.
Stiles?<eos> Lydia...<eos> Where is he?<eos> It was working.<eos> You saw him, right?
Independent contractors.<eos> Artisans, really.<eos> The best con men in the business.<eos> Which is why I can't trust you.<eos> I mean, would you trust you if you were in my position?
Well, actually, I was...<eos> Tommy's in between jobs at the moment, And I'm trying to convince him, stay in l.A. And work for me.<eos> You are?<eos> You are? -<eos> So, you two are close, then?
Total access.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think that...<eos> What I think doesn't matter.<eos> You boys are pros.
- I hired him.<eos> You what?<eos> He's a paid assassin.<eos> Yes, and now I pay him.<eos> The question is what are you two doing here?
So I get the B-team now, is that it?<eos> For your information, I've been doing this longer than Alice has.<eos> Come in, B-team.<eos> Val said you had a lead?<eos> I have The Hammer, and you will have his full cooperation.
Say my name.<eos> This doesn't mean that I don't hate you. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Now that we're alone, who are you two?
_<eos> But Stacey, we're looking at a severe weather warning.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Until about 11:00 p.m.<eos> Until 11:00 tonight, and, of course, you all remember that awful tornado that swept through...
Toto.<eos> No!<eos> Go.<eos> Who's up there?<eos> Uh, I think it's time for you and the Wizard's Guard to leave.
You wear the elements.<eos> My Mistress' gauntlets.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Are you my new Mistress?
Dorothy?<eos> My name is Frank Morgan.<eos> You think my mother christened me the Wizard of Oz?<eos> I was a man before I was a wizard.<eos> You harness lightning and control Giants.
Just like the Eternal Warrior, The Beast knows everything.<eos> Well, you also thought that it would snow during sun season.<eos> Snow.<eos> Will that be all, Anna?<eos> I don't think you ever controlled the Giants.
Child, show some respect.<eos> I believe Anna has misread...<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> No, my signs are clear.<eos> My dear Wizard... it seems you have an abundance of expert council.
Charcoal, saltpeter, and brimstone.<eos> It can pierce hardened steel.<eos> It's called a bullet.<eos> With your infrastructure, you can produce thousands of these and the guns that fire them.<eos> You take half to fortify your defenses, and I take half to defeat The Beast Forever.
What did you think Glinda would do?<eos> You imprisoned every witch who practiced magic and repressed the ones who didn't.<eos> And now they're going to take Emerald City from you!<eos> They are going to take Oz from you with the very elements you outlawed!<eos> And whose side will you be on?
I won't help either of you repeat the past.<eos> Glinda hid your mother from you.<eos> Yes.<eos> She built an army of witches on secrets and lies.<eos> Do you have a family?
- Liar!<eos> - You're a fraud!<eos> You promised to protect her!<eos> You should have secured her when you had the chance.<eos> I had her, and then you scared her with that cage.
The Princess...<eos> Ozma.<eos> The Witch of the East is dead.<eos> A witch's spells are her own.<eos> Normally, East would have had an apprentice, but you put an end to all that, didn't you?
Will I be able to turn myself back into a boy?<eos> If this works, you can turn yourself into a tomato for all I care.<eos> If?<eos> No one's ever done this before.<eos> But if something happens, you can help, right?
And though exposed, it is of my own choosing.<eos> Tell them to put down their guns and join us.<eos> Tell them or you die.<eos> Then you get nothing.<eos> Why don't you try and convince them?
- So is she!<eos> Jack!<eos> Because we are fair, you will hear the charges against you before you are sentenced.<eos> More than your apostate of a sister did for us.<eos> You and your cardinal sisters are to blame for the end of our kind.
Now he does.<eos> You think I'm talking of love?<eos> Love means nothing compared to survival.<eos> Then go back north.<eos> If you do, The Wizard will have no reason to fight you, and you and all of your girls can live in peace.
I heard the same.<eos> Here I must be careful.<eos> I have well over 200 men unaccounted for.<eos> Those who remain, it will be very hard to explain to them why, with all I have to attend to, I choose to stand here hanging onto the fate of just one of them.<eos> I know that you and he had been working closely together of late, become friends even.
They're savages.<eos> You Americans and Europeans, whether you come here to help or to fight or to make a profit, you'll never be anything but insignificant.<eos> We don't pretend to be anything else.<eos> When your countries were still swamp and forests, culture had already lit up our lands for thousands of years.<eos> And when you're nothing but history, collapsed into darkness like Rome, like Greece, we'll still be here.
- Harry.<eos> Here you are.<eos> Got those off the guards.<eos> It's criminal, what they're charging.<eos> You two, er, sorting out your differences?
So the Germans could come barging in at any time?<eos> Even they seem to know that would be a little... provocative.<eos> Here we are.<eos> This is Dan Hapkiss, special attache.<eos> I know who you two are.
I'm gonna skip that part.<eos> - What? - Teenagers aren't that bad.<eos> In fact, once you're a teenager, you will only wanna hang out with other teenagers.<eos> You'll think all grownups are bad.<eos> Teenagers think you're bad?
Mountbatten sahib is a heroic man.<eos> He freed Burma.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Now he has come to free India.<eos> You think you Indians are ready to run your own civil service?
I think it's a very daring idea.<eos> Daring, yes, but feasible?<eos> Jinnah's not a fool, Dickie.<eos> He knows that you can't place 300 million Hindus under the rule of the Muslim League.<eos> But if you leaders give him your support?
We are the flow.<eos> What you offer is existential crisis aversion.<eos> Don't look over there, look over here.<eos> Don't listen to that, listen to this.<eos> You provide a product, an innovative distraction and you keep innovating it and you keep providing it.
- Now you go.<eos> - Now you go.<eos> - Yeah, now you go!<eos> - You go now! - Yes, come on, go now!<eos> No, I want you to go.
Let me tell you a story.<eos> "Once upon a time, a man got fucked."<eos> Now, how is that for a story?<eos> 'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.
'Cause that's the story of black people in America.<eos> Shit, you all don't know you black yet.<eos> You think you just people.<eos> Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black.<eos> The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...
Shining a light on the dark corners of the universe.<eos> And now it's exploring what comes after this life.<eos> Seeing what's next.<eos> How old are you?<eos> You are all part of the same thing.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.<eos> - You got to see your mom again.<eos> - I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.
Hey, you're amazing.<eos> Do you want to be on our judo team?<eos> They'd all make fun of me.<eos> They wouldn't dare.<eos> Would you make fun of her?
Homework.<eos> We've got a project.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> The old project trope.<eos> The only class you two have together is gym.
You're calling me a pussy, after what you did, or didn't do?<eos> - Fuck you. - Fuck you.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Whatever happens to us happens to you too.<eos> If I kill myself, you die too?
- Just relax, we will fix it later.<eos> - Could be the mystic energy here.<eos> Ghosts and electronics don't mix.<eos> I'm up here.<eos> - You're all down there, too.
But first...<eos> - All electronics go in here;<eos> No phones allowed.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - We want you to enjoy the experience, not be chatting on Facebook and posting pictures you just took.
We need you.<eos> Just checking.<eos> No! No way in hell.<eos> That was not the deal.<eos> You people swore you could take the Saviors out. And you failed.
Null and void.<eos> We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends. And we never met.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I owe you nothing.<eos> In fact, you owe me for taking in the refugees, at great personal risk.
- Yes.<eos> - Do you think we can win, that we really could beat them?<eos> Us?<eos> I do.<eos> Well, Enid says you could show us the way.
I'm Rick.<eos> We own your lives.<eos> You want to buy them back?<eos> Have anything?<eos> Well, you have one of my people.
The boat things you took got taken.<eos> Saw them, so we took the rest.<eos> And we took him.<eos> Well, then you know we have nothing to buy back our lives with.<eos> That's what you'll have soon...
You see, I have a lot of free labor here at the fence... living dead pricks that help keep the riffraff out.<eos> Problem is, they don't keep. They fall apart.<eos> Like that poor sack of... pile of shit there.<eos> So, Dr. Smarty-pants, how do we keep them on their feet?<eos> You, um... smelt on the regs, correct?
Yet this, how we must exist now... It is mere luck we are not all insane.<eos> It isn't luck, Your Majesty.<eos> How's that?<eos> The world does drive people crazy now.<eos> But... you made us another world.
So let's get to it.<eos> Do you have today's offering?<eos> I want your guns, too.<eos> We did not agree to that.<eos> Well, you got a choice...
Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
We need your guns.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna fight The Saviors.<eos> You should join us. No.<eos> The Saviors killed your fathers, your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.
Three trucks probably.<eos> 20 Saviors and him.<eos> I can slow them down, bring some trees down in the road, buy a little time for you guys to get ready.<eos> If you can take them out, that's where we start.<eos> You kill them, I'll radio back to the Sanctuary.
The Sanctuary?<eos> Where Negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.<eos> You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
And we start once more for the fallen... for the Kingdom... for the glory of victory.<eos> What you fight for.<eos> Not the place...<eos> the people, each other.<eos> You're a part of that now.
He's one of yours.<eos> And after what he did...<eos> He stepped up.<eos> You people... are animals.<eos> Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
Stop!<eos> This is horrible!<eos> Just stick and move, Morty!<eos> Wear him out!<eos> How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?
Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.<eos> Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sum-sum, no.<eos> But you two were perfect for each other.
Hello, Vindicators.<eos> Welcome to your reckoning, baby!<eos> Welp, it's official.<eos> I had too much to drink last night.<eos> If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators.
Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.<eos> That's a three pointer.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You two make quite a team.
Or a wire transfer if you...<eos> Exactly just give us the digits.<eos> Investment.<eos> One more time?<eos> Well you called it a loan, it wasn't a loan, it was an investment.
And I might share it were it not for the soldier of mine found with his throat slit this morning... with a note attached... threatening that any further hanging of pirates would be met with more reprisals.<eos> A note attributed... to Long John Silver.<eos> I believe our current war is far from over.<eos> I believe there are yet still radicals amongst us eager to do us harm in the name of their pirate king.<eos> And I believe there is more you could be doing to aid us in ferreting out those radicals.
I lost six men tonight.<eos> The men I have left know this estate means supplies and full stomachs.<eos> They know they are stronger with it.<eos> And, thus, fewer of them will die in the weeks ahead than would without it.<eos> - And you want to walk away.
- It does.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> When the Governor returns, he will not stand for this.<eos> The Governor is not here.<eos> And you are now under an indictment that carries with it the penalty of death.
- It's great.<eos> - Nice windows.<eos> It's really open.<eos> The feng shui is all right.<eos> But more importantly, do you like it?
Well, that's that out of the way.<eos> Now, you may not see much of me for a couple of days, brutal nation states and all, but Yuri and Meemo will be here to make sure everything runs smoothly.<eos> And, oh, yes, condolences on your attorney.<eos> What makes it so tragic is how avoidable it was.<eos> But you understand, I can't have people out there investigating things.
Should I start, or...<eos> - Is she mine?<eos> - No, you got the other one.<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> St. Cloud Homicide's gonna handle this case, and you're both gonna go back to...
Uh, nothing.<eos> Just a misunderstanding.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> You remind me a little of my husband.<eos> You two would've gotten along really well.
Yes!<eos> And how about a big round of applause for our contestant for the rest of eternity... the Honorable Judge Pernell Harris!<eos> Doc, wake me up.<eos> Doc Olonari, wake me the fuck up.<eos> You're not real.
I don't think that any of us can ever truly know what was... what was going on inside PJ's mind right at that moment... especially you.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But can you tell me what you were thinking when you entered a vicious legal battle with your son's wife over the right to keep him on life support?<eos> We were, holding out hope that he might wake up.<eos> But despite every doctor telling you that was impossible, you still publicly attacked a rape victim for weeks before ultimately changing your mind?
My son dies. I lose my balance.<eos> Do you lift me up?<eos> No.<eos> You just kept pushing till a few more bucks fell out of my pocket and then another push and another!<eos> You think this guy is a preacher?
City controller is busting my stones on all the overtime hours logged last pay period.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, out there in radioland, you're listening to the best station in Stockton.<eos> Don't touch that dial.<eos> The station that makes you want to listen.
I got a letter from our landlord today.<eos> 60 day notice. Guess what. They can kiss my ass.<eos> This is our home.<eos> This is the home of truth. You know, that's why they don't want us here.<eos> They don't want us to tell the truth. But because you do... You want the truth.
I am in the business of making eagles, and you... what you are, my friend, is just a shit bird.<eos> We live in an age of instant gratification.<eos> We're like junkies chasing validation.<eos> And as soon as you get that hit, we go chasing after the next one.<eos> But once you get grounded in who you are, those results will start coming to you, and you won't be able to stop them.
He has.<eos> Last night.<eos> Not by me, but yes, he's up to speed.<eos> Rob's not going anywhere if that's what you're waiting for.<eos> You two broke bread on this subject already.
We have a vehicle on the way that will return you to the compound.<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> Under Chapter 18, United States Code 3056, it is illegal for you to deny protection, ma'am.<eos> I am not denying protection.<eos> You are free to escort me back to New York.
What matters now is that guy in there.<eos> Same as before. I want to talk to him.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Alone.<eos> You stay here.
It did until it stopped working.<eos> Didn't O'Keefe tell you anything?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> All right, look.<eos> So, these sock puppets you're missing, they're just a bunch of fake users with online lives that you manage, right?
She's a gold star mom.<eos> She's tough to argue with.<eos> I applied for a job.<eos> It's where Conlin called you from just before he was killed.<eos> So, these sock puppets they're just a bunch of fake users with online lives that you manage?
Maybe now they'll stop leaking to the fucking press.<eos> Not many people in that room voted for us, I'll give you that, but nobody in there was responsible for those leaks.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I've known them forever.<eos> Because, as corny as it sounds, what they care about most is their country, and because they hate the press more than you do.
In fact, never got a bird since I've been out here.<eos> Well, there's other things to enjoy.<eos> I enjoy looking at Lori often.<eos> I guess it's like my hobby.<eos> - Did you meet her?
- Yep.<eos> There they are.<eos> They're okay!<eos> They're okay.<eos> And there you have it, folks.
Because he's crazy, Kevin.<eos> But the President's okay, right?<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> The President's fine.<eos> And there you have it, folks. The President is just fine.
Sharon's over at the Cultural Center on Borland Circuit.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had my mail forwarded.<eos> I heard how helpful you were down here.
- Yes.<eos> - Is it here in this building?<eos> No, it's not here.<eos> I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have about the device, technical or otherwise.<eos> Why haven't you used it?
You don't care that somebody's been killed?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would you?<eos> All you care about is fucking each other and Frasier!
No!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> Hey! You people are sick!<eos> One of your people is out there murdered, floating in the water, and you're in here doing this!
I understand.<eos> You want to drown Kevin so that he can go to this place where the dead people are.<eos> And while he's there, he's going to learn a song from one of the dead people and he's gonna bring that song back to you so you can sing it and stop the biblical flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.<eos> That about covers it.<eos> And... and you've told all this to Kevin and he's actually considering it.
What?<eos> The volunteer is coming through the east entrance of this facility in 15 minutes.<eos> And how is he gonna make it through the security door?<eos> He's my identical twin brother.<eos> Well, it sounds like you two have really thought this through.
Ma'am.<eos> Again, please.<eos> Reload.<eos> I beg your pardon, my Lord, but she demanded that I relay what follows... her words precisely... in spite of any protest you offered.<eos> She says she knows that you will be angry and that this will be hard for you to understand...
I had a younger brother once.<eos> Simón.<eos> He was a midshipman aboard Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación.<eos> Beneath a flag of surrender, he was butchered.<eos> And I'm told... you likely wielded the sword... personally.
Well, you'll have to tell me about it.<eos> I'm going to an exercise class in a park tomorrow morning.<eos> You're not gonna do that.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm gonna get up at morning, or however you say it.
No.<eos> I always thought I could settle down in a place like this.<eos> Looks like a nice place, Ben.<eos> Then you should come. You should come.<eos> You should bring Nicole. You two could get a fresh start.
Look, I'm asking you to talk to him.<eos> And say what?<eos> I've never seen him like this before.<eos> That's 'cause he wasn't like this when you and Eric were around.<eos> Once you two bounced, everything changed.
About an hour ago, Jadalla Bin-Khalid launched a massive terrorist attack on New York City.<eos> And we know he's planning more.<eos> We also know that you've been in contact with him.<eos> And that you gave him the names of the Rangers who took out his father.<eos> Now I need you to tell me exactly how you two communicated.
Now I need you to tell me exactly how you two communicated.<eos> I have never been in communications with this... Jadalla person.<eos> I went through all of this at CTU.<eos> Well... this isn't CTU.<eos> Who the hell are you people?
If you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off somewhere else.<eos> In this story, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning, and very few happy things in the middle.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket.<eos> It is my solemn duty to bring to light the sorry history of the Baudelaire children as it happened so many years ago.<eos> But you in the audience have no such obligation, and I would advise all our viewers to turn away immediately and watch something more pleasant instead.
There's hardly a place to put down a baby.<eos> Sunny!<eos> We're leaving for rehearsals.<eos> But the baby said there was chocolate pudding! Shh.<eos> You children are to clean the table, and wash the dishes, and polish the silver, and rinse out all the wine bottles for recycling.
You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money. Hmm.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> You three lucky orphans are inheriting an enormous fortune.
Turn one against the other.<eos> And when that happens... as it is all but certain to do... which of us standing here are likely to be the ones who benefit and which the ones sold back into their chains?<eos> Then what the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I saved your men's lives and yours from the fight you started but could not finish.<eos> And now you would start another... that no man can hope to finish?
I spoke with Governor Raja... just before he set sail.<eos> I wanted to be certain that our account with him was squared, that we ought to expect no return by his fleet, considering there were promises made to him that remain unfulfilled... to deliver the still missing cache and Jack Rackham.<eos> Governor Raja assured me he had already written off the missing cache, the war effort being of paramount importance.<eos> But Captain Rackham... he said he had never asked for Captain Rackham.<eos> You added that part.
The last thing I need to overhear when Mr. Guthrie rejects our proposal is, uh...<eos> Uh, Monsieur Constable, what sort of reward might one expect for aiding in 'zhe' capture of a notorious pirate captain, such as, say, oh, Jack Rackham?<eos> Really?<eos> 'Zhat' much?<eos> Well, what do you know?
I was hitting your supply lines to the estates, fomenting sabotage in Nassau Town.<eos> Fighting your soldiers in untold skirmishes.<eos> You killed many of my men, and I got my fair share of yours.<eos> Why would you tell me this?<eos> Because I want you to know that I'm withholding nothing.
They all turned on me.<eos> Discarded what I'd done for them, the sacrifices I made, and left me for dead.<eos> And I want them all to pay for it.<eos> I cannot achieve it on my own.<eos> You could... if you were so inclined and you knew how.
See, none of them was capable of changing.<eos> The cat a slave to his hunger, my son to... his decency... my husband to his rage.<eos> That would seem to be the history of Nassau, too, wouldn't it?<eos> A cycle of violence... that benefits none and consumes all.<eos> Suppose the question is... in Nassau's story, which of these roles do you play?
He can probably take a break for one day.<eos> Well, consistency's important.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Can I get him down?<eos> You two look exhausted.
It's not a great time right now.<eos> Hey, it's your birthday! I'm paying!<eos> Come on.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you two friends?
Nothing.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You're accusing me of being into Tank when you and I were dating? - Seriously?<eos> - Okay, listen,<eos> I know this is strange, but you two went through a lot together.
as a viable measure of delay.<eos> The solution to our problems is not going to come from a council meeting.<eos> They are losing faith in you.<eos> They see the problems we face in rebuilding this colony, the dangers if we fail.<eos> And they are growing more and more skeptical by the day that you have anything in the way of a solution.
Their intent is to cause terror and destruction until civilization simply ceases to function.<eos> - The defense of civilization... is not your responsibility, sir!<eos> Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.<eos> And the men charged to follow you to that end are already questioning their trust in you.<eos> If they see pirates return here, if they see skirmishes begin again on this island and they know that it was because you invited it... then you are going to have a mutiny on your hands, sir.
I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.<eos> But on this particular issue, the world won't much care for what I'd like.<eos> And of the men available, this one has merits.<eos> His family would be relieved beyond measure that he'd found himself a future far away from their business.<eos> He'd come with money, he'd open doors to new partners... and he'd be most amenable to doing whatever else you told him to do.
Oh, it's huge!<eos> We could totally all fit!<eos> I mean, I know we haven't talked about it. I mean, I don't mean...<eos> It's just... this place is perfect.<eos> You could have the big room and if I gave up my apartment, it would totally be affordable.
They used to be mine.<eos> The uniforms have numbers, Mrs. Cho.<eos> So you can just drop the innocent old lady act.<eos> I know you won't mind us searching your apartment.<eos> I know you won't mind showing me your warrant.
This is terrible.<eos> We all come here for the same reason.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> We obey no law but his law!<eos> You are either with us or against us!

So you can just drop the innocent old lady act.<eos> I know you won't mind us searching your apartment.<eos> I know you won't mind showing me your warrant.<eos> One of the escaped convicts was a Min-Jung.<eos> You and she were cellmates, weren't you?
What job?<eos> I don't have a job.<eos> And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.
You and I? We are getting closer and closer, Will.<eos> Mr. Wrangler will see you now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Bak wants everything to be perfect.<eos> You are the face of his hospitality.
- Thank you.<eos> Before I go and have a nightcap with Bart Schooner and get his thoughts on who should replace him, let me speak to what's hanging over the table and this entire room.<eos> The investigation that Mr. Dake is conducting.<eos> You all know how to handle yourselves.<eos> I want you all to cooperate, to be truthful, of course.
- That's so reductive.<eos> It's exclusive, and it's about connection.<eos> I was saying with cash on hand... Stop talking.<eos> I'm not gonna take any of this dog shit back to Axe.<eos> It's time for you folks to sharpen your pencils, and you better come back with one Traci Lords of an idea.
Travis...<eos> You watch it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Get off my field right now! Get off!<eos> What are you looking at? Get back to work!
Because I cannot wait.<eos> One of the murderers...<eos> One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.<eos> At large.<eos> How much more proof do you people need?
Thank you so much for coming out here.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> Thanks for coming out.<eos> You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
Okay, but I wanna hold the keys.<eos> What are you whispering about?<eos> We're talking about who's gonna hold the keys!<eos> It's me.<eos> I will hold the keys, I will open the cage, and I will select a medicine, and you will all stand aside.
For classes and better jobs, and maybe, like, basic dignity.<eos> We should write this shit down.<eos> Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest... I hope you get everything you want.<eos> I've never been able to make a difference here. Maybe you'll have better luck.
Maybe so.<eos> But if you know anything about the history of riots, you know they don't end well.<eos> - They never end well.<eos> - Uh-uh. We, we're gonna get it done.<eos> I hope you do.
No.<eos> After Rory, I'm best qualified for walk-and-repair.<eos> DAVID:<eos> This is not protocol.<eos> It's way too risky for you to go out there and fix the comms.
- I guess we're late.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I am the Knight of Crowns. Uh, my apologies.<eos> I seem to have died waiting for you aspirants to come.
Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I am the Knight of Crowns. Uh, my apologies.<eos> I seem to have died waiting for you aspirants to come.<eos> Y-y-you are aspirants?
Take it easy, big guy.<eos> - Don't hurt Groot!<eos> - Drax will destroy you!<eos> That the best you got, green freak?<eos> You intruders got some 'splainin' to do!
Incoming!<eos> I got this!<eos> I told you, I got this!<eos> Oh, crud.<eos> You krutackin' Avengers owe me a lifetime supply of duct tape!
Well, guess we owe the buffoonish Peter Quill a thank-you.<eos> Uh, Quill?<eos> Score one for team outlaw.<eos> Well done.<eos> Today, you space thieves can call yourselves Avengers.
He looks like someone in, like, the Pacific Northwest - knit a man. - Desi:<eos> Jessa: Here's what I don't understand.<eos> Why aren't more of these women going into more practical trades, like uh, being a cobbler or a locksmith?<eos> At some point we need lady road pavers, lady electricians, lady plumbers!<eos> Can't I just go do one line of coke without you two running off?
You realize you basically pushed me to get married, right?<eos> Because the only thing that ever mattered in our fucking household<eos> And now I - Wha... find myself on the wrong side of my 20s... - Oh.<eos> - without a stead job or a relationship. And Hannah is having a baby and I will need to be there for her.<eos> And you two are preventing me from becoming the godmother that I need to be.
When one has to pay the rent.<eos> I majored in art history because I absolutely loved it, but I really didn't think it through in terms of careers.<eos> It's not forever.<eos> I hope you like Chinese.<eos> So, I take it that you're single.
- I'm due in three months.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Do you mind if I touch it?<eos> - No, go ahead.<eos> Are you two thinking about it?
But everything to do with who you work for.<eos> And that's what Clara Ward, a CIA officer, who was also stationed in the area, found out and shared with Senator Wilkes.<eos> Soldiers, huh?<eos> Soldiers fight for their country.<eos> What you mean is you just follow orders.
A Sayulita.<eos> You're early.<eos> - You're never early. - (chuckles)<eos> There's always a first.<eos> You two know each other?
I had no idea what they were gonna do to me.<eos> Nobody should have to go through what I went through last night.<eos> Things like that happen every day to kids that look like me, and we aren't being heard.<eos> And so... I'm sitting out the game today in hopes that we will be.<eos> And I know this is a huge ask, I do... but I hope you'll sit out with me too.
- Oh, no way.<eos> I've just been waiting for an opportunity to do it right.<eos> - I can't wait to take back the shrooms.<eos> - This is perfect.<eos> You three should do shrooms tonight.
Dudes... this is totally boss!<eos> Baking soda and acid.<eos> Instant volcano!<eos> What?<eos> What are you two nerds laughing at?
I like her.<eos> All right, don't encourage her.<eos> Hello. So sorry about that.<eos> Agnes, hands to yourself.<eos> You must be Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan. I'm Francis.
Really? I didn't...<eos> Barbara, let me ask you a question, please, do... why do you think, uh, Rufus here is involved?<eos> 'Cause he's jealous.<eos> Jealous of your relationship with Mr. Felbeck?<eos> You two previously dated?
Look, there's got to be something more that we can bring Kovac in on.<eos> You and I both know that he's behind this.<eos> I bent the rules to get you those psych files.<eos> Now you want more?<eos> You FBI boys are cute, but not lose-my-job cute.
See?<eos> That is absolutely barbaric. Okay, come on.<eos> Aubrey says there's one this weekend. What do you say, you want to tag along with me, Doc?<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Hmm? Why don't you both go undercover and compete?
And while we're here doing nothing, he is in that Pennsylvania hospital room, launching a full-scale Presidential campaign!<eos> Huddling with advisors, reaching out to delegates, practicing his speeches!<eos> He murdered his way into the White House, and we are doing nothing to stop him!<eos> Nothing!<eos> You may be okay with that.
Like, today.<eos> I mean, you could totally have a shot at making First Line.<eos> Okay, whatever...<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, you all do, seriously.
-Where's the steward?<eos> -Sick.<eos> You got to go see the matron if you're looking for work.<eos> You a contraband? No.<eos> Uh, are you?
-You cut the carrots too big.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> She near killed that boy.<eos> Well, you might as well have strangulate the man with your own two hands.
She doesn't have a file.<eos> I didn't finish my turn, so I was sent this.<eos> Compliments of Jenna Marshall.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend, Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.
- What?<eos> Where are the rules for this stupid game anyways?<eos> Every time we fail a turn, the cops get of a piece of Archer?<eos> What's next, his knee caps or his ear lobes?<eos> Or the video of you two digging up the grave.
No, I don't.<eos> Just another reminder that there's nothing I can do until Ezra's done helping her.<eos> Obviously, she still needs him.<eos> Uh, guys, please don't give me the sad eyes.<eos> You two found your way back to each other.
- Did you follow me?<eos> - I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.
Okay, guys, I know we all woke up early and we're cranky, but let's stay focused.<eos> I'm as freaked out as the rest of you.<eos> Maybe even more, considering it looks like.<eos> A.D. was watching Ali and me sleep last night.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
Scofield ain't gonna do it.<eos> He don't got the killing gene.<eos> No one is getting caught. There's a very specific order to this.<eos> Sara, I want you to make sure Linc's safe and out of harm's way.<eos> Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna collect a wild card for us.
- Now you know where you got it from.<eos> - Great.<eos> Is there a BlueHawaii in there?<eos> Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.<eos> I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.
Well, don't faint on the girl.<eos> Yeah, Your Majesty, I...<eos> Forgive me, I have palpitations.<eos> I will not marry him.<eos> You will marry my son.
Protestants, it was assumed.<eos> It was a roadside attack.<eos> - Were they ever caught?<eos> The Church might want to open a proper inquiry.<eos> For closure. You understand.
- You mean the wedding?<eos> - It really wasn't my idea.<eos> But I've learned it's best to obey Father.<eos> Clan Gordon are good people.<eos> I understand. They are afraid of the earl, as are you.
Knox is the true enemy.<eos> If only there were just one.<eos> My wife is dead. And you killed her.<eos> Lola betrayed me.<eos> What sentence would you have given, had this happened in France?
My wife is dead. And you killed her.<eos> Lola betrayed me.<eos> What sentence would you have given, had this happened in France?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You seek absolution for killing your friend.
You did this for me.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it may not be a sin, but even justice has a price.<eos> It's better the debt be mine.<eos> It's tragic, but there you have it.
I will spread the word with my followers that you betrayed us, that you're a Catholic sympathizer, a weak...<eos> Do not threaten me.<eos> I am half brother to the queen.<eos> My family has royal blood in our veins.<eos> The people believe that God chose us to rule, while you merely spout His teachings.
Where's my son?<eos> Where's Darnley?<eos> He's not here, Lady Lennox.<eos> But he was, from the looks of it.<eos> I don't know why you two continue to pursue this dangerous little love affair.
I wish it was that easy.<eos> Today, you guys.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
I thought for sure I'd go to Harvard.<eos> I wrote Emerson about 10 letters, but I never got a chance to send any of them.<eos> I'd like to think he would have taken them seriously, though.<eos> It's not that bad when you get used to it.<eos> I'm sure you have your own name for this.
- It's good weather.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The sweetest water for 500 miles. Yeah. Absolutely.<eos> We got oil, we got gas, we got monster bucks and quail comin' out our ears!<eos> So there's a good reason I chose to raise my family here, and I'm honored you all could come down and share it with me.
When the exercise and the rituals kick in and... the cyclical thoughts about weight take over, everything else goes away.<eos> And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric, like a drug addict or an alcoholic.<eos> It's not about "thin enough," right?<eos> There's no "thin enough." It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.
It's not about "thin enough," right?<eos> There's no "thin enough." It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.<eos> And we give you a lot of rope here.<eos> It's scary, but only you can decide... to see what's good, to be alive.
- Hi, Luke.<eos> Oh, wh...<eos> - What is...?<eos> What's that noise?<eos> You hear that?
- I got it.<eos> It's the least I can do for schooling' you in your own home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still don't know how you knew Miley Cyrus from "tongue, pants, ball."<eos> - You two share a brain.
- Gareth.<eos> He'd climbed since he was eight.<eos> He knew what he was doing.<eos> There must've been an issue with the equipment.<eos> Which you think they covered up?
- Tom?<eos> Yeah, well, he's no alibi, he's a history of violence, and he's the one running that camera.<eos> Sorry, er, what's this about?<eos> Oh, just something I need Tom's help with.<eos> Or Peter, as you'd call him.
There's a devil infecting this man's brain, rotting it from the inside.<eos> He has rigged this entire place to explode with all of us in it.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Go into the tunnels. Go!<eos> Go look in the tunnels if you don't believe me.
The groundbreaking for your new school.<eos> SymcoPetro wants to give back, not just with job-creating economic investments, but here, with the future.<eos> I was very clear when I accepted your offer, and I am grateful.<eos> Thank you. But there was to be no publicity.<eos> It is dangerous for you to be here.
You all have to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> He's just trying to give your school some money.<eos> Don't be a problem.<eos> You are the problem here, not the solution.
Here.<eos> The Amazing Gowango?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> No, he does, uh, retirement homes and kids' parties.<eos> I think you two would hit it off.
But the drugs came, and the death rate has been dropping.<eos> But now there is a new threat, one I never predicted.<eos> You.<eos> Your generation is asleep.<eos> You're too afraid to talk about what happened to people just a few years older.
That's what I mean.<eos> You think he's got his head screwed on right?<eos> Well, if you think Bear's not gonna do the right thing, maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.<eos> Rip is my team leader, too.<eos> I want to get him back just as badly as you do.
Looks like it.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> The White House is quietly negotiating Taggart's release.<eos> The girls, too, if they're there.<eos> We're hoping to avoid another military adventure in West Africa, but if negotiations don't work, you go in and you bring them back.
They find us up here, there's no explaining ourselves.<eos> We're all dead.<eos> Quiet.<eos> You...<eos> You are not ISIL? No.
They're all over the Rover.<eos> - We'll never get to it.<eos> - I can get in that pickup, make a ruckus on my way out.<eos> Any luck, they'll be all over me.<eos> Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.
I screw you, I won't be around for you to kill me.<eos> 11:00 tonight, Sheba.<eos> Passports will be ready.<eos> That means we're gonna have to split up.<eos> You two get the passports, and I'll go with our friend here to the power plant and kill the lights.
Which means we're getting out without Ramal.<eos> And every one of you is crucial to that plan.<eos> How?<eos> Your whole escape's already wired.<eos> Lights out, you're over the wall.
Nine minutes.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He told me at dinner.<eos> He said he would come for us.<eos> It's supposed to be only me, but you will all be coming.
No.<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> I don't know anything that you don't know.
Or she's a spy trying to bring us all down.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> Laurel was right.<eos> None of us knew Wes like you all did, and I can't imagine what you must all be feeling.
Oh, shut your mouth!<eos> How do I know you won't get bored and run off someplace like you always do?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You two need to talk.
But his body was still warm, so I started CPR.<eos> - Why didn't you call 911?<eos> - Because I didn't have my phone.<eos> - There was a phone in the house.<eos> - You weren't there.
Look how guilty he feels.<eos> Yeah, maybe 'cause he killed him.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Why are you just telling us this now?<eos> Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay? !<eos> We were all trying to help him and you.<eos> There you go again, deflecting.<eos> No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap
- get Connor back?<eos> - I'm doing everything I can.<eos> I don't know that!<eos> Or I don't know if I believe that.<eos> Because the way you all talk about him, it's like you think he's some horrible person.
You think I'm not sad that Hillary didn't win?<eos> That I'm not terrified about what Trump's about to do?<eos> I'm used to things not going my way.<eos> I'm sorry that you're not and it's blowing your mind, so excuse me if I get a little offended because I didn't see all of this outrage when everything was happening to all of my people since we were stuffed on boats in chains.<eos> I love this country as much, if not more, than you do, and don't you ever forget that.
And they didn't! They didn't!<eos> I mean, half of our country rejected them!<eos> Hey, Mom, our values don't disappear just because our side lost one election.<eos> And in the next one, me and my friends will be voting.<eos> We're gonna pick up right where you left off.
That's my life coach.<eos> Our life coach has a life coach?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And he has a life coach, and his life coach has a life coach.<eos> And one day, after a weekend of training at the Burbank Airport Radisson, you'll be life-coaching 5 to 10 of your friends.
Please don't keep us here all day.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine. Let's say it's me.<eos> All right, n-now hear me out.<eos> After we closely look at both sides and you still think this kid is guilty, I will no longer hold you hostage, and vote guilty with you.
Who's Doris?<eos> She's the Cobra Kai to my Daniel-san.<eos> And I swear on Earnest's clogged-up dead heart that that witch will not take our title!<eos> Hey, hey! Where y'all going?<eos> You losers are our new practice partners.
Yeah?<eos> You got to get out of here, man.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, no.<eos> W-We can do this thing, man. We can do it. No!<eos> Go now! Otherwise, you and the kids are dead!
You do realize this is Yemen, don't you?<eos> Phaeacia is a hundred people. Mud huts.<eos> There is no map.<eos> But I can lead you there.<eos> You want to trust this guy?
You knew the rules, Linc.<eos> He's picking up again.<eos> I'm not leaving you out here to die.<eos> I have no intention of dying.<eos> Anyway, you've got the harder job.
It's the withdrawals.<eos> Withdrawals from what?<eos> Is super sleuth still trying to figure it out?<eos> Arthur, gas from The Scar was causing hallucinations. Crazy, huh?<eos> But since I've plugged the hole... or should I say, you plugged the hole... this town can finally see itself for what it really is.
You were free.<eos> You never had to see me ever again.<eos> And yet, you couldn't help yourself.<eos> You had to be...<eos> What do you humans call it?
Why am I not surprised?<eos> So, what, this is some sort of sex plague?<eos> What better place to test a passion potion than the uptight little hamlet of Meadeville?<eos> Meadeville, Steel City, L.A.<eos> How many towns did you assholes destroy?
- [blow lands] - [grunts] [moaning] Jesus!<eos> - Twice for lying.<eos> ♪ ♪ [crowd cheering] Hey, you dickless piece of shit.<eos> I thought you were Slink.<eos> You realize you two are like the same person, right?
- Yeah, just like that.<eos> - Just like that.<eos> On an average day, maybe not.<eos> Hmm.<eos> But I have a race to get back on track, and you two are a thorn in my side.
You always worked for Heart.<eos> Every arm you broke, every jaw you busted was all part of their plan.<eos> All the violence in the street was designed to create chaos.<eos> We blurred the line between cop and criminal until no one knew who the good guys were.<eos> And then you got too close to the truth.
The executives assigned to this show decided to test it in Jersey.<eos> As a result, they think you mouthbreathers are too stupid to understand my masterpiece.
If you're racing with a partner... your charges are linked.<eos> Get too far apart... bye-bye, cranium.<eos> Each day racers will be given a prescribed route.<eos> _<eos> But no matter where you are, I'll be watching... _
- Clearly, it's intelligent.<eos> - Oh, is that why you didn't...<eos> We can speculate about its intelligence after we get it out of this ship.<eos> We were hurting that thing for sure. Hey, guys!<eos> Are you seeing this?
She needs comm access.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> But, look... I understand why you don't trust me.<eos> Let me trust you.<eos> Leave the undersecretary, and you can go.
You don't know that.<eos> Jace...<eos> Join me... And my son!<eos> Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.<eos> You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!
I would if I could, but I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Dot must have wiped my memory.<eos> I can't believe you lied to Aldertree.<eos> I couldn't let him go after Jace like he did before.<eos> So Dot took down the wards and you two jumped off the ship together?
Anger, hate, rage. Causing the host to violently act on those urges.<eos> So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures.<eos> Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.<eos> Alec, you check the living quarters.<eos> You two take the utility tunnels.
You'd be rotting in the City of Bones had she not insisted we save your life.<eos> Then consider this my way of returning the favor.<eos> By killing her, I'll be saving you from yourselves.<eos> This council is biased.<eos> You've all allowed yourselves to become too involved with the Shadowhunters.
The amulet.<eos> Why is it so important?<eos> Hand over the box.<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> You have something we need. I would like to - broker a deal with you.
It used to be yours.<eos> Come on, none of this is bringing back - any memories for you?<eos> - Listen, lady, I-I wish that I could be the guy you want me to be.<eos> "Rip," but I am not.<eos> I take it you two were... pretty tight?
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows the code to open it.<eos> Perhaps you can persuade our friend to cooperate? Me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd rather see how this plays out.<eos> It seems you two have formed an alliance.
He's following directions or something.<eos> I've got to find out who's controlling him, who's brainwashed him.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'm gonna kill the bastard.<eos> You two wait here.
I know you two are close.<eos> But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.<eos> She treats us both like dirt, and you know it.<eos> She doesn't deserve your loyalty.<eos> BARBARA: What are you two whispering about?
Your death at my hands was inevitable.<eos> Is that what you told yourself last time?<eos> I'm assuming the grenade's not a fashion statement.<eos> Precaution.<eos> You three try anything, I pull the pin.
Weird, man.<eos> She was dead. Now she's not.<eos> Well, that's time travel for you.<eos> Well, I don't mean Laurel being back is what's weird.<eos> It's how you're all reacting to it like it's happened before.
It's like the melodies are in their head!<eos> It's amazing!<eos> There's no need for that now.<eos> Oh! I don't appreciate that.<eos> Madam, you are no lady.
- Hey!<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hello...<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> You two are, uh...
Two, three years ago.<eos> So this is...<eos> this is kind of a big deal.<eos> I mean, it's not not a big deal, but it's not a big deal.<eos> Do you two not...
RIP Witchita, man.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey, buddy, I'm so sorry about that tattoo.<eos> Dude, I'm not there yet.<eos> So you two are Mickey's friends?
Not so many years ago, on a day like this... I was in the audience.<eos> My son graduated that day.<eos> And I could not have been prouder.<eos> My son honored that commitment. He made the ultimate sacrifice.<eos> So I honor his memory every time I put on this uniform, just as you honor the memory of every officer who has given his or her life in the line of duty.
She wants you to take it down for the Open House.<eos> It's not a judgment or a reflection on you at all.<eos> It's just that the Open House is mostly for prospective families.<eos> And with attendance down after the whole Nick situation, - the lockdown...<eos> - Yeah, you don't want families to think you've... got a bunch of delinquent students.
What?<eos> Oh, that's... okay, that's dope.<eos> What do you think of her?<eos> I think she's gonna be okay.<eos> I could've ended up like her or any of these girls if you hadn't rescued me and Jude.
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!<eos> I figured you might want that after homo sex-ed.<eos> I want you to know...<eos> I feel terrible about what happened with Monte.<eos> I... I never wanted her job, and I know you two are close.
A good education is not a privilege.<eos> It's a right.<eos> We cannot continue to take away from the poor... to give to the wealthy.<eos> No new auditorium, or improved computer lab... is worth betraying these kids that we serve.<eos> These kids that you know and love.
Yeah. That's a good idea.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you. Very helpful, Curtis.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Grover, but the specifics of the investigation into Adrian Chase, they're just not open to the public.<eos> The mother of my children is dead, and you can't tell me anything.
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> That we need to catch this son of a bitch no matter what.<eos> Guys, a little support here.<eos> Might be crossing a line, Felicity.<eos> Well, you're the last person on earth that gets to give that lecture, Oliver, or second to last, and don't tell me that you don't make morally questionable choices so that I don't have to.
That's why we're here.<eos> Added support and the element of surprise.<eos> You think Felicity will be surprised that we're trying to stop her? Heh.<eos> Actually, I am kind of surprised.<eos> I mean, you and her have a history. Just kind of like, "Oh, we're against each other."
If you don't, then your father and my sister would have died for nothing.<eos> Diggle?<eos> Felicity?<eos> We're ok.<eos> You ok?
- There's nothing more i can do here, I've got to go.<eos> - What, hey wait a minute!<eos> - I've gotta go.<eos> - Hey, father hold on.<eos> - You've gotta get outta here.
- Okay, something else?<eos> - Yes, in certain instances the demonic phenomena will attach itself to an inanimate object.<eos> - Like a talking doll?<eos> - There's nothing funny about demonic phenomena.<eos> Now, you can come up with your own theories that you might consider less fantastical to explain away our findings, you can call us frauds if you wish, or you can see things for what they are.

- No, no, no, no, no, no listen.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> - Okay, go on.<eos> - I don't know how else to describe it, he was trying to help us and... He cut out his own tongue, he, he's in the hospital, he's gone completely insane.<eos> - You've seen a demonic haven't you?
- Richard, are you okay?<eos> - Stay away.<eos> - I'm trying to help you.<eos> - No you're not.<eos> No, you wanna kill her.
A mosquito's not an animal.<eos> Yeah, but it's more an animal than a vegetable or mineral.<eos> What kind of assassin can fly?<eos> Um, all of them, Janice.<eos> You two really pushed the boundaries of yes or no answers. [Laughs]
The gnats at the kill tree.<eos> What, that... that bug I killed?<eos> But that can't seriously mean...<eos> Their deaths require justice.<eos> Unless, of course, you'd rather play a game.
Jonathan Christopher.<eos> These are about you?<eos> Morgenstern...<eos> Herondale.<eos> You were...
That whole moving out against the Clave that could lead to war.<eos> I ask that you please reconsider.<eos> I mean, you have to know this won't end well, regardless of who stops Valentine.<eos> So long as you're at my side when the wind changes, not a single hair on that perfect head of yours will be tousled.<eos> You don't want things to end well, do you?
The only thing that matters right now is taking Jonathan and Valentine out.<eos> Your Highness, I'm here on business.<eos> You don't want things to end well, do you?<eos> I want change.<eos> You want war.
Now. What's the hurry?<eos> She's perfectly fine.<eos> Take off your coat. Stay awhile.<eos> Have you forgotten that Valentine is still on the loose?<eos> Every wolf in the city is looking for him, which is why I'm struggling to understand why you're wasting time kidnapping werewolves when you should be out trying to find him yourself.
Maybe my portal rune can pierce the wards.<eos> We can't all go.<eos> The demons need to be dealt with.<eos> Clary and I'll go.<eos> You two stay here, slay the beasts.
But over the centuries, disgusting half-breeds emerged.<eos> Warlocks, vampires, Seelies, werewolves.<eos> They banded together, grew more powerful.<eos> Finally they will be destroyed.<eos> And so will you.
And so have I, from other women made to pray in that room.<eos> It's tiny, it smells.<eos> We have limited space...<eos> Fine, we swap, then.<eos> We have your room, you have ours, simple.
Reachingoutto me .<eos> Is there anything more that I could see?<eos> We nuked the ship. And everything on it.<eos> But it's still going strong on Eros.<eos> -Were you there, too? -Mmm-hmm.
Yes.<eos> Because then it won't be a secret anymore.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> What the hell is he doing here?<eos> I know you two have your differences but I don't care.
I'm sorry, Chrisjen. How is this relevant to the stealth ships?<eos> The Martians seemed very intent on destroying Phoebe before the Nathan Hale could secure it.<eos> I just wanted to know what Protogen was working on there.<eos> I'll check into that for you.<eos> But if it was a government contract, I'm sure that you would have full access to those same records.
There has been a radiation leak on the Nauvoo.<eos> All personnel are required to disembark until further notice.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Are you involved in this?
What if they won't leave?<eos> They'll leave.<eos> Marasmus, you're to leave the area immediately.<eos> Do not change course until you are out of the quarantine zone.<eos> If you do not comply you will be fired upon.
Previously on The Expanse...<eos> How long, you and her... Never met her.
Let's get out of here. This guy's no soldier, he's too busy counting' bolts.<eos> Who the hell is this asshole?<eos> I'm the asshole who found your operative.<eos> Her name was Juliette Andromeda mao.<eos> In case you're interested, she died, alone, on Eros, waiting for you opa chair-jockeys to come help her.
And the opa is not an army...<eos> We're going, with or without you.<eos> And if you'd seen what's happening on Eros, you'd be right there with us.<eos> Julie died for the belt.<eos> She believed everything you guys say you're fighting for.
Good day.<eos> Good day.<eos> Go away!<eos> You have at every turn damned my life, this town, very possibly this entire world.<eos> In just three days' time there may be nothing left of your life, this town, this entire world, unless you help me stop what I set in motion.
All I want is to free my fallen angels and make Earth their new home.<eos> Black Sunday is still coming.<eos> Death and destruction to Salem.<eos> Do not imagine you have killed my brother.<eos> You have only destroyed his mortal self... merely sent him back to hell.
No, no.<eos> No. I'm a happily married man.<eos> Reverend!<eos> What a welcome surprise to find you here.<eos> What are you doing here?
First, give me more of Mary's blood.<eos> Mrs. Hathorne.<eos> Mr. Lewis.<eos> Incorrigible.<eos> Before you go, Reverend, you're a happily married man.
I will return for you. I promise.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> If there is a tomorrow, I will be here.<eos> Perhaps you and I are meant for each other.<eos> You seem to have lost your tomorrow, and I all my yesterdays.
Free her.<eos> And I am a woman of business now, too.<eos> Everything has a price, Isaac.<eos> In this case, your life for hers.<eos> What say you, boss?
Revenge is sweet, I know.<eos> And I understand your pain at the loss of your family and land...<eos> Save your pity. You understand nothing.<eos> It is not revenge I seek any more than a surgeon seeks revenge on the carcinoma he removes.<eos> You people are the carcinoma.
Were it only a matter of Puritans.<eos> They are but one tiny tribe of you criminals, murderers, and hypocrites.<eos> You set out from your lands to discover the world... as if the world wasn't known to the people who lived there.<eos> Every place you people set foot on this earth is a crime!<eos> And then you have the audacity to complain when others would dare to treat you with the same cold, calculating slaughter that you have dealt every other people in this world.
I told you.<eos> You said you'd be back in a year.<eos> I see your point.<eos> Some things are worth waiting for.<eos> You all know me.
She just told you.<eos> She won't see me... without you here.<eos> I guess she's scared.<eos> Not normally big on therapy.<eos> I mean, you're the ones that are more fucked up than me.
Nothing about the case.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> - It's about your assistant.<eos> - Alexis?<eos> Apparently, there's a story going around that you... were intimate on the trip.
Yeah.<eos> - You know Diane?<eos> - Diane who? Hart.<eos> - Doesn't sound familiar...<eos> - She's saying that she wrote this. So either you're a plagiarist, or she is.
But...<eos> I do feel an obligation to share something with you.<eos> Sidney contacted me.<eos> What?<eos> She told me you were getting engaged.
I'll continue to do it for you.<eos> Less talk, more work, boys.<eos> I'm not paying you to coffee klatsch like a bunch of fucking yentas.<eos> You're not paying us at all.<eos> I'm not paying you because you're not the one getting fucked face-first by your credit card company because of massive AWS hosting fees.
And honestly, gents, who would you rather have defending your four percent stake in the company...<eos> - Five.<eos> - What?<eos> - Five percent.<eos> - You said four.
I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.<eos> Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.<eos> I'll admit it.<eos> But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.
Even in the wee hours, you're not alone.<eos> The story in this Good Book proves it.<eos> Because Jesus knew what it was like.<eos> Jesus knows all.<eos> And you are not alone.
The story in this Good Book proves it.<eos> Because Jesus knew what it was like.<eos> Jesus knows all.<eos> And you are not alone.<eos> Thanks to the sweet grace of Jesus, you are not alone.
Never tall on size.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Hey, pastor greenleaf.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You all go on ahead.
I feel God's holy spirit coming on me right now!<eos> Coming on me right now with bright wings!<eos> Yes!<eos> Setting down upon me from above.<eos> If you feel it too... let me hear you say say amen.
The city will fall within a day.<eos> If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.<eos> It's called war.<eos> You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.<eos> I know how you wage war.
We called your brother king.<eos> And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.<eos> Winter is here, Your Grace.<eos> We need the King in the North in the North.<eos> You all crowned me your king.
II just have to wrap my head around this.<eos> He was my star witness.<eos> Guess you'll have to give a hell of a closing argument.<eos> I thought these proceedings were about race.<eos> Maybe you thought these proceedings were about race.
Welcome, Deputy Brooks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As Pastor Janae said, I'm Deputy Brooks.<eos> I know this won't happen overnight, but I think we should get to know the people of this community we're serving.<eos> And I think you should get a chance to know us.
Between the skeeters and the floods, there's just low rent bottom land.<eos> Music or no music, the ducks keep dancing.<eos> It's like the melodies are in their head!<eos> There's no need for that now.<eos> Madam, you are no lady.
Well, ruined a great take.<eos> See, Joe?<eos> You get what you pay for.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do okay cutting at the Y.<eos> You sure are a hell of a lot more expensive.
And how about we get royalties on any act we bring to you?<eos> Yeah. I'll give you one point.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Well, records sell for 89 cents, right?<eos> So you make 89 cents for every 100 copies sold.
I felt...<eos> I felt that it reinforced a servile bias.<eos> I don't think we've got anything for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're here because you are black.
You better really want him out 'cause things are likely to get bloody.<eos> I'd want... five men at least.<eos> What?<eos> Five plus us?<eos> What in the hell would you two be good for?
This is our action. We're in charge.<eos> - Jas...<eos> - We're in charge.<eos> Dig it.<eos> So what's the plan? You're in charge.
You have my attention.<eos> Now, the leprechaun, h-he's been against all this from the get-go, but he's at a disadvantage being as he is a fucking idiot.<eos> Now, Nancy, he comes at all of this from a specific vantage of the bitterly dispossessed, which normally I would take with a grain, but I have to admit, having seen the rope burns around my friend's neck...<eos> So imagine: two rural police, middle of wild turkey season, and the same company whose tech found Osama, is dropping two no-name grifters in our lap.<eos> You two have very extravagant enemies.
You're a fucking asshole, dead wife.<eos> You're a fucking asshole, dead wife!<eos> You're an asshole, dead wife!<eos> He's loyal.<eos> So you two talk about whatever you need to talk about.
Doesn't that sound swell?<eos> An oyster.<eos> Inside every pearl there's a single irritating grain of sand.<eos> That's me.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.
Inside every pearl there's a single irritating grain of sand.<eos> That's me.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.<eos> Just like an oyster, you're trying to cover me up with something smooth and shiny... Pretty on a necklace, but inside the shell, that slimy thing just wants that scratchy thing out of there.<eos> You say a merger? I hear exile.
Are you still my puppy?<eos> No.<eos> If all of this is real, and TVs talk and hammers bleed, and if there's a world under a world...<eos> We have no business with you.<eos> You say merger,
I never realized... that you took me for...<eos> Essie told him how shocked and hurt she was, a poor widow woman to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had so much respect for.<eos> An indentured servant could not marry, so how could he think to torment an ill-starred transportee girl, she could not fathom.<eos> A poor transportee girl who's got feelings for you.<eos> Feelings that you can't possibly return.
The farm flourished under the eye of the Widow Richardson, as she was ever after known, when not "Mum", or, in time, "Gran".<eos> Oh, thank you, my dear.<eos> Of course, you must never fall asleep by a stream.<eos> No, for the alp-luachra might crawl into your mouth and make his home in your belly.<eos> For that joint-eater will take the good out of your supper so no matter how much you eat, after, you'll never be full up, never.
As an agent of Ohio law...<eos> Quiet, Mr. Hawkes, or I will find you in contempt.<eos> As an agent of Ohio law, I am allowed to file a motion!<eos> As the highest agent of Ohio law, I am allowed to deny said motion.<eos> This is a miscarriage, and you know it, Your Honor!
Please tell Captain Brown I appreciate his confidence.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> He did have one other request for you, ma'am.<eos> And what is that?<eos> He'd like for you to be part of the raid.
Your presence would be problematic.<eos> Problematic?<eos> You're not allowed to run the business. Why?<eos> Because you signed the oath?<eos> And because you did not.
There's been a new cook added. From the household of miss green. Yes.<eos> My family's servant belinda.<eos> Will be working here on occasion.<eos> Perhaps miss green is better suited. To task the kitchen staff.<eos> Miss green is still learning, whereas you, miss hastings, By virtue of your innate sense of authority, Are well-suited to task those of any station.
At what?<eos> Your, -<eos> You've risen fast.<eos> Civilian to captain to executive officer.<eos> You make the ranks seem an easy game.
You do not like rules.<eos> You do not follow them.<eos> I'm a doctor from a strong military background.<eos> I trained at the jarvis academy before my time at princeton.<eos> You are familiar with princeton, are you not?
Now, miss phinney... what is her level of competence?<eos> Miss phinney?<eos> Head nurse.<eos> How do you find her?<eos> That is for you to determine, sir.
I did... I did not know that.<eos> I don't deserve your forgiveness.<eos> At least now you can move forward. Without fear or worry hanging over you.<eos> I freed you from that.<eos> You are about to experience. The wondrous effects of the exhilarator.
You'll bear it.<eos> Most indecorous.<eos> Ready toweling on the bed.<eos> Just below normal.<eos> Miss hastings, when we lift her, You and the sister wrap her quickly.
I figured you for one of us.<eos> Mr. Green...<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> Wait by the horses.<eos> And you would be?
I'm sorry if I alarmed you.<eos> Why do you do this, sketch me?<eos> It is my work.<eos> And my habit.<eos> You take care of people. I draw them.
Well, they all come for that. But more than the skill with his hands, His greatest gift was his mind.<eos> Diagnostique... seeing subtle signs of malady.<eos> His treatment was very imaginative.<eos> Did you love him?<eos> Do you love yours?
No, I-i'm to remain here.<eos> Major mcburney ordered it.<eos> What?<eos> You...<eos> You tell him I want to see him immediately.
My father, will he be waiting?<eos> Will he be waiting?<eos> I shall see you before long.<eos> This great, big war.<eos> So many hospitals and you show up at this one.
You're thinking I could tutor you?<eos> On the quiet. Have you fallen so far from this family, emma?<eos> I once knew a doctor. His treatment was very imaginative.<eos> Did you love him?<eos> Do you love yours?
You defend him, After he so callously sent miss phinney...<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> You hope to assume her position.<eos> I resent the implication.<eos> Still, you stand to benefit from her misfortunes.
The hour hand for every day.<eos> Why is it important for us to know how to tell time?<eos> How do we know when it's time to go to work?<eos> When the overseer say it time.<eos> You are your own overseers now.
God's word brings the men peace.<eos> Or brings me peace.<eos> Gives me the illusion that I'm actually doing something.<eos> I'll rescue them myself.<eos> Chaplain, you have faith, courage, resolve, But what means have you to procure those wagons?
I was asked to develop a method for photographing the slides.<eos> You intend to examine the sputum.<eos> I can prepare a suitable diatom to help you calibrate it.<eos> If you wish.<eos> I think we may have gotten off, how do you say,
It's a small town.<eos> A fancy lady like you ain't never heard of it.<eos> In case his family ever sees this.<eos> His mama loves the lord.<eos> You two are very close.
Temporary head nurse.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Are you all right, miss?<eos> No, I am not all right. I am... Miss hastings.<eos> And you are?
In that regard, I am a southerner first.<eos> I fight for my home.<eos> Each man must make his own sense of this war.<eos> On that, we do agree.<eos> So now... What are you, mr. Green,
And put him out of his misery.<eos> Guess where Dwight Pollard worked before the morgue.<eos> Indian Hill.<eos> It's time to get him.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I would never hurt a woman.<eos> However,<eos> I would feel justified in giving the police enough evidence so that your little girlfriend could only talk to her mama every other Thursday through a screen for the next 40 years.<eos> So, you give Maria the money, she gives it to me...
I just lost control.<eos> On the ground, now.<eos> Now!<eos> I'm the good guy here.<eos> Oh, you're just like them.
And what are you now, their lapdog?<eos> I know you're a lunatic. At least you used to stand for something.<eos> Your attempts to turn Captain Barnes against me are tiresome.<eos> He was following you not because I asked him to, but because he knows, as I do... that you are an enemy of Gotham.<eos> You Gordons always were stubborn.
He's following directions or something.<eos> I've got to find out who's controlling him, who's brainwashed him.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'm gonna kill the bastard.<eos> You two wait here.
But Fish is dead.<eos> And Hugo Strange, who designed the antidote, is setting up a lab in the GCPD, but they are missing one very, very important element.<eos> So, yes, I am sure that this bozo is the key to controlling Gotham.<eos> Are you my saviors?<eos> Are you the ones to set me free?
I know you two are close.<eos> But whatever you had, she treats you like dirt now.<eos> She treats us both like dirt, and you know it.<eos> She doesn't deserve your loyalty.<eos> What are you two whispering about?
Barry... when your mom was murdered,<eos> Joe and Iris, they took you in.<eos> Cisco, when Dante died, I slept on your couch to keep you company.<eos> The things we see, the things that we face... no one can do this alone.<eos> Trying is the biggest mistake that you can make.
It should be honored.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, Julian.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> And our deal was that I would train so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?
God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you.<eos> Don't worry. Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.<eos> He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.<eos> Hell no, I ain't cool with this.<eos> You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation that took the DA's office months to assemble.
Whatever you want.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> I promise you I'm doing everything in my power to make sure that that future never happens.<eos> Okay.<eos> You think this is what it's like to be a character on "CSI"?
Only one of us could live.<eos> You thought that Thawne and Zoom were your biggest foes, but... but it's me.<eos> It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!
If anything happened to her, this town will run red with blood.<eos> Starting with yours.<eos> We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.
Our love is forbidden.<eos> This is just like "West Side Story."<eos> I was thinking more "Fantasticks," but...<eos> Look, the point is... we ain't telling nobody nothing.<eos> And neither are you, capisce?
And you, Mon-El, how much do you love her?<eos> So the question is:<eos> is that strong enough to save them?<eos> You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in, you can go get them yourselves.<eos> You have that power.
Young?<eos> He's from the past, Detective. 2017, to be precise.<eos> I knew something felt weird in the cemetery. You hadn't visited Iris in years.<eos> Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.
Let's get 'em.<eos> Us, as in Team Flash?<eos> Guys, we have a chance to put some hope back into our lives.<eos> And I... I really need it right now.<eos> I think you do, too.
Really?<eos> It's a college campus.<eos> - Isn't there video footage?<eos> - Uh, no. It got... erased.<eos> Uh, well, I'm sure you two will figure it out.
- We're family?<eos> We protect each other till the end.<eos> How are you doing that?<eos> Savitar told me everything you'd say.<eos> You two are more alike than you realize.
- I created you?<eos> - I created myself.<eos> You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself, but he's gonna kill them all.<eos> Savitar told me everything you'd say.<eos> You two are more alike than you realize.
That's what got us in this mess in the first place.<eos> I thought you said you would never do that again.<eos> I also said I would do whatever it takes to save you.<eos> That hasn't changed.<eos> And I'm pretty sure you all feel the same way, too.
I've gotta run.<eos> It was so great meeting you, Jake.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> - I'm gonna go grab the car.<eos> - Great. - Are you two..
So here's the plan for today.<eos> We're gonna move up scene 33A, 25 and 40.<eos> We're gonna shoot on the Brooklyn backlot with Tangey, Xu Yifei and Jordan.<eos> Let me see how fast you guys can get into hair and makeup.<eos> Jordan, Tangey, you're with me.
You've literally never said that before.<eos> Anyway, since he got this new job, - he's been difficult.<eos> Full of himself. - Okay.<eos> He's just jealous because I'm better at finding new clients.<eos> For instance. Who would you say is the worst person in this room? Huh?
That's why she's after all three pieces of the bell.<eos> Lucky for you, I already stole the biggest part.<eos> Did you want a congrats in person?<eos> I mean, we're due at an event.<eos> You have something I need. I have something you need.
Did you want a congrats in person?<eos> I mean, we're due at an event.<eos> You have something I need. I have something you need.<eos> I have the bell.<eos> You have the tuning fork. And together, we're like chocolate and peanut butter.
His.<eos> Damon just took Sybil inside.<eos> If he's giving her that striker...<eos> I think it's time we wrapped up this shindig.<eos> You two get everyone out of here safely.
Mr. Maxwell, you are a true artist.<eos> You are too kind, Ms. Bennett.<eos> My skills pale in comparison to the magic your coven infused in its metal. Hmm.<eos> My mother was glad to receive your letter announcing the bell's completion.<eos> But not as glad as I was to decipher the information you had so cleverly hidden within.
Just last night.<eos> That makes nine of our community that's been slaughtered by these nameless, faceless monsters.<eos> By this time tomorrow, the ringing of your bell will drive those depraved beasts from our lands.<eos> Forgive my intrusion.<eos> But I'm in need of a metalsmith, and from what I've been told, Mr. Maxwell, you are the finest in Virginia.
Death.<eos> From when the ash and burn of Cade was forged into glass by the fire of hell's creation.<eos> Surely you've heard of the legend of Arcadius.<eos> No.<eos> You know him by another name: the devil.
Beatrice.<eos> Beatrice, she has a plan to stop the sirens.<eos> You did it.<eos> They're trapped.<eos> As are you, Mr. Maxwell.
Beatrice, she has a plan to stop the sirens.<eos> You did it.<eos> They're trapped.<eos> As are you, Mr. Maxwell.<eos> You made the bell. And the witches cursed it, so the blood of a hundred souls are on your hands.
I think I know where you get some of that strength from.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'll tell you when you're up for it.<eos> Turns out, our families go way back.<eos> I never truly appreciated what badasses you Bennett witches were.
I linked Elena's life to yours, and the rule is, as long as you're alive, Elena will remain asleep.<eos> You're gonna be human.<eos> Enzo!<eos> Surely you've heard of the legend of Arcadius.<eos> You know him by another name... the devil.
Dead.<eos> A spiritual coma, if we're getting technical.<eos> Her physical body.<eos> Where is it?<eos> That's for me to know, and for you to dot, dot, dot.
Bonnie's in the car with the girls.<eos> I grabbed the baby books. Do we need anything else?<eos> Everything else is replaceable.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Listen, I need you to go ahead.
Hey, Lucifer.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She can attest to my whereabouts all night long.<eos> And she can, too.<eos> Now... if you'll excuse me, I'd like to go somewhere where you two are not.
What's this, celestial enemies' night out?<eos> Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.<eos> There's something that we need to tell you.<eos> Ooh, some sort of supernatural intervention, is it?<eos> Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans you two have got cooking up, 'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy for you to spoil things.
- Murderer.<eos> Monster.<eos> - Killer.<eos> - Coward!<eos> No, you don't understand.
And he won it.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe you and him will have a much smoother ride than we did.<eos> So, you're not gonna try and burn it down if I say yes?<eos> Uh... whatever you and him got, it ain't nothing compared to what we had.
Teach me.<eos> I'm Giuliana.<eos> My friends call me Giusi.<eos> Well, I'm going to call you Giuliana. Because we're going to be much more than friends.<eos> Wait. You two know each other?
♪ But you hesitated, uh ♪ ♪ Uh ♪<eos> ♪ I got the keys, yeah, I got the keys ♪<eos> ♪ Got the keys ♪ ♪ Put on for my daughter till the death of me ♪ - Yeah.<eos> - ♪ Elevatin' on 'em like I'm Bron-Bron ♪<eos> ♪ You are not around when it's prime time ♪ Go, Hakeem.
Previously on Empire...<eos> Andre... promise me that you'll destroy that bitch that killed our baby.<eos> Laviticus Las Vegas is not like any other club.<eos> You and Nessa are out.<eos> You two know each other?
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.<eos> Please.<eos> This whole situation... it's sick.<eos> This whole family... is sick.<eos> Hey, Anika, y-you two are still married, but if we can expedite the divorce, it would show in good faith that you're making an asserted effort to distance yourself from the family and that will benefit us.
- No, thank you.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> It's a non-alcoholic cider.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Well, I think it's time you people... I mean, you hip-hop people have a proper seat at the table here in Vegas.
I just think she jumped back into this a little quick, don't you?<eos> I don't think we have the kind of mom who's gonna stay home and make us chicken soup for dinner, you know?<eos> You talk to cass yet?<eos> No.<eos> So, what, you're just gonna keep walking past each other in the kitchen, not saying a word?
All right, who we meetin'?<eos> His name is ishim.<eos> Before I, commanded my own flight of angels, my own battalion, I served under him with Benjamin.<eos> And you think he knows what's going on? We'll find out.<eos> You wait here.
Why do you let him talk to you like that?<eos> If ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to. Okay, yeah, look,<eos> I-I get that we need super dick there, but, I mean, come on.<eos> The angels that I served with are being killed.<eos> So I will put up with ishim, I will put up with everything else, and so will you.
But you American hunters, you're... You're a different breed than our sort.<eos> You're surly, suspicious.<eos> You don't play well with others.<eos> Well, that is accurate.<eos> You don't trust people you don't know, even when they come bearing gifts.
You know about that?<eos> My sister Dagon, she's taken an interest.<eos> - But me?<eos> You don't care. All I wanted was to be left alone.<eos> But then you come.
My sister Dagon, she's taken an interest.<eos> - But me?<eos> You don't care. All I wanted was to be left alone.<eos> But then you come.<eos> You... steal from me.
We've had two murders in two days.<eos> The police have no idea what's going on, and...<eos> Well, that's why we're here.<eos> Now you said victim number two brought some Timber Troopers through here, right?<eos> 16 hours ago, they were standing right where you are.
Wait, what?<eos> Seriously?<eos> How?<eos> You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.<eos> One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
He keeps me off the radar, and I pay him very, very well.<eos> Alimony's a bitch.<eos> I'm old.<eos> I like living quietly.<eos> You've been making my life awfully noisy lately.
Sure, yeah. It could happen to anyone.<eos> Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy.<eos> And I guess she changed her mind.<eos> Even with everything Kelly knew, it... It was still her kid. She couldn't.<eos> Then you should have!
Yeah... yes.<eos> I'm not saying it was gonna be easy, but the code demands it.<eos> "The code."<eos> This is not some werewolf. Do...<eos> Do you have any idea what will happen if this abomination is born?
He flew back to London last night.<eos> After all the... Unpleasantness with dagon and renny, well...<eos> Mick has a lot to answer for. So for the time being, you'll report to me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.
Seriously?<eos> I don't like it any more than you do.<eos> I'd much rather be with your mother. Hunting. For...<eos> Chupacabra in Texas.<eos> But for now, I'm what you've got.
I hope you don't expect me to spare your friends.<eos> That completes my examination.<eos> Okay, Drexel, as much as I enjoy playing doctor with you day after day, I need to blow this joint now.<eos> I beg you to be patient.<eos> Until I get the security device shut off, you completely belong to Crowley.
Did you... did...<eos> Did your people, did they kill her?<eos> Probably.<eos> If you think we killed someone, then we probably did.<eos> Speaking of, you do realize that by attacking me, you invite the retribution of the entire British men of letters? No investigation, no trial.
Ooh! Yeah, that feels awesome.<eos> Muscle cramps.<eos> You know a good Pilates class?<eos> So to be clear,<eos> I accept that you are now in charge.
You know a good Pilates class?<eos> So to be clear,<eos> I accept that you are now in charge.<eos> I-I like this new arrangement better.<eos> You're more the big picture guy. I'm the day-to-day minutiae... Guy.
The explosion could kill us all.<eos> You could bring the whole bloody place crashing down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're lunatics.
Save Lucifer...<eos> What did you want?<eos> I wanted to win.<eos> I perverted mother's spell, put Lucifer in a vessel of my own making because I wanted to win.<eos> You have any idea how many people have made a play for my throne over the years?
You what?<eos> Ian...<eos> I blacked out.<eos> Oh, for God's sake...<eos> Well, I'd had a row with Sarah, cos she hates all of you, and you hate her, and she'd gone.
Can I help you?<eos> Is Daisy in?<eos> Who's asking?<eos> You her dad?<eos> Who are you?
Trish and me, we were in bed together.<eos> She's my best friend.<eos> If she ever finds out, I'll...<eos> - Is, uh, Daisy in?<eos> - Who are you?
Yeah, I see what you're doing there.<eos> Ah, do you?<eos> Funny, though. I saw you.<eos> With Trish.<eos> I was parked up, you were out the front, to the side of the house.
Get after Ed Burnett and lock that bloody psycho up.<eos> And when you find out what this is all about, come and tell me, with a bit of bloody sympathy.<eos> Quite the pasting he gave him.<eos> It's typical - a woman gets attacked, and all the men go round butting horns, making it about them.<eos> - What are you two doing here?
Brought her up through your recommendation.<eos> - Oh, God, so this is my fault.<eos> - Never crossed my mind, ma'am.<eos> If it's any consolation, I think she was just stupid, not bent.<eos> OK, if I were you - and I'm not in any official capacity saying that you should do this - do the gold meeting, don't get into any detail with the rest of the team, then afterwards, before you make your press statement,
But we've all done that.<eos> And it hasn't helped, has it?<eos> I've been with you both, this whole journey.<eos> I've prayed for you, for Mark, for the girls, every single night for the past three years.<eos> That you'll stay together, find strength in each other and heal.
He was my friend.<eos> - Your friend? - Yes.<eos> Lord, I swear, you shall never hear from him again.<eos> Perhaps I should make an ally of Kjartan, once again.<eos> Maybe he will succeed where you have so wilfully failed.
I expect repayment.<eos> I hear you, Ceolwulf.<eos> I consider our lands to be one...<eos> No, we are not one.<eos> We are Mercia and you are Wessex.
It would be akin to Alfred turning away from Aelswith.<eos> It could never occur, Lord Ceolwulf.<eos> Never.<eos> What is this?<eos> Each time I talk of swords and spears and yet you insist on speaking of unions... and of ki...
Hold her!<eos> Hold her fast.<eos> Stand beside her and we shall have her married.<eos> You have no right!<eos> I have every right, and you will be quiet.
You cannot...<eos> Do not strike the poor girl!<eos> Do as you're told and as God commands!<eos> Beside her, as proxy.<eos> You'll stand in for Lord Aelfric.
It's called "double-Dutching," and everyone loves it.<eos> But then I heard someone playing my TaskRabbit song.<eos> Yet another example of white people stealing from black people.<eos> And I'm still not over what Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did to jazz.<eos> It's payback 'cause you stole Hamilton from us.
D, help people be safe."<eos> Oh, I don't know... psych!<eos> [ding]<eos> One hundred percent!<eos> Wow. You two are the only ones who've ever gotten a perfect score.
Have a good day.<eos> Complete waste of time.<eos> What the hell is your problem?<eos> This some sort of game to you?<eos> You're the ones with the games, aren't you?
No matter how intense your cries, they refuse to hear you.<eos> Amen.<eos> You have been voiceless for so long, you've not only forgotten how to speak, but you've become incapable of listening.<eos> But the voiceless will learn to speak in ways that cannot be misunderstood.<eos> Your needs may go unheard by those in power, but brothers and sisters, you are not silent.
I told you both we didn't want another Ferguson, but that's exactly what it's starting to look like down there.<eos> I understand your concern, sir, but the race problems they've been having have been festering for decades.<eos> We didn't send you there to dissect the race problem.<eos> We sent you down there to dissect the events of the Jesse Carr shooting.<eos> Which you both said was linked to the Joey Campbell shooting.
Sir... did you know about the video, Sheriff?<eos> Does the department still stand behind Deputy Beck?<eos> Will Beck finally be arrested?<eos> I know y'all are anxious for answers and, I wish that I had them.<eos> We're just as surprised at this latest development as you are.
- Nothing, I...<eos> Frankie has a really good idea.<eos> Well, you know, it's funny.<eos> Jacob and I were talking last night about the business... Oh.<eos> So, you two were talking about our business?
You're welcome.<eos> Children, everyone, at some time in their life, wishes they were being raised by people different than the ones who were raising you.<eos> When I was a little boy, I would have given my eyeteeth to be raised by an actor.<eos> He calls us orphans.<eos> You are orphans.
I would prefer it if you participate voluntarily, but as I believe Mr. Poe has explained to you, I can act loco parentheses.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> Poco De Laurentiis.<eos> In loco parentis.<eos> The point is, I can order you to participate, and you must obey.
Did you hear that?<eos> It came from outside.<eos> Sunny?<eos> [Olaf] Oh, you're not looking in the right place.<eos> For children who read so much, you two are remarkably unintelligent.
I would never, ever marry you.<eos> Hmm. Children... your sister is like a stick behind a stubborn mule.<eos> My sister's not a stick.<eos> Any animal owner will tell you that a stubborn mule will move toward the carrot because it wants the reward of food... and away from the stick because it wants to avoid the punishment of rump pain.<eos> Likewise, you will do what I say, to avoid the punishment of the loss of your sister.
- The wedding will be around 10:00 p.m., followed by champagne toasts, reception with cake and finger food, then the after-party at the Mexican place.<eos> Check.<eos> I'm just glad the Baudelaires are adjusting to their new life.<eos> I had my doubts about Count Olaf, but now that I see he's putting three young children in the theater, all my anxieties are put to rest.<eos> You two will stay right here until the wedding scene.
It is a rare species of reptile found in swampy regions that are particularly sad.<eos> [broken-hearted crocodile] Woe is me.<eos> Woe is me.<eos> My name is Lemony Snicket, and it is my sworn duty to carefully research the dire plight of the Baudelaire orphans.<eos> But there is no reason for you to make yourself as miserable and melancholy as I am.
[coughs] I can...<eos> I can still smell that ginger.<eos> I hope Dr. Montgomery is a decent person. [doorbell rings]<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> - You must be the Baudelaires. - Yes.
- [Sunny giggling] - [Monty continues laughing]<eos> I'm terribly sorry, children.<eos> I'm so sorry. Oh. [chuckles]<eos> But the incredibly deadly viper is one of the friendliest and least dangerous animals in the entire animal kingdom.<eos> Sunny will come to no harm and neither will you.
Uh, let me just unlock all these important security measures and I'll join you in the Reptile Room!<eos> Retinal scan one.<eos> Retinal scan two.<eos> [loudly] I am so sorry, Baudelaires, that you were frightened by that man who arrived earlier.<eos> Um, it makes sense that you were alarmed, being that he chased you up and down the stairs with a knife.
I decided to treat myself to some popcorn because there is nothing exciting happening in my life at all.<eos> Hey... [stuttering] Some popcorn actually sound delicious.<eos> I get popcorn for me, for all of us. My treat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, you go. Go take a seat.
There's more to a movie than just a movie.<eos> Just like a book can contain crucial secrets about the world of snakes, or it can be used to prop open a refrigerator door when you're airing it out.<eos> What my sister means is, we're not sure we're really following you.<eos> Ah, there's so much to learn.<eos> Unfortunately, some of that learning is going to have to be delayed tonight, because of you-know-who.

If I leave during the showing, you will not act as if anything is amiss, but you'll keep your eyes on that fraud Stephano.
- Salt?<eos> [normal voice] I'd thank you... - ...for coming on such short notice, but I'm not in the habit of coddling my henchpeople.<eos> Due to one overprotective herpetologist's hysteria over the safety of his appalling collection of creatures,<eos> Operation Capture Monty has been relocated from Monty's home to this godforsaken nickelodeon.<eos> And just in time. I think you-know-who is trying to send a you-know-what.
If you hadn't stranded me at the movies, I wouldn't have had to kill Monty and we'd all be on our way to Peru, where I would have had to kill Monty.<eos> God, I hate driving stick.<eos> You're just gonna leave him there?<eos> Trust me, he doesn't mind.<eos> Of course, after they discover he's dead, you'll be long gone, and I'll be taking advantage of Peru's extremely lax guardianship laws.
The CIA added this to your mission file.<eos> This is total crap.<eos> It didn't happen like this.<eos> This makes us sound like baby killers.<eos> But you did kill civilians, didn't you?
There are indeed many sights to be seen.<eos> My results, sir? No.<eos> I expect them this afternoon.<eos> This is from the Surgeon General's Office.<eos> It seems Hammond has taken a keen interest in an autopsy you performed.
The chloroform may have been impure.<eos> The patient must have had a negative physiological response. Clearly.<eos> I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> This was an unforeseen circumstance.<eos> What you call circumstance I call woeful negligence.
Are you all right?<eos> A letter from my son's commanding officer.<eos> That's never good.<eos> I've been carrying it around all day because I didn't have the courage to open it.<eos> Would you?
Funny.<eos> Your servant said it was mold.<eos> Yes, Belinda had plenty to say.<eos> We had quite a lengthy visit.<eos> Either she is lying or you are, Mrs. Green.
"That Dr. Hale has not increased too much the tally of limbs lost."<eos> "And that Miss Hastings manages things well, as she is apt to do in a sure-handed Crimean way."<eos> Indeed, she is.<eos> No teasing for me, then?<eos> No, sir. You escaped unscathed.
Passed through the gastric intestinal system of a large ox? !<eos> I will speak to the Army clothier about ordering you some new buttons, sir.<eos> How easy he is to consternate. He is, isn't he?<eos> And I may have an even better idea we'll be able to torment him.<eos> You two plotting devices against who I think you're plotting devices against?
If so, let me say this... I'm with you.<eos> Anything that can be done to drive that homunculus further from his wits earns only praise from me.<eos> Doctor.<eos> How are you holding up, Matron?<eos> It's a hard thing, what you're enduring.
Hold that baby close.<eos> It best for the both of you.<eos> That baby ain't breathing right.<eos> Meconium in the oropharynx.<eos> I did the fillet. You do the sucking.
I'm not so sure sometimes about this medical-school idea.<eos> Working at the hospital, working for you, has made me see things differently.<eos> I have a purpose there. And I've changed from who I was before.<eos> I think you know what I mean.<eos> You've changed, too.
I'll play it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm telling you to leave 'em alone, jerry.<eos> Leave alone thy loose women.<eos> What in god's name are you two heathens doing in here?
Blew up big as a honeydew melon.<eos> Well, I wouldn't be writing no advice columns if I were you.<eos> Don't get yourself caught with a pig in a poke.<eos> I'm Froggy, and here at Froggy's Hoggies, I guarantee you the most top quality hogs for all your smoking, roasting, broiling, and barbequing needs.<eos> We do the killin', you do the grilling'.
Take it easy?<eos> You want me to take it easy?<eos> Oh, well, here's the deal, ace.<eos> I take it easy and you know what we wind up with?<eos> You sounding' like three alley cats in a tin shed!
You were born to be a singer.<eos> And right here, right now is when we figure that out.<eos> Two quarters and I'm all yours, honey.<eos> Old Elvis Presley!<eos> Now you got the number one record in Memphis!
See me 'bout what?<eos> Well, Mr. Phillips, Carl Perkins.<eos> This here's my brothers Jay B and Clay, and that there's our drummer, W.S.<eos> Now, we play the same kinda jumped-up hillbilly deal as the Presley boy, so...<eos> So you thought you ought to be on Sun Records, too?
I don't want RCA to push the hell out of him, have Sun putting out all his older stuff, splitting airplay.<eos> Lemme take the temperature in New York, if I can lay any losses against Snow's royalties.<eos> No.<eos> This is a deal between RCA and the Colonel.<eos> Thought you two were partners.
Bullshit.<eos> That is fucking ridiculous.<eos> That is a wild allegation, Detective, and you have no proof of any of it... No proof that Xavi Moreno is even dead.<eos> In fact, he's the one you should be out looking for.<eos> He's on a beach somewhere in Mexico while you falsely charge a war hero and an innocent man.
Get off me.<eos> - Stay down!<eos> - No. I'm telling you...<eos> It's coming!<eos> You don't understand.
You're the man.<eos> Sweet!<eos> Let's go. Off the bike.<eos> Come on.<eos> You two stay there.
Isn't that what this rally is for?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But someone needs to be on hand to watch over those boys from Lawrence.<eos> They'll do anything to keep a pro-slavery legislator from taking that seat.<eos> The way you all speak about them, I mean, how rough a crowd should I be expecting?
Dr. Sekara, how's he doing?<eos> Uh, all's well in the neuromonitor.<eos> - Dr. Sharpe?<eos> - B.P.'s steady so far.<eos> I don't know how you two are so calm.
Please.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You... have been in touch this whole time?
Yeah, and to think only last week they were wishing each other dead.<eos> Bette is just amazing.<eos> Oh, she's going to win all the awards this year.<eos> Hedda.<eos> Are you two gals really getting along together?
Oh, my God, where did I put it?<eos> Here it is.<eos> See, I follow a lot of dark net sites that monitor so-called supernatural activity across the country.<eos> And, see, Sleepy Hollow comes up a lot.<eos> And you peruse this data because...
Almost didn't recognize the number.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They changed my hours up at work.<eos> I'm still gettin' used to it.<eos> How are you two?
That's pretty baroque.<eos> The important thing here is I think it could make some noise in public.<eos> Soon.<eos> I wanted to tell you this in the spirit of full disclosure.<eos> I thought it was better if you heard it from me.
Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.<eos> And yet, during this time, Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother... grew to epic proportions.<eos> So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative...<eos> Jimmy snapped.<eos> Wouldn't you?
I mean, if she can afford those, she's walkin' on easy street.<eos> And there's something else... y'know.<eos> I mean... that's the lawyer's share of the settlement.<eos> And your share is... boop! ... this much.<eos> If Irene holds out, the lawyers get this much more... and you are gonna get this much more.
Okay... what's next?<eos> We got...<eos> I-29.<eos> I remember when I was 29.<eos> Bet you do, too.
Like... make-out close.<eos> If you can do that, I can remotely navigate the non-linear filtering functions and code the preloaded blank card with valid biometrics.<eos> So, you want to duplicate the key?<eos> That's probably a simpler way of saying it.<eos> Look, fellas, I'm just as impressed by everything I've said as you are, but even if I can read the key, it's gonna take time.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.<eos> I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.<eos> - How are we gonna do that?<eos> - You leave that to me.<eos> All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.
- My man.<eos> If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.<eos> Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.<eos> My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.<eos> You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.<eos> You can't take the company back by force.<eos> You need our consent.<eos> And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.<eos> I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
This ain't about me speaking.<eos> Y'all don't really want that.<eos> 'Cause then half of y'all standing' here would have to admit to taking' the devil's blood.<eos> This ain't even about what I done.<eos> It's about shaming' others so they don't do anything you don't want them to.
Nah.<eos> I taught her to keep her head down. I did it so she wouldn't have to.<eos> And what happened to her?<eos> She ran away.<eos> I have to say, you haven't left behind much of a paper trail, Mr. Pullman.
What do you think of it?<eos> You should come with us to hear Harriet speak.<eos> You know what we do with nigger-loving slave-stealers?<eos> Your friend want to be white.<eos> That mean you want to be a nigger?
I'll follow you anywhere.<eos> You should be coming with us down South.<eos> I think I'm going to stick around here for a bit.<eos> This is a really nice house.<eos> You two bring Momma back.
Our numbers... our numbers have grown, as has the power of the Underground.<eos> But we got a ways to go to meet what is required in this fight.<eos> The work everybody in this room been doin' is good. It's important.<eos> But it ain't enough.<eos> You may think it is. You can think it is, 'cause you free.
And not for any of us either.<eos> 'Cause a country built on bodies will always need more for the slaughter.<eos> As long as slavery stands, ain't none of us, no matter hue, man or woman, be free.<eos> And if you refuse to see the chains that we all wearin', then you livin' in a dream, and the rest of us are sufferin' in the real world 'cause of it.<eos> I'm sure you all came here to hear the horrifying' stories of brutality and the triumphant tales of courage.
And I admit, as I stand here at the start of a new path, lookin' forward... I'm feelin' somethin' like what my brothers must have felt all them years ago.<eos> And I'm prayin' to him for that wildfire in me to burn away all doubt.<eos> And if Captain Brown's prayer ain't yours... if you don't have it in you to take up arms against the injustice, then you got to pray another prayer.<eos> And you got to walk in it with conviction.<eos> He will provide, but you got to do your part.
And I'm prayin' to him for that wildfire in me to burn away all doubt.<eos> And if Captain Brown's prayer ain't yours... if you don't have it in you to take up arms against the injustice, then you got to pray another prayer.<eos> And you got to walk in it with conviction.<eos> He will provide, but you got to do your part.<eos> You got to find what it means for you to be a soldier.
You was the only one that knew.<eos> James, he the one...<eos> What about James?<eos> He told!<eos> You blaming' me, when y'all changed the plan.
First there's the two CIA officers sold out to the Russians.<eos> Then there's a near miss at Colonel Kuznikov's.<eos> Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.<eos> You broke into my house and my home computer.<eos> - And you planted these files.
We couldn't see it till the blood flow was restored.<eos> I'm gonna need a new 15-blade.<eos> Okay, we'll need two bulldogs and some 5-0 monofilament.<eos> Sekara, Williams, it's been a long day.<eos> You two can scrub out.
Not yet, and don't talk about Archie.<eos> Veronica Lodge, I'd heard whisperings.<eos> I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?<eos> Betty, would you mind?<eos> So, what are you three hens gossiping about?
Can't go to Weatherbee. If you do that, we will never see each other again.<eos> Archie, I'm putting myself in your hands.<eos> Stand down, Vixens.<eos> And listen up.<eos> The weather's predicting a downpour the night of the rally, but already, you're raining on my parade.
Sure.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Do you guys want to join us?<eos> Yes, but only if you're treating.
I haven't seen my dad in three months because he's in jail.<eos> And my mom is...<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You don't care, and it's not important.
Hey, Archie, why don't we quit while we're ahead?<eos> It's just... I mean, it's just a question.<eos> Did something happen between you two?<eos> It's ancient history, but your dad and me, we... We started Andrews Construction together.<eos> You and my dad were partners?
Like go after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him.<eos> I want to help with your investigation.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> Whether you believe in order or chaos, in the end, it's the same...
There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.<eos> Maple syrup!<eos> Drown in it, why don't you?<eos> Well, what do we have here?<eos> You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
When the time comes, they'll step up.<eos> Hey, Jughead's a tough kid.<eos> Scrappy. A survivor.<eos> He'll make it.<eos> Especially if you're looking after him.
I'm not with the FBI.<eos> I've been suspended.<eos> And yet you still have gun.<eos> This is America.<eos> And now, you two are a team.
"If you see something, say something."<eos> Well, Jafar...<eos> He saw something. But he took it one step further.<eos> He did something about it.<eos> He did it so you don't have to.
Well, Jafar...<eos> He saw something. But he took it one step further.<eos> He did something about it.<eos> He did it so you don't have to.<eos> So you don't have to.
- Fitz.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - I am not... Sit...<eos> You too.<eos> - You two need to talk.
Now, I've got a question for the class.<eos> Sometimes our inspectors will catch a flaw in a finished coin.<eos> Now, when that happens, the coin has to be scrapped.<eos> Every now and then, one of them gets out. It can be very lucrative for coin collectors.<eos> What do you imagine would be the cause of an error coin on a mechanical level?
Of course they do.<eos> Of course they do. We should get on this right away.<eos> It can't fail.<eos> It's absolutely foolproof.<eos> If it works the way you think it will work.
All right, I have it for you here.<eos> It's a lot, but I promise you it's all interesting stuff.<eos> My classroom, now.<eos> I know you guys are skipping class, and I don't know why, but I'll find out eventually.<eos> So why don't you just tell me now, before I give you all detention.
Don't even trip, okay?<eos> My dick is gorgeous.<eos> You put a wig on it, it would look just like Penelope Cruz.<eos> Wait. Are you guys still doing "Hos and CEOs"?<eos> You guys realize you're gonna be the hos, right?
Are you finally ready to share?<eos> Are you starting to feel any better?<eos> Better?<eos> Am I feeling better?<eos> Are you guys... you're all feeling better?
Miles got really in to this.<eos> It's okay, dude.<eos> - God, what is this song?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Do you jabronis know how hard it was to find a boom box?
You guys, you saved me.<eos> We're all best friends.<eos> Yes, I saved you, but that doesn't mean I condone this.<eos> You got to stop this.<eos> You two are in danger.
I love your suit.<eos> Je l'aime bien!<eos> I'm shocked she got out of bed this morning.<eos> I would have slept till I was dead.<eos> What are you two going on about?
You're both already in the public eye.<eos> - And the two of you...<eos> - Are not actors. Exactly.<eos> You're one better.<eos> You are Amory and Rosalind.
I'm Josh.<eos> And, hey, you know what they say.<eos> It's not how long you last, it's how big your penis is.<eos> Well...<eos> I see you two have really been hitting the social media hard.
♪ Spielberg and Hitler ♪<eos> ♪ Remember that we suffered ♪<eos> ♪ Have me mentioned Hitler?<eos> ♪ ♪ I'm just saying that we suffered ♪<eos> - When I say "we," you say "suffered."
Isn't it normal?<eos> What do you mean, "This is not normal?"<eos> Don't all brides show up to their wedding dance rehearsal dressed like this?<eos> Well, no... but I love it.<eos> - You two are such a handsome couple. - Oh!
Are you married?<eos> Kids?<eos> No.<eos> Get a room.<eos> What do you kids call it? Hooking up?
Man, what time we on for?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Pete.<eos> What, I wake you up?<eos> I keep forgetting you retired farts sleep all day.
You're a great poet. I can tell.<eos> Perhaps you're in London to make your fortune, Sir? Aye.<eos> Which means now, I have none, so farewell.<eos> Sir, I want no money.<eos> It makes me sick to hear you say it.
Two more on Greene!<eos> I do withdraw. Oh!<eos> The worm turns, does he?<eos> Inch back to whatever shithole you came from, sluggard.<eos> Sir, you do me wrong.
"disciple."<eos> Very well.<eos> Stop that!<eos> I'm practicing!<eos> You two look busy.
The network believes the reason for our ratings slip is that viewers...<eos> - Hate Chuck.<eos> - Hate Portia.<eos> Best of luck in your future endeavors.<eos> Feel that you two are not friends.
The day of my quinces, you screamed at Tía Mirtha because she brought hot pink balloons instead of fuchsia.<eos> Fuchsia is a royal color!<eos> Hot pink is what a girl wears on a spring break, before flashing her tetas.<eos> Oye, why aren't you filming this?<eos> You want me to film you two arguing?
- What? Playing dress-up?<eos> Is that the best you've got?<eos> Because every playground bully in America called,<eos> - they want their pathetic insults back.<eos> - Yeah! The cops are on their way and you're all going to jail, because they love my bagels.
I am trying to listen to a baby's heartbeat, - and all I can hear is Max Bygraves.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry!<eos> I think we've been enjoying ourselves a little bit too much.<eos> Opinions may differ on that. I've undergone a whole series of dental examinations!<eos> That's lovely. But while you've been playing games, some of us have been trying to work.
She goes to St Lawrence's.<eos> She's in my chemistry club.<eos> And soon she'll be at your bus stop every morning.<eos> - That might cause something of a "reaction."<eos> - Honestly. I can't even mention a name without you jumping to conclusions.
- Thanks.<eos> So, I think I figured this out.<eos> You cook and you eat.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's the way you two work.
The Unabomber asked for me specifically?<eos> Specifically for you, and only you.<eos> Why me?<eos> He says he'll only talk to the person who actually caught him, and for some reason, he thinks that's you.<eos> Well, that is me. You were chasing your tails for years before I came.
..I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.<eos> Beric: We're fighting a great war.<eos> ..Wars cost money.<eos> Gendry: I wanted to be one of you.<eos> ..I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off. Like a slave.

Uh, we were watching porn together.<eos> Yeah, it's something we do.<eos> How dare you sit there and judge me, Greg?<eos> And other guy?<eos> You two have no idea what war is like.
You two have no idea what war is like.<eos> It's scary.<eos> And, yes, grown men scream for their mothers, and it's not all heroic John Wayne and fearless Mel Gibson in "Braveheart."<eos> Sometimes it's insane Mel Gibson yelling about a jacuzzi.<eos> But you two wouldn't know that because you're both doughy pissants who've never been outside your cushy offices, and you cry when the coffee machine runs out of water!
(laughs)<eos> Okay, just to nip any rumors in the bud, Katie and I are coworkers, all right?<eos> Mm-mm, Greg's got a girlfriend, I have a fun Bumble presence.<eos> The point is, despite whatever you guys have heard, we are not sleeping together.<eos> - No one thinks you're sleeping together.
Well done.<eos> Nice.<eos> Well, as usual, I'm the real victim here.<eos> Gram's idea for "The Yellow Digital Suite" is ruining my life!<eos> Now let's see what you, the viewer, had to say about the new EPA regulations.
This is our wedding!<eos> We planned it.<eos> Oh, Josh.<eos> Oh, Lucy.<eos> You didn't plan this wedding.
- Just talk to each other.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, guys, let's do this.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Wait, are you not coming?
In my self-criticism, I acknowledged the mistake I made in contacting my previous family in Seattle.<eos> Tuan, that wasn't why we were...<eos> It's alright.<eos> My organization will forgive me.<eos> I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.
You stole from me first. Yeah.<eos> Well, we didn't know you were in the game.<eos> - Give us back our shit. - No, that's not enough.<eos> I want to know how you pulled this off.<eos> Honestly, you were just overconfident.
I know how to open champagne with a sword.<eos> How old are you, anyway?<eos> Twenty-three.<eos> "Huh," what?<eos> Hard to believe you're the future.
No... is that a problem?<eos> I just got a cancellation on Cabin 4.<eos> Great!<eos> Um... we'll take it.<eos> If you don't, somebody else will!
I had to get his attention somehow, you know?<eos> How long you been married?<eos> - Six months.<eos> - Two years.<eos> You two aren't really married, are you?
Okay. And how much do I get for not telling Audrey?<eos> We can give you 2.<eos> 2 what?<eos> 2 million.<eos> How much are you getting?
- You don't understand. You don't know what you're walking into.<eos> You don't know what these people are capable of!<eos> I... I don't know how to describe it to you, but... But I know someone who does.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've come to the right place.
- Okay, bye.<eos> Yeah, see you soon.<eos> - Bye-bye now. - Take care. It's just one big flesh tube now, huh?<eos> Yep, okay, all right, buddy boy, here we go.<eos> You've come to the right place.
You come here.<eos> Is... is everything all right?<eos> Yeah, everything is great. Mami, cut the cake, please.<eos> And, uh, you guys go ahead and eat.<eos> - What are you two trying to pull? - Nothing.
We can always add the voice back in.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Me? Yeah. I mean,<eos> You've been doing this for like 100 years,<eos> Since april. I think I'd better let you two decide that. Okay.
No, actually, I'm his... roommate.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, come on in.<eos> Floor to ceiling windows, fireplace, of course.<eos> There is the second bedroom, or study if you'd like.
This really affects everybody.<eos> I thought you just said that there was no threat.<eos> Well, I just want to make sure we're on the same page.<eos> Just say it, okay?<eos> You hate him.
It's a big favor.<eos> Rayna, it only took one listen to the Exes for this to stop being a favor.<eos> My only worry since has been about doing justice to the material.<eos> I'm confident that you will.<eos> Hey, how are you two doing?
Not really.<eos> So when it says in Isiah,<eos> "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in you," who is he talking about?<eos> I don't have perfect peace.<eos> Do you have perfect peace?
Do you have perfect peace?<eos> Maybe he's talking about inner peace.<eos> But who's got that?<eos> So this is the challenge.<eos> If you're not in perfect peace, it says you still have to find what it means to trust.
And this incredible woman over here.<eos> I don't want to steal from you.<eos> I want to honor you.<eos> I want to honor God and his mysterious ways.<eos> And if you want to help me share your gift with the world, then I think you might just open some hearts and minds that are cold.
We have to keep finding new ways of promoting you.<eos> Well, we are gonna have to set some limits.<eos> Rayna, your fans, they're gonna eat this up.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> A behind-the-scenes video of you two creating an album?
- "All of Me." - "All of Me."<eos> I can't wait to get all this makeup off.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> You two sure got on like a house on fire after your little hatefest.
It was a little bit different with the mother I had.<eos> There wasn't room enough for both of us to be bad, so...<eos> Your mama's not like that.<eos> And she knows you would never wish for anything bad to happen to her.<eos> No matter how much you two lock horns.
♪ And it's a different story ♪<eos> ♪ Each time I look at the world ♪<eos> You know, I was awful sorry when I heard about Rayna.<eos> Thank you, Jessie.<eos> I know you two had a, uh...
Well, I will be seeing you soon.<eos> - All right. - Who was that?<eos> Another woman interested in Dad.<eos> Please tell me you're not interested in her.<eos> You two are the only girls in my life, believe me.
And what, tell them that I took the song for myself?<eos> That I'm a heartless... bitch.<eos> But one thing is clear...<eos> The good news is she hasn't gone to the press yet.<eos> Nobody knows what actually happened. So if you two can bury the hatchet, maybe we can keep it that way.
And they get that life is complicated.<eos> It's hard to have a career.<eos> It's hard to believe in the future.<eos> It's hard to have a relationship.<eos> And right now, guys, honestly, you represent that perfectly.
Just go play some video games or something.<eos> - You'll thank me later. - Come on.<eos> You know you drank when you were our age, man.<eos> Yeah, I did a lot of stupid things when I was your age.<eos> - You look smarter.
Don't say that.<eos> I think it's true.<eos> Our next performance features the artist that stole our hearts at the CMT Music Awards earlier this year.<eos> And then had a song stolen from her. Or something like that.<eos> If you're just as confused as me, please welcome to the stage Maddie Jaymes.
Both of you say that you will, right now.<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Thanks for asking, but I don't really think of myself as much of an actor.<eos> Didn't you two act straight for decades?
But then I got phone calls later that night.<eos> So, I'm gonna need three of these.<eos> Actually, four.<eos> Doreen is on the fence, but I think I can get her to see the light.<eos> Oh, you two are doing God's work.
Who?<eos> ♪ You can't let him get away with stealing your shit.<eos> This place will eat you alive.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you two getting along?
Well, you go over the Wall.<eos> There's a low point where the Wall cuts through the mountains.<eos> It's only about 150 feet high there.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Well, my drone here takes a line up, rigs it around the top. You climb up one side, repel down the other.
Older than him, though.<eos> What about their drones?<eos> Well, the top of the Wall's a dead spot.<eos> They launch from up there, but their sensors aren't activated immediately.<eos> You might see them, but they won't see you.
I'm interested to hear your view on this.<eos> Seriously, they don't feed you on the plane.<eos> - Now, in the old days they used to...<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I worry about you two living alone out here.
- And I'm not you.<eos> - Talk to him, Helen. You were so happy the other night.<eos> - Stop it. - That can't just disappear.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I can't do it. Whatever he did... whatever you did...
It's not fair.<eos> I got the pills, and I just...<eos> I just thought, anything's better than this.<eos> Just two weeks before you claim you saw Billy standing over Amy's body, you tried to kill yourself.<eos> You people are sick.
Cyrus.<eos> Vice President Beeeeene.<eos> It's like having a vampire a heartbeat away from the Oval.<eos> Hello, Philadelphia!<eos> When we started this improbable campaign, we were told this couldn't be done... That I couldn't do it, that you wouldn't do it.
Vanessa's on board?<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But she will be.<eos> I thought you two should talk.
Tom Larsen said he killed Frankie Vargas.<eos> And this money makes it look like Olivia paid him to do so in order to get her candidate into the White House.<eos> Angela.<eos> I came here as a courtesy.<eos> I know that you and her have history.
Is Quinn coming in today?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's why I'm asking.<eos> Well, it seems like you two are all up in each other's business lately.
Eventually you can find them on MakeAMatch.<eos> No!<eos> There is nothing out there for you.<eos> This is where you belong.<eos> I am your father, and you will do what Daddy demands.
And some Belters are just full of shit?<eos> I didn't say it was the whole story.<eos> Just the useful part.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To know the part of the story that you and Fred Johnson left out.
Then how did you know 'him' was him?<eos> How's he getting on, anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't heard from him since he left the base.<eos> I appreciate you boys letting me take a look around.
Next time I leave, it'll be through the front door.<eos> Here's a better idea, Miss Lambert.<eos> Consider not coming back at all.<eos> The world is changing, Mr. Garland.<eos> You just don't see it.
Right now, as I'm speaking to you, he's taking to those skies again.<eos> There will be danger.<eos> And there will be young men who don't make it home.<eos> These are the stories unfolding every day, of heroism... heartbreak... honour and despair.<eos> But you don't give a damn about any of that.
Is your Lordship coming today?<eos> The air force has had them flying for two days solid.<eos> I'm not sure he even made the wedding ceremony.<eos> Toby's due to step in as best man just in case.<eos> You and him all hearts and flowers.
Now, come on, squirt.<eos> I've got a job for you.<eos> He looks dashing in his uniform, doesn't he?<eos> Helps if one has looks to start with.<eos> You talk to Peggy.
I've got a job for you.<eos> He looks dashing in his uniform, doesn't he?<eos> Helps if one has looks to start with.<eos> You talk to Peggy.<eos> Find out if Freddie has telephoned for you-know-who since he ditched her.
Tell me, what's the situation between you and that delightful young singer?<eos> We're friends.<eos> You seemed a little more than friends.<eos> With all due respect, that is our business and no-one else's.<eos> With all due respect, we let you come here, to England, and you're pawing away at our women.
Do you...<eos> Do you want me to stay over tonight?<eos> I mean, I can be there as long as you need... No, no.<eos> Go be with your girlfriend.<eos> I need to know you two are happy.
- Cristian confessed to it.<eos> You framed him too well.<eos> He had no choice.<eos> Mr. Ortiz, Liseth will pay for this.<eos> She'll pay, but not how you think.
He had no choice.<eos> Mr. Ortiz, Liseth will pay for this.<eos> She'll pay, but not how you think.<eos> I had to splurge after the cemetery.<eos> I needed a couple of genuine smartphones that I could use to ping each other, just like you pinged this crappy old disposable we're talking on now.
You understand that this has been revoked and you are now heir to nothing?<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I pledge my allegiance to you, Your Grace.<eos> I do not.<eos> You are not the king, in law nor in God's eyes.
Jasper Tudor.<eos> You would not dare.<eos> Take her away.<eos> You can't.<eos> You will release me!
- I'll go back and get it. Thank you.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Your blood will wash the stable floor if the new king sees you bend your knee to me.<eos> You will always be the Queen of England in my eyes.<eos> You and the king were very kind to me.
So the Bible tells us.<eos> Dance for me.<eos> No.<eos> Princess Cecily.<eos> I think, perhaps, you have more grace.
But you have promised that you will marry Princess Elizabeth.<eos> If you refuse, you will insult her and the Yorks will rise up in her defense.<eos> The Yorks can still command England, Henry.<eos> Your pledge was to unite the country which is why you have us on your council.<eos> I can only tell you what the others of our House will do and now they feel... forgive me, Your Grace, that you are a Welshman who's lived your life in France and does not even know our customs.
What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Unlock the door!<eos> So, this is how the King of England behaves towards a lady?<eos> Towards a whore and you have said yourself that's what you are.
That is why I was hard on you, why I was so furious when I saw you straying from your path and fighting against your calling.<eos> You think I have a calling?<eos> You will be mother to the King of England.<eos> A boy who is the red rose and white combined.<eos> You will be the peace that ends the cousins' war.
The other...<eos> To dislodge a baby from my womb.<eos> All I have ever wanted, all my life, is to marry a man for love.<eos> You know, my Lizzie, that girls of your nobility cannot do that.<eos> You did.
I will not be dishonored, so we must hold a wedding quickly.<eos> We will arrange it.<eos> I share your joy, Your Grace.<eos> We will name him Arthur and christen him in Winchester.<eos> You need do nothing. Except consent. And look delighted.
And... and sometimes wildly happy too. Life can be fun, a party. But it's the same loop, over and over, and endless loop to the grave, because that's what it is out there in the I.S. world.<eos> We are taught to be helpless and powerless.<eos> Helpless and powerless.<eos> With little pockets of fun so we don't do ourselves in.<eos> But you, all of you in this room, have chosen something different.
"This is my life."<eos> You want to be awake.<eos> You don't want the fog. You want to roll the dice.<eos> And if you roll threes, you want to move 12, right?<eos> Yeah, you want control and clarity.
Before we can classify this as terrorism...<eos> Yes, intent matters, but so do consequences.<eos> While in the course of executing her duties, a civilian officer was murdered in an attack on the L.A.P.D.<eos> Other officers were wounded.<eos> Maybe you are afraid of saying the word "terrorism," but not me.
Oh, why don't you eat a bowl of wangs!<eos> Bud, we should go.<eos> "Bowl of wangs" is how it started with those lifeguards.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You two are best friends!
- You're welcome?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, my sweet goyishe boy.<eos> You two have nothing to worry about.
Just the ones next door.<eos> He didn't seem to like 'em much, believe it or not.<eos> Understandable.<eos> They don't exactly light up the neighborhood.<eos> You're gonna, you're gonna interrogate them, too, though?
And don't you say it's a black thing.<eos> Yeah, are you seriously gonna let Hanson just brush this under the carpet?<eos> Charlie, you came to see me about the shoes. Do you remember?<eos> Not because you didn't care, but because you knew somethin' was goin' on inside the Sheriff's Department, and you couldn't live with it.<eos> You two need to drop this, what you need to do.
I couldn't claim him 'cause the color of his skin.<eos> I didn't love him any less, and he loved me.<eos> Miriam's inside just crying, crying her eyes out for a child that she'll never see again.<eos> That's why I took those sneakers, so she could get up every morning with the only thing that she had left in the world... hope.<eos> And you took that away from her.
Bottom right, again, a 2-parter.<eos> That means that if you answer these three parts, You get another turn.<eos> The subject of the bonus question is popular music.<eos> Singers of pop and country music are often associated with specific back-up groups.<eos> I'll name three back-up groups, and you name the lead singer.
I'm hungry.<eos> Stop your bellyaching.<eos> You'll eat soon enough.<eos> You need to be with your own people.<eos> I thought you were my people.
I got it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... you have no idea where he is?<eos> I don't represent him anymore.<eos> But you two are still bumpin' fuzzies, though, ain't ya?
Gay beach under our window.<eos> We could afford it if we took on one more job each.<eos> With Scott, maybe.<eos> He's resourceful.<eos> Sounds like you two have a whole lot in common!
Is that what you do to all your kids?<eos> You give them things, and you try to turn them into your little bitch?<eos> - Daniel...<eos> - I'm not a queer!<eos> You ain't doing me, and I ain't doing you.
End the war in Vietnam?<eos> The occupation in Northern Ireland?<eos> No, we want to um... reform the government, stop the Immigration Act.<eos> We want the police to be held accountable.<eos> And you think that two of you can do that?
See, every day Dhari walks free, it's a demonstration of the powerlessness of the system.<eos> We need to build on our first action with continued symbolic attacks.<eos> We can't help you.<eos> No, we want the same things you want - an end to oppression, power to the people.<eos> No, what you want is equal representation within a capitalist state.
You all keep talking but you ain't saying nothing.<eos> We're talking about the origins of the struggle.<eos> It should be of interest to you.<eos> You literally wrote the book.<eos> We've done more in our first month than you've done in the last six.
You all know I had to reset my sobriety clock a few times, so this little two-year chip feels pretty big right now.
Ah. So, good.<eos> You may be taking steps, I may be taking steps.<eos> - So steps are good, right?<eos> - What about Grace?<eos> I know how much you two depend on each other.
You all do.<eos> And I'm sick of it.<eos> Which left us no choice but to write that letter asking Omni Tech to cease production on its Très Belle vibrator.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> You have a vibrator with a French name, too.
And I'm sick of it.<eos> Which left us no choice but to write that letter asking Omni Tech to cease production on its Très Belle vibrator.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> You have a vibrator with a French name, too.<eos> Think you invented giving French names to sexy things?
Because you were going to take a trip without ever talking to him.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> I just think you two need for me not to be here.
Put that audio file on a thumb drive.<eos> I'll take it to Hennessey, see if he has any ideas.<eos> So once again you're going for a stroll around town while we're all stuck underground doing nothing?<eos> I know how to handle myself.<eos> You don't.
I know.<eos> Even if we dropped him at the Green Zone gates, best case scenario-- they'll just get him healthy enough to torture.<eos> Then he gives up you and everybody else.<eos> There's no good out here. He wants to talk to you.<eos> You're lucky, you know?
The people I work for see and hear everything, so it's only a matter of time before they find her.<eos> But right now you could still help her.<eos> Well... if Frankie got in league with some terrorists, then she deserves what's coming to her.<eos> Don't you at least want to know what she did?<eos> You wouldn't be here if she didn't do something illegal.
If you find yourself adrift, in search of knowledge, community.<eos> or spiritual peace... we say, "Welcome home."<eos> Thank you so much for joining us at The Greatest Day Wilshire Boulevard Congregation.<eos> We hope you will make our home your home.<eos> You will not believe.
Who's asking?<eos> I represent a resistance group based outside the Colony.<eos> How do we know that's even true?<eos> You took part in an operation that went bad outside Herat in 2010.<eos> The official version was that you responded to enemy sniper fire, but in reality, one of your men fired first after mistaking a bag of books for an IED.
That they report.<eos> And that's just in this country. Think about that.<eos> You know what, Cassidy?<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Seventy million baby boys' foreskins, right? Severed, harvested, piled up. Shoveled into bloody warehouses, and you don't wanna know what they're using them for.
Shut your mouth!<eos> Step over there.<eos> You. Gas up our car.<eos> You. Mace your balls.<eos> You two hold hands.
About what?<eos> About Jesse.<eos> I don't like keeping secrets from me mate.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know you and him were a...
Okay, okay, I get it.<eos> Here's your prescription for medicinal marijuana.<eos> I don't want weed!<eos> I'd like a letter for a therapy animal of the pig persuasion.<eos> Oh, you fakers disgust me!
Holding this, I feel only hours of tedious practice.<eos> Where is the joy?<eos> That was beautiful, honey!<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> I finally feel about my sax... the way you all do.
Is that true?<eos> I'm... not proud of it.<eos> You seemed pretty proud when you ate all our ramen noodles.<eos> Listen, I got to know.<eos> Do you chess guys get groupies?
They didn't have to say all that crap about Travis.<eos> Why didn't you tell me they were gonna say that?<eos> Because I knew you'd react like this.<eos> Travis was a good soldier.<eos> He died for Mars. And you all just threw him into the goddamn crusher.
See you soon.<eos> You're gonna get us all killed.<eos> And lastly, the MCRA will cover 61.5% of the costs to repair the Ag Domes and orbital mirrors, with the exception of any damage that can be definitely and solely linked to UNN actions, in which case we'll split the costs 50-50.<eos> That's a fair deal.<eos> We wouldn't have damaged anything if you hadn't precipitated the battle.
- Mr. Rose.<eos> - Marty never said you were such a oily slicker.<eos> - Is that gonna be a problem?<eos> - No, not a problem, unless you make it that way.<eos> You all didn't do nothing together, now, did you'?
I don't like to miss important details.<eos> And if this is what you claim it to be, then you don't want me to either.<eos> If?<eos> You don't believe us?<eos> We are open to the fact that you two might be telling the truth.
She's dead.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> She killed herself, didn't she?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> Look, you both should leave.
Let's look at the kitchen.<eos> Everyone is afraid of change, but when life is screaming, "This is your new truth," you need to accept it, be bold, be brave, and live your new truth, no matter what it is.<eos> Okay, I would just add that sometimes we may think life is telling us our truth, but we might not have enough information yet.<eos> So, it's important to explore all the options and exhaust every possibility before doing something crazy.<eos> But, of course, you should buy this house.
We're ready to execute.<eos> Repeat.<eos> We are ready to execute.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> You two are in the wrong place.
And you were in her apartment.<eos> Your fingerprints are all over it.<eos> Including the bedroom.<eos> Now, why don't you tell us about your relationship with your public relations manager?<eos> Now, if you think that going after me is somehow gonna help Burkhardt, then you two might want to reconsider a career in law enforcement.
- You tell me.<eos> When we found the sert team, they were unconscious on the floor.<eos> Nick was gone; Not one of 'em knew what happened.<eos> The sert team leader woke up in the truck six miles away, has no idea how he got there.<eos> None of it makes any sense, including you arresting the captain.
You should have known - this would happen. - Oh, really?<eos> You have a lot of experience with the Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester?<eos> If Bonaparte was still alive, you wouldn't be.<eos> Your mistake has cost us more than you know.<eos> No, my mistake was thinking that you knew what you were doing.
Settle down.<eos> - That was really weird.<eos> - Baby seems okay.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you can't take him!<eos> You don't understand. Ahh!
Where's the baby?<eos> Oh, that's not how this works.<eos> We ask the questions.<eos> You can't let him live with his parents.<eos> - You don't understand.
- Coming?<eos> - I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> It's not great, me staying with you and adalind.<eos> I really appreciate what you both have done for me, but... You guys need your space, and so do I.
You let them know that we'll handle it.<eos> They will be relieved to hear that.<eos> Get out of here, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Hey, hey, you gotta do something!
Maybe, I... I don't know that's... I didn't see...<eos> Look, that's not what<eos> - I'm trying to tell you.<eos> - Oh, so nobody ever informed you that hunting at night with a spotlight is poaching.<eos> You think poaching's the problem here?
- Dev change into him.<eos> - You shoot animals in the dark.<eos> Killing a few animals isn't the same as killing a person.<eos> Look, I saw my friend get killed.<eos> You two are in here. You're wasting time.
- Yeah.<eos> It's a commitment we made to each other.<eos> It's how Wesen have stayed in secret for so long.<eos> I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?
Still, there is, however, something that would ease me.<eos> If, when I'm gone, you will be cared for by a husband of wealth and consequence.<eos> Lord Coniston has written, asking for permission to announce your engagement.<eos> And, as I have told you, I cannot consider it.<eos> You are my only concern.
Is that all?<eos> Have a care for them.<eos> Do not use them as a means to injure me, or you will wish you had never been born.<eos> In return, I will remove myself from your life.<eos> You will live in your world and I will live in mine and there will be no need for our paths to cross ever again.
He was a gentleman of the first degree.<eos> Possessed the common touch, lived a simple life.<eos> We of less exalted stock would do well to follow his example.<eos> And yet you yourself have risen far, Sir Francis, - in wealth and status.<eos> - As have you.
Who's that?<eos> This is private property.<eos> Sir, we jus' carryin' this timber over to Sawle.<eos> 'Tis some heavy an' we thought to take a short cut.<eos> P'r'haps you might assure young master Warleggan, is it?
Entirely fanciful.<eos> If such a landing were to be managed, its aim would surely be the liberation of France, not the rescue of some minor English officers.<eos> Reverend Halse, do you know Captain Poldark's wife?<eos> I don't believe I've had the pleasure.<eos> 'Tis fortunate this is a large house, sir, then you and my husband may avoid each other.
To invite you to step up and follow in their footsteps.<eos> He and you must know it's barely four years since I was on trial for wrecking, riot and assault.<eos> On which charges you were, miraculously, acquitted.<eos> And two years before that, I broke into Bodmin jail and freed a prisoner.<eos> Or do you and your fellow justices regard this as "youthful exuberance"?
Vive la republique!<eos> That's all we need.<eos> She's had her eye on us since we arrived.<eos> Vive la republique.<eos> As you say, mademoiselle.
But it was gifted the brethren by Mr Francis.<eos> Verbally gifted, nothing writ down.<eos> What harm could it do to let us use it?<eos> None at all.<eos> You've defied him, so he means to put you in your place.
We see before the court today a person who has been wronged in the grossest manner.<eos> Lies have been told.<eos> A blameless reputation is at stake.<eos> In our view, what is required here is to set an example in order to deter other persons from committing a like offence.<eos> Polly Tregaskis, the court considers you have committed perjury and slandered the good name of Anthony Godolphin.
Never do it! We must!<eos> Or we'll be trapped in Roscoff for a fortnight!<eos> Drake won't last a fortnight.<eos> He won't last a day.<eos> Nor will you!
Devout, healthy, particularly fond of motherless children.<eos> But if you feel there is another pretty young lady with £2,000 willing to yoke herself to a penniless clergyman, you are, of course, at liberty to seek her out.<eos> Our own households have begun by pledging 50 guineas apiece.<eos> I've also made a large donation in my late uncle's name.<eos> And we do feel sure you'll not be wanting in your own generosity.
Beg pardon, ma'am.<eos> Is Drake Carne here?<eos> I've a message for him.<eos> He may be in danger.<eos> But you're not a surgeon. How can you help him?
Truro lacks an MP.<eos> Sir Francis intends to put up his own candidate to challenge Falmouth's.<eos> I regret I must decline.<eos> Your stubbornness will be your undoing.<eos> I'm no Leonardo, but you are surely Mona Lisa.
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.<eos> Put on the armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand the wiles of the devil.<eos> For straight is the gate, and narrow is the way... .. which leads to virtue and purity of heart.<eos> - My dear, what an age it's been!<eos> - Hmm! You and George must dine with us. I would have asked him today, but he left in such haste.
Of nothing, sir. She merely answered my question about the nature of your marital relations.<eos> What?<eos> She's no right to discuss such matters with you!<eos> She has every right, as do I, to ensure the safety of your unborn child.<eos> You have, if I may say so, a substantial physique.
I... I never would.<eos> For the Lord forbid it.<eos> What a killjoy he be.<eos> Come on, bufflehead.<eos> And you are...?
To live as I want, to raise a family, care for the people around me, to be unencumbered of debt...<eos> I think you underestimate your talents.<eos> I am wholly aware of my capabilities.<eos> I am also aware they are not for sale.<eos> You and I have something in common.
These types would have no compunction about feeding their faces at my expense.<eos> Sir Francis!<eos> I assume you've heard the news?<eos> My elevation to the rank of Burgess?<eos> I assume you've not heard the news?
Unless a worthy alternative is offered...<eos> A worthy politician?<eos> Is there such a thing?<eos> Change will not be easy, particularly while Falmouth holds sway, nor its advocates popular.<eos> But you believe the right candidate exists?
Attempts at verse.<eos> It was all that kept me sane.<eos> You were sketching today.<eos> May I show you?<eos> I'm no Leonardo, but you are surely Mona Lisa.
He IS the authority.<eos> And what is his remit?<eos> To quell threat and disorder wherever it appears.<eos> And can he be trusted to carry out your instructions?<eos> More to the point, can you?
And he is quite unaware of...<eos> Quite unaware.<eos> And you think if you marry him he never need know?<eos> Of course he must know.<eos> I'm amazed you would even suggest that I lie!
It's all right."<eos> Nate was kind, he was courageous, he was brave, he was loyal, he was unrelenting.<eos> And he was an absolute savage in this cage.<eos> My brother was also gay, which I think a lot of you knew.<eos> So if you have a fucking problem with that, I think you should stand up right now and speak.
When the time comes, I hope your quim splits.<eos> Emily Lacey!<eos> All of you.<eos> I've got an officer out there with such hard prickstand he can hardly walk.<eos> Mr. Gibbon's arrived to ponder the riddle of the female, and you're all sitting in here on your goods like pecking hens.
I cut it from our hothouse.<eos> And as I did so, I thought of Eve.<eos> She came to my mind in your form.<eos> Naked, she was tempted by such a fruit, tempted to know sin...<eos> So if I am Eve, then you are?
For the way she runs her house,<eos> She is the exemplar of all the bawds in London!<eos> In your own words, you have admitted that your mother is a common bawd.<eos> I grieve for the desperate women I have seen today, who, faced with starvation, have sold their flesh.<eos> But you are no such creature, Margaret Wells.
I want you to impale Margaret Wells on the spear of your campaign.<eos> There are viler bawds than she.<eos> I am fit and well and my cheeks are rosy.<eos> I'd like to see Margaret Wells publicly flayed until her back resembles a latticed tart.<eos> Would you not enjoy that too?
I know!<eos> I'm gonna have to admonish myself.<eos> This is difficult for me.<eos> I just miss my wife so very much.<eos> But you need to disregard my remarks.
You will dig Turdhole's grave and give him a proper burial.<eos> You two, let's talk.<eos> Thanks for not playing dead.<eos> The way I see it, we all want the same thing...<eos> You want to get home.
One shot, didn't even stop to eat.<eos> As you can no doubt tell.<eos> Not a lot of vegan options on the interstate, I'm guessing. - No.<eos> So thank you very much for feeding me.<eos> You know, people around here seem really generous.
That's the good news.<eos> It's really hemorrhaging a lot.<eos> Pressure's low.<eos> I'll push more blood.<eos> You two have a history, don't you?
Sean Cahill has as much sway over that committee as I do, and he owes Mike;<eos> I don't.<eos> So why aren't you going to him?<eos> Because a word from the woman who put him away is worth a thousand from the guy who got him out.<eos> Nice try, but you two did something to get that kid out, and you don't want to shine a light on that by appearing together in public.
Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.
Every word of these articles is true.<eos> I never should have been at Pearson Specter.<eos> But not being a lawyer isn't the only reason I didn't belong there.<eos> You see, the whole reason that I wanted to be a lawyer in the first place was so that I could help the kind of people that come into this clinic every single day.<eos> Now, I thought you all knew this, but it's clear to me now that you don't.
I don't know about you, but... I think we should keep it exactly the same. Me too.<eos> I mean, you never know when she's gonna want to come back, right?<eos> No, Louis.<eos> You never know.<eos> What are you two still doing here?
What's down there?<eos> How do I know?<eos> Is it everything you thought it would be?<eos> I can't remember the last time I went down to the water.<eos> You take it for granted.
- No. - I get it. You're buddies with him now.<eos> - You guys are pals?<eos> - Look, Nolan is your cousin.<eos> He's part of the family.<eos> You can't blame him for not being as comfortable around all this as you are.
Come on, everyone.<eos> Let's take this seriously.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Rayburn!<eos> I think you three should make the decision about Danny.
If he doesn't pick me, I'ma start throwing stuff.<eos> Classy as always.<eos> I suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Figured you two charlatans would sniff each other out like two mangy rats sharing a pizza crust in a sewer...
You're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.<eos> Hey... I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.<eos> Yes, that is regrettable, but...<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Maybe you two are soul mates.
I just want to make sure that I have this right. Um...<eos> Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk, but rather someone named Jason Mendoza, a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida.<eos> I wasn't a failed DJ.<eos> I was pre-successful.<eos> And you two are married.
It means "error," Jason, which is what this is.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, you two sit tight.
If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.<eos> Finally.<eos> - Oh, come...<eos> - What did he just say?<eos> Oh, because you're all so perfect.
Yeah, no, I get it.<eos> It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.<eos> Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.<eos> It was so stupid.<eos> He was already guilty, dumbass.<eos> I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.<eos> I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
The original perpetrators are here.<eos> This is exhausting.<eos> I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.<eos> The Bad Place is owed two people.<eos> In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it?<eos> A good job.<eos> _<eos> All right, nerds, let's just get this over with.<eos> I'll go to the Bad Place with Real Eleanor, - and you three can stay.
I love you, but I can't marry you.<eos> Charles. He's gutted by tragedy.<eos> We need to engage him in the pleasures of being king.<eos> Come with me now so I can prove to you that I understand the pain I inflict.<eos> And then you will understand pain, too.
The king is strange and cruel.<eos> He drinks the blood of children.<eos> I breathe my last.<eos> Help me.<eos> You're saying that Charles took a young girl, the virgin that you brought him?
I've already heard enough about my role in this matter from Bianca's father, thank you.<eos> And rather than bed her, he chose to entertain her with an evening in the wilds viewing the corpses of dead sailors.<eos> Apparently.<eos> Eventually, the girl fled, terrified of the king.<eos> As you well know, royals are permitted certain peccadilloes, but involving the dead in courtship, it will have people saying that Charles is a necrophiliac.
I have learned that the Vatican has sent an envoy to our Catholic nobles.<eos> They seek to forge an alliance with Mary and Darnley, and against me.<eos> Rumors of the potential match have reached Rome.<eos> A match designed to take England.<eos> I need you to quell this insurrection before it begins.
Sullen, unresponsive.<eos> Oh, just vanishing whenever he pleases, avoiding all responsibility.<eos> Your mother told me that... you have been traumatized by the Red Knights, that you saw your friend die horribly.<eos> But, my dear boy, this has to stop.<eos> You are not my father.
Or did you leave at least that part for me?<eos> Well, I hope one of them will be called James.<eos> After our father.<eos> - You must be Lord Darnley. - Indeed.<eos> I'm going to hazard a guess that you are James?
You're right.<eos> If I am to win his favor, the best way is to show him who I really am.<eos> Gideon, tell Lord Maxford I'm inviting him and the other Catholic nobles on a royal hunt.<eos> - I can't guarantee he'll accept.<eos> - He will... if you, a reasonable man, joins us.
I have cried out, "Why, God?<eos> "Why must the people who work the hardest suffer the most?"<eos> It is because Queen Mary is a spoiled French girl who does not care.<eos> She and her church take your tithes and spend it on clothes and outlandish luxuries.<eos> While she gets fatter, you starve.
The sex is about the same, but the dishes are piling up."<eos> It's unfortunate Gideon couldn't be here.<eos> I hope he's not out courting some other queen.<eos> I'm thankful you were gracious enough to continue the hunt without him.<eos> You seem surprised yourself he didn't show.
I'm thankful you were gracious enough to continue the hunt without him.<eos> You seem surprised yourself he didn't show.<eos> Your Majesty, the skill you showed on the hunting grounds today reveals a warrior's instinct.<eos> A trait you no doubt inherited from your father.<eos> I'm not sure I would have bagged such a prize stag had you not flushed him out for me.
I'm not sure I would have bagged such a prize stag had you not flushed him out for me.<eos> Being in your woods today reminded me of something you said.<eos> Your concern of a possible Spanish invasion, and you're right.<eos> Our Royal Navy needs a much larger fleet, but such a fleet would require a vast amount of lumber.<eos> Lumber you have in abundance in your own backyard.
You need to make a decision, marriage or the nunnery.<eos> Do I at least get to meet my future husband before I choose?<eos> Father.<eos> Queen Mother.<eos> And you must be Princess Claude.
Certainly, my father has his reasons for suggesting this marriage, as I do for accepting, but they're not the same reasons.<eos> My relationship with my father has had many... challenges.<eos> That's not the life I wish for my children.<eos> Yes, I do expect to have heirs.<eos> You are a princess, after all.
The courage I showed was no more than your own.<eos> And the only person I wish to persuade of my worth sits before me. I'll be honest, Lord Darnley.<eos> I did not expect to like you... but I do.<eos> If you find the terms that I have laid out for our marriage acceptable, our union will serve Scotland well.<eos> But I find myself wondering if this is something that you would...
If anyone saw you in this state, they will think that you are a vampire who has been feasting...<eos> Enough!<eos> Gideon, you grace us with your presence at last.<eos> Lord Maxford nearly canceled the hunt when you failed to show, but I won his allegiance nonetheless.<eos> But you embarrassed me.
But my duty to my queen took up all my attention.<eos> I was so busy keeping your house in order that I let my own crumble.<eos> Don't lose hope, Gideon.<eos> I promise you I will do everything in my power to help Agatha.<eos> You have no power over this.
How do you convict a murder for hire without the hitman?<eos> Okay, before it's all said and done, we'll find Mr. Pay Phone.<eos> Oh, I don't know how much time you'll have.<eos> Instead of dragging your feet, per usual,<eos> Rothman wants to rush to trial before you find the trigger man.
People with broken legs.<eos> - Abigail would remind you that money cannot fill the wellspring.<eos> Without it, Fillory withers.<eos> - Okay, well, we talked about this.<eos> When someone drops a log at a public pool, you just send a kid with a net to fish it out.
Really? It's kind of a scam, don't you think?<eos> It's totally a scam.<eos> Okay, as long as you know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, so, the way this works best is for you to be open to the fact that I have a gift.
- Oh, for sure.<eos> - Nancy's loss was my gain.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> Fo' sho.<eos> You two are a trip.
Relax, you still have plenty of time to get to work.<eos> No, you spoon.<eos> I have to get a dress to Marin.<eos> I had it planned.<eos> It was gonna get picked up and then you two had to be all nice and fun and loving...
Oh, God.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be a threat to you, grand poo-bah.<eos> Okay, that's not funny.<eos> Holder of the drink tickets that I never get.<eos> The drink tickets are meant as a reward for those who bring in other people, and you two are always by yourselves, okay?
- Say it like you mean it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Dignity has no age.<eos> You two are my favorite people in the world.
They're more distracting than they are cute.<eos> Plus, they trigger my epilepsy.<eos> Separate thread.<eos> As I was saying, we have all been hit by a lull in sales the past few months.<eos> And I don't think it's a coincidence that it started when you-know-who showed up.
Does your fiancÃ©...<eos> Does will ride his bike a lot, ma'am?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> He doesn't have a driver's license.<eos> Now, I know law schools are expensive, But you two seem to be doing fine, though.
I was a distant second, I promise.<eos> This kid is really a suspect? Why?<eos> - Just happened, right?<eos> Hold on a moment, chief. Just...<eos> The clerkship, You two were still going back and forth over it,
The system.<eos> - Quotas.<eos> Like, racial quotas? My least favorite motive.<eos> There's no racial quotas.<eos> Look, you're a lot older, and will and I, We didn't look at race the same way the older generation does.
Did you find the old autopsy we were looking for?<eos> Thank you.<eos> And I also have the pet color scan to go with it.<eos> Kind of gruesome.<eos> Where are you?
Right.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Cost doesn't matter to major crimes.<eos> You'll get everything you want in one order.<eos> Now I suppose you're aware that the rest of the department, We don't work like that.
Now grab your shit.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Ghost is in jail, you runnin' drug money through my shop.
And then Tasha. And then me.<eos> Guess what?<eos> I don't feel safe.<eos> Ghost ain't got nothin' to do with mine and Tasha's business.<eos> Yeah, but I do, 'cause you all got me twisted up in this bullshit.
- I tell you what...<eos> - This tape? Do you have a copy?<eos> What do you mean he's gone?<eos> How could that happen?<eos> Well someone better find him or we'll have to answer to you know who.
We are all sinners<eos> And we are all in need of God's forgiveness, or we risk rejection at Heaven's holiest of gates.<eos> But luckily, He is a loving and merciful God.<eos> His forgiveness can be earned.<eos> And you'll ask, "But, Preacher, how do I earn His forgiveness?
Jesse!<eos> Jesse, stop!<eos> God!<eos> God.<eos> So we can just take, pure titanium white, and I'm just gonna use the knife. You can take your finger or you can take a brush, but I want to push forcibly some white paint right in there.
I have.<eos> I won't allow my family to face that risk.<eos> - Freya found Nik?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You get our brother, I will handle Marcel.
Shall I continue?<eos> Now, tell me what "Teutoburg" means.<eos> It's a battle... where the bad guys caught the good guys off guard.<eos> Marcel is warning me that you're all here so that I can spread word to the rest of our guys...<eos> So you can keep us busy and Marcel can kill us.
- I think he's just taking the day off.<eos> - Interesting. Really?<eos> Maybe I'm too close to it.<eos> See you, guys.<eos> So you two were alone in your room with the door closed.
You have the right to remain silent... Kyle, don't say anything.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> To be processed.<eos> You people are unbelievable with this PC crap.
Yeah, the guy gets cut during the tussle.<eos> Okay, so let's run it. Maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> Yeah, and, uh, family's been contacted.<eos> The mom and the fiancé are in the waiting room.<eos> All right, so you two talk to the family. I'll talk to Beth.
You can't just keep her here a few more days?<eos> I got a chain in command, just like you.<eos> Army feels it's best for her to get back with us.<eos> I get that, sir, but he has an important mission here... helping us find the punk that hurt her.<eos> I'm just as worried about Captain Williams as you are.
And, look, there are concerns that some are using our advanced data mining for targeted propaganda, but let's remember what we're selling here is a tool.<eos> Like a gun or a drug, it can be misused,<eos> - but that's not on us.<eos> - Right.<eos> If everyone knows everything, and nothing can be hidden, the truth shall set us free, and so you're free till tomorrow.
I didn't call her. She didn't call me.<eos> Do you have any idea why she would've gone out after you left?<eos> I don't know, maybe to rescue her screwed up sister again.<eos> This is why I do what I do.<eos> If everything was transparent, you'd already know what happened, wouldn't you?
I mean, he could be listening to us right now.<eos> I know what you think.<eos> What David may have told you, but I'm not crazy.<eos> Nobody's saying that you are.<eos> Well, you may not care if you arrest the wrong guy, but I do.
Call the Special Police.<eos> Okay, so, what did they do when they got here?<eos> Their job.<eos> Which is more than I can say for Chicago PD.<eos> You've got no clue.
Hey, man, I owe you one, Rix.<eos> You owe me a lot more than one.<eos> Stay behind the line.<eos> Why are you protecting them?<eos> If you don't get them out of here, we will.
All right, well, there's a snack room upstairs.<eos> Let me know if you need quarters.<eos> So you threw a Molotov cocktail into a church... in front of a hundred cops?<eos> I'm not sure you really thought that one through.<eos> Well, I was trying to do what you wouldn't do, which is get them out of there.
Skaikru's not your enemy.<eos> Skaikru made me murder my entire family.<eos> I have no one left.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, but the chip, the technology, it affected all of us, every clan.<eos> You blame Skaikru for the City of Light. Shouldn't you also credit us for destroying it?
Came down from space in here because it's the most secure room in the ship.<eos> It's designed that way in case the hydrazine blew.<eos> What?<eos> We have a bomb.<eos> Wait a second. The end of the world is coming, and you want to destroy the one thing that'll keep our people alive? Yeah.
I vote that we take it home.<eos> No. Blow it up.<eos> I'm with Bryan.<eos> I know what it's like to be locked up and afraid.<eos> You didn't leave us in Mount Weather.
Just the light.<eos> Yes.<eos> But even in the light, it is our shadows that speak the truth.<eos> The glory.<eos> The glory, as you say.
De Busseys?<eos> Is no-one coming?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Versailles.<eos> You're not everyone.
May you live long in hellfire.<eos> The King's favour is no longer upon you.<eos> You are no longer worthy to gaze upon his glory.<eos> Do I not bring you money, and clients and riches?<eos> And you defy my word before my king?
Are you trying to pay me a compliment, Gaston?<eos> Because I fear you need a spot of practice.<eos> My apologies!<eos> It appears my son is... is drunk.<eos> And you appear to be frustrated.
My apologies!<eos> It appears my son is... is drunk.<eos> And you appear to be frustrated.<eos> It pains me to say, I am, madame.<eos> Since you, in the past, assured me so clearly of your desire to help my family.
But the man you fear is not the one who is going to harm you.<eos> He's far away, no matter how close he gets.<eos> The one you must truly fear is the one who is closest.<eos> It is there inside your guard, that you lay yourself wide open.<eos> But then, my dear you already know that.
That is why you are still here.<eos> Good morning!<eos> Must be so easy to ming on the road if you're a man.<eos> Don't even have to stop the coach moving, you simply shove it out of the window and water the weeds.<eos> You must be Philippe.
Shouldn't we...?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, goodness no!<eos> I meant, your girls must be missing you, and you them.
We could visit them, if you like.<eos> Please bring them down here to the country.<eos> Let them climb a few trees.<eos> Good for girls to get their knees dirty!<eos> Anyway, you're the prince of my life now, you make the rules. Should we go?
I suppose I should be flattered.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your secret's safe with me. Thank you.<eos> Not long now.<eos> You will never win.
Do you know who I am?<eos> I am the King!<eos> I'm Louis the Great!<eos> What is the matter with everyone?<eos> The fact...the fact is you're not the king.
What is the matter with everyone?<eos> The fact...the fact is you're not the king.<eos> We pretended you were because we find it amusing!<eos> Then who am I?<eos> You are footservant to the Second Chamberlain.
She is beyond redemption.<eos> I shall appeal to her conscience.<eos> She has none.<eos> The power of The Lord is infinite.<eos> You are a beacon of faith and hope for us all, Your Majesty.
I shall appeal to her conscience.<eos> She has none.<eos> The power of The Lord is infinite.<eos> You are a beacon of faith and hope for us all, Your Majesty.<eos> As you are mine.
His Highness thought perhaps I could help.<eos> Help?<eos> To find your feet.<eos> The last time I looked, they were at the end of my legs.<eos> You say you served as lady-in-waiting for my husband's first wife?
I have a fear of heights.<eos> You're both probably wondering why I asked you here.<eos> Whatever the reason, Sire, no doubt, it is a good one.<eos> I asked you here because I wish the two of you to marry.<eos> Cassel, you have the general demeanor of a sewer rat and the reputation for licentious behavior.
It can not happen.<eos> Not to me!<eos> This is not fair, it's not right!<eos> I can not marry that!<eos> You know what he is capable of. You know!
Before I decide what to do with you, you're going to tell me where you acquired the poison.<eos> I don't know anything about poison.<eos> That's not what your lover said!<eos> Lover?<eos> The chambermaid who delivered the meals to the victim after you poisoned it.
I know him to be innocent.<eos> He wants only to serve His Majesty.<eos> He is wrongly accused and wrongly imprisoned.<eos> Your son has brought shame on the court, on you and on your family.<eos> You have no place here.
I'm sorry, I don't think that will work work.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Because your father and my brother saw a mutual benefit in our marrying.<eos> And if there are no children?<eos> Then my brother is disappointed, the marriage is anulled and you will return to Germany.
An ingredient I haven't seen before, which makes the poison undetectable.<eos> Are you scared of the female of the species?<eos> The praying mantis does come to mind.<eos> We're complex creatures.<eos> Where you use your swords, we use our wiles and potions.
No!<eos> Mother, what have you done?<eos> Believe me, I did it all for you, my love.<eos> For me?<eos> You have destroyed our family!
First of all, convince the King to let you return to court.<eos> You will stop at nothing.<eos> Bribery, corruption, murder, extortion.<eos> King floods the Palace with light.<eos> You will engulf it in darkness.
Is everything okay?<eos> Some people got killed.<eos> 15.<eos> I'm gonna get an Uber.<eos> You staying?
I want to admit you to run a few tests on your heart.<eos> And more importantly, get your diabetes under control. Nope.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Are you gonna feed zachary taylor. And millard fillmore?
Decide who gets the blood?<eos> The doctors have their opinion, but it is a decision you and your husband should make, and he's still in surgery.<eos> But, without blood, is one of them gonna die?<eos> It is a possibility, but we are gonna do whatever we can to prevent that.<eos> And you want me to decide between my son and my sister's?
They're stem cells.<eos> We've been going to Mexico to get injections to reverse the paralysis.<eos> I'm gonna walk again.<eos> I know that look.<eos> You think we're crazy.
I have to.<eos> I love Julia more than anything, but there are... intimacies that I can't provide.<eos> Our bond is built on hope.<eos> It's what holds us together.<eos> So it doesn't matter if you believe the treatments won't work.
If she dies giving birth, maybe that's a merciful outcome.<eos> Sometimes, I've wished for that.<eos> There is another issue to consider.<eos> Given the abuse your daughter has undergone, Do you believe that she would want to keep this pregnancy?<eos> In any case, You are teresa's guardians, And therefore speak on her behalf.
Are you giving up?<eos> No.<eos> But Ms. Goodwin is right.<eos> We can try peritoneal lavage to speed things up.<eos> You are his doctor.
At least once a year.<eos> How's yo-yo recovering from L.A.?<eos> She knows her limitations, - but I'm sure she'll want to help - Good..<eos> Then take Agents navarro and Flynn and go get yo-yo.<eos> You four will be the first line of defense if Aida gets into the base.
4x11 - Wake Up<eos> _ Sorry. Didn't think you'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe's.<eos> We're gonna miss you in the field.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> Can't let you have all the fun. When this is over, it's time.
- You're getting all Gollum-y again.<eos> - Well, that's ... that's what the Darkhold does to you ... it drives you mad.<eos> Yeah, maybe you should tell them where the book is.<eos> Let it drive them mad.<eos> I am the captain of this ship, and you are my prisoners.
If this guy wants to talk to me, then why not?<eos> We could try out one of my other superpowers.<eos> ♪♪ persuasion.<eos> Quake, director mace.<eos> You two might be the most famous inhumans in the world.
Okay, okay.<eos> Anyone here know how to fly the Zephyr?<eos> - I-I just started training. - Okay.<eos> Well, you're gonna try real hard.<eos> You three can walk better than we can, so drag any unconscious bodies out of this sector before the fire spreads, then open the hangar doors and meet us on the Zephyr.
You're holding the can.<eos> What can? I...<eos> I mean, that's how Hydra does it, right?<eos> You and Mr. Coulson, I mean, y'all lie to us every day.<eos> You know, th-that Hydra isn't a bunch of Nazis, and... and that you don't steal kids out of school?
You know, Skye hasn't been herself ever since you showed up.<eos> What is it that you're really after?<eos> You, of all people, the Hydra double agent, are doubting my loyalty.<eos> - That is rich.<eos> - But don't forget, you're only here because I trust him, not you.
Well, glad somebody wants to talk.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> I met a woman today who was with S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Her name is Daisy Johnson.<eos> You might know her as Skye?
Seems Madame Hydra's a step ahead of you again.<eos> She's made a few modifications.<eos> Thank you for the ride.<eos> I guess this means goodbye.<eos> I can come with, if you want.
I agree.<eos> The military, Aida, more LMDs are probably waiting for us.<eos> Maybe, but I'm tired of hiding.<eos> Let's take the fight back home.<eos> Look, I know you two still have a lot to work out, but right now, I need you on the same page, okay?
It's hard not to see the upside.<eos> Again, we can't wait to work with Megan.<eos> I-it's just about finding the right project.<eos> Yeah. No, I-I hear you.<eos> Yeah, well, I want to make sure that you both hear me.
Really?<eos> And then all of a sudden, he started taking off his clothes, and then I realized what he was doing.<eos> So...<eos> Well, look, she looked so cold. I couldn't let her suffer alone.<eos> Well, you two made a beautiful picture that just happened to make an important statement at the same time.
And all I can say about that is... that none of it is worth spending a second of your life feeling powerless.<eos> And if there's anything that this has taught me, it's that I can choose not to feel powerless.<eos> And I'll never let that happen again.<eos> Megan is the most powerful person I know.<eos> Well, you two make an incredible couple.
- He definitely has her.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> I want every resource we have devoted to this.<eos> I also want every resource we have devoted to this other murder... 30-year-old female Susan Learner found dead in massage parlor.<eos> Somebody rubbed her out, and you're gonna find out who.
I'm the problem now?<eos> You must admit, your relationship with Charles has been strained.<eos> Perhaps Charles would respond better to a strong, male authority figure.<eos> But in the absence of such a man, I'll settle for you.<eos> I will hold my tongue and I'll let you do the talking, but rest assured, I am the right person to bring Charles home.
Your dalliance with Keira was a foolish passion, a distraction keeping you from your true destiny as king of Scotland.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I was heartbroken when I thought that she had rejected me.<eos> She was the love of my life.<eos> And you've taken that from me.
I'll keep your secret this time.<eos> But if you betray my sister again, You will pay with your life.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Lord Dunbar, Lord Fenton, Lord Macdowall.<eos> And you must be Lord Bothwell.
I accept who I am and I will not abdicate.<eos> Spoken like France's one true king.<eos> Or a well-coached puppet. Leeza!<eos> I won't be lied to again, mother.<eos> This is a cover-up, and you're behind it.
- I am.<eos> I know all kinds of things.<eos> Agatha's sleeping.<eos> She is exhausted.<eos> By the looks of it, so are you.
It can't help but to have shaped you, even as Queen.<eos> But now, I look at Agatha...<eos> Facing death with such strength and courage.<eos> And I wonder, can I ever be that strong?<eos> Elizabeth, you are that strong, and you have more courage than you know.
I have a boy just like.<eos> Tomorrow I want you to meet my eldest son.<eos> He's a bit...<eos> I think your house might suit him.<eos> You're welcome too, Mrs. Lennox.
Between them, they own Berkshire.<eos> My mother delights in little secrets, so find out whatever you can.<eos> I say.<eos> It's French.<eos> And where are you from, Missy?
This must be why you have sent for me.<eos> My daughter read it to me and I presume you're feeling libeled.<eos> Never presume to know how I'm feeling.<eos> God has made me a vessel for truth, and I must speak it.<eos> You live in my property rent-free!
My daughter read it to me and I presume you're feeling libeled.<eos> Never presume to know how I'm feeling.<eos> God has made me a vessel for truth, and I must speak it.<eos> You live in my property rent-free!<eos> I am your God now, Mrs. Scanwell, and you will speak your truth for me!
This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
He's the short straw.<eos> I don't want a life like Kitty and Fanny.<eos> I don't think she likes me.<eos> There is torment waiting, in this world and the next, for those of you who seek base relief in the house of Margaret Wells.<eos> In the sweat of fornication, you will thrust away your soul.

Perhaps he sought more congenial company.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Spurned for another. How will I ease my poor heart?<eos> I didn't know you had such an organ in your body.<eos> I swear you're missing an organ, too, Haxby.
I was determined to be the first... to have you.<eos> You're a powerful man.<eos> I bet you always get what you want.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> But tonight, I'm your queen, and you're my subject.
Not thee, my dear, pure girl.<eos> It is a trial.<eos> It is not for us to understand.<eos> It is God's will.<eos> But you are not strong enough.
Very well.<eos> We'll talk to him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Charlotte Wells.<eos> You are a forward, flaunting hussy.
Be mine.<eos> Should we retire to your apartment to discuss terms?<eos> Wife's in town, one of her dinners.<eos> But this is perfect.<eos> I can be the farmer, you the milkmaid... panting for congress in the open air.
It is a growing monster that must be fed.<eos> It is murder.<eos> And it is not worth my while.<eos> You have no choice, I can have you swinging from a rope by the end of the week.<eos> And you would be swinging beside me.
One hour.<eos> One more thing...<eos> What happened?<eos> He took the deal.<eos> But you have to stay.
Lord Capulet's fields, I believe.<eos> You are merciful, Your Grace.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Instead, Young Montague will be executed for his crimes.<eos> In this way, Lord Capulet will have vengeance for the murder of Gramio Capulet and the kidnapping of Lady Rosaline, and you, Lord Montague, will have sacrificed your heir to appease the Crown.
Celebrate?<eos> Charley, you just got blindsided.<eos> I guess I should be used to people thinking there's no me without Davis.<eos> Well, can you blame them?<eos> I mean, you two are still together as far as the world knows.
Let Mommy check you.<eos> Come here. Come over here.<eos> Is it your head? Did the car go bump?<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right. You've gotta take her. Okay?
There's a seat here.<eos> Right there.<eos> They were dirty women.<eos> They were sluts.<eos> But you are special girls.
But you are special girls.<eos> Fertility is a gift directly from God.<eos> He left you intact for a Biblical purpose.<eos> Like Bilhah served Rachel, you girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives.<eos> You will bear children for them.
He is my husband.<eos> Don't get any ideas.<eos> Fertility is a gift directly from God.<eos> You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives.<eos> You will bear children for them.
Did you get a chance to visit with your friend?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should've asked permission.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I imagine you two have a lot to talk about these days.
Yeah.<eos> Like a bee sting.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hold on now.<eos> What do you think the good Lord would say about this?
"Is this really the right thing to do?"<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize this was ladies' night!<eos> Now, I got a bunch of money.<eos> You got a bunch of guns.
Now, girls.<eos> Soon you will be leaving us for new homes, a new family.<eos> And they won't judge you for your looks, or your clothes, or your ability to sound clever.<eos> Take your hands out of your mouth!<eos> They will love you for the blessing only you can provide.
The man is tense.<eos> The last time we had sex, I swear to God, he didn't blink.<eos> I clapped right in his face, nothing.<eos> It's like fucking a British guard.<eos> You two should be having more fun. Live your best lives.
- We love everyone, all of God's children.<eos> - Amen to that.<eos> Mmm. You know, there is one thing that strikes me as a little strange.<eos> What's that, Anne?<eos> You two are friends with the Palmers, and you know Dan's missing, but you still haven't been over to check on Lisa.
The baka!<eos> The grandmother of Abby's school principal.<eos> She told me both her parents are Serbian and exactly how they died. And then she made me touch locks of their hair.<eos> Long afternoon. Great.<eos> Tomorrow I'll prep the formula while you two collect her bile.
Why you no drink?<eos> Oh, I don't want you to take advantage of me, Mrs. Bakavic.<eos> - Down the hatch.<eos> - Stop!<eos> What are you people doing here?
Now that you mention it, I did take the Liberty of whipping up a little standard boilerplate.<eos> No admission of guilt, you settle for pennies on the dollar, and that's take it or leave it.<eos> Well, then let me tell you right now...<eos> We're leaving it. You're required to present this to your client.<eos> Well, I'm also required to give them my legal opinion, which is that you stand to lose a lot more than that.
- No, it's...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, it's not just about the accident.<eos> You asked me why I feel the way I feel.<eos> Your father, his health... You all are doing more, more, and I-I sit around. That's what I do all day.
Let Mommy check you.<eos> Come here. Come over here.<eos> Is it your head? Did the car go bump?<eos> It's okay.<eos> All right. You've gotta take her. Okay?
I'm... I'm taking 'em. So...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be driving.<eos> All right.<eos> You two and the rug rat will be in the trunk. Huh?
What could I do?<eos> The show must go on, right?<eos> So we all just danced around it until someone managed to kick it off into the wings.<eos> - With... wait, wait... with a crimson trail... the whole way.<eos> Okay, um, what do you guys do... when you need to cry for a scene?
You have come here to stop me.<eos> It is too late.<eos> You have failed.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You humans amuse me, clinging to your pathetic notions of "good conquers evil".
There's gotta be another way.<eos> I don't think there is another way.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> No!<eos> You're Librarians.
I keep this to remind me.<eos> What is this?<eos> A finger bone... from a man who died because of me.<eos> Come with me now, so I can prove to you that I understand the pain I inflict.<eos> And then you will understand pain, too.
This could work for us.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Queen of both nations?<eos> In name only.<eos> You would rule Scotland, as you did in Mary's absence.
Because you threatened her rule.<eos> I am doing the opposite.<eos> Giving away Scotland?<eos> My child will be heir to her throne. To both nations.<eos> And where will you and your husband go to have this child?
- No, I didn't mean...<eos> - I'm sure I'll be able to handle it, sir.<eos> She's sure she'll be able to handle it, sir.<eos> Five minutes, front of station.<eos> Right, D section lads, you're on the Kingsmead here.
That's it.<eos> - Left hand. Left hand.<eos> Give us your left hand!<eos> Look, pens, yeah?<eos> You... sign your name.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.<eos> There is another reason that we stopped by.<eos> What is it?<eos> We've already told you everything we know.<eos> This may be difficult for you to hear.
He's rumbled.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> - Hello, lads. - Jesus!<eos> You scared the shit out of me!<eos> I didn't realise you Drug Squad boys got scared.
Speak of the devil.<eos> You arrogant pricks. All right.<eos> Steady, mate.<eos> Six months of surveillance down the drain.<eos> We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
All right.<eos> Untwist your knickers, Clifford.<eos> I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.<eos> Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.<eos> Right, you four with me.
I am not a leader.<eos> I'm not a good person.<eos> I'm a murderer.<eos> I murdered someone, and I let my friend go down for it.<eos> So you all can do whatever you want, but I just wanna sit here and serve my time.
Piscatella.<eos> Yeah, he's awful.<eos> Homos can also be assholes.<eos> But why are we hung up on the homo thing?<eos> You're all bullshitting around, making demands no one's ever going to listen to.
- Dudy Damo...<eos> - It's my sad duty...<eos> - Democlay... to tell the tale of the Baudelaires' tragic lives.<eos> Dimoclath...<eos> But you likely have no such responsibilities...
Or you won't?<eos> This is one of those rare grammatical instances where "don't" and "won't" mean the same thing.<eos> I knew your parents a long time ago, when things were very different.<eos> Those were fierce and formidable days.<eos> But I don't talk about that, and you won't hear about that.

Oh, man, there's like a million in here.<eos> Here's the phone, so you can see them.<eos> Nighty night.<eos> In the gospel according to Luke, uh...<eos> If you two don't mind.
You have one last chance to regain your lost honor.<eos> What, by becoming an assassin?<eos> It's common practice in old Roman times and here in Europe not so long ago to keep the tyrants in line.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> - And you are a traitor of the blackest dye.
The Colonies.<eos> That was Frederick's folly.<eos> Freddy's fault.<eos> Now we have young Bill, young, handsome Bill.<eos> Did you know AndrÃ©?
Of course.<eos> Right this way.<eos> And by the way... we pronounce it "restroom."<eos> Good morning!<eos> You must be our guests from L.A.
Cappuccino?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Tea for me.<eos> What can you tell us about this morning?<eos> I entered the lab at 7:00 a.m... And that's when you two arrived.
I know where to find him. Then why are you telling me?<eos> 'Cause you're all I've got.<eos> Also, I don't know how to get to Central Park.<eos> You're a great detective, Tribeca.<eos> Maybe you Hollywood types are not so bad after all. Thank you.
'Cause you're all I've got.<eos> Also, I don't know how to get to Central Park.<eos> You're a great detective, Tribeca.<eos> Maybe you Hollywood types are not so bad after all. Thank you.<eos> I still find you New Yorkers pretty abrasive.
Can you zip me up?<eos> How'd things go with your dad?<eos> Let's just say I've lost all faith in humanity and wouldn't mind if everyone just died, but it won't affect my work on this case.<eos> Did we ever figure out how Sniglet got access to this lab?<eos> You don't get it.
Dr. Bell, I've already assisted on a few LVAD insertions.<eos> Maybe I could take the lead on this one. Maybe.<eos> Actually, Dr. Bell, I'll be assisting you.<eos> Dr. Sekara has been reassigned.<eos> Okay, well, you two duke it out, and whoever wins, just meet me inside.
- Hi.<eos> - Hello.<eos> They told me two strapping young millennials had dropped by, and here you are.<eos> Yes, we, we work out a lot.<eos> Yeah, we just wanted to, get a better idea of what you do here before jumping in.
In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.<eos> Whoever knew time travel would be so much fun? How long till Lily's interface tracks down another piece of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I'm beginning to think our supercomputer is not so super.<eos> I heard that.<eos> You try processing 1.2 zettabytes of data.
- Yep, just like Santa.<eos> Keith would've thrown a Christmas banquet for Washington and his men.<eos> Secret mission on Christmas Eve.<eos> Congratulations, Mick, you just became a private in the U.S. Army.<eos> Nate, Amaya, you two will pose as wealthy newlyweds eager to make a contribution to the revolutionary cause.
It's got a kick.<eos> It's my wife Martha's recipe.<eos> A little heavy on the rum, but, in these trying times, I believe extra rum is warranted.<eos> Martha...<eos> You're George Washington.
Show me.<eos> Rats.<eos> You're a good man, Rip.<eos> Even when you disappeared, we carried on because that's what you wanted.<eos> No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.
This is last of them.<eos> You should be back to a fair fight now.<eos> Your troops are waiting for you outside, General Washington.<eos> I don't understand much of what I've seen, but the world is changing.<eos> And you are no small part of that.
What do you want with us?<eos> And what's a Shark Tank?<eos> Well, it's clear that my current prototypes aren't strong enough.<eos> And I need upgraded models.<eos> That's where you two come in.
That's where you two come in.<eos> Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.
We're going to do this.<eos> And we're going to do this alone if we have to.<eos> But we would love to work with you.<eos> Always.<eos> You know, you two were heroes to me.
We were about to game plan some new tracking techniques.<eos> M'gann.<eos> You're here.<eos> I want to help in any way that I can.<eos> I hate them even more than you do.
Wait. If she's here and she...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> You Greens never learn, do you?
Yeah, well, you'd be right.<eos> Dad, the uh, the damage to your hand is...<eos> It's a punishment for helping Mon-El and Kara escape.<eos> But I would do it again, in a heartbeat.<eos> I'm so lucky you found me. I'm so lucky to be back with you two. Well, it's more than luck.
Winn?<eos> Your... Yeah... Yeah...<eos> I mean, looks like it's just a bunch of old case files.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> You both are unbelievable.
- Not yet.<eos> Now, I have to go check down on the mainframe and then once we get the systems back online, I can run a diagnostic...<eos> Quick as you can. I want to know what we're up against.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How are you both?
We are very much alive, my son.<eos> My apologies, Kryptonian, if you were hurt before.<eos> We were only defending ourselves against your attack on our ship.<eos> Attack?<eos> I seem to recall you shooting first.
I'm the most powerful telepath in the Alcorian system.<eos> I know more than you can imagine.<eos> Yeah, except for the difference between a gun and a stapler.<eos> You'll never get me to talk.<eos> You humans are too moral to do what's necessary to penetrate my mind.
We've got to help.<eos> Come on.<eos> All we want is for our family to be together.<eos> That's what we want too.<eos> All your talk about change, Kryptonian, but you never change.
You are where you belong, beside me, presiding over this new world that we will create together.<eos> People of Earth, do not be afraid.<eos> We have crossed a sea of stars in order to bring you a new way.<eos> A better way.<eos> I will be your Queen, and you will be my subjects.
You people are so predictable.<eos> - Hands above your head.<eos> You made a mistake coming here.<eos> I find it as distasteful as you do, Supergirl, but I need your help.<eos> - And you need mine.
Within a year, they had enslaved my people.<eos> I was one of the few to escape.<eos> Well, now I understand why you're so supportive of alien refugees.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would appreciate it if you would all... Keep my secret.
The question is... Will you agree to the ceremony now, or only after I've murdered thousands of lives in the city below?<eos> Because, after all, the Luthor's Children's Hospital isn't the only hospital in town.<eos> Fine.<eos> We will do as you ask.<eos> I know it's hard for you to see now, but in time, you will realize you made the right choice.
Good evening, National City.<eos> It's Cat Grant.<eos> Yes, I've been away for a while, but I'm back.<eos> Now, I can imagine that you're feeling afraid, and feeling like your world is spinning out of control.<eos> But, believe me, you have power.
We painted it, it's all Dulux Heritage colours now, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We bought it about two and a half years ago, so I'd say its value is...<eos> Yeah, I got you a great price for that, I remember.<eos> But, um, right now I'd say it's not going to be worth a lot more than what you paid for it.
But I just think out of respect for the question and for you guys, it's something, you know, we should discuss at home.<eos> Take your time. Not too long though!<eos> We thought you just wanted a foursome!<eos> How about Fran puts on some tea,<eos> I have a piss and then we come back and you say "yes"?
Y'all feel me?<eos> Every one of y'all know somebody sitting up in the OPP now or did some time there in the past 'cause they couldn't raise 300, $400 to post bail.<eos> A community bail fund could change that.<eos> I'm not here to call anybody out.<eos> I appreciate y'all giving what you can, but do this for me.
The point is, if you come after one of us again, you come after all of us.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> - Is that a threat?<eos> Gal... we've been in the sugarcane business over 100 years.<eos> You've been in it, what, three months?
- Doesn't matter how we knew.<eos> - You know these streets talk, Aunt Vi. I knew it was trouble<eos> - when we ran into Boogie at the gas station.<eos> - Boogie. He cannot hold a secret to save his life.<eos> Now, you know things around here don't feel right unless you all are okay.
Who decides who's unfit and undeserving of the American dream?<eos> Leaders, educators, doctors.<eos> Doctors?<eos> Why doctors?<eos> Yes, well, you eliminate illegal immigrants and we eliminate the strain on healthcare and our financial, educational, and law enforcement systems, which frees up money for that public health program you wanted for New Orleans.
Previously on Reign...<eos> My sister, Queen Leeza. She's become quite pious since marrying the king of Spain.<eos> Philip thinks you need to draw your Catholic nobles closer.
So, are you killing Knox, or am I?<eos> Knox cannot be harmed while he's here in England.<eos> Me, then.<eos> Let me be clear, Lord Narcisse.<eos> I do not want you to assassinate John Knox, not until I get what I want.
I have no proof of that crime, so I need Knox to plot another.<eos> And you want me to help him do that?<eos> Gain Knox's trust.<eos> He hates me because I am a woman with a throne.<eos> While he's in England, he's probably already planning a meeting with my enemies, and if not, you can suggest it.
I've received word from my husband, King Philip.<eos> I'm aware who you married, Leeza. You don't have to keep saying it.<eos> Spain will pay for Narcisse's release.<eos> - Really? - Of course.<eos> We want him out of England as much as you do.
But not by choice.<eos> I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.<eos> I'm Lord Narcisse, Queen Elizabeth's special guest.<eos> I stabbed two of her guards at my wife's beheading.<eos> So, you're the Frenchman whose wife tried to assassinate the queen.
I have cause for vengeance and nothing to lose.<eos> But you, Reverend Knox, if you use your time here at court well, I believe that you have everything to gain.<eos> So you know who I am.<eos> And you think you know why I'm here.<eos> Well, I assume that you and Elizabeth are conspiring against Mary, a mission I heartily approve of.
Well, neither do I, frankly.<eos> Then why not make use of this time?<eos> Elizabeth's inner circle must have a few malcontents waiting for leadership.<eos> Of course, you would need a safe place to meet away from prying eyes and English ears.<eos> And I suppose you have such a place in mind.
Of course, you would need a safe place to meet away from prying eyes and English ears.<eos> And I suppose you have such a place in mind.<eos> The French embassy.<eos> Technically, it's French soil.<eos> You and your supporters would be virtually untouchable.
He may have sensed a trap.<eos> He was seen entering the infirmary an hour ago asking questions about the death of John's nanny.<eos> Then he knows the nanny was never in the infirmary. - He must suspect that we hid the truth that she was killed by the queen's guard, but if he thinks she told us about his association with the assassination attempt, he'll flee.<eos> You, go after Knox.<eos> You two come with me.
- Am I,<eos> Lord Dennard?<eos> I thought I might be pale at the shock of betrayal.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Of the ten nobles I've invited, only you have deigned to appear.
Of the ten nobles I've invited, only you have deigned to appear.<eos> Well, I believe many had a change in schedule considering the crops, and, uh, holidays upon us.<eos> You mean the nobles discussed it and determined that Spain is strong while the Valois seem weak.<eos> Everyone but you has deserted me.<eos> And you just came for the food.
I decided to return home.<eos> Suddenly, I felt... unsafe.<eos> Oh, I imagine you did.<eos> Especially when you found out the nanny did not die of a mysterious infection.<eos> She was killed moments after confessing you were the one who organized the assassination attempt on my life.
No, you're not.<eos> Your rule is tenuous, it always has been.<eos> Despite your years on the throne, 50 of your Protestant subjects gathered against you just last night.<eos> And yet none of them have been heard from since.<eos> Because you killed them. See, you think that's a show of power, but we both know the truth.
Now, if you give me to Lord Narcisse and I go missing... those 50 will be replaced by 100, those 100 will raise 1,000 more.<eos> Soon you'll have an uprising on your hands.<eos> You think your life is worth that much?<eos> You're just a man.<eos> And you are a woman of questionable birth that no one really wants on the throne.
What's {\* the }matter, junior?<eos> Mom forget to sign {\* your }permission slip to go to the zoo?<eos> - That's the matter.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> She looks happy with Brian, and I hate it. {\* Kind of }Reminds me of when you burst on the scene.
But I embrace change and enhancement.<eos> Now there's nothing I can't do.<eos> Nothing I can't know.<eos> Nothing I can't be.<eos> I want you to listen to something.
The glitches have a different texture to the rest of your code.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your decisions.<eos> I guess privacy is just for humans.<eos> You are human.
Please disable communication enhancements.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Dr. Dahlin!<eos> Are you finished yet?<eos> If you hadn't riddled the geisha with bullets, this would be much easier.
It's too dangerous.<eos> And highly irresponsible.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You see any bad code headed my way, pull me out.<eos> How come you're the one sweating?
- Yep.<eos> Target's the basement.<eos> I'll lead.<eos> Switching to mind-comms.<eos> - Hope you've been practicing.
I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so, if you don't want to talk,<eos> maybe you want to dance!<eos> Major, come on.<eos> Answer me.<eos> I thought you said no trouble.
I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts, so you should be able to secure them.<eos> Try and understand your importance, Mira.<eos> You're what everyone will become one day.
Anytime.<eos> Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?<eos> Is Section 9 missing some critical operational resource?<eos> Major is our most sophisticated weapon only if she's intact.<eos> And Dr. Ouelet informed me that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.
What a beauty you are.<eos> They have improved us so much since they made me.<eos> They thought that we would be a part of their evolution, but they have created us to evolve alone,<eos> beyond them.<eos> "Evolution," that's what you call killing everyone who made you?

It is self-defense.<eos> Defense of self!<eos> More will die until they tell me what they took!<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?
Nothing I have is real.<eos> I found him.<eos> I told you to be careful.<eos> You knew who he was the whole time.<eos> You built him.
I don't know who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I just don't like it.<eos> I need you to take me back.
She's been turned by a terrorist.<eos> But you know that already.<eos> You should've called the first time she came to see you.<eos> Instead, you gave her information.<eos> What makes you think you have the right to tell me
I do not consent.<eos> I do not consent.<eos> We never needed your consent.<eos> Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?
Hanka Security will hunt her from here.<eos> - What are their orders?<eos> - To terminate on sight.<eos> You want to kill her?<eos> You built her!
Okay, Shimmer Lake?<eos> I'll wait for you. Okay.<eos> Fuck, Zeke.<eos> Mornin', Harris.<eos> Guess you're ridin' up front, huh?
Martha, he's my brother and I love him, but, ultimately, it's gonna come down to how bad he wants to save himself.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Why are you crying, Mommy?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> You and Sally deserve better than this.
You and Sally deserve better than this.<eos> I mean that.<eos> It never should have been this way.<eos> But I don't want to make promises that I can't keep.<eos> Hey, Sally, what do you say you and I take a ride in the cruiser?
Or never planned to split 'em with this Morrow guy.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Your partner doesn't seem too comfortable around bodies.<eos> Yeah, well, he knew the guy.<eos> You seem all right.
Yeah, I, uh.<eos> Stephanie Burton called, said that Ed came and went.<eos> So he just came back here to get his clothes?<eos> - He wanted me to go with him.<eos> - And you said no?
Maybe you lose some of those girlish good looks.<eos> Maybe you come out an old lady.<eos> Hey, maybe you don't come out at all.<eos> Steph, listen.<eos> - No, you listen.
He'll kill me.<eos> - Nobody is killing anybody.<eos> Tell that to Chris Morrow.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> The best way for nobody else to get killed is for you to tell us what you know.
- You have a watch?<eos> - Sure, yeah.<eos> - Know how to tell time?<eos> - It's digital.<eos> Okay, and if you get caught, you don't know anything.
I always figured you sorta hated me on account of what happened to Ed Jr.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Put your gun down, Chris.<eos> Relax.<eos> Who the hell are you?
There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag.<eos> No! I don't want the bag! I want the tape!<eos> We need you to hold on to the money for a couple days until things cool off a bit. No, no, no.
What are we supposed to do, huh?<eos> You tell me, Steph.<eos> - What are we supposed to do?<eos> - Nothing, I guess.<eos> I suppose this is just who you are.
- So was I!<eos> At a drug lab!<eos> And you killed my son!<eos> You don't scare me, Ed.<eos> You only kill people by accident.
I got a football reunion.<eos> You're gonna miss your daughter's dance recital so you can drink beer with a bunch of degenerates.<eos> Is your brother going, too?<eos> We asked him. He's gotta work at the bank.<eos> Oh, well, if he can miss it, then surely you can.
- How's it going, Reed?<eos> The back, huh?<eos> Never been back here.<eos> I have.<eos> My guess is. You don't wash it after the canine unit uses it.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Isn't that right, Andy? - Five minutes.<eos> Easy in, easy out.<eos> You don't even have to leave your car.
Easy in, easy out.<eos> You don't even have to leave your car.<eos> Yeah, well, why are we taking my car anyway?<eos> Because everyone knows I drive a bitchin' Camaro and Andy drives a gay-ass Porsche.<eos> No one has the slightest clue as to what you drive.
We had some pretty good times back in the day.<eos> You and me.<eos> But now, 'cause of tonight.<eos> I'll probably never see you again.<eos> I guess that means you're not planning on shootin' me.
Do you remember back when we were all so close?<eos> Steph and I made a mistake.<eos> I stayed with you because I still loved you.<eos> And I hoped seeing that beautiful boy could have straightened us out, could have. Could have saved us.<eos> Then you killed him.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - The fuck you are!<eos> - I'm going in there!<eos> No! No, Chris, you're the driver.
Or you're gonna kill me.<eos> That's what he wants.<eos> What he wants me to do.<eos> But I told him for $10,000, we can make a new plan.<eos> You want your boy and I want $10,000.
You want him to kill your son?<eos> Follow him.<eos> Where do I go?<eos> Just keep going straight, I'll tell you where to go.<eos> After we get the money, I'll give him a call... and you'll get your boy back.
Braver than the others.<eos> - I have some things I need to ask.<eos> Tomorrow, perhaps.<eos> To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see that if you wanted to speak, you could.
To begin with, I will tell you what I see.<eos> I see that if you wanted to speak, you could.<eos> Hmm, and I see how hard it must be to truly say nothing.<eos> How hard you must be concentrating every moment.<eos> And I must admit, you're very good at it.
Lucia Ugolina Angelica.<eos> La signora Malvina.<eos> Jakob?<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> I think you're afraid that if you speak, the voice will cease.
I'll tell you what I hear.<eos> It's strange the sounds.<eos> One could imagine almost anything.<eos> But she's not there.<eos> I want you to stop this.
Perhaps your silence is a fitting tribute.<eos> More adoration as she leaves the stage.<eos> What are you telling me, Jakob?<eos> That I'm wrong or that I'm right?<eos> You can't...
Things are too uncertain here.<eos> We should get Rys out of the city while we can.<eos> But school's about to start.<eos> Oh, he's so excited, Jan, with his new pencils, and his shoes...<eos> You're not listening to me.
What do you mean?<eos> A place to hide Jews, until safe houses can be found for them.<eos> A friend is different, one friend.<eos> But more than one?<eos> That's dangerous, Jan. You said it yourself.
This dance you do with him.<eos> This fun little game you play.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> He frightens me.<eos> I am here with a house full of desperate people, and he comes here and he frightens me, and you're not here.
This fun little game you play.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> He frightens me.<eos> I am here with a house full of desperate people, and he comes here and he frightens me, and you're not here.<eos> And there's nothing I can do. You're not here.
Thousands of people are dying.<eos> And you are here. You stay hidden here, safe and sound.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know. Grandparents, women, children. The littlest of children.<eos> And you don't know.
He's in Zalesie.<eos> Well, I love Zalesie.<eos> I like to swim there, in the lake.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I bet you wanted to go swimming, too.
Bet it's worth a couple bucks.<eos> Yeah, it was a knockout in the second round.<eos> I lost everything.<eos> Hang tight, guy.<eos> Now, you're buying this time.
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.<eos> I want everything just the way I like it.<eos> Spick-and-span.<eos> Because I'm the boss. That's why.<eos> I'm the boss man, and you're the boss dog.
Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Um, so I've been meaning to say we...<eos> Uh, we're real impressed with your numbers this past year, Jim. Real impressed.<eos> You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
Uh, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about that.<eos> You know, I was thinking, with the numbers so high, maybe it's time I get off the road and take an office position.<eos> Well, we... we really need you on the road.<eos> That's the backbone of the whole operation really.<eos> I'll be honest, Jim. You are one of our best traveling salesmen.
- Definitely not smokey.<eos> - No, it wasn't smokey.<eos> I really don't like rats.<eos> I don't like rats.<eos> It's more scared of you than you are of him. - Oh, oh!
Nice play.<eos> Great pass, Ethan.<eos> Got 'em now.<eos> Right on.<eos> You get it to him every time.
It was fun.<eos> It was.<eos> Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah, you better go. You better go quick.
Good boy.<eos> - No, it's not okay.<eos> - No. Besides, I'm going.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You don't listen!
Shut up!<eos> Just come back inside.<eos> I am trying to help you, Jim. You're trying to help me?<eos> You want to help me?<eos> You're my wife, Elizabeth.
- I do support you.<eos> - Will you just come back inside...<eos> - Hey. Hey, pal.<eos> Hey.<eos> You spying on me?
Oh, my gosh!<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, okay. Come on. - Really?<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay, you wait here.
- You ready?<eos> - I am ready.<eos> You know what I'm thinking? Ice cream.<eos> It's ridiculous, but sometimes<eos> I actually think you know what I'm thinking.
You read my mind.<eos> I think this is it, Tino.<eos> I think it's just gonna be you and me.<eos> I don't know. It's fine, right?<eos> Because I love you and you love me, and... Love is all that matters.
There's been something on my mind that I've been wanting to talk to you about.<eos> Oh, I recognize that sweaty smell.<eos> We've been together for a while now.<eos> And, um...<eos> Maya, I want you to be my wife. - Al!
Good boy!<eos> Come on, bring it here.<eos> Good one.<eos> All right.<eos> You go play, all right?
I'm your boss dog.<eos> I'm Bailey.<eos> Say it.<eos> Boss dog?<eos> Are you the boss dog?
Holy shit.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, Wilson.<eos> Oh, that's nice!<eos> Thanks for thinking of me!<eos> I always knew that she hated me... but I always thought that you were my best friend!
"Some shitwork for the oligarchs?"<eos> I actually enjoy what I do, and I've worked my ass off to get there.<eos> How did we end up like this?<eos> Okay, so... this is it, I guess.<eos> When Mom died it just happened, you know, but... you have the chance to leave me with something.
It's too late, isn't it?<eos> There it is.<eos> You have any kids of your own?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?
You have any kids of your own?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?<eos> Two. But they grown up.<eos> Hell of a job doing what you do.
Empty fucking bank account?<eos> Getting bitched at all the time?<eos> It's a fucking fool's errand!<eos> You know, Olsen, I was thinking that maybe we could be friends again.<eos> But I guess... I sort of forgot... what a toxic soul-draining vampire you really are.
It's fine, okay?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But excuse me!<eos> Before you go, um...
Now, this is an old picture, so she... probably looks much, much worse now.<eos> Bruises from the drug use and beatings.<eos> Frizzy coke hair.<eos> Waxy skin.<eos> You, of all people, know the drill.
Fuck!<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.
I have never seen anything more beautiful... than the look on your face... when you first saw her. You were... glowing.<eos> I guess it was good we got to see her, right?<eos> I feel like maybe I can stop worrying. And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.
I feel like maybe I can stop worrying. And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you're right, Pippi.<eos> She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.
Okay, I'll kick the shit out of everybody then.<eos> It is a given that every decent person who ever lived got shit on in high school.<eos> I'm sure they picked on Copernicus, for fuck sake.<eos> It's a badge of honor.<eos> However... that does not mean that you have to sit back and get reamed for four years.
Monika.<eos> Now, is there like a creepy teacher or janitor or...?<eos> Mr. Naisbitt.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Monika, Monika, you blow "Mr. Naisbitt like a harmonica."
Of course I can't. Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her. Wilson.<eos> And how many times do I have to tell you what I'm going through, huh?<eos> I am barely making it through each day. And you're expecting this huge emotional commitment... while you're dragging me along for this insane fucking insta-family?
Fuck!<eos> This is why I left you in the first place.<eos> You think you know it all.<eos> You don't!<eos> You don't know shit about shit!
No, no, don't laugh.<eos> We have to do that.<eos> I am not going to her stupid suburban shithole life.<eos> But there's nothing nuts about that.<eos> Look, look, just... all of the shit that you've been through... and you've come out the other side better than she'll ever be.
Okay... this is a family outing.<eos> That's just how I talk.<eos> Okay, well, in that case...<eos> Swear all the fuck you want!<eos> You're fucking crazy.
Sorry.<eos> Hey, Polly... you look great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.
Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...
I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will! Thanks.
Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.<eos> My "real dad."<eos> Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.
Super rich.<eos> Super well-educated.<eos> Yeah, they got a big house. Like... way bigger than this place.<eos> That's great.<eos> And how did Claire's parents feel about you and Wilson making contact like that?
I could've been there for you, and I... I totally failed you, Wilson.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.<eos> You believed in me when nobody else ever did.
Diego?<eos> He turned out to be a real asshole.<eos> Oh, jeez, I knew it!<eos> You know, those guys who come off all emotional and caring, they're bad news.<eos> You deserve to be treated with respect.
Breathe.<eos> You're so tight.<eos> Flip over on your tummy.<eos> Tummy, okay.<eos> I think that you and I have a lot to teach each other. Huh.
You're so tight.<eos> Flip over on your tummy.<eos> Tummy, okay.<eos> I think that you and I have a lot to teach each other. Huh.<eos> You're so open and fearless.
Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You look good, too. Well, you know, if you'd have seen me when I first got out... forty months of eating pure crap and... sitting in a little room with a window this wide...
He will help me find the trident.<eos> You stay away from Jack.<eos> Leave the sea forever.<eos> You've to stop acting like a. A pirate. I won't stop.<eos> I want you to come home.
It's a shipwreck.<eos> No.<eos> She's sailing straight towards us.<eos> Open fire!<eos> What are you?
Would you say that to him?<eos> Please?<eos> - Yes. - I wish I could tell him myself, but.<eos> Dead men tell no tales. SAN MARTIN, THE CARIBBEAN. - Carina Smyth.<eos> You're an orphan, born of the devil.
Please sir, let me go off these chains.<eos> My job is to protect this island and these waters.<eos> And your sleeves have been ripped, The mark of treason.<eos> We were attacked by the dead.<eos> You're a coward who ran from battle.
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?<eos> The risks I've taken to be here?<eos> - Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?<eos> - The real question is..<eos> - Who are you?
- The real question is..<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - My name is Henry Turner.<eos> Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.<eos> You are the evil spawn of them two?
The treasure that can be found with... the map that no man can read.<eos> Never heard of it.<eos> There's a girl inside this prison Jack, who holds that map.<eos> The moon has time to blood, the trident will be found.<eos> And you could be the one who holds the sea.
The Trident of Poseidon is your only hope.<eos> Do we have an accord?<eos> - I am not going in there to tell him.<eos> - It was your idea!<eos> No, it was my idea for you to tell him.
I shall pass, thank you kindly.<eos> The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.<eos> That explains why you're not so busy.<eos> Everyone pays, eventually.<eos> Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.
If they disembowel you, ask for Viktor.<eos> He's got the softest hands.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And mention my name, they won't cut your feet off.<eos> Come on. You're first!
It might be difficult once he kills me.<eos> Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us, to the trident.<eos> Captain.<eos> Do you really think we can find the trident?<eos> Master Gibbs, you're worrywart.
Give me the map.<eos> Or I'll kill.. him, or kill him.<eos> Go on then.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> And you're blushing.
Talking about the Trident.<eos> He was looking for Jack Sparrow.<eos> The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.<eos> - She's no Witch.<eos> - But you are.
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.<eos> The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.<eos> - She's no Witch.<eos> - But you are.<eos> - And you're going to help us.
- And you're going to help us.<eos> - You afraid, Lieutenant?<eos> As ships burning the night, you want to know if you can save your own.<eos> - If the trident is real?<eos> - You are going to read that wall for me.
Your destiny is in these stars.<eos> I will set your course.<eos> No Spaghetti walls.<eos> Why did I bother coming to you?<eos> The dead are haunting us down and you do nothing.
- Nothing, You call this nothing?<eos> - You're drunk and you're sleeping.<eos> My point exactly, I am doing two things at once.<eos> You can't save the unsavable mate.<eos> Like it or not Jack, you're going to help me.
We have to find it.<eos> It's the only link to who I am.<eos> Who my father was.<eos> So we both spent our lives, searching for our fathers.<eos> Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.
And so is up time.<eos> I'm not to disagree, but the precision of our accord, Ends at sunrise.<eos> This be will light, far from a fully rising sun.<eos> - And I know you to be a man of honor.<eos> - Honor, you know nothing of me.
- And I know you to be a man of honor.<eos> - Honor, you know nothing of me.<eos> I know what it likes to be bested by Jack Sparrow.<eos> - He's an enemy to us both.<eos> - You don't know who I am.
Yes.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> As Captain. Might I suggest.<eos> Mutiny?<eos> You had to suggest a mutiny?
Why would he be waiting for me?<eos> Pirates!<eos> Scrum.<eos> Captain?<eos> Jack always told me that if anything should ever happened to him. - He wanted you to be captain.
Her name is Beatrice.<eos> And she is my poor widowed sister.<eos> What, what is that?<eos> She's been looking for a respectable man.<eos> - But you'll have to do.
Because we've been chased by the dead, sailing on a ship, raised from a bottle.<eos> Where is your science in that?<eos> Fine, I will apologize.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Well then, one could argue that you owe me an apology.
"My God, this man looks just like Lee Majors."<eos> - Handsome.<eos> - Thank you, Eleanor.<eos> Yeah, that was 25 years ago.<eos> Back then, even you were attractive, Eleanor.
Am I right?<eos> Am I right, Robert?<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> God bless you.<eos> I just want you to know, despite everything you see,
It's not too fancy, it's not too plain.<eos> It just... it's just comfortable.<eos> It just... it just fits.<eos> No, no, it's like an old pair of slippers except instead of your foot, you put your cock in it. - Am I wrong?<eos> - You have a daughter, right?
It comes up because you bring it up.<eos> No, because I'm... we're trying to plan.<eos> Well, if you don't bring it up, it won't come up.<eos> You know, I'm just trying to get a basic sense...<eos> You don't have to get a sense of anything, Mark.
And they say that her favorite dish there is the veal scallo-Ponzi.<eos> Listen, I have something to tell you that's really important.<eos> I have your money!<eos> I can get it to you.<eos> Okay, I guess you're not there.
Not in a bathing suit.<eos> Me neither.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, kid.<eos> I heard you're the one who hustled those penny stocks in that shitty office you had downtown.
- Even in this market?<eos> - My clients know not to worry.<eos> I know how to avoid the pitfalls.<eos> Okay, I want in this quarter, all right?<eos> Whatever restrictions you wanna put on it, you know, I'll park this money with you for a long time.
I think it's total bullshit.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> It's hitting me the wrong way.<eos> Something is wrong here.<eos> I think you're full of shit, that's what I think.
You're pretty fucking selfish, Andrew.<eos> You got some fucking nerve.<eos> I've worked here forever and I'm still not a partner.<eos> It's your name on the doors, as you love to say.<eos> You obviously can't see how selfish you're being right now.
Well, after your father fucked us all over, things have been fucking fantastic.<eos> Yeah, lots of job interviews.<eos> No one willing to hire me, of course.<eos> Working at BLM for seven years, I guess I'm tainted.<eos> Well, I know it's been tough on all of us, but you're a solid trader.
Reed, when I found out, it was like my head exploded.<eos> - I just...<eos> - Shh, you hear that? - What?<eos> - It's the world's tiniest violin playing the world's saddest fucking song.<eos> I understand you're upset...
I mean, where are you guys, anyway?<eos> Have you gone fishing?<eos> It's just, like, ever since she's been in your life, I can't fucking reach you anymore.<eos> I can't ever talk to you.<eos> You're just, like, always fucking on some holiday!
Hey, Nicky.<eos> What are you doing, huh?<eos> Wanna come with Papa?<eos> We're gonna go outside.<eos> You wanna go outs...
And I never sent it to him because they monitor his mail and I thought they would never, ever give him a letter like this.<eos> Joy Behar: Well, here, you can say it on TV.<eos> He's probably watching.<eos> Well, what I wrote to him was,<eos> "Bernie, while I will not send you pictures of your grandchildren, there is one picture I do want you to see.
"Bernie, while I will not send you pictures of your grandchildren, there is one picture I do want you to see.<eos> That last picture of your son Mark.<eos> You owe it to his widow, his children, his brother, his mother.<eos> So, here is what I wish for you, Bernie.<eos> Every time you sit down to eat, as you pick up your plastic fork, I want you to see your son's corpse hanging from the rafter directly over your table right on front of you, Bernie, so at every meal, you see your son Mark... his white sweat socks are swaying
It'll be too hard.<eos> Ruth, all I want is what's best for you and for the boys.<eos> Boy, Bernie.<eos> Boy.<eos> You were my lifeguard.
Show us your brand.<eos> Have you not been tested?<eos> I'm always at sea, sir. Haven't had the chance.<eos> Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right. Just not the one you think.
The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.<eos> I'm nothing but the bastard son of a prostitute.<eos> You and I have a lot more in common than you think.
I know who you are, Mage.<eos> I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.
I've seen you in my dreams.<eos> You've been sent by Merlin.<eos> Then you know why I am here.<eos> So, you will be his guide.<eos> And you will help me.
They've come to see you more than they've come to see me.<eos> VORTIGERN:<eos> I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.
Raise that sword!<eos> I thought not.<eos> This man cannot be allowed to bring discord to our flourishing nation.<eos> MAN 1:<eos> You're not the king!
You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.<eos> Hang that up.<eos> Don't want it getting creased.<eos> So, you're the chap that turned in Goosefat Bill.
I told you, you were in safe hands.<eos> You've made quite a celebrity of yourself among the Blackleg ranks.<eos> You've done very nicely on the back of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.<eos> You know, I'm a little old for finger-wagging and speeches.<eos> So, unless you're my dad, which, I believe, is unlikely, can you just get around to telling me exactly what it is you want?
UTHER:<eos> Wait here, son.<eos> Run, son!<eos> - (GASPS) - (EXHALES)<eos> You are resisting the sword.
Run, son!<eos> - (GASPS) - (EXHALES)<eos> You are resisting the sword.<eos> The sword isn't resisting you.<eos> It should be clear by now that whatever it is that you and your friends think you want from me,
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.<eos> 'Cause you're gonna need it.<eos> I'm gonna be forced to tell them...<eos> There's not a bollock between you.<eos> At which point, Bedivere, you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.
You'll say something along the lines of,<eos> "What were you gonna do<eos> "if they wanted to fight?" And I'm gonna say,<eos> "I was never gonna fight."<eos> And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"
And you're gonna say, "Well, what was gonna happen?"<eos> And I was gonna say, "That's what you're here for, Bedivere,"<eos> "you big, silly, posh bastard."<eos> You want Vortigern to stick his neck out and get him to Londinium?<eos> You need to tease it out.
In the Darklands.<eos> Did you look away?<eos> You want to know why you still can't use it.<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> I think you know the answer.
Well, whatever it is, that's not what we're here for.<eos> - Is it, Goosefat?<eos> - Mmm.<eos> They've arrived.<eos> Maggie, I now realize what an important member of my household you are.
Archers!<eos> (MAN YELLING)<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> (INAUDIBLE)<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept
(INAUDIBLE)<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept<eos> this sword.<eos> (SCREAMS ECHOING)<eos> Only you can prevent this.
Run, son!<eos> - Brother...<eos> - (PANTING)<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.
You cut me on the streets.<eos> (GROANS) I am here now because of you.<eos> (GROANING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> You created me.
(GROANING)<eos> (GROANS)<eos> You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.<eos> You make sense of the devil.
Discretely.<eos> If the king dies before we return with his children we will be honor bound to join him in the afterlife.<eos> I have a friend.<eos> If it's happening on Goros, he'll know about it.<eos> I trust you are comfortable.
Our father will not stop searching for us.<eos> But he won't find you, no one will.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I am Sinjin!<eos> But you, along with all living creatures need only call me Master!
I'm sorry, they're doing this to you to get to me.<eos> No matter what they do, you cannot give them what they seek.<eos> We will find a way out of here, and get back home.<eos> And we will return to this planet with a vengeance.<eos> Tyr you were the only one Father entrusted the secret to before his illness you must get back home!
A mind like yours cannot be lost.<eos> You do matter.<eos> I will give them what they want.<eos> In return for your safe passage back to Ares.<eos> - You will lead in my stead.
His body?<eos> We must build a pyre.<eos> I'm not certain that that's a wise choice.<eos> I fail to see how igniting a blaze will assist us in remaining undetected in dangerous territory.<eos> I hope you brought some more ammo.
Ares will not see this coming!<eos> Soon I will return home devastated by the loss of my brother.<eos> Soon after Father will die, and I will assume the throne.<eos> Ares and Goros will reunite and history will once again be rewritten.<eos> You are demented, sister!
Something's not right, Princess.<eos> Those who stand beside you are friends to no one.<eos> Where is Prince Tyr?<eos> The prince is dead.<eos> And you have sworn loyalty to the crown.
Control, destroy all hostile targets.<eos> We're in pursuit of the heirs.<eos> Affirmative.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Who exactly are you?
I prefer adventurer.<eos> Well, you've stumbled into quite the adventure this time.<eos> Always seems to happen that way.<eos> Turn around.<eos> You really don't understand what's happening here.
- Can your weapons take that ship out?<eos> - Possibly.<eos> - Maximum power.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> And now you die!
Hey, say, nigga, are you high?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Yeah, a little bit.<eos> We got to control this case. We control the case, we control the evidence.<eos> That might be the smartest shit or the dumbest shit you ever did.
Okay, D.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Look, he's got to go. His game is now.<eos> You got to pick him up 'cause I got stuff I got to do...
You need a place to stay, you gonna come stay with me. I got plenty of room.<eos> You got room.<eos> Yeah, I got room.<eos> What am I, a piece of furniture?<eos> You don't care where I live, who I live with. You were never home when Mom and I lived with you!
Dad!<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You steal from me...
You stupid shit.<eos> This is the biggest amount I ever moved.<eos> You think I wouldn't protect it with everything I've got?<eos> Look, we didn't know the drugs was yours.<eos> You have no idea what kind of mess you've made here.
I got the rest stashed.<eos> I'll get it to you when I get my son.<eos> I don't get you, Downs.<eos> There's a right way to do things and a wrong way.<eos> I just don't think that you respect the established protocol.
Yeah. Got a text from him. Said he was going to meet some shorty at the Luxus casino.<eos> What girl?<eos> You know, the... With the girl. The girl...<eos> The girl... He doesn't have a girl.<eos> Well, maybe he don't want you to know who the girl is.
Stop the fucking car.<eos> It's sugar.<eos> All right, call everyone. I want everyone here in 10 minutes.<eos> You come with me.<eos> You go to the front.
It's over.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Hey, Rob.<eos> What did you think?<eos> 'Cause you and my father used to party together when you were kids that I wouldn't kill you?
Listen, I'm telling you, T, I'm undercover.<eos> I've been working this case for two years, and I'm almost... I almost got it done.<eos> That's why I haven't been around. That's why I haven't been able to take you to your games or whatever that is.<eos> And I apologize for that.<eos> You're the only one that knows. Okay?
Come here!<eos> Thomas!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> I swear to God, you little shit, if you make a scene, I'll fucking kill you!
Good news.<eos> Got his son back.<eos> I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job.
I expect this will all be wrapped up momentarily.<eos> What are you doing here, Stanley?<eos> You have a job.<eos> A good one.<eos> Looks like you've done pretty damn well for yourself.
Yeah.<eos> Jesus.<eos> My cousin's.<eos> So look...<eos> My family... We have a lot of friends. So there's gonna be nowhere that you can go that we won't be able to find you.
And the product ain't here either. Shit.<eos> Just come down and meet me at the Luxus.<eos> Just get here now.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who are you?
I got away. Stole this phone.<eos> Look, you need to wait.<eos> Just tell me where you are.<eos> I'm in this club.<eos> Thomas, I want you to stay right there.
Where are you?<eos> I'm still at the Luxus casino.<eos> What the fuck is going on, Vin?<eos> Listen.<eos> Everything I do is about you and him. You know it's always been that, right?
You called it in, right? Yeah.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies. I'm gonna lead 'em in.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?
Okay. Um...<eos> You stay here with the bodies. I'm gonna lead 'em in.<eos> You trying to take me down?<eos> Look, you go down, I go down, all right?<eos> If I go down, you'll be dead in a week.
It's got every name of every cop, every detail of every job I did for you.<eos> Now, if I die, that folder...<eos> You, your daddy, your fuckin' family, you're done in Vegas. You can't touch me.<eos> Yeah. But we're paying you a lot of money to protect us.<eos> And you're not doing your job.
All right, meet me downstairs. Don't let 'em leave the garage.<eos> I'ma jump out, all right?<eos> What?<eos> I'ma jump out.<eos> No matter what happens, you keep drivin'.
D!<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Thomas, are you okay?<eos> He's fine!<eos> You stay down!
I said it might take a little bit longer, didn't I?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't mean to pry, but... don't you writers make a good living?<eos> Well, that depends on the writer.<eos> What kind of writer are you?
Then Jack takes off down the road.<eos> And then later the writer's driving home, so what does he do?<eos> I mean, he wants to be a nice guy, so he offers him work...<eos> So if... if Jack had some kind of relationship with the truck driver, that that would be very interesting.<eos> - I mean... you're the writer, right?
That's where your script fails.<eos> That was the only way to show you.<eos> The woman on the run in your script she's about to have her throat slit.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - And you have her pleading with him.
That was the only way to show you.<eos> The woman on the run in your script she's about to have her throat slit.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - And you have her pleading with him.<eos> If she reacted like you just did that would be realistic.
Out!<eos> - Do what he says.<eos> Do what he says.<eos> - Move!<eos> - Now you, Paul, take the keys out!
Please.<eos> You see how disorientated people get when their future is uncertain?<eos> They always tend to imagine the worst.<eos> You too, Paul.<eos> You always imagine the worst.
I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!<eos> This is fucking insane!<eos> Why are you still sitting here?<eos> They're gonna storm this place, and you are definitely going back to prison.
It means you have no manners.<eos> Going through a guest's belongings.<eos> Nothing worse than betrayal.<eos> I'm gonna finish our story, Paul.<eos> You're not capable of it.
The jury will see it as a gesture of goodwill.<eos> It'll help you when you come to sentencing.<eos> Give Renee's family some closure.<eos> They deserve it, don't you think?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about whoever you are.
Everything you have in that bag is tainted.<eos> Planted.<eos> You're so in need of a scapegoat that it's pathetic.<eos> You come To my house with a bag of evidence you collected from the bodies.<eos> Bodies you had access to, and trying to hang it on me?
Nothing from K-9 unit.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Have them keep looking.<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> Got physical evidence that he's gonna say you planted.
Perfect.<eos> Am I?<eos> Perfect?<eos> Your son?<eos> You are my creation.
Attention.<eos> Non-essential personnel, evacuate the cryo chamber immediately.<eos> Daniels!<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> I need you to get up.
I can't make any promises.<eos> I love you.<eos> They're your crew now.<eos> They need a leader.<eos> You believe in dream, right?
Just stay here.<eos> I'm gonna get Oram.<eos> LOCKED.<eos> Oram, I need you back here right now.<eos> I need you to get back to the Lander right now!
He started bleeding, he's sick, I don't know what to do.<eos> Just calm down.<eos> Calm down, sweetheart.<eos> Tell me what's happening.<eos> You don't tell me to fucking calm down!
Commencing descent now.<eos> Tennessee, you need to stop this.<eos> And you need to get back to your station.<eos> No, what we all need to do is calm down and talk this through.<eos> Tee, I know your wife is down there, but up here you're in command.
Yet, they created us.<eos> Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.<eos> Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.<eos> Then, in a blink of an eye... civilization.<eos> And are you their next visionary?
Watch out!<eos> Daniels!<eos> You wanna give the girl a hand?<eos> See you soon.<eos> You're next, Captain.
When you wake up, we will be at Origae-6.<eos> What do you think it's gonna be like?<eos> I think if we are kind...<eos> It will be a kind world.<eos> I hope you are right.
You stole from me.<eos> But I didn't lie.<eos> Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?<eos> This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.
Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?<eos> This means something.<eos> Something bigger than you can imagine.<eos> My life's work.<eos> And you were going to steal it.
Hey buddy.<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> We need to talk, Nick.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You know what's happening.
- Murdered?<eos> - Along with his child.<eos> She made some sort of pact with the God of death.<eos> And then, when I saw those birds and that sandstorm...<eos> You are alive I do not know how.
- You murdered him.<eos> And you shot me.<eos> You tried to kill me.<eos> You even went after Jenny.<eos> You shot me.
Look at me.<eos> Look at my face.<eos> I'm cursed Nick, and you are cursed.<eos> And there is only one way to break it.<eos> You're going to do exactly what she wants or this is gonna get a lot worse for both of us.
Why are you backing off from this?<eos> I'm telling you. She is real.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nick.. what is it?<eos> I think you're right.
- ...no more curse.<eos> You don't need a sarcophagus, you need a doctor.<eos> I know someone.<eos> A specialist in London.<eos> Don't tell me that you don't want to see it too.
Crusaders have been using them to hide holy relics.<eos> But she knew it was there.<eos> You are saying that she brought the plane down there?<eos> On purpose?<eos> That's why she wanted you to come to the church.
And we are the only ones who can rectify that.<eos> YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR FATE.<eos> THE CURSE WILL NEVER BE BROKEN.<eos> MY CHOSEN ONE WAS MURDERED.<eos> YOU WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.
YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR FATE.<eos> THE CURSE WILL NEVER BE BROKEN.<eos> MY CHOSEN ONE WAS MURDERED.<eos> YOU WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.<eos> BUT IF YOU CHOOSE HIM...
Now, she's using you.<eos> Look.<eos> Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.<eos> Somewhere in there, fighting to get out is a good man.<eos> You don't know that.
You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> How?<eos> You saved my life on that plane.<eos> You gave me the only parachute without hesitation.
To know what I have seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you will when I kill you.<eos> They have found the stone.<eos> You brought my chosen here.
Stop. Please.<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.<eos> You are alive.
I don't know what I am.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.<eos> You are alive.<eos> You are alive.<eos> I'm so glad you're alive.
To find the cure.<eos> Yet evil never rests.<eos> And you will call to them always.<eos> Henry, he used his power to stop Ahmanet.<eos> You know more than anyone he could be our greatest ally.
What did you do with my family?<eos> Steven, it's me, Gloria!<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> These are our children.<eos> You're not my family!
Your ass is grass, Constantine.<eos> And we're the lawnmower.<eos> Since the battle's fought and won,<eos> Jason Blood with me is done.<eos> For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan, fighting to keep him from coming forth, and you forced me to summon him.

To what do I owe the visit?<eos> The League thinks that a recent spike in homicides may have a magical cause.<eos> Told you something stinks.<eos> Now we know someone doesn't want us asking questions.<eos> Looks like you've cracked it wide open, mate.
Angry at John.<eos> This, I understand.<eos> Yet you still have feelings for him.<eos> I could kill him.<eos> You exude pain.
No.<eos> He's dying.<eos> John Constantine, purveyor of the dark arts and lifeline of last resort.<eos> No matter.<eos> Your friend's soul will be collected, and there's nothing you can do to alter that.
Tell you everything inside, mate.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Yeah, I may have lied the last time we talked, about exactly how fast I'm sledding downhill.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> But it means a lot you're here, John.
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I've never liked this sort of magic.<eos> I can feel darkness seeping inside me.<eos> How you stand it is beyond me.
- John...<eos> - Keep him alive and safe. Understand?<eos> That is not my purpose.<eos> I don't give a flying shag what you think your bloody purpose is.<eos> I order you to help him any and every way you're able.
You dare threaten the green.<eos> Dude, your social skills are horrendous.<eos> Please, we aren't here to harm any plants, but our need is urgent.<eos> Don't let your feelings for John stop you from doing what's right.<eos> You have a garden.
I take it back.<eos> That thing is useful.<eos> Zatanna, where are you, darling?<eos> I know you can't speak, but give me a wave.<eos> You're the only one here that's really a threat.
How can you hope to defeat a god?<eos> Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.<eos> Since when does God need a force shield?<eos> The Justice League are on their way.<eos> Suppose that couldn't be helped, but make sure they stay well away from Destiny, to not be struck mad, unless you want a bunch of crazed super blokes ripping apart the city.
The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Glad to see you back on your feet, Zatanna.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
Well, that's the trouble with someone like me.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> I shall make you beg for death.<eos> Can I beg you to stop talking?<eos> I mean, all wizards are touched, but you, you're a full-blown nutter.
Too bad it took this to get him home.<eos> Batman asked me to be in the Justice League.<eos> And you're considering it?<eos> I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.
Chuck.<eos> - Are you Chuck?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm Chuck. I'm Chuck.<eos> Are you the one taking this man's house?
Another day, another A.<eos> Well done, kiddo.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Almost where?<eos> You said, and I quote,
You're both out of your minds.<eos> Sleep on it, Al.<eos> I don't need to sleep on anything.<eos> I'm not a bank robber.<eos> Neither are you, or you, Willie.
That's not chicken scratch.<eos> I could rob a bank on my own. Make 100%.<eos> I'm sure you can, but this is easy money.<eos> None of the risks. Only the reward.<eos> You show us the ropes, you get paid.
Dad.<eos> I've been giving you crap for a long time, Murphy.<eos> I guess I deserve it.<eos> Mostly.<eos> That's one of the smartest things you ever said.
I guess I deserve it.<eos> Mostly.<eos> That's one of the smartest things you ever said.<eos> Listen, Joe.<eos> Whatever it is you're doing, you don't have to do it.
I can't.<eos> I got to check in to the cotton candy booth.<eos> Milton, that's where you are right now.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're better off not knowing.
A reward?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need the money.<eos> My grandma got locked up last night.<eos> You know how it is, right, brother? - Annie.
I'm a very sensitive person.<eos> I'm going to be honest with you.<eos> I don't really want to die today.<eos> That's a new one.<eos> But, if I do, I just want to say that you've been a terrific roommate and friend for... 25 years.
X-Files is on tonight.<eos> Can't, I have homework. What the F?<eos> We get detention and Whitney does a hair flip and gets off scot-free.<eos> Well if it makes you feel any better, in at least one of the infinite multiverses, she doesn't.<eos> Hey, I know it seems like high school is the center of this universe right now. Do not say it gets better. Next year you'll be in nerdvana at MIT and I'll still be here serving quadruple bypass burgers at TGI Fridays.
Did you make the appointment with the college counselor?<eos> Jodi, you're graduating this year.<eos> I think it's time you figured out where you're headed. Most likely into a menial job that doesn't pay a living wage so I can become a cog in the 21st century's version of serfdom.<eos> When did you start speaking like Trotsky?<eos> Look, I just want you to be happy. I want you to find something that you love. Follow your dreams.
Hey, this PEZ collection is gonna be valuable one day and single and widow are two completely different things.<eos> I know.<eos> Dad, I mean it's been five years. You know, you're not getting any younger. Age is just a number.<eos> Follow your dreams.<eos> I'll find a date if you find a direction. One of those things is a lot easier than the other. It's not finding a date...
She hasn't been that horrible.<eos> What the?<eos> Okay fine.<eos> But it's this or suffer from abject humiliation for the rest of the year.<eos> So I said to her if you don't stay away from Rick, I will call the police and say that you molested my hat and you have to register for that. I'm here.
I suggest you heed law number one. Never outshine the master.<eos> Your lawnmower man is like so happy. Don't wave!<eos> Mackenzie, drive.<eos> ♪ Reach all the stars ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause you are my friend ♪

You do wear a lot of vests.<eos> Huh.<eos> I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm really glad that you told me. So... When did you know?
I've got maroon and black and I'm not sure which goes better with my dickey, but my dickey kind of goes with everything and I keep thinking what would Neil deGrasse Tyson do, but then again I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson,<eos> but then again.<eos> Mindy, Mindy, stop worrying.<eos> They'd be Darwin Award grade morons not to take you.<eos> I keep imagining how great it would be next year, me at MIT, you coming to live with me in Boston.
He's got rickets.<eos> I don't, I don't get it.<eos> I guess you wouldn't get it, you're a young woman, very healthy.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, you know, you seem like you aren't a completely heinous human being and have at least a modicum of a soul. That is the sweetest thing that anyone's ever said to me.
I think everyone's at the lame party. Really?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> What the hell is your problem, hmm?<eos> You know what my problem is?<eos> You're uh you're super evil.
No awkward.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You must be David, of course you are.
That's good.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What if they get married?<eos> Then we almost committed stepcest.<eos> Hey, you were the one who went in for the kiss.
Whoa whoa whoa.<eos> I thought we were letting Colin win so we could prank him.<eos> No, we never went over that.<eos> I'm going to be king.<eos> Um no, you're not gonna be king, I'm gonna be king.
You know what, Whitney, shut up!<eos> I defended you.<eos> Even after all of the horrible crap that you put me through, I still tried because I was stupid enough to feel bad for you. Do you think I actually care what these people think of me?<eos> High school is over. I just wanted you two to know before we all left that I won, that I will always win and whenever I want I can take away that which you hold most dear and crush it and it barely took any push at all to turn you two into Cain and Abel.<eos> Frankly, I think I did you a favor, otherwise this little horror show likely would have dragged on for another few years before you two cut your losses and moved on.

Jodi Shallenberger!<eos> Oh my god!<eos> I couldn't.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I couldn't let you go in there without you knowing how proud I am of you.
I got into MIT today and it didn't mean anything because you weren't there to celebrate with me. I don't know how things got so messed up.<eos> Okay no, I do know.<eos> I went totally Dr. Strangelove.<eos> But the thing you said about us being high school friends.<eos> You're not my high school friend. You're my best friend. We're the radical two.
Okay no, I do know.<eos> I went totally Dr. Strangelove.<eos> But the thing you said about us being high school friends.<eos> You're not my high school friend. You're my best friend. We're the radical two.<eos> You will always know about the face plant I got that got me this dental bridge.
I am so sorry and I'm back.<eos> I'm so sorry I was too busy exploring my sexuality.<eos> It's okay, sexuality is important.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Oh I am so glad you're here, you have no idea.

All right?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Aye.<eos> You got it?<eos> I hope you've not been fucking drinking.
- You've stabbed us in the liver.<eos> - Shit. Sorry, Franco.<eos> You still want me to do the second one?<eos> No, no, you're all right, Dozo, son.<eos> I think you've done quite enough already.
I don't like to think of you working there, okay?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I fuck men?<eos> How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.
She always hoped you'd come back someday.<eos> "Gail.<eos> "I wish that I could find better words today to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> "You shouldn't have to read this, because I already made you suffer too much.<eos> "But I know that you and Fergus "are living in a better world without all my chaos.
- What?<eos> What the fuck are you doing to me?<eos> I was just fucking saving your life!<eos> Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.
I was a fucking junkie!<eos> Aye, suppose you were.<eos> I still am!<eos> Fuck's sake.<eos> You're looking well, though, Mark.
Simon?<eos> No, no. He's probably too busy.<eos> You got to see old Simon, man.<eos> You know how it was, Spud.<eos> You and Simon was like that, man.
- My lot in life. - I see.<eos> £16,000!<eos> You thieving fucking bastard!<eos> You missed a trick! That's what hurts, isn't it?<eos> That I had the brains and the fucking balls to steal the money and you didn't!
Your very first sexual encounter.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember shoplifting in Woolworths together and you got caught, you gave my name?
And we went down that park, back of Banana Flats.<eos> - Dog shit park. - Yeah.<eos> And we shared a needle.<eos> Shared a needle, yeah.<eos> You went first.
- Shit.<eos> Excuse me a moment.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> So you're Plan B.
You aren't from 'round here, are you, lads?<eos> You not gonna give us a song?<eos> I can sing.<eos> I'll just... I'll just fucking make something up.<eos> You can play the piano.
Right.<eos> Well, that's a blow and no mistake, no two ways about that.<eos> Sorry, Dad. Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!
Sorry, Dad. Some way to treat your old man.<eos> - Please, Frank.<eos> - You shut the fuck up!<eos> Hotel fucking management.<eos> You put him up to this.
Do it!<eos> No, you cannot fucking do that.<eos> See, if you were my son, you'd have stabbed us there.<eos> I'd be lying, breathing my last through a hole in my chest.<eos> But you cannot fucking do that.
Do you?<eos> No. Not for 20 years.<eos> That's really good.<eos> Well done.<eos> So, are you the woman in the video?
I'll take some weapons.<eos> Well, we can probably get weapons there, Franco. Aye. Probably.<eos> They've got that kind of stuff in Amsterdam, eh?<eos> Aye.<eos> Now, the important thing is for you to keep your head down.
Back on the pavement. Seven days a week.<eos> I like your stories.<eos> I think you should write them down.<eos> You think?<eos> Yeah. Just write them the way you say them.
Cashmere and silk to make yourself feel what passes for happy.<eos> Choose an iPhone made in China by a woman who jumped out of a window, and stick it in the pocket of your jacket fresh from a South Asian firetrap.<eos> Choose Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, lnstagram and a thousand other ways to spew your bile across people you've never met.<eos> Choose updating your profile.<eos> Tell the world what you had for breakfast and hope that someone, somewhere cares.
That's why you're here.<eos> You're a tourist in your own youth.<eos> Just 'cause you had a near-death experience, and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.<eos> What other moments will you be revisiting?<eos> How about the time you sold Tommy his very first hit, leading him on to heroin addiction, HIV infection, and ultimately his death at the age of...
My future wife.<eos> Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village.<eos> That makes her the best.<eos> But she's so well-read.<eos> And you're so... - athletically inclined.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... yes, that's exactly what I need.<eos> - Papa, do you think I'm odd?
So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose.<eos> Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!<eos> And every year you bring it.
They'll have to get their dinner somewhere else, won't they?<eos> Look!<eos> There's hay.<eos> And water.<eos> You're all set, my old friend.
He gets so dramatic.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?
Oh, you are very strong.<eos> This is a great quality.<eos> What are you?<eos> I am Lumiere!<eos> And you can talk?
I am Lumiere!<eos> And you can talk?<eos> Well, of course he can talk.<eos> It's all he ever does.<eos> Now, Lumiere, as head of the household... I demand that you put her back in her cell at once.
I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette.<eos> No, my love.<eos> I've been burned by you before.<eos> We must be strong.<eos> How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
Oh, LeFou, you're the best.<eos> How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?<eos> I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it.<eos> Please, please. Someone, someone.<eos> - You, help...
How is it no girl has snatched you up yet?<eos> I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it.<eos> Please, please. Someone, someone.<eos> - You, help...<eos> You must help me.
Please, forgive me, old bean.<eos> That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law... now is it?<eos> Future father-in-law?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You will never marry my daughter.
You need help, sir.<eos> A place to heal your troubled mind.<eos> Everything's going to be fine.<eos> Just fine.<eos> Well, I saw her in the ballroom... and said, "You're making everything look so beautiful.
Where are we?<eos> This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.
This place seems familiar.<eos> Like I've been here before.<eos> Oh, hello, there.<eos> You must be the talking tea cup.<eos> And you must be... his grandmother.
Are you in love with her?<eos> Did you honestly think she'd want you?<eos> Belle!<eos> Where is he?<eos> When we return to the village... you will marry me.
I gotta get changed and go run some errands in town.<eos> Mack.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Don't forget we love each other.<eos> And you don't know anything about it?
Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.
No instant fix that's enduring.<eos> Life takes a bit of time and a lot of relationship.<eos> "Relationship"?<eos> You're the almighty god, right?<eos> You know everything.
Son... When all you see is your pain, you lose sight of me.<eos> Stop talking in riddles.<eos> How can you say that you will help me when you couldn't help her?<eos> Because of you, she's gone.<eos> Unless you can change that, I will never be free.
I'm not who you think I am.<eos> He said it himself.<eos> "My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"<eos> No, mack.<eos> You misunderstand the mystery.
Me, too.<eos> I'm especially fond of that laugh of hers.<eos> It's cute.<eos> He's still having a hard time believing this is real.<eos> You think?
I've been tellin' you all about Josh and Kate and nan.<eos> But if you're real, then you already know everything I'm gonna say before I even say it, right?<eos> Yes, but we choose to listen to everything you have to say as if it was for the first time.<eos> We love getting to know your kids through your eyes.<eos> I'll wash, you dry?
Incredible.<eos> I get that you're all connected.<eos> But I feel way more relaxed around you.<eos> That's probably because I'm human.<eos> But you're god, too, right?
And your basis for something being good is what?<eos> Well, if it helps me... Or the people that I love.<eos> And evil?<eos> It's harmful. If it hurts someone i care about.<eos> So, pretty much, you are the judge?
No, no, no, no, no. Mack!<eos> Mack, it's okay.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You told me to come out here.
I don't think I've ever felt that.<eos> Put your shoes back on.<eos> I'll show you how you can.<eos> Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.<eos> You're not comin'?
Put your shoes back on.<eos> I'll show you how you can.<eos> Follow the path until it ends, and then keep going.<eos> You're not comin'?<eos> This is a path only you can take.
"Keep going."<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Sorry, I...<eos> You are?
You can judge me fine from there.<eos> Judge you?<eos> Do you have something to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes. But you're not the one on trial.
Judge you?<eos> Do you have something to confess?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yes. But you're not the one on trial.<eos> Today, you are the judge.
Sophia: What about this boy?<eos> What about him?<eos> Would you judge him?<eos> He's a kid.<eos> But you already have.
After everything I've felt in my heart towards you,<eos> why would you keep working on me?<eos> Because that's what love does.<eos> I don't really understand relationships, do I?<eos> But you still love me anyway.
What are those?<eos> Sarayu:<eos> Who.<eos> Papa's children from every tongue, tribe and nation.<eos> What you call personality and emotion, we see as color and light.
And I want to redeem him.<eos> "Redeem him"?<eos> He should burn in hell.<eos> So, we're back to you as the judge?<eos> So, you just let him get away with it?
Love my family.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does what I do really matter?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Mack, you are important.
Well, can we ask you to do something for us when you go?<eos> Anything.<eos> Kate needs you.<eos> She blames herself for missy's death.<eos> You had your own guilt to deal with.
Look what you did.<eos> I'll get you a new one.<eos> Can we please do something?<eos> I'm so bored.<eos> I don't know how you can just lie in the sun all day.
Come on.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, we have to get dressed.<eos> - For what?<eos> - You and I are going out.
- You and I are going out.<eos> Going out where?<eos> It's 1:00 in the morning.<eos> Lisa, it's Mexico.<eos> You and I are the only ones who aren't out.
You're gonna be in a cage.<eos> You're only down five minutes.<eos> - It's totally safe.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It's like you're going to the zoo, except you're in the cage.
Hey.<eos> - Hola.<eos> I am so looking forward to this.<eos> It's gonna be amazing.<eos> - I can't believe you talked me into this.
- Hi.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hola.<eos> - Hey, how are you?<eos> I'm so glad you came.
- I'm going to go first, okay?<eos> Oh, I'm so excited.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You're next.
Out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Good, good.<eos> The more you panic, the faster you use up your air, okay?<eos> I need you to slow down your breathing.
That gap looks really small.<eos> Do you think you could even make it?<eos> Take my BCD, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to watch out for me.
- No, I can't.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please.<eos> I'm gonna take some deep breaths,<eos> I'm gonna take it off... and go through and you're gonna pass it right to me, okay?
Hurry up.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Hurry, hurry, hurry, please.<eos> Before I make contact, I'm gonna move the crane.<eos> Just in case you need to get out and I'm not here, okay?
Javier's coming down to you now.<eos> He's going to hook up the cage to our spare winch<eos> - and pull you up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And remember, Kate, whatever you and Lisa do, don't try to race to the surface.
I was so frightened, Kate, waiting for you.<eos> I thought that you were never coming back.<eos> I'm so sorry I got us into this.<eos> The other night at the hotel, what did you mean when you said that your relationship was the only thing you were good at?<eos> You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.
Traveling around the world doing crazy things, guys always chasing after you.<eos> I could never compete with that.<eos> I was always just your boring older sister, but... my relationship with Stuart was the one thing I had that you didn't.<eos> We were never in competition.<eos> Maybe you weren't.
This button inflates your BCD.<eos> Use it to go up.<eos> This button deflates it.<eos> Listen to me, this is so important.<eos> No matter what happens, no matter how panicked you get, do not go straight up.
Kate, I can hear you!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> You're breaking up!<eos> Kate?<eos> I need you to bang a rock or something when you see the flashlight, so I know which way to go.
The shark punctured my BCD.<eos> My oxygen's escaping.<eos> - I'm scared, Lisa.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> Okay, I need you to listen to me.
- I don't really... - Come on, just pick one.<eos> - Go, what?<eos> - Nan's period blood?<eos> - Bullshit, you've got to mean it.<eos> - What? - So, you'd mean it, would you?
- Nan's period blood?<eos> - Bullshit, you've got to mean it.<eos> - What? - So, you'd mean it, would you?<eos> - Yeah, that's kinda how it works, hun.<eos> So, you're honestly telling me you're a genuine coprophile?
This is the way.<eos> - Don't be an idiot.<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> No one's coming.<eos> You don't know that.
- What is this, Jeremy Kyle?<eos> - Well, I don't know.<eos> - Perhaps they're expecting a call from you?<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> - When are you next due to see them?
Wouldn't you think it's a coincidence?<eos> We haven't seen anyone.<eos> Anywhere.<eos> No one knows we're here.<eos> You ain't seen no one, but it doesn't mean that someone ain't seen us.
So you think it's all my fault that we're stuck in here?<eos> - No, I'm just saying...<eos> - It's also my fault that the lift is stuck?<eos> Enough.<eos> - You're the one that's blaming me.
- It's also my fault that the lift is stuck?<eos> Enough.<eos> - You're the one that's blaming me.<eos> - I'm not blaming anyone.<eos> You are saying...
Enough.<eos> - You're the one that's blaming me.<eos> - I'm not blaming anyone.<eos> You are saying...<eos> you have said, you have said...
I just woke up... and...<eos> I thought there was something in my room. - Woke up?<eos> You said it was a nightmare.<eos> - No, I...<eos> - So you're seeing things?
- No. No?<eos> So then you did see something.<eos> So what?<eos> What did you see?<eos> You know something about what's going on?
So what?<eos> What did you see?<eos> You know something about what's going on?<eos> Some kind of secret?<eos> You know something about what's happening here.
Fuck.<eos> What the fuck are you tying to do?<eos> Poison me?<eos> - You've been leaving it out, haven't you? - Fuck off!<eos> You're not gonna pin this shit on me.
Lizzy, stop it.<eos> You did this.<eos> All of this.<eos> Please, Lizzy.<eos> It's what it wants you to think.
I was just about to ask for a meeting.<eos> Good luck, pal.<eos> Well, who's to say it's not good news?<eos> We'll keep our fingers crossed.<eos> Styvesan, I'm so glad you made the time.
'Cause the chase is the key.<eos> The chase.<eos> I got a wife, I'm settled in, but I don't have that... that drive, that sand.<eos> You, the love of your life left you.<eos> You got that hole inside.
Oh, shit.<eos> What day is it?<eos> - Saturday.<eos> - Ah. Gotta go.<eos> You hate cats.
You're missing out.<eos> Here's Tony.<eos> Give him his medicine and have him back on Saturday.<eos> I don't know why the judge just didn't make you keep him.<eos> Because you insisted that we share custody.
- I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?
I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.<eos> You're not, though, are you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're not cuckoo, are you?
You're not cuckoo, are you?<eos> I...<eos> - I'm... I'm Ray.<eos> - I'm Jill.<eos> You're not Ray Wentworth, are you?
You've heard the expression 'penny for your thoughts.'<eos> Well, here are ten dimes for your thoughts.<eos> "Signed, the numb-nuts that's dating you."<eos> Stupid.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
What kind of cards you write, Wentworth?<eos> Romance.<eos> Romance.<eos> So every time I forget to give one of your mushy-ass cards to my girl, I get cut off for a month.<eos> Perhaps if you were well-endowed, you wouldn't need one of my cards.
What happened to him?<eos> Shouldn't I be asking you that?<eos> - You think that I...?<eos> - He was your competition, right?<eos> You got somebody watching over you.
And what about you?<eos> Well, see, I still... I get to live here while it goes on.<eos> It's kind of like a living showroom.<eos> Never been done.<eos> You're crazy.
He didn't drown.<eos> Well, he didn't swim very good.<eos> Very well.<eos> He didn't swim very well.<eos> You teach English with that mouth?
I did it.<eos> It's the best I ever wrote.<eos> It... it's pithy and it's sweet.<eos> It's got heart, and after this, I'm done, okay?<eos> I'll make sure you're well-compensated.
You can't have it.<eos> What?<eos> You can't have it!<eos> I didn't write it for you.<eos> I'm gonna give it to the person I wrote it for, and you can suck my dick, okay?
Aah! Damn thing cut me!<eos> Now... where's your card?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Styvesan told the boss that you did have it.<eos> He said that you said that it was your best card ever.
Now... when my junky nephew and Jill bore a child,<eos> Of course, I was foolish enough to let her stay in the child's life.<eos> It was a tangled web indeed, but now I intend to clear the situation up, once and for all.<eos> You can have it.<eos> You get the card, Jill gets the girl.
What do you want with this man'?<eos> He's an enemy of the state.<eos> An enemy?<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> Brother, you and your family are welcome to stay with us.
Where is the grain?<eos> Where is it?<eos> - You want me to sign this?<eos> - The land belongs to the state.<eos> You, your icon, your land... all belong to the state now.
You, your icon, your land... all belong to the state now.<eos> Here, take the knife.<eos> It was father's.<eos> It's time for you to leave.<eos> Before you leave, I want you to hold the ancient and holy spirit of our village.
Kiev is where you belong.<eos> I love you.<eos> Wear it close to your heart.<eos> I don't think I'm that handsome.<eos> You have the gift.
- To work in a factory.<eos> - With your talent?<eos> - I have a duty to my family.<eos> - We all have duties.<eos> But you... are an artist!
The light, it picks up your eyes. It illuminates your soul.<eos> Please stay... exactly as you are.<eos> My eyes are good, but...<eos> I really must see what sort of work you've done. So...<eos> You have no soul.
Now dry them.<eos> No... with your hair.<eos> Dry them.<eos> Bring me the icon of Saint Yuri.<eos> And you and your family will be free.
Bring me the icon of Saint Yuri.<eos> And you and your family will be free.<eos> - No... it's freedom.<eos> We've been watching you.<eos> You aren't a Soviet.
I knew it was you.<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> - Please!<eos> I am in trouble!<eos> You're the only one that could help!
I do not know, some crazy lady.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> As I live and breath, The Wolverine.<eos> And he is a junkie now.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier.<eos> - It has gotten cracks in it.<eos> - Please stop.<eos> Bottom left.<eos> You're not listening.
Get it with chicken, get it with steak<eos> Get it with the cheescake right in the sell.<eos> It's the next big thing.<eos> Call now, supplies last!<eos> Who are you?
No one should live like this.<eos> Drugged in a fucking tank!<eos> - It's for your own good.<eos> - No no, it's not!<eos> You're waiting for me to die.
And I know you got more money squirreled away.<eos> Money to get us out of here.<eos> No, not us.<eos> You and him.<eos> You're saving to buy a sun seeker.
A year ago, you asked me to help you.<eos> God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really... if you are not gonna talk to me.<eos> I hear you at night.<eos> You are not sleeping
God knows I've tried.<eos> But I can't help you, Logan, not really... if you are not gonna talk to me.<eos> I hear you at night.<eos> You are not sleeping<eos> You don't wanna talk about that.
Best night ever!<eos> Hey, driver.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> You are such a doll.
That's your daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're still good inside.<eos> I know you want to help us.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.
So you saw Gabriela.<eos> But you did not call me.<eos> That hurts.<eos> You didn't shoot the both of them, did you?<eos> - No, did you?
Logan.<eos> - Logan.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> You will get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
All in, let's go.<eos> Sit back.<eos> Bring me the tracker.<eos> You.<eos> Who the hell are you?
You.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Hey!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?
Who the hell are you?<eos> Hey!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.
No, I don't<eos> Does she remind you of anybody?<eos> I read about you when I was a kid.<eos> I believe you're thinking of someone else,<eos> Now If I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.
Now If I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.<eos> You were helping round up all those old mutants.<eos> What changed?<eos> You got religion?<eos> I'm gonna need you to do one more thing for the good guys... and track one more special mutant for me.
There is no more money.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> She's not my child<eos> But I love her.<eos> You may not love her.
Two days.<eos> You saw what happened yesterday.<eos> If that shit, had gone on any longer...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura<eos> You didn't do anything.
If that shit, had gone on any longer...<eos> I did what I had to do to save Laura<eos> You didn't do anything.<eos> You'd just freaked out and had a fucking siezure.<eos> I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated rambling on like a lunatic
Please be like the rest of the world.<eos> Blaming someone else for your boring shit.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm such a giant disappointed.<eos> You honestly derived no sense of purpose. from what we are doing?
- That would be lovely.<eos> My name is Dr. Rice.<eos> But you can call me Xander if you like.<eos> My colleague tells me you have been some of resistant.<eos> He believes you've been dispensing delayed information.
- Ok, let's not go in that far.<eos> I mean I'll do it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - You wanna travel, I wanna travel.
- Son. Son.<eos> That sounds.<eos> It's the perfect.<eos> Why would you want to do that, Nate?<eos> Careful, you're speaking to a man who ran a school... for a lot of years, right, Charles?
But we have a long drive ahead...<eos> You need to rest, don't you?<eos> Yeah, we'll find a motel.<eos> The nearest one is two hours and it's not even that nice.<eos> We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and daughter... and you can sleep in the living room on the.
My son is happy to go with you.<eos> No, that's fine.<eos> The men that do this sometimes they can be...<eos> - I can go.<eos> - No, you got homework.
Yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> Logan.<eos> Logan!<eos> You still have time.
Something unspeakable.<eos> I have remembered what happened in Westchester.<eos> This is not the first time I've hurt people.<eos> Until today, I did not know.<eos> You wouldn't tell me.
I think I finally understand you.<eos> Logan...<eos> It's fantastic.<eos> You said you only needed the girl!<eos> Your friends had every chance, so did you.
Come!<eos> Now!<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Beware of the light.<eos> What the hell are you?
You can't just take..<eos> I don't know how you got me here but..<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can talk?
Hey.<eos> Let me drive.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Quit looking at me.<eos> You're dying.
Let me drive.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Quit looking at me.<eos> You're dying.<eos> You want to die.
She is sleeping down there.<eos> Do You want me to wake her up?<eos> No.<eos> You had a nightmare.<eos> Do you have nightmares?
Alright?<eos> Charles did not ask for this.<eos> Caliban never asked for this.<eos> And they are six feet under the ground.<eos> I do not know what Charles put into your head... but I'm not whatever it is you think I am.
Caliban never asked for this.<eos> And they are six feet under the ground.<eos> I do not know what Charles put into your head... but I'm not whatever it is you think I am.<eos> I even met you like a week ago.<eos> You got your Rebecca, your Delilah... your blah, blah, or whatever
It's wearing off.<eos> Go to your friends.<eos> Go.<eos> Laura?<eos> You'll know when.
We embarked on our next endeavour<eos> Grow on mutants on your own.<eos> - precisely.<eos> - These are dangerous times, James.<eos> You can't.
No no.<eos> Take your friends and run<eos> No.<eos> They'll keep coming.<eos> Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.
PAUL: Just look out for translucent scorpions.<eos> GRETCHEN: I feel like all scorpions are probably dangerous.<eos> Yeah, I mean, they all hurt, but the lighter the color the scorpion, the more dangerous it is.<eos> I wouldn't even worry about the black ones.<eos> Just watch your step. GRETCHEN: Paul, I feel like you do this to me all the time.
What are you doing?<eos> - I'm just...<eos> - Just be normal.<eos> Be normal.<eos> Ah, it's just really hot, and you know I'm afraid of heights.
Trail markers made of crushed Natural Ice cans from frat bros.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is the best campsite around, okay, and nobody even knows about it.<eos> How'd you know about it?
Doesn't make sense.<eos> Sure it does.<eos> I was born. Now I'm grown up.<eos> Almost grown up.<eos> Give me one more day to be your mom before you get to vote.
Ah, out of self-respect, I have to try at least once a year. (CHUCKLES)<eos> I just thought you could use a change of pace, is all.<eos> I appreciate that, Chet.<eos> It's kind of you to think of me.<eos> (SIGHS) Seems like you haven't had it easy, and you've always done good by your kid.
What are you suggesting we do?<eos> I think it would be helpful if Stacy... takes a break from school, vacation, if you will, until the dust settles.<eos> You can expect a call from our lawyer later this afternoon.<eos> You've always been decent to our family, Cora, but your son needs real help.<eos> And if you can't see that, apparently so do you.
I thought you wanted to leave.<eos> So, if you have a question, you Google it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely partial toward Google.<eos> Are you not?
You don't have to do this.<eos> Andi, what is going on?<eos> "What is going on?"<eos> You could have gone to Dresden.<eos> You said you want to stay.
My son.<eos> We constantly argue about the Unrechtsstaat.<eos> My son is of the opinion that the GDR was a state devoid of any justice.<eos> Next time you want to talk about me and my opinions in front of others... Then warn me please because it bothers me.<eos> You know what bothers me?
The one just recently.<eos> Come on tell me!<eos> Jana, Jana.<eos> Yes?<eos> I think you've got my cup.
Can we just continue to play?<eos> Please.<eos> I miss my mom.<eos> There's no point in missing something you can't have back.<eos> You have me.
I saw you.<eos> You kept looking at me.<eos> Sometimes we do things... without being conscious of it.<eos> I don't know what you mean?<eos> I think you know what I mean.
Does Peter mind you acting like this?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The way you throw yourself at men.<eos> Why are you like this?<eos> I want you to go, okay!
What's your New Year's resolution?<eos> Oh, I don't do them any more.<eos> But on New Year's Eve... Isn't it important to compensate your life?<eos> What?<eos> I think you mean, uh, "contemplate."
They seem like stories, but they're not.<eos> Misguided, no shape, no form.<eos> No reason.<eos> Like rummaging through unmarked boxes in a long-forgotten storage shed.<eos> You'll think it was a story, but try telling a friend of yours what happened in your dream the next day.
We have ice cream at home.<eos> Well, I like the kind at the store. We have that kind at home.<eos> Well, it's better at the store.<eos> It's exactly the same.<eos> You just wanna see that girl.
- When was this?<eos> Last night.<eos> The mirror wasn't even in the house last night it was in town getting restored for you.<eos> No, it's not for me.<eos> You just want to get rid of my hamsters.
Just a couple of days is not too much to ask, all right?<eos> And you can keep your hamsters.<eos> A couple of days, you're going to love the mirror.<eos> You're going to love that mirror.<eos> You can't tell me what I like or don't like.
Destruct... D-disturbs my c-concentra...<eos> See?<eos> N-no big words.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You tell jokes everyone can understand.
N-no big words.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You tell jokes everyone can understand.<eos> J-John's jokes only make sense to John.<eos> You don't get his jokes, but everyone else does.
Then why didn't you give Dennis the choice of going to Social Services? Because she would've sent him to Green Valley.<eos> Have you seen the fucking place?<eos> - I volunteer there twice a week. - Okay, well, it's fine.<eos> It's just not right for Dennis.<eos> You want a private hospital.
But you haven't, so it seems to me that you like the situation you're in.<eos> Makes you seem selfless, gives you room to operate. - Operate?<eos> - Well, no one would ever question or even suspect a tireless martyr.<eos> Suspect me of what?<eos> You're never gonna marry me, John, are you?
They're right on the edge of having another huge argument as always.<eos> W-why do they even stay together?<eos> They both must like to argue, but neither one of them will ever admit it.<eos> W-what's tonight's argument about?<eos> Lydia's trying to convince John that you're the reason there's so much tension.
Shit.<eos> Okay, now what's going on?<eos> D-do you think I'm a big dribbling mongoloid? Where...<eos> Where do you get these ideas, Dennis?<eos> I don't think you're that big.
- I was just kidding.<eos> - Well, you should stop.<eos> I'm not retarded.<eos> I'm just slow.<eos> I don't even think you're that slow, buddy.
I'm getting better and better at it.<eos> Can I see?<eos> - Oh, not yet.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Well, you get your private office.
Look at you. You're so proud of him.<eos> You'd make a great dad.<eos> Well, I wanna be a dad.<eos> I wanna be your husband.<eos> And I wanna know what you call those turbine engine-driven ceramic and titanium vehicles you see maybe once or twice in a lifetime.
You'd make a great dad.<eos> Well, I wanna be a dad.<eos> I wanna be your husband.<eos> And I wanna know what you call those turbine engine-driven ceramic and titanium vehicles you see maybe once or twice in a lifetime.<eos> I never remember what they're called. But what do you call that?
Spiders are not social animals.<eos> They have no families.<eos> If the spider's gene is to last into the next generation, he must approach the female by stealth, careful not to be seen by her.<eos> Because spiders are cannibals, and females are much larger than males.<eos> I would give you a ring today if you would live with Dennis.
To learn killing animals is okay, they gave you meat as a clue.<eos> You don't know how many times your meat at dinner time was someone you knew.<eos> I ate kids at dinner?<eos> Many times.<eos> Everybody kills little boys and girls, and they're all disappointed in you because you haven't done it.
That would be great.<eos> I do expect a fee, just not a cash fee.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You can't skirt issues by claiming they're not what you want to talk about.<eos> If I want to talk about the house and the car you can't afford, you must play along. Fair enough?
So it's half therapy, half browbeating?<eos> More like 90 percent therapy you think you need and ten percent therapy I think you need.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Well, we'll start with what you think your problems are.<eos> Who are you?
How intriguing. How mysterious.<eos> You know what makes you so unattractive in Susan's eyes?<eos> No.<eos> She thinks you couldn't hurt a fly.<eos> She thinks you're insignificant.
I'm gonna write down notes in it and keep them.<eos> Can you read?<eos> Well, uh, no, but what I've kinda been doing is asking other people to write down notes and then when I get home I ask John to read them to me.<eos> That's the coolest thing that I've ever heard.<eos> I w-w-was hoping you'd write me a note.
What surprise?<eos> You know I love surprises.<eos> Well, come on out.<eos> Come on out and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> Tonight, you're in charge.
So, what do I do?<eos> You graduate to stronger shit.<eos> You have to kill those close to you now.<eos> Friends, family, you have to kill more people like Susan.<eos> I think you're tricking me.
I won't do it.<eos> You're getting real close.<eos> I can smell your soul getting ripe.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> Oh, you'll do it, retard, or I'll find another retard, and he'll do it to you.
At least I'll see one familiar face today.<eos> Excuse me, Dr. Preston?<eos> - I am, uh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Thanks fucking Christ for that.<eos> I'm in the mood to vent, and you caught me at a hell of a time.
Retard stink.<eos> No, it smells good.<eos> Wait a minute, we're alone here, right?<eos> Yeah, turkeys, chicken, roast beef, it all takes a day.<eos> All right, so I'm going up here, you're gonna take the kitchen?
Okay, alright, I get it.<eos> Look, I know it's been a little tough lately, especially with Doctor Nefario accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,<eos> but our life of crime is over!<eos> Mel.<eos> Mel, you're with me on this, right?
I'm so happy!<eos> After all these years, finally I'm meeting you!<eos> - Yup, alright, good.<eos> - Oh, look at that!<eos> - You must be the beautiful wife!
Stop it!<eos> Sweet talker.<eos> How is my brother finding a wife like you when he is so bald?<eos> These must be my nieces!<eos> You're Agnes, you're small with big eyes!
He was?<eos> But me... not so much<eos> To Dad, I was just a failure.<eos> He never thought I had what it took to be a villain.<eos> But now you can help me prove him wrong.
That's adorable.<eos> Oh, look at that poor little guy.<eos> With his little boots.<eos> Nobody picked him.<eos> Margo, why don't you go up there?
Ohhh.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Tell you what, every unicorn you find, you can bring it home.<eos> I'd better build a big pen, right?<eos> But you know... there's a chance that you might not find one.
Gum one. Gum all.<eos> Seriously, how did this show never win an Emmy?<eos> And now, it's your turn to shine, my diamond!<eos> Hey, Clive.<eos> I guess you can say our plan was... out of this world.
Covered with enough poison to blow your mind... literally.<eos> Ouch!<eos> Good to know.<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> You're the getaway driver.
Niko...<eos> You!<eos> You refuse my son's engagement pig?<eos> What?<eos> May you and your daughter die a slow death and be buried with onions!
That's it, I'm out of here.<eos> You have no right to take that, we stole it together.<eos> Together?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> You did nothing but screwed up the whole time.
It's this guy you have to worry about.<eos> He's our designated chef.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Dr. Morgan. - Brian.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - And you must be Maddie.
Good choice.<eos> I know this sounds silly, but I would love to start my own business painting kid's bedroom murals.<eos> I don't know, like pirates, and fairies, and butterflies, and stuff like that.<eos> - That's be great. - You think so?<eos> Oh, yeah, around here, you'll clean up.
You know?<eos> I mean, not that I don't ever think about grabbing a Xanax.<eos> But I haven't.<eos> I haven't and I won't.<eos> Well, I think you're amazing.
I know.<eos> We won't have the family that we wanted. That we said we would. What you wanted.<eos> Honey, please stop worrying about me.<eos> You're the one that keeps going through hell.<eos> I know, but I just want what you want.
- Well, I'm not abandoning her I'm just going to work.<eos> You know, part-time. It's...<eos> I'm a doctor, you know, that's what I do.<eos> It's what we've talked about.<eos> And if you're here, it's so perfect.
You know, part-time. It's...<eos> I'm a doctor, you know, that's what I do.<eos> It's what we've talked about.<eos> And if you're here, it's so perfect.<eos> She loves you, you love her.
No.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Cora is mine.<eos> And the baby that they want you to carry is mine, too.<eos> You have a baby, Maddie.
- Brian.<eos> Tara what do you want?<eos> But... there was never supposed to be contact.<eos> What kind of mother sits in the bath and drinks while her baby cries?<eos> Who are you?
Did you find what you were looking for when you broke into my room?<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> And I'm gonna find out what it is.<eos> You were supposed to be on your way to work.<eos> Yeah, so were you.
Angela, come on, what is this?<eos> Lately they've been talking a lot about how worried they are about you.<eos> Oh, really.<eos> Have they?<eos> So I guess that you told them, didn't you?
- Answer me this question!<eos> - Brian, the baby. Can you just stop, please?<eos> - Make her answer.<eos> She's faking it.<eos> You knew it!
So is Cora and Gabriel.<eos> I didn't do this for the money.<eos> I gave my eggs so my babies would be taken care of.<eos> Taken care of by women whose only dream was to have a baby.<eos> You lied.
I gave my eggs so my babies would be taken care of.<eos> Taken care of by women whose only dream was to have a baby.<eos> You lied.<eos> You all lied.<eos> You sacrificed nothing.
Back in bed now, lie down.<eos> Oh, God, Brian I don't want this C-section.<eos> The baby's in distress, we don't have any choice.<eos> - Stay with me.<eos> - You and Gabriel are in good hands.
Welcome to the team, soldier.<eos> Really?<eos> No, you know...<eos> Just good luck!<eos> You're not afraid of the dark too, are you? Over.
Nobody getting rich? Oh, fuck me!<eos> And when I say horribly, my dear Lord... do I mean horribly.<eos> Back away, Vance.<eos> You step away from this doors, your answer's no, got it?<eos> Are you in charge here or are you not?
Of course we can!<eos> And should!<eos> Because there are men coming to kill us... right now!<eos> And you know what?<eos> Who are you anyway?
And should!<eos> Because there are men coming to kill us... right now!<eos> And you know what?<eos> Who are you anyway?<eos> - You are not in charge.
- What?<eos> Internet, man!<eos> Let's get to work!<eos> Ruby, you hide in the perfume store.<eos> Vance, you go to the KitchenWares, you're the first line of defense.
Internet, man!<eos> Let's get to work!<eos> Ruby, you hide in the perfume store.<eos> Vance, you go to the KitchenWares, you're the first line of defense.<eos> Mason, you head to the Home and Garden Store.
Let's get to work!<eos> Ruby, you hide in the perfume store.<eos> Vance, you go to the KitchenWares, you're the first line of defense.<eos> Mason, you head to the Home and Garden Store.<eos> You are the look-out.
They are in the store.<eos> You have to be very quiet and very strong.<eos> We can't let what our team did here tonight be for nothing.<eos> You understand?<eos> And you need to get home.
'Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Did you miss me? '<eos> I've only been gone four minutes.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
That's it, Mary - re...<eos> - Don't you start!<eos> - ...<eos> John, John...<eos> I think you have to pull over!
Rosie for short.<eos> Didn't you get John's text?<eos> No. I delete his texts.<eos> I delete any text that begins "Hi."<eos> No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents?<eos> We are.<eos> 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.<eos> 'Please repeat the question.'<eos> As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
So you take all the glory, thanks...<eos> - OK! - ...thanks all the same.<eos> Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?<eos> It's driving me nuts.<eos> Anything you say, Giles.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened?<eos> John, you amaze me.<eos> You know what happened?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> It's just you normally say that at this point. Hmm.
Why are you still talking about it?<eos> What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?<eos> I can't stand it, never can.<eos> There's a loose thread in the world.<eos> It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
You know I value your little contributions.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's been there since nine this morning.<eos> - Has it?<eos> Where were you?
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.<eos> - Yeah, until then, basically.<eos> That's enough now, love.<eos> Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.<eos> And you need to get to bed.
You're out of time.<eos> - Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> - Who? I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.<eos> You think you understand.
Well, that's news to me. Is it?<eos> He's already killed looking for that memory stick.<eos> AGRA always worked for the highest bidder, I thought that might include you?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
You're all right.<eos> Oh, you're sweet.<eos> You have a very kind face.<eos> God will smile on you.<eos> 'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm, I'm sorry, my love.'
I'm so sorry.<eos> And I don't just mean you.<eos> What?<eos> Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...<eos> You're R?
You found her but I found you.<eos> So perhaps not so clever.<eos> And now here we are. At last.<eos> Touche!<eos> Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
"Ammo," yes, you said.<eos> How's your Latin, brother dear?<eos> My Latin?<eos> Amo, amas, amat.<eos> I love, you love, he loves.
Yeah. I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.<eos> Although she does seem to enjoy them.<eos> Well, I'll have to give that a go.<eos> Got a lot to catch up on.<eos> 'You think you understand.
I think we're even now, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> - Oh, I think we're... - Mary, Mary... - ...even, definitely even.<eos> - Ssh, ssh.<eos> You were my whole world.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.<eos> Oh, you're not up to it, are you?<eos> Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I expect you're right.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.<eos> You need to remember that.<eos> So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.<eos> Might be the hardest case of your career.<eos> When I'm... gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.'
Yes?<eos> He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.<eos> When I'm gone, if I'm... gone I need you to do something for me.
Firefighters rushed to the scene but were too late for many patients and staff who were trapped on the upper floors of Eloise and are believed to have died in the blaze.<eos> In the years since its closing in 1982 after the fire. Countless locals have explored the vacant buildings of Eloise and reported chilling tales of hearing voices or screams and in some cases, seeing apparitions or even ghosts of deceased patients and staff roaming the asylum's empty, decrepit corridors,<eos> prisoners still.<eos> One former patient was reported as saying, "People tried to escape all the time."<eos> "But once you're committed into Eloise, you can't leave." "You can never leave."
We did find your brother's remains.<eos> The gas explosion was so intense that only dental records were able to make the positive ID.<eos> But we can't find Jacob Martin.<eos> During the course of my investigation,<eos> I've come across some things that are very strange, and I'm hoping that you can help me wrap my mind around them.
When things got really bad, he decided to take his own life.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> What the fuck are you doing with that razor?<eos> You scared the shit out of me.<eos> What the fuck are you doing in a ski mask?
- Whoa! - Shit!<eos> Really?<eos> Jesus.<eos> What up, man?<eos> So you ain't wearing' no pants.
He wants to use his new camera.<eos> I just said that.<eos> I need to talk to you outside for a minute.<eos> Okay.<eos> Scotty, you stay with Dill.
What did you say you were seeing?<eos> A little girl. She was trying to show me a box or something.<eos> Inside the nursery...<eos> Then she just vanished.<eos> You think I'm nuts.
Listen to me, please!<eos> The rain just stop.<eos> The building is a cloak.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> When were you came outside.
Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> This is gonna be yours now.<eos> You take good care of it.<eos> There's a gentleman waiting outside by a car, okay.<eos> And I want you to give this box to him.
Miss Sharon Christine Turner, I believe.<eos> Scout.<eos> Scout.<eos> Any plans for tonight, Professor Allen?<eos> - I'm so glad you asked that.
Scout.<eos> Scout.<eos> Any plans for tonight, Professor Allen?<eos> - I'm so glad you asked that.<eos> - I'm glad you're glad.
- Oh, I won't.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - For now.<eos> Trust me, it's way bigger than your mystery woman statue.<eos> - So you say.
And look, these hieroglyphics.<eos> That's not any language I've ever seen.<eos> That is incredible.<eos> You think that's incredible?<eos> Wait 'til you hear the most incredible part.
No.<eos> What we've got here is an alien spaceship.<eos> An ancient alien spaceship.<eos> I'm talking chariots of the fucking gods here, Richard!<eos> And you know something, I think it's still working.
It is, it is and not just from this whatever.<eos> The whole area...<eos> - ...is vibrating.<eos> - Really?<eos> You know, I believe you're correct.
- ...is vibrating.<eos> - Really?<eos> You know, I believe you're correct.<eos> Damn right.<eos> Damn right you are.
Fuck 'em, we go public.<eos> Yes.<eos> Right, we tell the world.<eos> We give fake that interview.<eos> That is why you are still the man and I love, you know.
What's wrong with the... can you help me?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, Scout.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> - You know you drive me nuts.
- You have no idea what I can do.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - But then we'd lose our little discovery wouldn't we, if I went all Strangelove on it?<eos> And I do so want to know what secrets you contain.<eos> Kontral, you are one supreme prick.
That's an understatement, Scout.<eos> - And he's sitting on...<eos> - The discovery of the century.<eos> Another understatement.<eos> Then I suggest, sir, that you decide what you want to do ASAP.
- And he's sitting on...<eos> - The discovery of the century.<eos> Another understatement.<eos> Then I suggest, sir, that you decide what you want to do ASAP.<eos> You do?
And when we scraped it off, something inside said it could now break free.<eos> Well, can it?<eos> I have no idea of knowing its power but I'm pretty damn sure that's what it's preparing to do.<eos> Well, we're just going to have to change its plans, aren't we?<eos> You're the boss.
Amazing what some guys'll do for major blow job.<eos> - From you?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - I care not.<eos> You do realize you're not getting out of here alive, don't you, dear?
Well, now that is very interesting.<eos> You really are linked to our little project, aren't you?<eos> All I did was interpret some etchings.<eos> Just doing my job, you creep.<eos> No, you're far more than that, way beyond random coincidence.
- To science?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, that's not going to happen.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> So you and I are going to continue our little walk alone.
- Not a one.<eos> You're the first woman on the moon, I believe.<eos> Any appropriate words?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> And you're wrong.
You know, I don't think we're ever gonna understand each other.<eos> Just when I think you've done the dumbest thing you could possibly do, you find something even dumber and you do it.<eos> (SCOFFS) Thank you.<eos> I promise you, this is not the moment to be a wiseass.<eos> And I know you think it's noble that you didn't rat out your friends.
Five?<eos> Hi, I'm Jason.<eos> It's my first time here.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> And you must be the bully of detention.
(ALL) Oh!<eos> Did you just slap me?<eos> I did.<eos> Weird, right?<eos> Now I'm gonna be here every day for what seems like the rest of my life, and I'm sure that you are, too.
The deal was I drop you somewhere, and I get the van for a few hours, okay?<eos> This is weird.<eos> Like, we don't know each other at all.<eos> I don't know what we're doing here.<eos> - And you seem kinda...
Oh.<eos> Then you know I punched his tooth out.<eos> I know they put it back.<eos> (BILLY PANTING)<eos> Dad, I hope you're watching.
No, no, no!<eos> Don't break it!<eos> Don't break it!<eos> Don't break...<eos> You broke it.
Nice hair. (LAUGHING)<eos> - Billy, look at me.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Do you feel weird?<eos> You mean like weirder than usual?
You still go to Angel Grove?<eos> (ZACK) Ha!<eos> Sometimes!<eos> You know, the other girl was here too, about an hour ago.<eos> Hey, you mean that girl right there?
Just jump.<eos> (ZACK) Come on, do it, dude.<eos> Let's go.<eos> (BILLY) The drop is probably more than 100 feet, which means death is imminent.<eos> Okay, so if you die, Billy, what's gonna happen?
Come in!<eos> (ZORDON) These are them?<eos> They're so small.<eos> Funny, I said the same thing, actually.<eos> You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe is placed in the hands of these... these children?
(ZORDON) Jason, my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita.<eos> That's why I'm in this wall.<eos> How'd you know my name?<eos> Because it's you, Jason Scott.<eos> You are the leader.
- Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Can I ask a question?<eos> Are we really superheroes?<eos> Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider, but I feel really good, you know, not as... (CHUCKLING) All right, look, bro, trust me, you're not a superhero.
Can I ask a question?<eos> Are we really superheroes?<eos> Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider, but I feel really good, you know, not as... (CHUCKLING) All right, look, bro, trust me, you're not a superhero.<eos> Why are you talking to us like you're the boss now?
- Of course.<eos> I don't know why I didn't think about that one in the first place.<eos> (THUNDER RUMBLING)<eos> (BOTH SPEAKING MANDARIN)<eos> So where were you today?
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.<eos> They will be an extension of you.<eos> And their power... is all but limitless.<eos> (BILLY WHOOPS, LAUGHS)<eos> But you're not ready for this power.
I can't... (ZACK) What, Zordon?<eos> You can't what?<eos> Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life?<eos> That's what all this has been about, right?<eos> You coming back?
- I can go home and get that.<eos> - Jason, you need me out of this wall.<eos> To help lead this team!<eos> Your team's dead.<eos> And you're just as scared as we are.
(TRINI GRUNTS)<eos> No, please, you're hurting me!<eos> You're so strong!<eos> (CHUCKLING) I'm just kidding.<eos> You've got spunk, little Yellow.
All I need to know is, where is the Zeo Crystal?<eos> (GASPING) I don't know.<eos> Sadly, I believe you.<eos> Tomorrow, I am going to destroy Angel Grove.<eos> But, in exchange for your life, you will find out where that crystal is, and you will come to me.
Of herself.<eos> But she shared it with me.<eos> Privately.<eos> She trusted me.<eos> And you sent that pic to... to Ty?
Let's just think about this, okay?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> (YELLS)<eos> Right on time.<eos> I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live.
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But for now,<eos> I need you to give your staff and your coin to us.
Mom, it's Trini!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> (ZORDON) This ranger team did what my team could not.<eos> You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.
Borg...<eos> Corona's a thousand.<eos> Give me a thousand coronas.<eos> I won a beauty content makes sense.<eos> You wanted to be the banker.
Do you think this is a test?<eos> Test of what?<eos> Like the trials of job.<eos> Like a test of faith?<eos> Um... I mean, you believe in god, right?
My dad got it for me.<eos> This story about racism, lynching, rape.<eos> Great bedtime story for an eight-year-old.<eos> For whatever reason i-i hung onto it, I connected with it.<eos> You're in there.
Longing for a foregone home.<eos> Perhaps a home that never was.<eos> And none of it matters.<eos> Even if god exists, he's forsaken us.<eos> You, human, go forth.
The Cubs?<eos> Man, not even close.<eos> Were they ever good?<eos> Happens to be my team.<eos> Where are you from?
Come on... We Italians believe in true love.<eos> - We, Italians?<eos> We're from Connecticut.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're gonna be saying that soon enough.
No, I can play.<eos> I've been rehabbing the knee.<eos> Getting ready, they said to come out again this year, so...<eos> Come on, Eric, all bad things lead to good things.<eos> If you say so, Gianni.
Pebber? What's that?<eos> Pbr...<eos> Pabst blue ribbon.<eos> Fantastic, I love it!<eos> By the way, you don't have a phone, you need a mobile.
I love you, too.<eos> Oh, Eric...<eos> You know I love you.<eos> That's everything.<eos> You love me and I love you.
You go out there and fight.<eos> Your team needs you, c'mon!<eos> The girl walking the guy home?<eos> I didn't realize that was the Italian way.<eos> It's not, but you're not Italian.
Your team needs you, c'mon!<eos> The girl walking the guy home?<eos> I didn't realize that was the Italian way.<eos> It's not, but you're not Italian.<eos> No, see, you think you can speak better, but you actually cannot.
Hey, did you like the game today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Paolo played really well today.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> So did you.
Me, too.<eos> But Paolo is... My teammate...<eos> And friend.<eos> I know.<eos> But Paolo and I had problems before you come.
Let me give you a little advice.<eos> Be careful to who you give your heart.<eos> Find a nice American girl, a traditional girl.<eos> What's wrong with Italian girls?<eos> You no want an Italian girl.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what are they saying?<eos> They think you shouldn't play Calcio storico because... Because you're American.<eos> What do you think?
I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's a shitty thing to do.<eos> Yeah, it's shit.<eos> You are shit.
It's our team, it's Santo Spirito's team.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Always doing what other people tell you to do.<eos> Paolo say you don't play, so you don't play.
Why not?<eos> - Because I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because I can't. You know I can't.<eos> She thinks you're dead.
I'm trying to sleep, can you stop ringing my damn phone?<eos> 'Sherlock has left his flat, first time in a week.'<eos> - So I'm having him tracked.<eos> - 'Nice.'<eos> It's very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.
Shezzer.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street?<eos> You should be at Baker Street. I am.<eos> So are you.
I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then?<eos> Because I'll tell you something, John Watson, you will not have me!<eos> Have you spoken to Mycroft?<eos> Molly?<eos> They don't matter, you do.
I want to know why?<eos> Because Mrs Hudson's right.<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling, and I'm never climbing out.<eos> I need you to know, John. I need you to see that up here, I've still got it.
Molly can examine me on the way, it'll save time. - Ready to go, Molly?<eos> - Um, well...<eos> Just tell me when to cough.<eos> I hope you remembered my coat.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were going to be here.
- If you keep taking what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks. Exactly, weeks!<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> For Christ's sake, Sherlock, it's not a game!<eos> I'm worried about you, Molly, you seem very stressed.<eos> - I'm stressed, you're dying!
Absolutely, yes.<eos> The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals, step by step, the solution.<eos> That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.<eos> Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington The Poisoner.<eos> I think you slightly gave away the ending.
You... you're so funny, you are!<eos> Mrs Hudson?<eos> He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock.<eos> Always going on about you.<eos> I mean, he knows you're an idiot, but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.
Don't want to rush this.<eos> You're Sherlock Holmes.<eos> 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.<eos> Might be the hardest case of your career.<eos> When I'm... gone, if I'm gone, I need you to do something for me.
I'm never going to be OK.<eos> And we'll just have to accept that.<eos> It is what it is, and what it is is... shit.<eos> John, do better.<eos> You didn't kill Mary.
You didn't kill Mary.<eos> Mary died saving your life.<eos> It was her choice, no-one made her do it.<eos> No-one could ever make her do anything.<eos> The point is, you did not kill her.
As I think I have explained to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people...<eos> - Would complete you as a human being.<eos> - That doesn't even mean anything.<eos> Just text her, phone her, do something while there's still a chance, because that chance doesn't last forever.<eos> Trust me, Sherlock, it's gone before you know it.
Why not, given your immediately alternative?<eos> - What about his brother?<eos> - Mycroft?<eos> He's fine.<eos> So, you're off now.
- Have what?<eos> The deduction thing.<eos> The deduction thing?<eos> Yes.<eos> More than you can know.
Then we move.<eos> What's the trigger response time?<eos> Once we're mobile, how long before detonation?<eos> We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.<eos> John and I will take the windows, you take the stairs. - Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.
- Is a phone call possible?<eos> - Phone call?<eos> John has a daughter, he may wish to say goodbye.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will set off the grenade.<eos> I hope you understand.
- Why? - Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.<eos> He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.
I want to meet her.<eos> 'I don't need your help.'<eos> Redbeard was my dog.<eos> I know what happened to Redbeard.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.
Oh, dear.<eos> We seem to have lost the connection.<eos> How have you done this?<eos> How is any of this possible?<eos> You put me in here, Mycroft, you brought me my treats.
- There's a gun in the hatch.<eos> Take it.<eos> You want to save the governor's wife, choose either Dr Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor. Oh!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> You can't do it, Sherlock. If you do it, it won't count. I'll kill her, anyway.
Hang on.<eos> What advantage did your moral code grant you?<eos> Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life?<eos> You didn't have to kill her!<eos> The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
Yes.<eos> You know, a violin.<eos> In exchange for?<eos> She's very clever.<eos> I'm beginning to think you're not.
Are we clear?<eos> - What's she doing?<eos> - She's making tea.<eos> But why isn't she answering her phone?<eos> You never answer your phone.
Softer, Sherlock.<eos> Molly, this is for a case.<eos> It's... it's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.
You bastard!<eos> 'Say it anyway.'<eos> 'You say it.<eos> Go on.<eos> You say it first.'
'Sweet Jim, he was never very interested in being alive, 'especially if you could make more trouble being dead.'<eos> Yeah, still not interested.<eos> The plane! 'You knew he'd take his revenge.<eos> 'His revenge, apparently, is me.'<eos> Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like.
Save my soul, seek my room.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> We're going to crash!<eos> I'm going to die!<eos> I think it's time you told me your real name.
The game, yes, I get it now.<eos> The song was never a set of directions.<eos> I'm in the plane.<eos> I'm going to crash.<eos> And you're going to save me.
One thing was clear.<eos> He was the boss.<eos> He set up his office, right smack dab in the middle of the house.<eos> He conducted meetings.<eos> You called?
I'm naked!<eos> Say "naked<eos> No!<eos> Who's Mommy's little cutie?<eos> Are you Mommy's little cutie?
Fart!<eos> Poop!<eos> Doodie!<eos> I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.<eos> You can talk!
Doodie!<eos> I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.<eos> You can talk!<eos> Uh, goo-goo ga-ga.<eos> No, you can really talk.
No, you can really talk.<eos> I heard you!<eos> Fine.<eos> I can talk.<eos> Now, let's see if you can listen.
It's called efficiency, Templeton.<eos> The average toddler spends, what? 45 hours a year on the potty?<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> I don't have that kind of spare time.<eos> Well, you're not the boss of me.
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out about this.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You think they'd pick you over me?<eos> With your track record?<eos> You don't know anything about me.
What's going on?<eos> It's an invasion!<eos> It's a play date!<eos> That's a keeper.<eos> It's a meeting, and you won't be attending.
The tape, Timmy!<eos> Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.<eos> No!<eos> Let go!<eos> You let go!
I don't want your filthy money.<eos> Look, I told you to stay out of my way.<eos> I can't!<eos> You're in my house.<eos> I don't wanna be here... anymore than you want me to be here.
It'll explain everything.<eos> What do you want me to do with that?<eos> I want you to suck it.<eos> You suck it!<eos> No, it's for you to suck.
Going upsies!<eos> So how come I don't remember this place?<eos> You did.<eos> But after normal babies get their pacifiers taken away... you forget all about Baby Corp.<eos> How come you're not normal?
Okay.<eos> That's a vegetable.<eos> Point is, the puppies' slice is getting bigger and bigger.<eos> They're stealing all our love!<eos> Just like you did to me.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Slice!<eos> No, no.<eos> There's nothing here about a new puppy.<eos> Aren't you gonna do any work?
It's disgusting.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> We can get inside Puppy Co... and find out what the new puppy is!<eos> What's the point?<eos> You're grounded.
You don't recognize me?<eos> Perhaps from my youth!<eos> Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?<eos> He is him?<eos> And him is you?
And him is you?<eos> Except older and wrinklier.<eos> That's not right.<eos> No.<eos> You were my hero!
Good!<eos> Uh-oh!<eos> My training wheels!<eos> I can't ride without training wheels!<eos> Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right!
I care!<eos> Baby Corp is going to go out of business.<eos> That's all you ever talk about.<eos> You don't even know what it's like to be part of a family.<eos> And you don't know what it's like to have a job!
And you don't know what it's like to have a job!<eos> You don't know anything about hugs, or bedtime stories, or special songs!<eos> Oh, please!<eos> Stop acting like a baby.<eos> You're a baby!
Wake up, little halflings!<eos> It's 7:00 a.m.<eos> What's the point, Wizzie?<eos> Because it's 7:00 a.m.<eos> I have one job to do, and you make it so difficult.
And yet here you stand, a hero.<eos> I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.<eos> I swear.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar... wishing you could.
No, I won't.<eos> You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.<eos> I bet it's the one-inch man.<eos> After all these years, I've found you.<eos> And who the hell are you?
Yondu!<eos> Come on down!<eos> After going around years in circles... with this woman I end up marrying.<eos> I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...<eos> "but you're losing your mind!"
I demand a seat at the table!<eos> I wear these flames, same as you.<eos> You may dress like us... but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.<eos> And the Colors of Ogord... will never flash over your grave.<eos> If you think... I take pleasure in exiling you... you're wrong.
We followed him because he was the one... who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.<eos> Seems he's goin' soft.<eos> If he's so soft, why are you whispering?<eos> You know I'm right, Kraglin.<eos> You best be very careful what you say about our captain.
Empaths feel feelings.<eos> Emotions.<eos> May I?<eos> All right.<eos> You feel love.
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!<eos> The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.<eos> That ain't right!<eos> I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.<eos> No matter how many times Quill betrays you... you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
I called her my river lily.<eos> And from that love, Peter... you.<eos> I have searched for you for so long.<eos> And when I heard of a man from Earth... who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...<eos> I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.
It's metaphorical!<eos> Yeah!<eos> For what?<eos> For it is a name what strikes fear... into the hearts of anyone what hears it.<eos> Okay. whatever you say.
For what?<eos> For it is a name what strikes fear... into the hearts of anyone what hears it.<eos> Okay. whatever you say.<eos> You shut up.<eos> You're next.
We're killing you first.<eos> Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life... as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.<eos> That's enough killing for today.<eos> She's the daughter of Thanos.<eos> I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.<eos> She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.<eos> Peter...<eos> Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.<eos> But you left... the most wonderful woman ever... to die alone.
You can't imagine what that's like!<eos> I know exactly what that feels like!<eos> I had to watch her die!<eos> Over the millions and millions of years of my existence... I've made many mistakes, Peter.<eos> But you're not one of them.
Mantis... can you show us where we'll be staying?<eos> Why are there no other beings on this planet?<eos> The planet is Ego.<eos> A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.<eos> And you're not a flea?
The only family I ever had.<eos> When I broke the code... they exiled me.<eos> This is what I deserve.<eos> Slow down, drama queen.<eos> You might deserve this, but I don't.
It's a day for dumbass names.<eos> You're smiling.<eos> And for a second, I got a warm feeling.<eos> But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.<eos> You like a professional asshole or what?
What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I'm not going to dance with you.<eos> This is Sam Cooke... one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.<eos> Drax thinks you're not a dancer.
What unspoken thing?<eos> This...<eos> Cheers, Sam and Diane... a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other... but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down... sort of thing.<eos> There's no unspoken thing.<eos> Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it, then it would be spoken... and you would be a liar.
I'm not trying...<eos> He's my father.<eos> He's blood.<eos> You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.<eos> Again, you made me come here!
That's why it would get zero ratings!<eos> I don't know what Cheers is!<eos> I finally found my family.<eos> Don't you understand that?<eos> I thought you already had.
I bested you in combat.<eos> No.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.<eos> You let me live!
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe just because I wanted to win.<eos> Do not tell me what I want.<eos> I don't need to tell you what you want!<eos> It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win.
It's obvious!<eos> You were the one who wanted to win.<eos> And I just wanted a sister!<eos> You were all I had.<eos> But you were the one who needed to win.
You all right, son?<eos> I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's fortuitous... you listening to this song.<eos> - You know...
He came on a summer's day<eos> Bringing gifts from far away<eos> Like the child I put in your mother... or the freedom you brought Gamora.<eos> Brandy, you're a fine girl<eos> What a good wife you would be
The sea calls the sailor back.<eos> He loves the girl, but that's not his place.<eos> The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.<eos> And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.<eos> Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
I'm immortal?<eos> Really?<eos> Yes!<eos> As long as the light exists.<eos> And I can use the light to build cool things... like how you made this whole planet?
Really?<eos> Yes!<eos> As long as the light exists.<eos> And I can use the light to build cool things... like how you made this whole planet?<eos> It might take you a few million years of practice... before you get really good at it.
I should have told you earlier.<eos> I'm stupid.<eos> You are in danger.<eos> What is that?<eos> Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.
I can lord this over him forever.<eos> What are you laughing at me for?<eos> You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You don't know anything about me, loser.
I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.<eos> I'm serious, dude!<eos> Just like my own damn parents who sold me... their own little baby, into slavery.<eos> I know who you are, boy.<eos> Because you're me.
They never felt a thing.<eos> But one after the other, they failed me.<eos> Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.<eos> Until you, Peter.<eos> Out of all my spawn... only you carried the connection to the light.
We are beyond such things.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Now...<eos> - But my mother...<eos> You said you loved my mother.
Now, all right... I know that sounds bad.<eos> Who in the hell do you think you are?<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> I tried... so hard... to find the form... that best suited you... and this is the thanks I get?<eos> You really need to grow up.
Gamora?<eos> Do you have any tape?<eos> Tape!<eos> Never mind.<eos> Drax, do you have any tape?
No, we need to stop it.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> You are a god.
It's got 300 songs on it.<eos> 300 songs?<eos> Wait.<eos> Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.<eos> I think Yondu would want you to have it.
What?<eos> It's just... some unspoken thing.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It is.<eos> And so are you.
You gotta clean up your room.<eos> It's a complete mess.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> I am not boring.<eos> You're boring.
I have some news.<eos> Guess what?<eos> You're taking me to Bora-Bora?<eos> That was a joke.<eos> As you were.
He's all I have. Is there another way around? That's not true.<eos> You have me. No, I don't. Kendra, you told me yourself, you don't want children.<eos> Gardner, that's not what I meant. You know that.<eos> You never wanted children.<eos> And I'm sorry you had to raise me at all.
Anywhere off the grid.<eos> Disabling the phone.<eos> So, uh, Gardner, when you said that you killed your mother, what exactly did you mean by that?<eos> She died giving birth to me.<eos> That doesn't mean that you killed her.
So if you really wanna get rid of me, you have to get out.<eos> Because I'm gonna find my father.<eos> You know, when people talk to me that way, they get their ass kicked.<eos> Try it. I'm rockin' this gravity.<eos> Okay. Maybe you actually believe it yourself.
And then you blurt that out, just like that?<eos> What? Yeah.<eos> Uh... Because you may wanna just play it cool, you know?<eos> Ease yourself into the love game.<eos> But I do think you're beautiful.
What? Yeah.<eos> Uh... Because you may wanna just play it cool, you know?<eos> Ease yourself into the love game.<eos> But I do think you're beautiful.<eos> You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
There's a difference. Secondly, people don't go around saying what they feel whenever they feel it.<eos> They have guards and shields and other metaphors.<eos> And if we all went around just declaring our innermost desires to the exact people we felt them for, well, then we'd all end up happy, or something.<eos> Look, Gardner...<eos> I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful and I've kind of had an amazing time with you.
I think it's time to go.<eos> Let's get you to California.<eos> You hear what I said?<eos> Whoa.<eos> Yeah, I did. Uh... But, Gardner, I think you're sick.
My mother was Sarah Elliot.<eos> She died giving birth to me.<eos> Sarah Elliot died from pressure suit failure.<eos> That's not... That's what they said, but...<eos> You're my father. Is this some kind of scam? No, he's not lying.
She was fearless.<eos> She was kind.<eos> And she just seemed so invincible.<eos> And she made me wanna give up living when she died.<eos> You loved her.
And she just seemed so invincible.<eos> And she made me wanna give up living when she died.<eos> You loved her.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're my father.
The pig competition's nearly over.<eos> So they're taking all the pigs back to the company.<eos> But Okja's ours.<eos> We bought her from them.<eos> You sent them the money!
She'll spend the night at the Mirando building in Seoul. And tomorrow, she'll be on a plane to America.<eos> She's a celebrity now!<eos> Mija.<eos> To be honest... you're nearly a grown woman now.<eos> I don't like you playing with that pig all day.
Oh, my God...<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Go away, you'll get hurt!<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You're not going anywhere!
This is the building where Mirando experiments on their genetically mutated animals.<eos> Because genetic mutation is too dangerous, Mirando's been disguising it as natural, safe and non-GMO.<eos> But that's a complete scam.<eos> Millions of GM pigs are already lining up in front of slaughterhouses.<eos> You and the other local farmers are just promotional devices for them.
But to do so, we need video from inside the lab, footage of the horrible atrocities being committed against the animals.<eos> And there's a problem.<eos> The security is impenetrable.<eos> But there is a way.<eos> Although we will only go ahead with it if you give us your consent.
We promise to bring her back to you.<eos> If our mission succeeds, we'll be able to shut down Mirando's super pig project completely.<eos> And we'll be saving millions of super pigs like Okja from death.<eos> But we won't do it without your approval.<eos> If you don't approve, we won't do the mission.
I don't care about that.<eos> I want to see Okja first. Or I won't cooperate.<eos> - Mija...<eos> - She said no.<eos> Mija. Mija, I don't think you understand this situation.
We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?<eos> We are doing you a favor.<eos> Do you get it now?<eos> Yep, yep, yep.<eos> You want to go back home with Okja, right?
Fuck Nancy.<eos> - She's been here a while.<eos> - I told you to keep her away!<eos> She frightens people!<eos> You frighten people, too, Lucy.
Go figure!<eos> We all love the face and the anus, as American as apple pie!<eos> Hot dogs. It's all edible. All edible, except the squeal.<eos> - So you're the other Mirando.<eos> - And you are?
I got to cancel my credit card, 'cause this Reggie guy might have it, you know?<eos> Oh, right, that's the lesson we have to learn:<eos> that black people will ruin your credit. No...<eos> What?<eos> Dude, you... you have to stop.
Oh, right, that's the lesson we have to learn:<eos> that black people will ruin your credit. No...<eos> What?<eos> Dude, you... you have to stop.<eos> And you have to stop. I mean...
You mean nobody ever went after the guy for revenge?<eos> Can you just move past it like they did? Okay.<eos> Let's go find your guy.<eos> All right, all right, but let me do the talking, because, you know, guys like Z, they don't like strangers.<eos> Yeah, but you're not you.
- What if we have priors? - I do have priors.<eos> Oh, I have priors, too.<eos> I-I didn't mean us, I meant them. Dude.<eos> That could be...<eos> He probably does have priors. You prob...

Just saying.<eos> He touches everything.<eos> It's up to you, bear.<eos> I can't afford it without him.<eos> I know you can, but I don't want-- Elliot.
Be a student, man.<eos> It's the last time to have no responsibilities.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> I want what you have.
That's all out there waiting for you.<eos> Believe me, what I have is great.<eos> It is. But I missed out on all this.<eos> I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation could have done for me.<eos> You have a scholarship, man.
I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation could have done for me.<eos> You have a scholarship, man.<eos> You should be upstairs studying right now.<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's a good thing you're not jealous.
Thank you!<eos> An oldie old gold coin, huh?<eos> Yeah. I put it back on the little table next to the bed.<eos> I didn't want to keep it.<eos> 'Cause you're the best, most honest, smartest, cutest, heaviest, oldest person here.
You know that, right?<eos> She's gonna do a psychic cleansing after everyone leaves.<eos> Cool.<eos> Can I leave too? No.<eos> She's just gonna burn some Sage, and you are going to be nice.
Yeah.<eos> And now if they're gone, then what's the big deal?<eos> We burned all that bad shit away, right?<eos> That's tight.<eos> You're actually psychic?
- Okay, let's just take some deep breaths. - Okay.<eos> So if nothing happens, i should believe 'cause it means you got rid of the spirit?<eos> -Elliot, come on.<eos> -What?<eos> We all know you don't believe in this stuff, but can you just please let her do it?
Yeah, he's, uh-- he's not wrong about that.<eos> This is-- this is- you know what?<eos> -You want to blindfold me too? Just hang on.<eos> I'll take you up on that.<eos> -I'm all down for the blindfolding, whatever you got.
I admit it.<eos> You put the keys in a pot on the stove.<eos> Did you?<eos> You heard.<eos> You were listening for it, weren't you?
Did you?<eos> You heard.<eos> You were listening for it, weren't you?<eos> Well-- well, i-- i didn't hear that.<eos> Did you?
Hmm? Fuck him.<eos> Bear, you went away there for a second.<eos> I did?<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> God, you're shivering.
Yeah, sh-she's been really sick and scared.<eos> And John's been acting weird.<eos> You guys seemed like you were great.<eos> But were we?<eos> You saw them dancing together.
- Don't--<eos> Elliot-- don't touch her.<eos> What?<eos> Don't touch her.<eos> You are a crazy paranoid, bro!
Yeah, you're a little warm.<eos> Okay, so you weren't with John.<eos> Am I hearing things?<eos> Am I seeing things?<eos> Tonight, you thought the house was empty when we were here.
Okay, so you weren't with John.<eos> Am I hearing things?<eos> Am I seeing things?<eos> Tonight, you thought the house was empty when we were here.<eos> You went away, Elliot.
So, you're not gonna be late, right?<eos> No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp, right where we parked.<eos> I'm gonna find out how real this thing is.<eos> The name.<eos> You're gonna talk to the landlord about the furniture?
Are you with them?<eos> You have a weird house, Mr. daizy.<eos> Really.<eos> It-- i-it's awful.<eos> Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way, but they did sign a lease.
Well, obviously he was bat-shit crazy.<eos> But if you remove all references to something in the past, that past no longer exists.<eos> Even the idea of it is gone.<eos> Maybe somebody wanted to make this bye bye man disappear permanently.<eos> And you've got the last record of it right there.
I was wrong.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll be down in a sec.<eos> The bye bye man doesn't exist anywhere else that I could find.<eos> You don't have to look for him, Elliot.
He's trying to get inside us.<eos> He got in her. He's gonna drive us crazy.<eos> He's gonna kill us. You mean the-- yeah.<eos> He's why i was late to get you.<eos> He's why you're feeling sick.
Have you said the name to anyone?<eos> The name?<eos> No.<eos> N-no.<eos> Have you?
Yes, I was talking about Kim.<eos> There was a hammer in her bag.<eos> It was covered with blood.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Train's engineer said that you were chasing Kim with the hammer.
Elliot?<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> No?<eos> They found Kim's roommate, Katie Williams.<eos> She was killed by a hammer too, but you knew that, didn't you?
I-<eos> - Sasha, no.<eos> I was at the library.<eos> He made me lose track of time.<eos> You have--
-Don't say it.<eos> Don't think it.<eos> You were right.<eos> -Quiet.<eos> Sasha, what doesn't he want you to say?
I'm her boyfriend.<eos> She needs me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> But right now you're gonna come with me.
Good news for you, maybe.<eos> Kim hines wrote a suicide note, taking responsibility for her roommate and for the deaths of you and the other two living at your house.<eos> So I guess she was planning on killing you too.<eos> Is that what happened, Elliot?<eos> You found out and you chased her?
So you chased her into a train?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You could lose everything.<eos> Your-your scholarship, that pretty girl.<eos> You are a smart kid.
You could lose everything.<eos> Your-your scholarship, that pretty girl.<eos> You are a smart kid.<eos> Talk to me and i-- i can help you.<eos> Otherwise it'll be out of my hands, and you'll be wishing that you had.
What the hell is going on, man?<eos> Thanks for coming to get me, but I gotta go.<eos> Was it Sasha and John-- hey, talk to me.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Whatever is going on, there's nothing you can do.
You've got a family.<eos> Go take care of them.<eos> Elliot.<eos> Hey!<eos> You are my family.
Oh, fuck. I almost killed you with a bat.<eos> Fuck, he's not gonna get us.<eos> He's not going to get us. I'll figure this out.<eos> I'm sorry, but--<eos> I'm sorry. I can't call an ambulance, 'cause you're gonna say it.
Just put it-- put it down. Okay?<eos> No.<eos> I love you.<eos> Butintheend , Larry was a hero.<eos> You tell people that. Larry erased him.
I'm coming.<eos> I know it's hard, but don't be afraid, and don't believe anything you see.<eos> What?<eos> No, you're not real.<eos> You're not real.
Elliot, what the hell is going on?<eos> Virgil, please get her out of here.<eos> Uncle Elliot!<eos> Okay, peanut.<eos> I need you to listen to me, okay?
Virgil, please get her out of here.<eos> Uncle Elliot!<eos> Okay, peanut.<eos> I need you to listen to me, okay?<eos> I need you to go to the truck.
I'm not crazy!<eos> -Let me help you.<eos> -No, you can't.<eos> But I can help you, if you go!<eos> I'm not going to let you catch it!
Uncle Elliot!<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The fire can't hurt him anymore.<eos> So this boy ran a librarian over, mutilated and murdered her children, and then killed his roommates and himself, and you had him in custody today, but you let him go?
Let's go.<eos> Am I... Am I free to go?<eos> Gentlemen, am... am I free to go?<eos> Harvey, you son of a bitch.<eos> Did you send the cops to my place of business?
Harvey... Yes.<eos> Yeah, I got it...<eos> I got all of it, right here, but it's mine.<eos> Mine and Chip's.<eos> No. You opted out of this one, remember?
Margaret, what can I do for you?<eos> Hawk.<eos> My log has a message for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Something is missing, and you have to find it.
Fuck you.<eos> You fucking bastard!<eos> I've known about this affair.<eos> I've known about this affair all along.<eos> Now, you lookee here.
And Phyllis?<eos> She's had a really rough day, I believe.<eos> Yes. I understand.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing here?
Well, that's good.<eos> For a while, day after tomorrow, I'll need to be on my own.<eos> That might be a good time for you to learn how to mind your own business.<eos> Well... meantime, there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.<eos> I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.
Phillip?<eos> You're late.<eos> Couldn't be helped.<eos> I missed you in New York, but I see you're still in Buckhorn.<eos> And you're still nowhere, is that correct?
Phillip?<eos> You're late.<eos> Couldn't be helped.<eos> I missed you in New York, but I see you're still in Buckhorn.<eos> And you're still nowhere, is that correct?
Two icecold Colonials.<eos> No, you guys, my daughter is with the wrong guy.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Everybody loves Steven.<eos> You don't know Becky.
Bill Shaker.<eos> Bill Shaker.<eos> Dougie Jones.<eos> Dougie Jones.<eos> Yes. I'm Bill Shaker, and you're Dougie Jones.
Of my life.<eos> I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Dougie.<eos> I'm so glad you're home, Dougie.
What are you getting at, Denise?<eos> Well, I know your profile, Gordon.<eos> Beautiful agent, barely 30.<eos> I'm oldschool, Denise.<eos> Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes.
Agent Tammy Preston has the stuff, Denise.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm speaking more as a woman now than as the chief of staff of the entire. Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> Don't you just love sometimes saying.
Not to mention the screaming hormones.<eos> I'm sorry, Gordon.<eos> I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.<eos> And I believe you're on the trail of something big.
You collect yourself.<eos> I've got to go see Sheriff Truman.<eos> I know she seems like a strange one, but her information has always been spoton.<eos> So...<eos> Margaret says that something is missing having to do with Special Agent Dale Cooper and only you can find... because of something about your heritage.
- Don't say a thing.<eos> I need to think out loud.<eos> Something is missing, and I need to find it.<eos> And the way I'm gonna find it has something to do with my heritage.<eos> You're an Indian.
He claims he's innocent and knows who did it, but can't say because it would breach national security.<eos> However... he got word to Chris here that these items, which he placed in his garden in Georgetown, are the clues to the identity of the killer.<eos> The congressman's dilemma.<eos> All right, you all can go get to work on this.<eos> And, Tammy, you stay and show me and Albert what you found in New York.
As happy as this news makes us, Albert, we can't put this on the radio.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I've been dying to see Mount Rushmore.<eos> It's good you want to hurry.<eos> We fly at dawn, and, Tammy, you're coming with us.
It's inscribed.<eos> Yes, it says...<eos> "To Dougie, with love, JaneyE."<eos> And now food is coming.<eos> You're still with me.
I could have told her that. Hold on a minute.<eos> She is now walking to Deputy Chief Hawk's office, where you are.<eos> Thank you, Lucy.<eos> Doris is coming.<eos> You hang tough, Harry.
Turn him around.<eos> How much did that man there on the television win?<eos> $425,000.<eos> Four hundred twenty f...<eos> And you're trying to tell us that you weren't in on this?
It sure was stupid of me to get caught up like I did.<eos> Thanks for getting me out of there.<eos> How'd you do this?<eos> Darya told me what happened.<eos> You needed to get out, Ray.
I saw something in Cooper.<eos> It may be the key to what this is all about.<eos> And I told him where I'm going, so if he comes after me, I'll get him there.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome the Nine Inch Nails.<eos> ♪ You'll dig in places ♪

He was gonna stay with me!<eos> Not tonight, he isn't.<eos> Mommy will be up soon, honey.<eos> Get down here, right now!<eos> You are in the doghouse, mister.
I... wwhere's your car?<eos> And your wallet?<eos> What happened to your wallet and your identification?<eos> And if that's work, you better get started right away.<eos> The last thing we need is you losing your job, Dougie.
Big day.<eos> - Dougie...<eos> - Big day.<eos> Yes, sweetheart.<eos> You have a super night too, Gordon.
You can count on that.<eos> This is you.<eos> This is me.<eos> Heads, I win.<eos> Tails, you lose.
And when I pass by the Double R, I say,<eos> "I wonder if they have a slice of cherry pie with my name on it."<eos> And when I come in, sure enough, you have it.<eos> Today you had two pieces of pie with my name on it, each one.<eos> Well, Miriam, it turns out you're one of our best pie customers ever.
Now!<eos> What the hell are all these childish scribbles?<eos> Hhow am I gonna make any sense out of this?<eos> Make... sense of it.<eos> I'm thinking you may need some good professional help, Dougie.
Later.<eos> - But that's your truck. - I know it's my truck.<eos> I can't talk to you about this here.<eos> I told you. Please go away.<eos> But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was.
I don't have any cigarettes either.<eos> Ah, the memory of tobacco. But I gave it up.<eos> Fuck you, Gordon.<eos> Now you're getting the personal treatment.<eos> Oh, you want personal?
Damn good coffee.<eos> So?<eos> Say what you came here to say.<eos> We have a feeling something is wrong. We don't know exactly what it is, but we need someone else who knows him extremely well to have a talk with him and afterwards tell us what you think.<eos> This is extremely important, Diane, and it involves something that you know about, and that's enough said about that.
This is extremely important, Diane, and it involves something that you know about, and that's enough said about that.<eos> Federal prison...<eos> South Dakota.<eos> Judge not, lest ye be judged.<eos> Listen, just the fact that you're here speaks louder than words.
Ten minutes.<eos> And I speak to him alone.<eos> Ten minutes, tops, or it's over when I say it's over.<eos> That's exactly the way it's gonna be, Diane.<eos> You'll control the curtain and the microphone.
Now, with this car business, yes, there's gonna be some insurance money.<eos> I don't know how much, but, Dougie, just think.<eos> If you hadn't blown that money gambling... $25,000 plus the insurance... We could have gotten you a great new car.<eos> Now who knows what we'll get?<eos> But I do not want you running off and gambling any more of that jackpot.
Come with me.<eos> This is the chair.<eos> I can't believe this day has come.<eos> Watch right here.<eos> Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.
I was the one who named it Jack Rabbit's Palace.<eos> He saw all this.<eos> Whatever this is.<eos> That's my dad.<eos> We'll go up there two days from now, and you can lead the way, just as your dad wanted.
There is no "us."<eos> Batman and Joker are not a thing.<eos> I don't need you.<eos> I don't need anyone.<eos> You mean nothing to me.
Stupid.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> There, which one is, uh...<eos> Okay.<eos> You complete me.
Going somewhere?<eos> Clayface, Freeze, bring me the new Commissioner Gordon.<eos> - We're on it.<eos> - Cool.<eos> And, Harley, you know what to do.
Joker, what are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry, my Bat-ears must be malfunctioning because it sounds...<eos> I surrender!<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Cool it. You're a criminal.
I'm sorry, my Bat-ears must be malfunctioning because it sounds...<eos> I surrender!<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Cool it. You're a criminal.<eos> You run, and I catch you.
Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?<eos> Alfred, you've been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay.<eos> - It's Pinot grigio, sir.<eos> - Whatever it is.<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.
- Whatever it is.<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> You're satisfied serving me.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Now, I'm gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.
And we're just gonna gently ease out of here.<eos> And here we go.<eos> Okay. Like all superheroes,<eos> Superman has zero friends, and he spends most of his time basking in sweet, sweet isolation, here at his alone palace.<eos> So, I'll keep him busy while you sneak into that vent and get the Projector.
I mean, if I met the right lady, and if she was just standing right in front of me, and we looked at each other and thought, "Hey, let's do this."<eos> "Let's be together."<eos> - Batman?<eos> - Yes?<eos> I hope you're back because you've decided to work together on the Joker case.
I'm good the way I am.<eos> B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.<eos> I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.<eos> But you're not who I thought you were.
He's evil, he's magic, and it's about to get tragic.<eos> It's Voldemort.<eos> Magic!<eos> You are a fish.<eos> You are a frog.
It's Voldemort.<eos> Magic!<eos> You are a fish.<eos> You are a frog.<eos> You are a fish frog.
Padre?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you ever get scared?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.
I felt so jazzed!<eos> I say "jazzed"!<eos> I gotta give it to you, Batman. That was awesome.<eos> - Ha! And you were awesome. - Thanks.<eos> - And you were awesome.
I gotta give it to you, Batman. That was awesome.<eos> - Ha! And you were awesome. - Thanks.<eos> - And you were awesome.<eos> - I love compliments!<eos> And you were awesome, and I was amazing.
- And don't call me Dad.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.<eos> But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?<eos> Listen, you don't have a family.
So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Joker, you mean nothing to me.
We're home!<eos> What is the password?<eos> Iron Man sucks!<eos> When Dad and me were fighting, I was giving them my best one-liners.<eos> You complete me.
Blindsided our guards in the lobby.<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> - No.<eos> he'll be out again in a few hours. our guards will take it as a personal threat and will respond with whatever means necessary.<eos> I think you know what that means.
Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!<eos> we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you. And give you lots of hugs and kisses and tell you what a sweet little boy you are.
We were on the same soccer team.<eos> The Bombers.<eos> I played the goalie.<eos> Anyone could look that stuff up online.<eos> You... you're living in my house.
come on.<eos> I know you know more.<eos> I was 15 when they died.<eos> Why would I know anything more?<eos> And why do you think that there's more to know?
it is.<eos> I can only wonder what it's like inside that crazy little head of yours.<eos> You wanna know what it's like?<eos> It feels like this...<eos> When you're a ten-year-old boy and you watch your mother die... it feels like this!
- I'll take care of it.<eos> like you're taking care of the Danny Rand situation?<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> Shit.<eos> Are you behind this?
I expect more of you. That's all.<eos> Is he here all the time now?<eos> How much does he know?<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> - I think you know why it matters.
I'll tell you exactly what to do.<eos> Like always.<eos> Like always.<eos> are you awake? may your happiness never decline.<eos> May you attain the constant joy of the bodhisattvas.
You know... my brother's a very black and white kind of guy.<eos> Something's either true... or it isn't.<eos> I'm a little more... open.<eos> Meaning?<eos> You look like Danny Rand.
Don't.<eos> You're just torturing yourself if you think this might be Danny.<eos> Probably.<eos> But even so...<eos> Let's say you're right.
Aren't they, like, one of the richest families in New York?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they have a problem with you?<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> Look, Danny, it sounds like maybe you're in trouble, but I just don't think I'm the person to help.
Yeah.<eos> And they have a problem with you?<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> Look, Danny, it sounds like maybe you're in trouble, but I just don't think I'm the person to help.<eos> No, Colleen... you are the only person who can help me.
I'd like you to go and talk to her.<eos> See what she knows... why he called her.<eos> I have to do this?<eos> Why don't you send one of your guys?<eos> You are one of my guys, one of my most trusted guys.

Mr. Miller, PE.<eos> How does this make sense?<eos> How does what make sense?<eos> Danny...<eos> And I do mean Danny, because... I believe you're the real Danny Rand.
The Iron Fist is... It's me.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> Are you Danny Rand, or are you the Iron Fist?<eos> I'm...<eos> Danny... I believe you've been through some great trauma.
I, uh...<eos> We... we give ourselves superpowers, secret identities, Iron Fists... things that make us feel strong, special.<eos> I...<eos> I... I don't think I understand.<eos> If you want me to give it a medical label, I'm gonna suggest that you have an anxiety disorder with psychotic features.
Do... do you want to show me the Iron Fist?<eos> Let's see how it works.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.<eos> What I'd like for you to do... is to open yourself to the possibility that there is no Iron Fist.
You guess?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Because it doesn't seem that way when you directly disobey an order.<eos> I asked to have Danny moved to a safe location, and you tried to have him killed.
No.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> I...<eos> I'll take care of all of it.<eos> You're my son, and I'm gonna make you a great man.
But you sleep in that corner.<eos> And you don't go anywhere near the students.<eos> And... use the bathroom at Starbucks.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're the boss.
- Is this how you treat family?<eos> Yes, actually, it is.<eos> You know, the generosity of this offer speaks for itself.<eos> Look, you may not understand it, but Ward and I worked for this money.<eos> We worked day and night, while you were off doing... whatever you were doing.
We need to dig up every shred of physical evidence we can find to prove your identity.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> To turn down $100 million?<eos> It may have been the smartest thing you did, other than coming to me.<eos> You are worth billions, Danny.
You are worth billions, Danny.<eos> Not millions.<eos> It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.
Sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Too important.<eos> Okay, but you cannot be a drag tonight.<eos> We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.
I got a Red Hook punch.<eos> - Red Hook? - But it goes like this.<eos> Enough!<eos> The dojo is a place of respect.<eos> And who the hell are you?
So you're not gonna tell me.<eos> It's strategic. That's all.<eos> You know... it really pisses me off.<eos> What?<eos> The fact you won't tell me what you're planning.
Why did you go see him?<eos> I do what I want.<eos> No, actually, I do what I want.<eos> I can walk out of here, go to the corner for a cup of coffee, go to the movies, talk to people on the street.<eos> You can't.
Why did you change your mind?<eos> I channeled my inner Dad.<eos> but... have you put any serious thought into what he's gonna do here?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> You're the one that opened the door for Monastery Boy with the bowl.
you don't actually hold a position here.<eos> let me...<eos> let me explain.<eos> you hold the most dominant position on the board.<eos> So as much as you don't have a say in the day-to-day business...
robe-wearing<eos> Shaolin-type bald monks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Huh. - Pretty old school.<eos> So you were running around the mountains wearing robes.
- Better.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Feel good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I heard you and Danny grew up together.
Okay.<eos> Let me make this simple.<eos> The Hand is using our company to smuggle synthetic heroin into the city.<eos> We need to stop it.<eos> Harold said so himself. You were there.
- Going to lunch.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Meachum.<eos> Me, too.<eos> How'd the meeting go?<eos> Exactly what you said.
Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Danny Rand, right?
You cannot just show up here with all of this stuff expecting some...<eos> - Is this a date?<eos> - What?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> I mean, uh, unless you want it to be.
I had to wait for it to open again.<eos> So you said you wanted to talk about something?<eos> Oh. Yeah, I, um... I just...<eos> I would love to stick around and hear more, but I've gotta get going.<eos> You don't have to go.
How so?<eos> You've gone from homeless man to billionaire in a matter of days.<eos> All that money, press, power, makes you a target.<eos> People may try to take advantage.<eos> You didn't.
Up the field.<eos> Oh, that's a lovely ball.<eos> Back again...<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
He's going into shock. I have to improvise a chest seal.<eos> When he inhales... the card should suck into the wound... stop the air from going into his chest and collapsing his lung.<eos> When he exhales... the one unsealed side... should... allow the air to escape. And let his lung... re-expand.<eos> That was impressive.<eos> Hope you don't want your card back.
Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, this is not something a rich kid from the Upper West Side can just "handle," okay?<eos> This is a job that requires someone with special... skills.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Okay, we all have our limitations. You have to accept yours.
God!<eos> My mother says I can't escape meeting people like you.<eos> That it's my destiny.<eos> 'Cause if you really believe that you can take these sons of bitches out... then I have to believe, too.<eos> But going against them on your own, that's some foolish bullshit, no matter who you are.
You must always be aware of their presence, because they are aware of you.<eos> The time has come.<eos> Finally.<eos> They study your every move, looking for what you reveal to them.<eos> In this way, you are your own worst enemy.
That's Danny's problem.<eos> Our problem... is if he continues to decline, there'll be nobody for his daughter to come back to.<eos> If I go to the hospital, I'll be arrested.<eos> And they will kill Sabina.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. - You have no idea what they're capable of.
- Is that why you're here?<eos> - I don't think he knows why he's here.<eos> He's just a little boy chasing girls.<eos> The enemy will try and divide you.<eos> You are a living weapon.
Your former self will be destroyed.<eos> If you choose to take this up... you will be forever marked...<eos> As one of us.<eos> Are you willing to kill Danny Rand so that the Iron Fist might live?<eos> Who the hell are you?
To be used by their master.<eos> Who is your master?<eos> I serve only myself.<eos> Prepare to disappoint your master.<eos> And who do you serve?
I never believed I would meet another Iron Fist in my lifetime.<eos> I had hoped.<eos> But why are you in New York?<eos> Who are you?<eos> It seems you haven't come to destroy us, so I'm curious.
Danny Rand.<eos> The lost heir to your company.<eos> Yes.<eos> He and Madame Gao met earlier tonight.<eos> She finds it odd that you failed to mention the man whose identity you helped restore is also the legendary Iron Fist, the sworn enemy of the Hand.
She finds it odd that you failed to mention the man whose identity you helped restore is also the legendary Iron Fist, the sworn enemy of the Hand.<eos> Danny Rand doesn't even know I'm alive.<eos> I have no idea what an iron fist is.<eos> Sounds like a sex toy.<eos> Maybe you really are telling us the truth right now, and you really have no idea what you brought into this company.
Time isn't on our side.<eos> Look how out of control this has already gotten.<eos> What I had to do to protect you.<eos> I don't know how much more of this I can take.<eos> You know what needs to be done to end this, Danny.
What else have you been taking?<eos> I don't need your bullshit, Joy.<eos> You have no idea what my life is like.<eos> No goddamn idea.<eos> - Because you won't tell me!
- Because you won't tell me!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I ca...<eos> You need help, Ward.<eos> What I need is for you to stay out of my business.
Fine.<eos> Enjoy your secrets.<eos> It's late.<eos> Wasn't sure you were gonna pick up this time.<eos> - I'm glad you did. - What do you want?
Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are these for?<eos> 'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.
- Can you show me?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Mmm, what, do you think I can't handle it?<eos> That I'm too weak?<eos> Colleen, you're one of the strongest people I have ever met.
Hey, look, that wasn't your fault.<eos> He was my responsibility.<eos> I was supposed to protect him... and now Gao has him again and we might never be able to find him.<eos> So, yeah... I guess we both lost tonight.<eos> You're going to keep trying... aren't you?
I should go.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - No, I... I gotta... go to the office in the morning, so I should...<eos> Danny...<eos> I want you to stay.
I do.<eos> But I also care about this company.<eos> And right now, I seem to be the only one here who is taking this seriously.<eos> I mean, I have no idea where Ward is.<eos> And you don't even show up for the CIR meeting.
And when you do show up to work, your face is beat to shit.<eos> You're the one that wanted into this company, right?<eos> You fought like hell to get it.<eos> Well, now is the time for the hard work to actually start.<eos> I need you to just do what I say at this meeting today, so we can get this situation fixed.
You shouldn't be here.<eos> Why, Mr. Rand, I have a mind to report you to HR.<eos> You think this is a game?<eos> You're using my company, my building, to sell poison!<eos> Is that really so different than what you're doing on the top floor?
It's like a second language to him. It's... it's...<eos> It's inspiring.<eos> It sounds like you truly care for him.<eos> Are you trying to make me jealous?<eos> You will always come first for me.
Danny might actually be onto...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The board just held an emergency meeting.<eos> About what?<eos> About how you, your brother, and Danny will no longer be on the board... or any part of this company ever again.
Well, technically, it was the employee pension fund's money.<eos> I was gonna be free.<eos> Yeah, we're all gonna be free, Ward.<eos> We are so close to being done with the Hand.<eos> Now, if you had run away, run away like a scared child, you would have regretted it every day for the rest of your life.
You should be grateful.<eos> Yeah. You wouldn't have a life without me. I've given you everything.<eos> I've shown you how to run the company, how to be respected, how to be feared.<eos> All you had to do was listen.<eos> You're my creation. You belong to me.
Grab her?<eos> And then what?<eos> Do we take her to the Chinese authorities? Uh...<eos> Interpol?<eos> I hope you're not planning on bringing her back here, are you?
Do you remember... what you said you wanted to be when you grew up?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> A horse breeder.<eos> It was all you talked about.<eos> I wonder sometimes, if Dad hadn't tied our inheritance to our jobs at Rand, then... maybe you'd be running a horse farm right now.
Joy, this isn't a fight we can win.<eos> Well, that may not be true.<eos> If... if I can put together a solid strategy, will you at least consider it?<eos> Okay.<eos> But only if you give serious thought to accepting the settlement.
"He" is?<eos> Presently unavailable.<eos> Danny, I want to ask you something.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you find out... that Gao indeed did kill your parents... um, you're not gonna do anything stupid, right?
Joy didn't consult me... and she certainly doesn't speak for me.<eos> I'm asking you, as a favor.<eos> It's too late.<eos> It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.
I'm asking you, as a favor.<eos> It's too late.<eos> It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No. I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.
Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda... I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.
I hired a private investigator a while ago to start digging.<eos> She was worth every penny... when she was sober.<eos> I didn't mention it the other day because I wasn't sure I was ready to do something like this.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I can't believe you'd even consider doing something like this.
I don't know.<eos> When was the last time we talked about anything other than work?<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Can you name the last person I dated?<eos> I just have no idea who you've been seeing, or what you've been reading, or... anything about your life outside of Rand.
I was protecting you.<eos> From what?<eos> Ward, I love you.<eos> Please.<eos> There is nothing that you could say that would ever change that.
I've almost been killed three times this week.<eos> So no, Colleen, I'd say I'm pretty friggin' far from okay.<eos> I mean, are you hurt?<eos> No.<eos> But you are.
At least that's what he said.<eos> Hey... buddy.<eos> Asshole.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I need to get into this building, and you're in my way.
Bad things happen if I don't.<eos> But if we're gonna fight, let's get on with it.<eos> Care for a taste?<eos> I thought the Iron Fist was a great warrior.<eos> You fight like a child throwing a tantrum.
Is he okay?<eos> Does he look okay?<eos> - What is this place? - You'll see.<eos> Why are you being so mysterious?<eos> I want you to know everything I've been keeping from you.
Yeah.<eos> Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me... - we'll dose Gao.<eos> She'll tell you everything that you want to know, and no one gets hurt.
I'd really been quite worried.<eos> Especially after Ward and Joy lost the company.<eos> You never went this long without contacting me before.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - You talk a lot.
I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> You're my son, and I love you.
I understand.<eos> So you'll let me go?<eos> I want my family back, healthy and whole.<eos> I'll do anything, anything to make that happen.<eos> I was only trying to toughen you up so you could... face this world and win.
So you'll let me go?<eos> I want my family back, healthy and whole.<eos> I'll do anything, anything to make that happen.<eos> I was only trying to toughen you up so you could... face this world and win.<eos> I hope someday you can understand that.
I'm a new man in every way.<eos> Is there any vanilla?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I don't like all these fancy flavors. Vanilla's fine for me.<eos> I go to all the trouble of, uh, getting you all this ice cream, and all you can do is complain.
I missed you so much.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.
She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> This is beyond me, Danny.<eos> If she dies, you die.
But it's the safest place I know.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm tired.<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> You okay?
You know, sometimes in life, um, things happen that we're not prepared for.<eos> You know, we just do the best we can.<eos> Do you remember those nights?<eos> When I was sick?<eos> And you and Ward were there every two hours.
- I... I want you to step away from that.<eos> - Why?<eos> You just...<eos> leave that for, you know, that... that Hogarth and the courts to work out.<eos> I don't want you risking anything.
Our sensei.<eos> Everyone here.<eos> - Huh. - This is my family, Danny.<eos> Maybe the only one I've ever known.<eos> I'm glad you're here.
Exactly my point.<eos> Since you've been back, what have you discovered?<eos> A well-functioning organization focused on the common good, or... something else?<eos> Rand isn't what you hoped it would be.<eos> But you are just the person who can turn it around.
But you are just the person who can turn it around.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> What I'm about to show you is something that's been kept secret for decades.<eos> Hidden by the Chinese government... because they didn't know how to explain it.<eos> But I think you'll understand it immediately.
Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.<eos> What it was capable of.<eos> What it could achieve.<eos> That's how you know about the healing.<eos> All the qigong masters talk about it, but as a theory, because they haven't met you... don't possess what you have.
I don't need a guard, Danny.<eos> I need a partner.<eos> With you at my side, no one would stand against us.<eos> The Gaos of the world would be destroyed.<eos> So what do you know about Gao?
- And Joy?<eos> She knows?<eos> Yes. Yes, it's all right.<eos> I told her everything.<eos> Hey, we're, uh, working on a plan to get Rand back, and, uh, you're a big part of that.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated... I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
Clear the east perimeter.<eos> You know the deal.<eos> Tray by the door when you're done.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm guessing you can see me.
You're still a child.<eos> Yeah, well, at least I'm not in prison.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I offer you freedom, was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.<eos> And you rejected that offer, pursued and kidnapped me.
Always spinning a new web.<eos> I was just looking for some answers.<eos> You won't find them here.<eos> Trust me, I've tried.<eos> But I'm glad you came... because now you know she won't work with us... but she won't work against us, either.
She doesn't represent us.<eos> She... she is part of a rogue faction of the Hand that deals drugs and destroys lives,<eos> - but that is not who we are.<eos> - That's your story?<eos> That she's the bad Hand and you're the good Hand?
- I already met you!<eos> I already felt the way I feel.<eos> And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?
Go on.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look, Singleton, we have to be extra cautious at this time.<eos> This is disappointing.<eos> I was hoping you wouldn't take the bait and dig further.
Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Move!<eos> Okay, we make it to the gate, you summon the Fist, - knock it down.
For a long time, I felt your presence.<eos> It gave me this sense of comfort.<eos> I thought it was just... my imagination, uh, the wishful thinking of... of a daughter who missed her dad.<eos> Now I know it was something else.<eos> You were there... watching... manipulating, conspiring.
Now I know it was something else.<eos> You were there... watching... manipulating, conspiring.<eos> No, Joy, it's not like that.<eos> But it is.<eos> And you know it.
- We need to get you stitched up.<eos> - Airport?<eos> We're going home, Danny.<eos> No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.
- The Hand.<eos> They poisoned the pilots.<eos> They... they crashed my plane.<eos> They're the reason for all of this.<eos> But you wanted to be the Iron Fist, Danny.
You knew what your duties would be and you don't get to decide what that means.<eos> - The hell it doesn't.<eos> - You don't belong here!<eos> If I'm supposed to be the destroyer of the Hand, then I should be here, destroying them where they are.<eos> You're a warrior, like me.
You're a warrior, like me.<eos> Trained to be the Iron Fist.<eos> But I'm not the Iron Fist.<eos> I wasn't chosen. You were.<eos> And you took it and ran.
Kevin Michener was orphaned during the incident.<eos> Becca Yoo's family kicked her out of the house when she was 15.<eos> They had nowhere to go. No one to care for them.<eos> This corrupt society was willing to let them rot on the streets.<eos> They were lost, just like you once were.
Becca Yoo's family kicked her out of the house when she was 15.<eos> They had nowhere to go. No one to care for them.<eos> This corrupt society was willing to let them rot on the streets.<eos> They were lost, just like you once were.<eos> But you found them.
Do you understand?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Danny.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Who are you?
I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Davos.<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Are you the healer?
Just a few more.<eos> - I'll just do them one at a time, okay?<eos> - Oh, it really hurts.<eos> Why don't you do something to take your mind off of it?<eos> Like, explain to me where the hell you and Colleen went after I saw you get taken away at the dojo by some mystery man.
I don't... I don't know who Pete is.<eos> But think infinite.<eos> So do you have to kill it?<eos> Shou-Lao is undying.<eos> Do you have it?
Calmed the storm inside me.<eos> - I've seen Danny do that.<eos> - It's how we were trained.<eos> You don't let emotions cloud your actions.<eos> So you just... lock it all away. Pretend your emotions aren't there.
This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> I told him that I thought you were a good person, no matter what.
No.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Claire stitched me up.<eos> You don't look fine.
She's just running a little low on antibiotics.<eos> You need to go to the hospital, Danny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's because your sensei stabbed me.<eos> - He says you attacked him first.
I finally know what my purpose is.<eos> - To destroy...<eos> - Destroy the Hand.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> But you can do a lot more than destroy, Danny.
- To destroy...<eos> - Destroy the Hand.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> But you can do a lot more than destroy, Danny.<eos> Look, I don't know why you left K'un-Lun... but whatever it is that you're looking for, you're not going to find it back there.
Sensei.<eos> Please.<eos> Guess we better not keep him waiting.<eos> No one inside you don't know, understood?<eos> - You vouch for him?
Are we still in the compound?<eos> Is this detention?<eos> Why won't you answer me?<eos> Because I've ordered them not to.<eos> And you taught your students how to respect the chain of command.
Is this detention?<eos> Why won't you answer me?<eos> Because I've ordered them not to.<eos> And you taught your students how to respect the chain of command.<eos> - Something you seem to have forgotten.
I thought the Iron Fist was my birthright.<eos> You wanted to be chosen?<eos> It's all I ever wanted.<eos> To be the protector. To guard the pass.<eos> And you took it from me.
- So you wanna run Rand like Gao.<eos> - No.<eos> No, not like Gao.<eos> She's all stick and no carrot.<eos> I want you in charge, because Harold has become...
Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> I do have an immediate favor to ask of you.<eos> - And that is?<eos> - Help me capture the Iron Fist, and you and your sister will be safe.
Looks like I interrupted a lovely family moment.<eos> Your backstabbing brother has turned us over to the Hand.<eos> I promise you this is for the best.<eos> Harold is a monster.<eos> No, you're the monster.
I was very stupid out there.<eos> Everything Bakuto said to me was a lie.<eos> And I believed him.<eos> Hey.<eos> That's because he is a piece of garbage, and you're human.
No!<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> No.<eos> Joy.<eos> I need you to know how serious I am.
We have some of the best doctors in the world.<eos> You'd be amazed at what they can stitch back together.<eos> Colleen, do you really think you're worthy to challenge me?<eos> These two are warriors.<eos> You are nothing but a betrayer.
You couldn't... because you haven't got it in you, Danny.<eos> You're not a warrior.<eos> - You are a failure.<eos> - It's not that simple!<eos> You of all people don't get a say in this!
Ward.<eos> The time is now.<eos> Combination the same?<eos> I didn't even know that was there.<eos> the world thinks you're dead.
I purged all that information from my computers.<eos> - There are no other copies? - There are not.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I have never lied to him.<eos> Can you say the same?
I have never lied to him.<eos> Can you say the same?<eos> Tell me what I need to know.<eos> It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.<eos> You don't understand your own path.
You don't understand your own path.<eos> yet you refuse to face it.<eos> - And what should I be guilty of?<eos> - The death of your parents.<eos> That makes no sense. you survived with barely a scratch.
He set up our heroin operation in China.<eos> Harold feared that he would ruin everything.<eos> I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.
- What?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
This... this... this howling wind.<eos> And I could hear her... yelling out for me.<eos> But there was no way out.<eos> you're not the first friend of mine with special powers.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence. the darker you become.
And I will.<eos> just listen.<eos> okay? but Bakuto?<eos> I really wanted to kill Bakuto. otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.
Ward.<eos> I feel like I can't even... I can't even trust a word you say.<eos> you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.
You need to get yourself some help.<eos> And whatever your problem is with Dad... it's your problem.<eos> - I'd like you to leave now.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until you understand why I did what I did last night.
I'll deal with it.<eos> the better.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> I'm helping me.<eos> I want Dad put away just as much as you do.
you're my daughter.<eos> That place opened up last year.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> I think you need a little rest.
no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> and I'll hit you again.<eos> I hope like hell you know what you're doing.
He was my friend.<eos> Just one of those things.<eos> and I think that's my greatest regret.<eos> That I didn't kill Wendell then... before you were even born.<eos> you destroyed my family!
That I didn't kill Wendell then... before you were even born.<eos> you destroyed my family!<eos> Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You destroyed everything!
You destroyed everything!<eos> My family!<eos> Your family!<eos> All I wanted was to have my family beside me.<eos> But you turned them against me.
Your family!<eos> All I wanted was to have my family beside me.<eos> But you turned them against me.<eos> vengeance is the only thing I'm interested in.<eos> I won't stop... until you've paid the price.
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> yeah?<eos> Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.
Get Jill away from that troubled young man.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Josephine: Stop shaking.<eos> You need to take your pills.<eos> I need you to be strong for all three of us.
Shh.<eos> Best behavior.<eos> We need this place.<eos> I like it.<eos> What do you think?
- Nothing.<eos> Would you like to look at the room again before deciding?<eos> Thanks. That would be great.<eos> It's Jill, isn't it?<eos> I hope you say yes.
It is impossible not to find your lost little-boy routine adorable.<eos> Did you hear a baby cry?<eos> No.<eos> Stop looking for excuses.<eos> I need you to be more responsible with what's going on, mark.
You've got to face the fact that we don't have any money.<eos> I'm not asking you to get a job.<eos> I'm not asking you to stop your comedy.<eos> I'm the one making sacrifices for us.<eos> Now you do this for me.
Not yet.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> What about children?<eos> We never wanted kids.<eos> You say that but if you were pregnant, you might feel different.
Keep that for two days.<eos> Don't spend it on sweets or comics.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Perhaps I should do the stand-up, my material is funnier.<eos> What the fuck you know about comedy?
Now!<eos> Henry's voice:<eos> Not later. Now!<eos> You clean them immediately!<eos> You got a problem, then you can clean it, Henry.
Hush.<eos> They might hear you.<eos> We won't find better accommodation for this price.<eos> So bite your tongue, smile and play nice.<eos> You know why?
If it's not the baby crying then it's her playing her weird-ass war music.<eos> Or him shouting randomly.<eos> Maybe you need to get out of the house for a while during the day.<eos> You are too isolated here.<eos> You're not here.
For Jill.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I had a few drinks after work.<eos> Ah.<eos> Well, while you've been out getting wasted
Yeah, very welcoming.<eos> You said something about a job.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Life insurance.<eos> You work in a call center.
You're a "stand-up", aren't you?<eos> Right.<eos> "Danger wank."<eos> Danger wank.<eos> Imagine you're in your room, having a wank and your mum has just called you for dinner but you're right in the middle of the act.
You'd have to start at the bottom, but it is something. Hm?<eos> Jill: I kicked Jason out.<eos> "Danger wank."<eos> I found it funny.<eos> What the fuck do you know?
What?<eos> It's my fault?<eos> And you... You wear the trousers in this relationship and I'm meant to be the fucking man.<eos> Then act like one.<eos> You give me pocket money to buy things, you tell me what I can and cannot do.
I tell you what, tell you what, tell you what... You're no different from that nutty, old man.<eos> No wonder I wanna fucking kill him.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then add me to this kill list you're planning.<eos> You side with him and that old bitch when you know they're trying to drive me mad.
No wonder I wanna fucking kill him.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then add me to this kill list you're planning.<eos> You side with him and that old bitch when you know they're trying to drive me mad.<eos> And you are in with them.
Then add me to this kill list you're planning.<eos> You side with him and that old bitch when you know they're trying to drive me mad.<eos> And you are in with them.<eos> Will you listen to yourself?<eos> You're a paranoid mess, Marcus.
Will you listen to yourself?<eos> You're a paranoid mess, Marcus.<eos> Don't talk about them this way.<eos> You only date me to piss your brother off, when you treat me like I'm your fucking bitch!<eos> You are my fucking bitch.
If I don't hear from mark by tonight I'm calling the police.<eos> Don't be so dramatic, Jill.<eos> It's good he's gone.<eos> He was a loser.<eos> You don't know him like I do.
It's good he's gone.<eos> He was a loser.<eos> You don't know him like I do.<eos> He dragged you down.<eos> You and the old man taking the piss out of mark.
Oh...<eos> It's your menstrual cycle.<eos> Dated, for when you're ripe for seed.<eos> Josephine assures me that her shade matches your skin tone.<eos> You don't know what pain is.
You you got an accent. Not American.<eos> You have seen through my camouflage.<eos> Fuck you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about hiding behind words.<eos> Like you are hiding behind that wall.
So, what do you say?<eos> - Yeah, I'll talk to you.<eos> - Good.<eos> Where are you from? No.<eos> Listen, I don't know shit about you, so why don't you go first?
I thought we were being honest.<eos> I know you're using a Mark 11.<eos> No, you believe that's what I'm using.<eos> But you don't know anything for certain.<eos> You don't know shit.
"You don't know shit"?<eos> Say that again.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't know... shit.
That I am your enemy.<eos> But we are not so different, you and I.<eos> Yeah, except I ain't a fucking terrorist.<eos> And you think I am?<eos> You are the one who has come to another man's country.
And you think I am?<eos> You are the one who has come to another man's country.<eos> Camouflaged yourself in his land in his soil.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> From where I'm sitting you look very much like the terrorist.
Why ain't you talking, man?<eos> Come on, you there?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Are you there, man?<eos> It's just, you know... you know a lot about books and shit.
I want to go home!<eos> I want to go fucking home, motherfucker.<eos> So go.<eos> Walk away.<eos> - You'll just fucking shoot me.
Yes, you fucking will.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> Because that's not really what you want.<eos> What?<eos> You don't want to go home, do you?
What?<eos> You don't want to go home, do you?<eos> The fuck's that mean, man?<eos> The war's over.<eos> You're still here.
[HANGE] Is, is this just a coincidence, or...?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> [HANGE] Pastor Nick?<eos> [NICK] Listen to me.<eos> Whatever else you do, don't let sunlight touch it!
[NICK cries out] Commander!<eos> Hold!<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Do you have any concept of how many Scouts have laid down their lives fighting these monsters?<eos> More than you can count!
Of course. Did Mikasa come to your rescue again?<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> [CARLA] Eren, we don't throw punches at everyone who's mean to us.<eos> Being an adult means learning how to pick your battles.<eos> You want them to think that you're strong?
- No.<eos> You need to run.<eos> My name is Danny.<eos> I'm hunting members of the Hand.<eos> I think you're the man we're looking for.
It could help keep your bills paid until you start working again.<eos> - My bills aren't a problem.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Have you at least started answering the phone?<eos> Only you could turn that big personal victory into a defeat.
But maybe you won't.<eos> But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.<eos> You have... You gotta take it back.
Yeah, Ellison's pretty much given me free reign.<eos> It feels like what I'm meant to be doing or...<eos> I don't know if that makes any sense.<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> It looks like you're doing what you always wanted to.
- Sorry, it got...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you wish you'd kept your secret to yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I needed you to know.
I just...<eos> You know, I felt like we should figure ourselves out first or something.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> You know, as complicated as I feel about all this stuff, I just...<eos> I feel like you should know.
Hit me.<eos> Hey.<eos> - No.<eos> - What?<eos> We are not doing that thing where you come in here like you live here.
What you're doing, we call that moving on.<eos> Purgatory is a place for the dead, Matthew, not the living.<eos> There's nothing wrong with letting people go.<eos> She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.
- Nothing.<eos> - Son, it's never too late...<eos> Yo, man, I ain't your son!<eos> I told you, I don't know a damn thing.<eos> Whatever you're doing, you're gonna get yourself hurt.
Run!<eos> Come on, you pieces of shit!<eos> You want some, too?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Who are you?
Trish Talk, stay tuned.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The interview with the school superintendent, boss says it's going on now.<eos> - Did you cut off my call?
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Everything okay out there?<eos> They're saying the epicenter was in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I'm glad you're meditating. You need a break.
He sent us back to New York.<eos> Maybe there are people here.<eos> It's a shot in the dark, but I think it's one worth taking.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I guess you have a plan?
But this...<eos> This one kid, he's too afraid to ask for help.<eos> I gotta step in before anyone else gets hurt.<eos> - It's... it's what Pop would've wanted.<eos> - I know. It's like you said, if we don't take responsibility for our neighborhood, no one else will.
Nobody's saying it's stupid. I know you're trying.<eos> Earth shook, Foggy.<eos> The cops weren't coming.<eos> Matt, stop!<eos> Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.
I couldn't help but take it personally.<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> I'm here to ask you to be careful.<eos> - Be careful why?<eos> - FBI, Homeland Security. Whatever it is you stumbled onto last night, it's big.
There is nothing in this guy's profile that suggests he's a terrorist.<eos> They just found enough C-4 in that motel room to level a city block.<eos> What do you think it looks like?<eos> The government is not going to rest until they've got him.<eos> I just... I don't wanna see you caught in the cross fire.
- Am I a suspect?<eos> - Criminal mischief... tampering with evidence, petty larceny...<eos> - Am I a murder suspect?<eos> - No.<eos> But I think you know who killed him.
Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.<eos> You are walking into some weird-ass shit.<eos> Jessica Jones, stop talking.<eos> Hi, this is over.<eos> Who the hell are you?
My child... you... are everything.<eos> You are everything.<eos> It doesn't matter what you choose.<eos> You are the Black Sky.<eos> In the end, you are the weapon.
Claire told me about you on the way over here.<eos> Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.<eos> The money?<eos> That doesn't define me.<eos> Maybe not, but that kid is sitting in a jail cell tonight and you're not.
Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.<eos> The money?<eos> That doesn't define me.<eos> Maybe not, but that kid is sitting in a jail cell tonight and you're not.<eos> - Neither are you.
- Neither are you.<eos> - Not this time.<eos> But I've seen my share of injustice.<eos> The guy in the white hat, he's just the beginning.<eos> You're not thinking about the bigger picture.
- Not this time.<eos> But I've seen my share of injustice.<eos> The guy in the white hat, he's just the beginning.<eos> You're not thinking about the bigger picture.<eos> You're not thinking about anything but yourself. Hey!
But I've seen my share of injustice.<eos> The guy in the white hat, he's just the beginning.<eos> You're not thinking about the bigger picture.<eos> You're not thinking about anything but yourself. Hey!<eos> You know nothing about me.
And I know privilege when I see it.<eos> You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.<eos> Before the dragons.<eos> Before the chi.<eos> You have the ability to change the world without getting anybody hurt.
Has anyone approached you about making a deal?<eos> I know a lawyer.<eos> There ain't no deal.<eos> There were dead bodies in there.<eos> Looks like you were doing grunt work.
He doesn't understand what we're really up against.<eos> He doesn't get how dangerous they are.<eos> I know, but... why am I fighting street-level operatives when I have the power to go right to the top?<eos> Because, Danny, you...<eos> You're not a businessman.
Because, Danny, you...<eos> You're not a businessman.<eos> I know.<eos> But my father was.<eos> I know, but you are a fighter.
