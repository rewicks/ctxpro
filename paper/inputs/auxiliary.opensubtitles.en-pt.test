Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I don't know who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yes I do.
We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.<eos> And I did.
Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
What did I say?<eos> She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
Yeah, everyone is ridiculous, Jerry!<eos> Okay?<eos> You deal with it 'cause you have to!<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, you do!
I...<eos> Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.<eos> Now I did.
And now we got a dead body in our bay.<eos> And the girls on that boat had the same drugs on them that I found in front of Leeds's club.<eos> So my gut says that it's all connected.<eos> Wait, Leeds did say there'd be an open house tonight, right?<eos> Yes, she did.
- Now that...<eos> - Mitch is gone.<eos> He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.<eos> And we know you feel the same.<eos> I do.
- Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?<eos> I thought that was supposed to kill you.<eos> It does.
It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> No.<eos> - No, signore, I do not. - Nor do I.
How will kids even know it's me talking?<eos> When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song.<eos> She smells like manure and she lived in the sewer<eos> Samantha Kingston<eos> Who did that?
Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I do?
We like our stories to end with the promise of hope.<eos> Happily ever after and all that.<eos> Is that as clear as it gets?<eos> Too bad real lives don't have that structure.<eos> Or, hell, maybe they do.
Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity.<eos> Lucy got a year's worth of wages.<eos> And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.

You could be a great writer.<eos> But your stories are not good enough, and it's because of your drinking.<eos> You know, I think you just need a good idea to jumpstart your career.<eos> You know, I was thinking this morning, I got an idea.<eos> - Of course you do.
I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.<eos> It's your fault the sheriff's dead.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!
Mama, mama, mama... oh.<eos> Hey, em.<eos> I thought you were mom, 'cause you guys have, like, the exact same voice.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, we don't.
- How new is this one?<eos> - Not what you think.<eos> It's the magic of the House.<eos> Decided it wanted to experience humanity and gave itself a body.<eos> It sure did.
- Every day.<eos> - No shit.<eos> Yes shit.<eos> I wish my dad did this for me.<eos> So does your daughter.
FBI.<eos> Mr. valecross, how do you do?<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> I understand you have information from you regarding the assets of...<eos> - no, I don't.
You know I can't release her without cash in hand.<eos> Let's say 24 hours, and she dies.<eos> Tell Patricia I say "hello."<eos> Rayt marius says "hello."<eos> Does he?
- No, Frank!<eos> - Shut it.<eos> Come on. Stick one on then, you Cunt.<eos> Take a fucking swipe at me. Do it.<eos> Do it!
I want so much more Than they've got planned<eos> The woods are lovely.<eos> I only wish I recognized them.<eos> Do you know where we are, Philippe?<eos> Because I don't.
Don't take my word for it.<eos> LeFou... my dearest companion... did I... your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot... try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved?<eos> Well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts...<eos> But no.<eos> No, he did not.
- I did not kill that girl!<eos> It was an accident!<eos> And my wife and my son are out there!<eos> - Hey, Kevin, I believe you.<eos> - No, you don't.
All right. In the seventh...<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Come on!<eos> Do it!
But you can also lose much as fast.<eos> Yes?<eos> I must tell you.<eos> Believe me that, from what you told me, if you lose, you will have to leave the city.<eos> Do not... yes.
- I thought I might.<eos> - Head trauma is wasted on you, mate.<eos> Danny, can I ask you something?<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> No one on the estate does.
I don't like this.<eos> Next time, get a note from your fucking mom or something.<eos> - I can't kill no girl.<eos> - It ain't gonna come to that!<eos> - Yeah, what if it does?
Yeah.<eos> Entire departments.<eos> Well, uh, I mean...<eos> Maybe the best thing to do is talk to Neil?<eos> Oh, I did.
I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works. I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
I'm sorry, we don't know anything about this woman.<eos> We don't know what she's capable of.<eos> I'm sorry, we don't know enough about her past.<eos> - We know she's fled an abusive marriage.<eos> - Yes, yes, we do.
I am security.<eos> - On your knees!<eos> - All right!<eos> - He has a weapon.<eos> - No, no, I don't.
This wasn't how it was supposed to finish.<eos> I never agreed to any of this.<eos> Then don't do it.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Listen, Muerte... he's on a roll.<eos> Who's he working with?<eos> I thought you and Erlik had an "agreement"?<eos> We do.
- Erlik?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Dead sure.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Neither did I.
We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what.<eos> One of you does.
We're just guests here.<eos> But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight.<eos> Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?<eos> No.<eos> One of them did.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
-Mycroft, last time when we were on the phone...<eos> No, no, no, stop.<eos> I detest conversation in the past tense.<eos> You said the fact that you're his brother made no difference.<eos> It doesn't.
That's all it was.<eos> Just texting.<eos> But I wanted more.<eos> And you know something?<eos> I still do.
You know, the secret one.<eos> That was just something... I said. I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.<eos> - You must have done.<eos> - I really didn't.
I can't say that. I can't... I can't say that to you.<eos> Of course you can. Why can't you?<eos> You know why.<eos> - No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
But that's jaywalking!<eos> Here, I'll pay your ticket.<eos> Go!<eos> I think we lost him!<eos> Oh, no, we didn't!
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies, and told them what he did.<eos> It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.
Do you know where he lives?<eos> No.<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
He's all I have.<eos> Is there another way around?<eos> That's not true.<eos> You have me.<eos> No, I don't.
And if we all went around just declaring our innermost desires to the exact people we felt them for, well, then we'd all end up happy, or something.<eos> Look, Gardner...<eos> I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful and I've kind of had an amazing time with you.<eos> But the last thing I'm gonna do is actually tell you that.<eos> You just did.
Scrap Lucy's precious promotional marketing crap.<eos> - Tell everyone ASAP.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> We already have FDA approval, correct?<eos> Yes, we do.
Well, what do you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> I know your parents died in a crash.<eos> -Dude. -He didn't tell me.<eos> They did.
Get her out of here.<eos> Both of you!<eos> You need to go!<eos> Open the goddamn door, or I'm callin' the police.<eos> Good, do it!
All the numbers, memorized perfectly.<eos> But honestly, Mr. Cooper, I think it might be worth some money.<eos> Maybe... quite a lot of money.<eos> You think so, do you?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
What are you doing living with my kids?<eos> Our kids.<eos> 'Cause I'm the best dad in the world.<eos> I'm there when you need me, I'm gone when you don't.<eos> - We don't.
Our kids.<eos> 'Cause I'm the best dad in the world.<eos> I'm there when you need me, I'm gone when you don't.<eos> - We don't.<eos> They don't.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take the kids.<eos> - Sorry. It's my job.<eos> - No.<eos> You don't...
I was meditating.<eos> Is that something you do?<eos> Hmm? I was trying to focus my chi so I could get myself out of here.<eos> How'd it work?<eos> It didn't.
What are you talking about?<eos> Hey!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
But we need to be honest.<eos> I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?
I want to know why you abandoned us.<eos> Why you abandoned me.<eos> Ever since I got to K'un-Lun... I... I've always felt empty.<eos> I thought maybe the... the Iron Fist would fix me.<eos> But it didn't.
"A close hit..." Loosen up.<eos> "...is within an inch."<eos> You say one thing and do another.<eos> I'd rather you just fight and say nothing.<eos> Hey, kid, you did okay.
All right, come on. Let's get on with this shindig.<eos> Give me the keys to the cuffs first.<eos> No, make the wish first.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> No, I don't.
There were dead bodies in there.<eos> Looks like you were doing grunt work.<eos> Like you were helping to clean up.<eos> - Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Of course it does.
Scratch-off. Those are her favorite, all right?<eos> Just do it.<eos> Tell her that they're from me. Tell her that I'm thinking about her.<eos> - You can trust me.<eos> - I do.
- And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.
The less we know about each other, the better.<eos> - This is...<eos> It's too much already.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't... - Jesus.
Whatever the Hand is up to...<eos> New York is in its crosshairs.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't.
But how can I trust you?<eos> Her name is Elektra.<eos> She was raised by him.<eos> Trained to fight the Hand.<eos> Which she did, with me.
You should see my place.<eos> What, do you work from home?<eos> I used to have a partner. We had an office.<eos> And?<eos> Now we don't.
What does it say?<eos> I've seen this language before, but there's a lot I didn't learn.<eos> A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it... I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.
I'm not sorry.<eos> You never believe me so why should I expect you to change?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I believed you when you told me that someone stole your lenses.<eos> They did.
Oh, it's totally cool.<eos> - Sorry we didn't get you out of here.<eos> - Well, sure tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
But I will have my phone on me all weekend. So if you need anything, I'm available.<eos> Ana, have a seat.<eos> I'm really... I'm sorry.<eos> I think you have tremendous potential here. But I don't wanna waste my time training someone who doesn't take this position seriously.<eos> I do.
I don't know.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I would if I could.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> And neither does anybody else.
Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> You think we're gonna lose.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Frank.
Yes, we sleep.<eos> We just don't sleep with a...<eos> You don't sleep with women?<eos> No, I mean, I do, I sleep with... I sleep with...<eos> Yes, I do..
I see you are negotiating the terms of the armistice without me.<eos> - On the Kaiser's behalf.<eos> - I'm on your insistence.<eos> We could easily win this war if only you had a little faith.<eos> We don't.
She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe, Maybe we don't!
Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
- Get yourself ready.<eos> - Classic father figure.<eos> Jesus Christ, Nola.<eos> No, this has gotta stop, okay?<eos> It really does.
Buddy!<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> You been feeding my dog?<eos> Pedigree, lamb and rice blend, he loves that shit.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.
I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
I...<eos> I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Anthony... Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did?
- Thanks.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> Hey, Norma.<eos> Shelly go home already?<eos> Yeah, she did.
No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No. No, I didn't. I...
She didn't even see me.<eos> I'm not sure about this one.<eos> She's impossible to get to.<eos> I have no in.<eos> Or maybe I do.
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You don't have any respect for money man!<eos> - Money doesn't grow on trees.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Hello, football fans...<eos> We got beer, vodka, cigs.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.<eos> No, I did not.
Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.
We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.<eos> I remember.<eos> No, baby.<eos> We didn't.
That, that...<eos> That's not possible.<eos> That's...<eos> They couldn't have taken everyone.<eos> They didn't.
What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Heck, who doesn't?
What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?
What do you want from me?<eos> You're my friend.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you even know what a friend is?<eos> Of course I do.
He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong Roan was about you.<eos> He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
Creditors respond to money.<eos> And they respond to influence.<eos> Her family has both.<eos> I understand.<eos> But... so does mine.
- What? That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
I mean, the boys have some lightsabers.<eos> Listen, you see a lot of couples - that have bad problems.<eos> - Mm-hmm. And after a while, maybe that's all you can see.<eos> Do you ever pause to consider what is great in a marriage, what is profoundly right?<eos> I do.
The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!<eos> The police want to ask me questions, Holt.<eos> - They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.
I mean, what did I do?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Lie face down on the ground, arms stretched out, please.<eos> Hey, leave me alone, OK?<eos> I didn't do anything.
- No. I hate feminism, Mum.<eos> It's boring.<eos> - See what we've raised?<eos> - I like wearing make-up.<eos> - Everyone at school does.
No, I don't know Logan.<eos> I knew the guy that come at me.<eos> I think your mom got in my head, all right? I think she got in my head.<eos> Yeah, and it worked, I thought...<eos> No, it did not.
Fuck your vocabulary.<eos> Okay? This is gibberish.<eos> You may have to consider that you didn't see what you saw.<eos> - Or...<eos> - Or you did.
will release those copies in a very public manner.<eos> This was not a spur of the moment decision.<eos> Do not take me for granted.<eos> Not again.<eos> I never did!
Forgive me for wanting to keep my brains in my head.<eos> Instead of, say, some other regions, like most boys?<eos> Come on, Helmet, you've got bathrooms to clean.<eos> - You mean "we've got."<eos> - Mm. I don't, actually.
Hannah wanted it done like this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You have to listen.<eos> What if I don't?
So... that's never happened before.<eos> They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.<eos> At Bryce's?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course they did.
Just go away.<eos> What I think... is that you wouldn't do something like that.<eos> I thought you loved Jessica.<eos> I did. I mean...<eos> Maybe I even still do, but...
Human contact.<eos> And communications class, crazy as it was, was human contact for me.<eos> Until someone in that class cut my lifeline... someone who is known for being sweet.<eos> I'll tell you who it is... but you're going to have to wait.<eos> Just like I did.
No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
I might have been... I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
Justin.<eos> Justin.<eos> You know the real story, right?<eos> You know what's true.<eos> I do now.
Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.<eos> He left.<eos> He didn't leave a note.<eos> He obviously doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
However, you can have a little dinner, some drinks, share a few laughs.<eos> There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good to make you feel human again.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> D-D-Did you say "wives," meaning plural?<eos> Hell yes, I did.
Or we could just go.<eos> - You want to go? - Nah.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !
There were always babies crying.<eos> I knew they had problems, but I didn't think they were mine to solve.<eos> I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.<eos> W-Who the hell am I, right?<eos> So I did nothing.
And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> I do.
Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
Come on. Whoa!<eos> He says he wants to help us.<eos> That true?<eos> You want to help?<eos> I do.
Does that make us square?<eos> Hello, neighbor.<eos> Hello.<eos> You know, if I cooked, I would have brought you a casserole...<eos> But I don't, so I didn't.
Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fucking this up right now.<eos> I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!<eos> I wasn't gonna let her die, you fucking moron!<eos> The point is he thought I was going to.<eos> I totally did, by the way.
I strongly recommend a contingency plan to be put in place.<eos> A little girls remains have been stolen.<eos> Her name is Suluk Tavra.<eos> And I know what he is going to do to her soul.<eos> So do you...
A book.<eos> He thinks the New Testament's getting old.<eos> I've only read some of it, but you figure fairly prominently, Kevin.<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - No, I did not.
First proof of extraterrestrial life.<eos> And it's just more death.<eos> You still got a beat on that signal. That you guys intercepted leaving eros?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course we do.
We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, You need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
Absolutely.<eos> One-hundred percent?<eos> Because I don't want to mess him up.<eos> He wanted me to meet some guy before I went to Africa...<eos> Saad did.
You sure he exists?<eos> He exists.<eos> He gave your son $5,000.<eos> Sekou don't have $5,000.<eos> He does, ma'am.
Don't tell me.<eos> Yep. National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
It was all over the Internet.<eos> You've never seen it?<eos> No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.
- Well, we're gonna be asked why we're not bringing a civil suit, that's for sure, why we're not sending a clear message to law enforcement. I...<eos> I think they got the message.<eos> What about Sekou?<eos> Doesn't he deserve to be compensated?<eos> Of course he does.
- How'd he get you out, anyways?<eos> It was bullshit.<eos> They didn't have a case.<eos> You got lucky then.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- Well, don't worry.<eos> I was with Franny.<eos> We were fine.<eos> A man came to school, and he had painted hair, and he scared Mommy.<eos> No, he didn't, sweetheart.
- Who?<eos> - Someone, I don't know.<eos> Does he live across the--<eos> Does-<eos> - Does he?
When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
Carrie?<eos> Madame President-elect.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Children's Services has put Franny into foster care.<eos> I don't...
- Hi.<eos> This is Maria at Child Services.<eos> You've been approved for a visit with your daughter tomorrow at our offices.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.
I'm not ready for this, any of it?<eos> I'd say, "Good."<eos> You'd be crazy to feel ready.<eos> What if the American people made a mistake?<eos> They didn't.
That's a far cry from compiling an enemies list, Rachel.<eos> Is it?<eos> Step into the President's shoes for a minute.<eos> Doesn't she have a right to know how deep and wide this conspiracy went?<eos> Don't the American people?
- The NSA's made its meta-databases available to us.<eos> The NSA?<eos> He had multiple contacts with each of the core conspirators<eos> - in the weeks leading...<eos> - Yeah. Of course he did... In the context of his job.
It's settled policy.<eos> Any attempt to undermine it's--<eos> Treason.<eos> You have proof of all this, I'm assuming.<eos> I do.
- What?<eos> What did you come here for?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Dar Adal called you.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Do you get that?<eos> You can't afford to stay silent-- and I don't mean press conferences.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said, "Show your face."<eos> He did.
I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down. Because in my government, you will have no place."<eos> For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.
And it is my understanding that you are the only man alive who knows it.<eos> My song is bring the rain, not stopping.<eos> Well, that's all subject to interpretation.<eos> You want to stop the flood?<eos> I do.
Matches your description.<eos> I've notified the police.<eos> They'll be taking Burton into custody when we dock.<eos> They'd like you to go down to the station and make a statement, assuming you don't have any pressing business in Melbourne.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's true...<eos> I borrowed your pills.<eos> Looks real.<eos> Indeed, it does.
Why?<eos> Because I'm the one that has to have sex with that abomination.<eos> I'm gonna dress it up how I want.<eos> You want me to grow a beard.<eos> Do I?
- I know.<eos> - I was there, but it's not fucking mine.<eos> - Boys, boys.<eos> I think we can all agree you both wrote the same book.<eos> No, we didn't!
They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?<eos> Did I wanna call you?<eos> Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?<eos> Of course I did.
Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay? He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
Is it true?<eos> One of our major pipelines had been blown up a year before.<eos> We were facing a catastrophic production shortfall, and my regional director cut a deal.<eos> So you bought oil from terrorists, then.<eos> No, I didn't.
Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't. Okay?
I never wanna use a toothbrush again.<eos> Why aren't you cleaning?<eos> My list was very specific.<eos> We finished it.<eos> No, you didn't.
You mean our bed?<eos> You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money.<eos> Of course you do.
Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are. He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski," he can hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> He says he deserves it.<eos> Damn right he does.
It was my duty to raise him in her place.<eos> But I failed.<eos> What happened was not your fault.<eos> A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother.<eos> I certainly didn't.
I came alone.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.<eos> Riley?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - He said I had to go down the stairs.<eos> - Who did?
This is what they mean I think by... the "civilizing nature of women."<eos> - I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.
In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.<eos> Of course I did.
The number doesn't exist.<eos> I'd never sell him out.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Do I get the whole chocolate factory now?<eos> Yes, you do.
You know what you have to do?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> This guy doesn't really come out here a few times a week.<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
Excuse me.<eos> Death by passion is the ultimate rush.<eos> Desert, anyone?<eos> Ah! Wait a second, you didn't tell me Monica told you exactly what happened to Margaret black.<eos> She didn't.
You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.<eos> Your current employment in no way suits your talents.<eos> You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.<eos> I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.
No, no, no.<eos> Please, I don't know anything.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> They don't seem to care about our lives, so why we gotta give a shit if they live or die?<eos> I do. I do.
A trickster of some sorts, yes?<eos> Oh, that will be a challenge.<eos> Well, you don't really have much choice, do you?<eos> Oh, well aware you have that stylish little blade.<eos> I sure do.
You've made this move already.<eos> - I have a plan B for you.<eos> Your brother asked me the same that day.<eos> I didn't have any, then.<eos> But I do, today.
♪ There once was a mermaid, ♪ ♪ who lived by the pond, ♪<eos> ♪ who was very beautiful, ♪ ♪ and very blond. ♪<eos> Teena McGuire.<eos> Hey, it is Marvin Fick, remember me?<eos> Of course you do.
Um... nothing.<eos> Okay. Good.<eos> Well, some friends and I got this Airbnb house in Puglia...<eos> - And you want me to come clean it.<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?<eos> No one did.
What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
What about it?<eos> Then you've heard of it?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> He did, didn't he?
I hate those pictures.<eos> Oh, hey! The quinceañera.<eos> You're doing it!<eos> Elena, I knew you'd come around.<eos> She didn't!
It's gonna be me and three couples.<eos> I don't like being the seventh wheel.<eos> - Do you want to come with me?<eos> - Oh, I'd love to, but I'm gonna go see a girl from work's band play.<eos> They do ska.
No, I can't.<eos> I need your help, my darlings!<eos> I need to feel your holy, holy love.<eos> Who wants virgins?<eos> I do, I do!
I mean, I'm... I'm different.<eos> Look, you know what?<eos> You're healing, all right?<eos> You're gonna get better.<eos> What if I don't?
No.<eos> That's... that's Parker's.<eos> He gave it to me 11 years ago.<eos> He told me he liked me.<eos> Of course he did, huh?
That stopped when the bombs went off.<eos> When the lab reopens, I'm going to hang it in my new office, to remind me. Always.<eos> Hmm. 4:47.<eos> Why would you want to be reminded of the moment when everything almost ended, Bones?<eos> Because it didn't.
But a boy can't have everything.<eos> We're going to set up a camp bed for him, so he won't be far away.<eos> We can talk about everything else in the morning.<eos> I used to go down the old rectory gardens when I was a kid.<eos> Do my dreaming.
It's just rules that govern the universe.<eos> Next thing you know you're gonna be telling her that rainbows are...<eos> Light refracted through water?<eos> - She already knows that.<eos> - Of course she does.
So, someone else was there.<eos> Two days ago, Adam Hitchcock made an offer on your land for $3 million more than what it's worth.<eos> It was a payoff, wasn't it?<eos> You didn't kill Sarah Abbott.<eos> Adam Hitchcock did, right?
Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.<eos> His office is a big Oval.<eos> You want the hospital secured, ma'am?<eos> Yes, Agent Spaulding, I do.
Teddy, honey, want to go draw mommy a picture?<eos> Oh, what a good one!<eos> He's dead, isn't he?<eos> And I think Cyrus may have had something to do with it.<eos> Of course he did.
Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but... No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?<eos> Yes, yes, I do. Yes, I do.
What's the matter?<eos> What was he like...<eos> Buckley?<eos> Was an asshole who believed in aliens.<eos> You don't?
- You don't know that.<eos> - It's not your fault, Joe.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Buck wore this trident on his uniform.<eos> All seals do.
Joseph.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> No, I do.
They'll just make it worse.<eos> Bonbon said the police will be stopping by.<eos> Yeah, they were here.<eos> They wanted me to tell them it was Annalise.<eos> Did you?
So....<eos> Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You want to get back to the States, it's 50K.<eos> 50K?<eos> We're just trying to get home.<eos> You know we don't have that kind of cash.<eos> You do now.
I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.<eos> - Marseilles? - Yeah.<eos> I've been working on a couple deals. I got $100K in my hand.<eos> But I want off the hook.<eos> Sure you do.
The isolation.<eos> Keeping everyone at arm's length.<eos> I don't.<eos> I love Miles.<eos> Of course you did.
Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense... he'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
You're here with family.<eos> Seriously, would you put your damn phone down.<eos> Do you have it or not?<eos> Mikey.<eos> Do you or not?
He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
Okay.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll get there.<eos> But you can't. The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
Instead of trying to go out with other girls just to prove something to yourself, why not just tell Clary how you feel?<eos> Luke said to do the same thing.<eos> We're highly evolved beings.<eos> What if I tell Clary and... It ruins our friendship?<eos> What if you don't?
If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't.
And don't let anyone in unless her name is Clary.<eos> The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the institute. You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
Look, I don't care if it's just you and me, we'll figure out a way.<eos> But I won't let it come to that.<eos> I've been out recruiting other members from other packs.<eos> Trust me. Plenty of wolves want to eat at the Jade Wolf.<eos> No, they don't.
I doubt you'd find the results you're hoping for.<eos> These tests are meant to find neurological changes, while my theory is that your visions are the result of emotion.<eos> You saying I'm crazy?<eos> I'm saying you're feeling something, and in the wake of your partner's demise, that's perfectly normal.<eos> I don't do feelings.
She told me that Prometheus forced her to do this.<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable Intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
And Goldilocks huffed and puffed and blew the door down.<eos> That's not exactly how her power works.<eos> Was there something wrong with Cisco's specs?<eos> Because didn't we just replicate the pipeline security system?<eos> We did.
Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name--Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Please.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> It is just very interesting how we choose our words, and how we express those words in order to...<eos> I'm so looking forward to meeting your plus one, if she exists.<eos> Well, she does.
What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.
I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific are staking out the Bertinellis, and Dinah and Spartan have eyes on the Bratva.<eos> You know, you got to get that new girl a code name.<eos> Well, when she's ready, I was considering Black Canary.<eos> You all right with that?<eos> Well, so long as she does Laurel proud.
And she made me promise-- she made me swear that I would bring him to justice.<eos> But even what you say is true, what could I do?<eos> Taiana told me that the same hammer that shatters glass forges steel.<eos> I say to her as a child to make her grow up strong.<eos> Well, she did.
This is all that we found on your target from all available video sources... Cell phones, traffic cams, security footage.<eos> Please promise me you're never gonna make a Felicity version of this.<eos> The world doesn't need to know how often I'm at the wine shop.<eos> I guess it's too much to hope that Chase took off his mask on camera.<eos> Actually, he did.
The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
You're the one who seems to have a problem with the way that I've been running Argus, which is particularly interesting to me since neither one of us has a job that fits the conventional definition of morality.<eos> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're upset because Argus is locking people up without due process when you and Oliver and your team of masked recruits has been playing judge and jury for years now.<eos> Lyla, I can't believe you'd actually compare team Arrow to this--this-- this clandestine government superagency!<eos> Well, I just did!
- Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you. She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
Are you?<eos> And you, vampire.<eos> Are you still learning to walk in the sun?<eos> Wow, word travels fast down here.<eos> It does.
There's a reason why my people have survived longer than any other creature on this Earth.<eos> We know when to choose the winning side.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> You've got the wrong guy.<eos> No I don't.
Either you trust me to be a leader or you don't.<eos> The Clave lied about the Soul Sword.<eos> They never recovered it from Valentine's attack on the Institute.<eos> They don't have it.<eos> They never did.
The Clave lied about the Soul Sword.<eos> They never recovered it from Valentine's attack on the Institute.<eos> They don't have it.<eos> They never did.<eos> Then who does?
We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
Yeah, I'll stay with Max.<eos> If he regains consciousness, perhaps he can ID his attacker.<eos> Cream or sugar?<eos> Did I fall asleep?<eos> We both did.
And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?<eos> Maybe she thought it was.<eos> We all did.
- OK.<eos> ♪ You stole me ♪ - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You guys look good together.<eos> Yeah, we do, don't we?
We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
We'd broken up a bunch, and we got back together and he was still seeing her and... and I went through... every photograph, every e-mail, and I made him get rid of all of them.<eos> I tortured him.<eos> I just was so... hurt that... I wanted to punish him for making me feel that way.<eos> You must have cared a lot.<eos> Yeah. I did.
No. No. No.<eos> - Why the fascination?<eos> - No, I was curious...<eos> Oh, yeah, I like it when you're jealous, though.<eos> No, you don't.
- I believe it.<eos> - Until...<eos> I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.<eos> Now I have fear.<eos> I do, too.
She seemed pretty sure. She used to say, "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow. Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Do not say a word.<eos> Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.
Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Sure I do.
The police are dead?<eos> All of them? All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car? Yes.<eos> I do.
He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'.<eos> Nonsense. Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
But when he did, she did, and from that day on, she called him John.<eos> They called their son the same.<eos> When the children went off to school to learn their letters,<eos> Essie made sure they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket, a little bread in the other, to make sure they came safely home once more.<eos> They always did.
So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,<eos> Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all. But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers... - Yeah, she did.
I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!<eos> You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!<eos> We don't!
What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally. He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
- All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.
We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.<eos> - We sure do.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
Look, this whole witness over-protection thing is totally unnecessary.<eos> It was just a random attack. Oh!<eos> The bus is coming. I gotta go.<eos> We need to keep an eye on her.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Okay.<eos> You had a clear shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it. - Why?<eos> - Julian, I'm trying to focus on what we're here to focus on.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> Gents, how we doing?
Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.<eos> All you need is to just believe in yourself.<eos> And for what it's worth...<eos> I already do.
- I belong completely.<eos> - What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did? - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
- Tracy's bazooka?<eos> - Yeah, you helped.<eos> - I didn't... I didn't...<eos> - I didn't help.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
We are suing Empire Enterprises for $50 million.<eos> We are also demanding that Hakeem Lyon cancel all upcoming club appearances and issue a public apology to Kennedy and to all women for the culture of violence and misogyny he and his music encourages.<eos> This is way out of control.<eos> Does Dad know about this?<eos> Well, he does now.
Okay, but I'm not challenging that.<eos> Make your history.<eos> I'm-a make my own history.<eos> Or I should say, I'm-a try to rewrite the history of you and your crazy-ass family.<eos> Do Inferno.
Tyree, please take this and school this old Lyon.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lucious, he killed it.<eos> He killed it.<eos> Did he?
But now...<eos> Patience is a talent.<eos> You'd be amazed what a person can do with a little bit of purpose and an abundance of time.<eos> Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... That you're using dark magic.<eos> Did he?
He gets back exactly at 8:45.<eos> What's he doin'?<eos> Night fishing.<eos> Wait a minute, you called us to... To kill a demon that likes to fish?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hiya, sweetheart.<eos> Run!<eos> Guys, we got a problem.<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> No, you don't.
"Our"?<eos> As in you and me?<eos> You're a killer, Dean Winchester, and so am I.<eos> And if we go too long without something to track or trap or punch or gut, well, things get a bit ugly.<eos> Don't they?
It's not a bad life.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.<eos> You got a line on vamps?<eos> I do.
She was miserable here. She...<eos> We had big plans.<eos> Was that before or after you bit her?<eos> I had to know if she could survive the change.<eos> Not everyone does.
It doesn't matter! The code.<eos> No, hey, screw the code.<eos> Don't make this harder than it already is.<eos> Mick, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do!
I have never seen that side of you.<eos> Yes, well, Mary, I'm sad to say that you won't become the Jiminy cricket of the British men of letters.<eos> We don't need a conscious.<eos> Such a trite idea, but we firmly believe the ends do justify the means.<eos> They didn't this time.
How can you even tell?<eos> Am I gonna say "bad dog"?<eos> He can be unpleasant.<eos> Dr. Hess says that you have designs on Mick Davies' job.<eos> Did she?
It's feel-good and it sells.<eos> It's page five filler.<eos> The lead should be the planning permission given for 300 new homes.<eos> Which moron thought that was better?<eos> I did.
Look.<eos> What I'm saying is I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
I never knew the smell of mildew turned him on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why did you do it then if you're so bloody sorry?<eos> He'd come round to look at the boiler.<eos> Well, he certainly did that, didn't he?
Mr. Winterman.<eos> Oh, hello. I was er...<eos> just about to lock up actually.<eos> - Have you got your wife's laptop?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I...<eos> I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.
Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.<eos> Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?<eos> Haven't been here in years.<eos> Why should they recognize me?<eos> Sometimes I hardly do.
Gendry(to Thoros): Yes, thank you, I know that.<eos> Hound: Could've been worse.<eos> Gendry(to Hound): She wanted to kill me.<eos> - And would have killed me if it weren't for...<eos> Hound: But they didn't, did they?
And Joffrey.<eos> It makes their power brittle.<eos> Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.<eos> Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.<eos> He did.
But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.
You invoked my name without ever even talking to me.<eos> You said that all I care about is my interest.<eos> That was inappropriate and wrong, and I am ordering you to stay away from this investigation.<eos> The Chief of Staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The President does.
- My brother has always said that...<eos> - I don't care what your brother thinks.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.<eos> I do.
- I will.<eos> It was so good having you two under one roof.<eos> Just felt whole.<eos> Dad mentioned the other night the Pastor?<eos> Of course he did.
Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
You're talking about the afterlife like it's... a destination.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the world is... looking for someone to show them the way.<eos> And you think I'm that someone.<eos> I do.
Haven't you ever wondered why you were able to survive so long in that coma with no ill effect?<eos> That place you spent those 12 years... it kept you alive.<eos> Kept me alive?<eos> The Realm almost killed me.<eos> But it didn't.
You get to decide that all by yourself.<eos> And look, you're...<eos> You're gonna make mistakes.<eos> That's how you learn.<eos> We all do.
But my office assured me it was legitimate.<eos> Unfortunately... My business is quite legitimate, Ms. Whelan... as am I.<eos> Yet you're here with $300 million to be a part of a... a team?<eos> My team? My team doesn't exist.<eos> Not yet, at least, but the funding does...
-Well, that was all postmortem.<eos> But what's most notable about the job is, whoever did it was very, very sloppy.<eos> Just jabbing here and there till the limb come off.<eos> Jabbing.<eos> Lil' jab'll do ya.
My father?<eos> Do they teach you that in Chaplain 101?<eos> He was so disappointed when your brothers all went to AMT.<eos> Mars needs its engineers too.<eos> It does.
Oh, um, excuse me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I thought you had your dinner tonight.<eos> Uh, I did;
- What's- - What--<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.<eos> And I trust you know who I am?<eos> I do.
Well, it ain't true.<eos> Okay, okay. Um...<eos> All right.<eos> There was a girl there, but I didn't sleep with her.<eos> Other guys did, but I didn't.
If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
No, you can't do that.<eos> - There's too much at stake to wait. - Mother!<eos> No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.
But I'm so glad you came back, and that you want us and him to be ours.<eos> - He's ours.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> - Hey. I saw Lisa leave.<eos> - She did.
Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
Can't you tell them that you were working on a case?<eos> I can't get a cup of coffee without them asking questions.<eos> But you'll be okay, right?<eos> They need you.<eos> Till they don't.
Where are you going?<eos> I have time to give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks<eos> I don't want to...<eos> But I do.
- What will you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Go abroad?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I do.
I proved my loyalty.<eos> I got rid of the body. I wiped down the whole damn house.<eos> - To prove your loyalty.<eos> - Yes, to prove my loyalty.<eos> And you did.
Uh, it's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... we were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.<eos> - We all did.
I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
I think he stopped taking his meds, or he started taking something he shouldn't.<eos> Do you know if he was using drugs?<eos> No, I mean, I didn't see it, but, you know, he acted like he did sometimes.<eos> Do you have that previous address?<eos> Yes, actually I do. Another hotel,
We have an elevator, but it's not working.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm in room 305.<eos> All right, lock the door and windows, set the camera, and go to bed.<eos> Doing it now.
Juliette's hurt. I have to go to the hospital.<eos> Okay, let me know how she is.<eos> Don't worry. We got this.<eos> Did he just say Juliette?<eos> Yeah, he did.
- If the autopsy proves she died from anything you did to her, you will go to jail, Mason.<eos> Now we talked to Dr. Landeaux.<eos> He told us she was suffering from dementia, and she could become violent.<eos> Now your record doesn't suggest you like assaulting people.<eos> - I don't.
Why don't I have a look at your husband?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Actually, the truth is we called you 'cause we need to talk to you about something else.<eos> Well, we don't need to talk to you.<eos> They do.
You're here because of me.<eos> None of this would have ever happened to you if you hadn't met me.<eos> So you think I wanna change that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't.
Let's talk.<eos> Worst part of my line of work.<eos> Masks are so damned hot.<eos> This doesn't have to end badly.<eos> Well, sure it does, Sam.
Okay.<eos> So, is that how you two met?<eos> - No, not really. - Yep.<eos> On second thought, I think we really do have to wake up early tomorrow.<eos> We don't, sweetie.
With a large amount on the table, I doubt he'd lie.<eos> We need another plan.<eos> Maybe we should let things take their course.<eos> The girls don't deserve to lose their jobs.<eos> -[sighs] -And Carlos does?
Then I guess you got your answer.<eos> You mean, there's not another bus?<eos> People lie. Board don't.<eos> You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?<eos> Sure, I do.
You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
Take advantage of basic income, group housing, medical services.<eos> Register today for a better tomorrow.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you know the fastest way to the ocean?<eos> For 50, I do.
But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Actually, this is my last week here.<eos> I'm not a gambler.<eos> Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?<eos> Surrogacy?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.
I'll be gentle.<eos> You've been in bed all day. I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine. I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want--<eos> Uh, I-I do.
I thought you were the king of Hollywood?<eos> I never said that.<eos> - You said it to the dogs.<eos> - Like a minute ago.<eos> No, I didn't.
You ever hear of Indiana Jones?<eos> You work with Harrison Ford?<eos> No, but I do represent the guy who got his heart pulled out of his chest in Temple of Doom.<eos> I love that guy.<eos> Everybody does.
Oh, yeah.<eos> No, I gotta call him.<eos> - So you didn't call him?<eos> - No, I called him.<eos> No, you didn't.
- And it's filled with porn.<eos> No, okay. I've seen worse.<eos> So, does that help?<eos> - ... I feel so nasty. - No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Oh, no.<eos> Well, this is a problem.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> You have a hammertoe that has to be shaved down.<eos> I do?
You maybe wanna take a shower?<eos> All of, like, North America would appreciate it.<eos> Why is Dany coming to dinner?<eos> Because she's our friend and we miss her.<eos> We do?
Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
Look at her.<eos> She about to come over here and tell me to shut up.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - I have the right to be here.<eos> Yes, you do.
Thank you.<eos> So you'll cool with questioning kids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In the gang unit, half the bangers we dealt with were kids.<eos> How you doing, ladies?
He made threats.<eos> And we can't find him.<eos> We just want to get him off the street before anything else happens.<eos> Jeanette, does he have a gun?<eos> Franklin, does he?
No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
What about Emily Vega?<eos> Kick her.<eos> Sergeant Lowdell.<eos> - You got a minute?<eos> - I do.
We'll be very respectful, but we need to go in and get 'em.<eos> First of all, they're not men.<eos> They're boys.<eos> And they now have sanctuary inside this church.<eos> - Like hell they do.
Now it looks like Tillman kept cashing the disability checks.<eos> The last one was cashed at a BofA on 40th Street ten minutes ago.<eos> It's right near Gleason's house.<eos> All right, does Gleason have a car registered in his name?<eos> Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.
Give me that key.<eos> Back up, everybody back up on the wall.<eos> Back up on the wall.<eos> Okay, someone needs to tell us what's going on.<eos> No, we don't.
- The Ark is our ark.<eos> - I get it.<eos> Ok, so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food.<eos> We got oxygen scrubbers, but hot do we store enough water for 500 people?<eos> We don't.
Break it down.<eos> Tell me, what do I do?<eos> First, you take the MCAT.<eos> Then you take it again when you fail.<eos> Most people do.
Please, I've been regretting it ever since we talked.<eos> I'm so sorry I inspired you.<eos> Relax, Doc.<eos> You didn't inspire me.<eos> They did.
What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
That's why this sucks.<eos> I get overeager, Fitz.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I meant well.<eos> I still do.
Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Ward.<eos> It's that way.<eos> Kill me already.<eos> Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.
Is she your source for the Resistance?<eos> - No!<eos> - No! Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here!<eos> Well, I do.
We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful ghost rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> I do.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
Hi.<eos> Ofdaniel has been convicted of endangering a child.<eos> The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.<eos> I know how difficult this is, girls.<eos> I do.
Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.<eos> Charlemagne. Lincoln. Belushi.<eos> You name it. You... Will be my right-hand man.<eos> The grail killed Abraham Lincoln?<eos> Mm. Yes, we did.
Do you prefer single line or double?<eos> Whatever makes them go! Go! - Go that way!<eos> - So exciting.<eos> We have to fly together.<eos> - Oh, my God, we do.
- Oh, you two.<eos> Hey, you told me you would clean up your room before you left.<eos> - I'll do it when I get home.<eos> - Promise is a promise, mister.<eos> - Do it now.
I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
- The context is you portrayed yourself which is what you did the entire time you pretended to be an attorney and what I believe you are doing to this body right now.<eos> if she's going to impugn his character then he's entitled to let someone else speak for him.<eos> - This isn't a trial.<eos> We don't allow character witnesses here.<eos> you do. 16a.
but I don't see what a random attorney has to do with these proceedings.<eos> - She's not talking about a random attorney.<eos> She's talking about me.<eos> But just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now.<eos> - Maybe he doesn't.
And it was Walter Samson's godson.<eos> she did.<eos> - Then we need to get her kicked off that board.<eos> Harvey.<eos> We don't.
A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
And on cloudy nights I used to tell you there were no stars because the batteries had run out.<eos> Backfired a bit on me there!<eos> You took the battery out of every toy you owned and had them ready for me at bedtime... .. to turn the stars back on.<eos> And you said that they were the wrong size batteries.<eos> So I did.
There's Julie Matlock, demanding editor, fiercely-protective mother, domineering wife.<eos> And there was also Nadine Hunter, charismatic but haunted woman, born under an unlucky star.<eos> Depression, alcoholism, a college sweetheart buried in the past.<eos> And then, to cap it all off, she's convicted for a murder she did not commit.<eos> - Did not?
Have they been with you long?<eos> Maisie since she was four.<eos> The boys since they were babies.<eos> Do you mind me asking, do you and Mrs Dawson have children of your own? - Er, no.<eos> We don't.
- But it has to have been one of them.<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> - Sir? - Mm?<eos> The church service, we said we'd go.<eos> Oh, yes, so we did, yeah.
Like one that DOSA had been building all along.<eos> Clever.<eos> You intentionally set me up to be possessed by Apep.<eos> - He could've killed me.<eos> - Yeah, but he didn't.
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.<eos> Fucking Eddie.<eos> I ain't seen him.<eos> How did you afford a place there, then?<eos> I didn't.
I didn't!<eos> I'd never hurt her.<eos> But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.<eos> David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.<eos> No, you don't.
Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.<eos> It's reversible.<eos> Thought you'd like it.<eos> Oh, I do!
Just baby talk, mostly.<eos> Well, you have arrived just in time.<eos> I know you've seen many unusual things. - Yes, we have.<eos> - And you must have many questions.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Probably the last spring he'll make it up the mountain.<eos> Want me to throw a rock at it?<eos> No!<eos> He'll know when his time has come.<eos> We all do.
Get me files on Pete Sampras and the Williams sisters.<eos> Irealizedshehad me pick her up four days in a row sothehome'sguardwouldbedown and she could leave on her own.<eos> Butwhy?<eos> He'll know when his time has come.<eos> We all do.
I will teach dance again!<eos> It is a gift that I have withheld from the world far too long.<eos> She taught me how to salsa.<eos> She was amazing.<eos> I do it for the joy.
Guardian, he protects the Earth, but Agent Schott?<eos> He protects the stars.<eos> I'll see you on the street, James.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I almost didn't.
Rip.<eos> Rip, it's Sara.<eos> Come on, it's Sara.<eos> You say her name as if she's supposed to matter to me.<eos> She doesn't.
Sit down, Professor.<eos> His heart is beating way too fast.<eos> I said sit.<eos> I know you think I'm overreacting...<eos> No, I don't.
Yes, Doc, let's.<eos> Let's.<eos> Let's talk about when I get out of this pathetic prison and these silly little cuffs. When I fry Supergirl from the inside out.<eos> You think she'll scream as she cooks?<eos> I do.
And I just think that Mon-El is the kind of the guy who thinks about himself first.<eos> Well, he's come a really long way.<eos> He's doing really well with training.<eos> Do you have something against Mon-El?<eos> No, I don't.
I...<eos> You know, Kara, you are starting to sound a lot like a reporter and not a friend right now.<eos> I don't mean to.<eos> - Maggie, did you find Lillian?<eos> - No, we didn't.
Especially when it's hard to find.<eos> So, my office is overflowing with flowers.<eos> - Really?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, we do.<eos> Excellent work, Jeremiah.<eos> I know it wasn't easy.<eos> We have a deal, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Even they can't stand your singing.<eos> Sorry to pull you over, but I saw you have a broken taillight.<eos> I do?
I didn't thank you earlier for looking after my son.<eos> A Kryptonian taking care of a Daxamite.<eos> And I thought I'd seen it all.<eos> But you didn't come here all this way just to thank me.<eos> No, I didn't.
And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.<eos> Your mother can change.<eos> You just have to talk to her.<eos> People don't really change.<eos> Sure they do.
Yeah, get in.<eos> Why me?<eos> You warned the aliens about Cadmus.<eos> - You want to help people.<eos> - I do.
Wives.<eos> They got all the leverage.<eos> So I had to do something to even the score.<eos> See, now you have a compelling reason to pay me when she wants to pay the credit cards. Yes.<eos> I do.
Christos?<eos> When you told her, what did she say?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> She didn't want to believe it.<eos> None of us do.
Well, we're undead, so if it's normal you're after, I don't fancy your chances.<eos> And why the sudden melancholy?<eos> Did you expect to break out of the Chambre de Chasse and into a family cured of dysfunction?<eos> When we were in there, it felt like the world had stopped.<eos> But it didn't.
I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
He'll be coming by way of Mystic Falls, carrying one of the bones and the means to find another.<eos> Between the three of us, we should have those remains by sundown.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> For that matter, why would you trust me?<eos> I don't.
Check it out.<eos> Your puke is purple.<eos> Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red... and something was blue.<eos> Someone stole the fucking gun.<eos> No, they didn't.
Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
And do the... the Langmores vote?<eos> Not historically. No, ma'am.<eos> I would think that votes would be valuable around here.<eos> Do they pay taxes?<eos> We do.
Everything is fine, Sheriff.<eos> Mom says that girl took something.<eos> That she's cousins with those two assholes.<eos> Do I ask that much of you, Charlotte?<eos> I don't, do I?
Here we go.<eos> You wouldn't even have been able to get in if we hadn't got her out, Ruth.<eos> You didn't get the little dipshit brother outta there, did you?<eos> No.<eos> You did not.
I had to wait for him to leave.<eos> I'd a been a sight more comfortable with a couple grand and a Handycam.<eos> The point is, Uncle Boyd, that much cash money's ill-gotten.<eos> We got as much right to it as he does.<eos> No, you do not.
My own tongue is in there.<eos> Don't tell your mistress about us - understand?<eos> The doctor he do seem fond of her.<eos> Er, he do.<eos> Everyone, everyone do.
But apparently, I can't give it to you.<eos> You're allowed, you know.<eos> You are not an algorithm, you are not a machine, you're human.<eos> You are allowed to have a down quarter.<eos> All hedge funds do, eventually.
Or you can tell me what the fuck is going on.<eos> How?<eos> Isn't the point of analysis that we don't know?<eos> Which is why I'm not in that racket. We don't have that kind of fucking time. Not anymore.<eos> Fucking right we don't.
Welcome back, gentlemen.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, I was wondering, have you heard anything of Miss Maric?<eos> I thought you had no interest in her?<eos> I don't. I don't.
Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, then how do we know it's there?<eos> We don't.
Tell-tell me about the fire in Prague.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> What does it matter now?<eos> I've always thought Papa started it.<eos> He did, didn't he?
I'm hungry.<eos> He doesn't look very appetizing.<eos> L-O-L.<eos> Thought we were gonna fuck this town up.<eos> Like you did this guy.
West, along the river path but...<eos> But you can't go.<eos> Nine year ago, Yeardley were part of an expedition beyond the falls.<eos> They tried to bribe the Powhatan, Pamunkey and the Chickahominy into telling them where the gold was to be found.<eos> They didn't.
One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
When's the last time you saw the dawn?<eos> Marshall, sir.<eos> Is it dawn, sir?<eos> You spoke with the governor.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.
I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
He makes the parties.<eos> Go.<eos> Maybe he'll make a party in your panties.<eos> I haven't seen you before.<eos> I do my grocery shopping elsewhere.
Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> We did what we believed in.<eos> Ain't no one can take that from us.<eos> Except they did.
You don't need him.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Onario!<eos> - You don't need your father anymore.<eos> You never did.
Prego.<eos> Andiamo.<eos> The one that didn't get away.<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Alie said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
-I'm really proud of you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Just some questions that I needed to answer.<eos> I know.<eos> But you did it.
Uncle Michele!<eos> Dear God, Mileva?<eos> Mileva can you hear me?<eos> She'll wake up.<eos> She always does.
Some pleasure to numb the world's constant pull upon me.<eos> It has nothing to do with our life.<eos> You are a selfish man.<eos> You have convinced yourself that your contributions to the world absolve you from the responsibility you bear to those you claim to love.<eos> They do not.
Yeah.<eos> So now that I'm here, all-all I see is mint.<eos> Please tell me you have some in the back.<eos> - Um, no, ma'am.<eos> We don't.
Why? Is it, like, good manners to put the second black eye on the other side?<eos> Uh, I don't know about manners, but symmetry is more attractive.<eos> See ya.<eos> You know that Bobby Dean had enemies?<eos> Most assholes do.
Number one:<eos> I offer a safe but aggressive investment scheme that follows the... the way that economics are trending, right?<eos> 'Cause I read the... There's this... uh, report.<eos> I'm sure you don't read it 'cause it would bore you to death.<eos> But I do.
Well, what's that got to do with cartoons, huh?<eos> You want me to get you some water, sweetheart?<eos> We can read a story before bed.<eos> I want Daddy to do it.<eos> Daddy'll do it.
You help me get him, and they will cut you a deal.<eos> You understand what's happening right now?<eos> Russ.<eos> - I don't know shit about Byrde.<eos> - Ruth does.
I'm worried about the $8 million today.<eos> I haven't gone on to worry about the fact that the prize for saving our fucking lives is just to do it all over again, only ten times bigger.<eos> Do you wanna talk about our fight?<eos> Nope.<eos> You do, though, huh?
Wendy.<eos> Cheers.<eos> How'd that Sam thing go?<eos> We own a funeral home now.<eos> Of course we do.
It's not actually yoga, but-- I just-<eos> I'm not sure I actually wanna work at the restaurant anymore.<eos> - So, what is this place?<eos> - Hey, did you talk with Topher?<eos> Yes. No, I did.
Well... it was very clear what I was saying.<eos> Okay, you need to breathe. I mean, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Well, I-I need to figure some things out, separate from you, separate from the family.<eos> I don't understand what I did. No.<eos> You didn't do anything.
How did this thing...?<eos> How did we get here?<eos> Am I remembering things wrong? Did...?<eos> I mean, we had some good times, didn't we?<eos> Mom, of course we did.
Am I remembering things wrong? Did...?<eos> I mean, we had some good times, didn't we?<eos> Mom, of course we did.<eos> We did, did we?<eos> Yes, we did.
- Am I supposed to lie on the stand?<eos> - No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?
I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?<eos> - They won't.<eos> - What if they do?
For what?<eos> 'Cause I didn't take those sick days?<eos> - It has nothing to do with that.<eos> - This has to do with my brother.<eos> - No, it does not.
Knock that shed down.<eos> Clean it all up.<eos> This is gonna be a prime site for a mixed-use marina.<eos> I heard you had that idea one time for the boatyard.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Well, I don't know.<eos> Like, to clear the past.<eos> Make way for the future. You know.<eos> Hey, look, I don't have anything against you, sir, okay?<eos> I don't.
But that's not why I'm here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a price in mind?<eos> I do.
I told you a story about us swimming.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> My dad... the way he taught Danny was he took him out in the middle of the ocean and he threw him overboard.<eos> He expected him to swim.<eos> And he did.
Well, I'm thinking he wants more than just conversation.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Who's this?<eos> We don't know.<eos> But she does.
I mean, she abandoned my mother in a Korean orphanage.<eos> I-I don't even understand why my mom asked me to do this in the first place.<eos> She spent most of my life trying to forget she was even born here.<eos> Well, people change.<eos> Maybe your mother's idea of this place did, too.
And, um, that's when I knew.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That he was the one.<eos> That he would take care of me forever.<eos> And he did.
But that's okay.<eos> Geon says caffeine makes me jittery.<eos> And he likes me calm.<eos> I mean, sometimes he says that I could have bigger, you know.<eos> But why guy doesn't right?
- Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
We want the same thing.<eos> No, I don't think we want the same thing at all.<eos> Keep your pants on.<eos> You had one inside of you?<eos> We all did.
How do I look?<eos> Like the Fat Albert kids went to prep school.<eos> Do I look nervous?<eos> - Yeah, you look nervous.<eos> - I do?
- Bye!<eos> - Be safe.<eos> All right.<eos> See, now that woman deserves a great wedding.<eos> Yes, she does.
Come on, Benny.<eos> I only gave you one job!<eos> Dude, they weren't open, man.<eos> So I kind of just came on down to the church, and the ceremony kind of just started, man.<eos> - No, no, it didn't.
I only gave you one job!<eos> Dude, they weren't open, man.<eos> So I kind of just came on down to the church, and the ceremony kind of just started, man.<eos> - No, no, it didn't.<eos> - Yes, it did.
I'm ruining the mood?<eos> It's because of you, Benny, I was late to my wedding!<eos> You and I both know that that's not accurate.<eos> You know what happened to me last night.<eos> Of course I do!
I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.<eos> I couldn't stand the idea of it being trapped in there.<eos> - Shocking no one. - Just leave her alone.<eos> It's not like you have yours.<eos> I do, so...
Sanford Bensinger is on the phone.<eos> Sandy.<eos> We call it the Giving Oath because you fucking swear it.<eos> Do you understand what an oath is?<eos> I do.
Are you seriously asking me about déjà vu?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's gone.<eos> You never get déjà vu?<eos> Everybody does.
If we fail, it's on both of us.<eos> I won't be able to protect you.<eos> And what a relief that will be... for both of us.<eos> The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.
I think I'm ready to... explore.<eos> - It's just preliminary. I'm not committing to anything.<eos> - I hear you.<eos> - 'Cause the thing is, I'm really not sure that I finished my mission.<eos> Well, who ever does, kid?
My family's at the mall.<eos> I've gotta get to them.<eos> What if it doesn't have any keys?<eos> - I'll bet Mia knows how to hotwire.<eos> - Of course I do.
Who are you?<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Of course I do.
Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Baby doll, yes, you do.
_<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> Weaponizing the fuel.<eos> You said we need every drop.<eos> We do!
I know, right?<eos> I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.
I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I don't think I can take another bug bite.<eos> Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?<eos> I didn't bring you out here.<eos> The clue in the ledger brought you out here.<eos> No, you did.
Everything to gain by converting you to his cause.<eos> That's my argument, you know.<eos> All right, fine, it makes no sense that it's a trap, which is exactly why it has to be one.<eos> You're going to accept.<eos> I already did an hour ago.
And men like you.<eos> Damn it, we lost it.<eos> Alex, give me a full 360!<eos> - We cannot maneuver here.<eos> - Do it!
Do it and I'll trade places with you.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
- You all right?<eos> - Is Hawk in trouble because we've been seeing a Denier?<eos> - What Denier?<eos> - He sees the kids, Mom.<eos> At least he did.
I need a nap.<eos> After I dance is when we usually lose most of the class.<eos> Now, before I teach you the actual moves, I want you to just feel your body and let it go.<eos> Who wants to give it a shot?<eos> Oh, I do!
After I dance is when we usually lose most of the class.<eos> Now, before I teach you the actual moves, I want you to just feel your body and let it go.<eos> Who wants to give it a shot?<eos> Oh, I do!<eos> I do!
But now I'm with Caroline, and... Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
Sit.<eos> All right, now give me that paw.<eos> Now here's what I got for you. There you go.<eos> I have a way with dogs.<eos> Well, my marijuana biscuits do.
- Hi.<eos> All right, great.<eos> Listen to Cherry.<eos> Be nice.<eos> Do something.
Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's like Fort Knox in here.<eos> But it's far more secure.<eos> Mrs. Clios...<eos> I will check you in, if the computer permits it.<eos> And it finally does.
Not even in a cool way.<eos> Tripped on a fat kid, landed on a skinny kid.<eos> Maybe you should go for Tess.<eos> I bet she'll be single soon since Bobby's jealous rage sent her boyfriend to the hospital.<eos> I did not.
You're sharing a bowl of chicken noodle soup?<eos> I bet you don't even have money for lunch.<eos> Hey, we didn't have money for gas or hotels either, but we figured it out.<eos> - We don't need your help.<eos> - Yes, you do. No, we don't.
I... I'll...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> We tried.<eos> We really did.
I'll take care of it.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> We tried.<eos> We really did.<eos> No, we didn't.
Their mascot is a Panther.<eos> So?<eos> That was her name for me.<eos> She used to call me Panther.<eos> - No, she didn't.
All right, last chance, man.<eos> Anything you want to save?<eos> Sell it all.<eos> Who wants to buy some goodies?<eos> You do.
I bought Ava that dress, and I needed it gone, so let it go.<eos> - I don't care...<eos> - Let it go.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How we doing?
"known as the 'bait and switch.'<eos> "The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target."<eos> So we're really gonna do this?<eos> I mean, I want to find her, man.<eos> I really do, but... this guy and his family?
Perfect in elegance and simplicity.<eos> This man stole my wallet!<eos> Well done.<eos> Whoa.<eos> No, he did not.
This was a birthday gift from my husband.<eos> It's a beautiful machine, but I think it's a little extravagant for our budget.<eos> No problem.<eos> Do you have your receipt?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> You think I got out early on a Saturday night without my minions of rich girls to protect me?<eos> I don't know your life.<eos> Well, I don't.
You always liked trains best, didn't you?<eos> Max.<eos> That looks like it hurts pretty bad.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
Let me guess. Russia vetoed the Security Council vote on Naruba.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm sure the Joint Chiefs have already emphasized that Naruba is strategically worthless.<eos> People are so damn poor in that country that it doesn't even register on economic reports.<eos> They did.
I should've gone public with you 12 years ago, Liam, fed you to the wolves.<eos> Too late now.<eos> Not really.<eos> I still have the evidence against you, Liam.<eos> And now... Senator Bowman does, too.
So, you want to tell me what you know or not?<eos> Abe Leonard knows that Agent Wells tried to delay Vice President MacLeish's confirmation vote.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten tell him?<eos> Mm, according to Aaron Shore, Leonard tried to get her to confirm.<eos> - And did she?
I think it would've been great to be working together again.<eos> Yeah, it would've been.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Anything can happen, right?<eos> And it usually does.
As you know, in addition to tomorrow's regular schedule, the United States will be introducing an initiative that would reduce NATO's nuclear arsenal.<eos> Now, I want to be absolutely clear that this is a proposed weapons-reduction change, not a change in doctrine.<eos> And it's entirely predicated upon the Russian Federation scaling back its strategic nuclear weapons in proportional response to NATO's actions, something that the Russian president has assured me he is ready to do.<eos> What, you believe him, Cornelius?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Seth. Hey.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President.<eos> I just, um, thought you should see this right away.<eos> Why didn't we get a heads-up?<eos> We did.
How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.<eos> All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.<eos> Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.<eos> Sure you do.
We can't. I tried.<eos> Well, I could ask.<eos> They were pretty firm about it.<eos> - I could cry.<eos> - I did.
And all he was doing was trying to make me feel better, and I kicked him out of the house.<eos> I kicked him out of the house on his birthday, Shelly.<eos> And I don't have a car, and I really want to make him this... fancy chocolate almond cake for his birthday.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And I usually do this, like, really... sexy Marilyn Monroe-style birthday dance for him, and... Oh, my God.
I kind of wish she didn't make the final round so we could get out of here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> It looks like we have a checkmate, everybody.<eos> Congratulations, Tess.<eos> Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
But the truth is, you came into this world pretty perfect.<eos> You always had this, uh... gentleness, this inner kindness to you, from the start, and I think... you got that from William.<eos> I really thought I was doing the right thing for you and for our family...<eos> - Mom, you don't have to do this.<eos> - I do.
Don't make that face.<eos> I'm starving and I know you haven't eaten.<eos> Ok. I'll get a meatball sandwich from Riggio's.<eos> They don't deliver this late.<eos> Oh, they do for me.
So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
So, deal with it, Rosen.<eos> Fuckin' anti-Semite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When did we learn that move?<eos> We didn't.
When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
"Just another patient"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Kristen doesn't scare you.<eos> She sure does.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I hate people.<eos> Okay, so, do we tell Kristen?<eos> 'Cause it'll kill her.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - No. We do not.
She's having a baby.<eos> I said that I'm fine where I am.<eos> She's your daughter.<eos> Do you have a daughter?<eos> I do.
It's like trying to make a list...<eos> - people yelling in your ear.<eos> - Big score potential.<eos> The... the pills I prescribed should help with that.<eos> They... do.
David Haller.<eos> As I said...<eos> They have her.<eos> Division Three.<eos> They probably do.
- What's your name, young lady?<eos> - Violet... Baudelaire.<eos> - A Baudelaire.<eos> - Wait, do you... do you know that name?<eos> Of course I do.
Yes, sir.<eos> Your shoes are still on.<eos> Klaus?<eos> I promised our parents I'd always look out for Klaus.<eos> But I didn't.
Life has a way of doing that.<eos> Yeah, but at least we have a life.<eos> You know, Lisa's was... was cut short before it even had a chance to start.<eos> Seems like you have some good memories of her.<eos> Yeah, I do.
With your ex-husband.<eos> Your ex-fiancé.<eos> I never thought I'd miss this place.<eos> You know, some good stuff happened here.<eos> Yeah, it did.
But, clearly, it didn't.<eos> So then the unsub tried to cast a stronger spell.<eos> Exactamundo.<eos> The color black asks for the bloodletting of a sinner, so the display of Robert Miller should have worked, too.<eos> But it didn't, either.
There wasn't any boy.<eos> There was only her.<eos> No boy?<eos> But there must've been a boy. We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.<eos> Well, she didn't.
I like to imagine that I am a princess in a tower. Or Joan of Arc riding into battle! Or a forlorn bride who lives by the sea but never speaks to anyone, because her one true love was lost when his ship went down and disappeared beneath the waves!<eos> Could you tell me a story now?<eos> I could tell you 12!<eos> Diana... do you think you could like me just... a little?<eos> I already do.
She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
But he's angry.<eos> You think he heard you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> What he really needs is a hard reset.<eos> We all do.
What do you mean?<eos> If they knew who you were, they would have stopped you.<eos> Because of your mom, your whole family's on the list now.<eos> I didn't go through the gate.<eos> You didn't?
It was a massacre.<eos> Where the hell are you going?<eos> - Bram?<eos> - They killed everyone!<eos> - Who did?
If he doesn't, he gets in trouble, and they don't... the hospital... they don't know where he is.<eos> You don't really believe he needs those pills, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
Yeah.<eos> And getting her into a good college.<eos> Let's start by finding her a place to live.<eos> She needs to be able to open up her living room windows and see the sun.<eos> We all do.
A moron, definitely.<eos> You always know just what to say.<eos> Aram, you're a trusting person who assumes the best in people.<eos> Be yourself and they will see that.<eos> Everyone does.
Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually... I don't want a rain check.<eos> I mean, I do.<eos> Obviously, I do. But I don't.
To find out that person... Is a spy.<eos> Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> I thought panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did.
But there is still pizza on my wall.<eos> Alright.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Well, we got our HCG.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Yeah, before we get to that, uh, Mr. Young is going to need you to explain to him why there's nothing more you can do for his son.<eos> What?<eos> No one's told him that yet?<eos> I thought he knew we were coming.<eos> Well, he does.
Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please. - Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
- Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No. I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.
Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No. I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.<eos> But I don't.
Bad as you thought it would be?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We have to, but...<eos> No, you don't.
I was halfway through my residency, and Lewis said to me,<eos> "Elsie, this surgeon business" is not making you any friends.<eos> "You need to think of something else to do."<eos> I was trying to take care of you!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
You were always so good.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Incredible grades, a clean room, ooh, you never talked back, and you never messed around with the boys.<eos> Most parents would appreciate that.<eos> Oh, I did... then.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, he's all about the program.<eos> Oh, well, that's good.<eos> - I mean, at least he has a handle on it.<eos> - He does.
Who's they?<eos> They.<eos> I mean, what, you want names and addresses?<eos> 'Cause I don't have 'em.<eos> Nobody does.
I told you, Frank, did I not?<eos> I warned you that this was not gonna end well...<eos> Not for you, not for anyone that you care about.<eos> Come on, man, she's got nothing to do with this!<eos> She does now!
What's wrong?<eos> I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.
- Brace myself?<eos> - Just go with it.<eos> Em and Lo, that's us.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> Um, yeah, like, for sure, Professor, I do.
Right, it'll just be a few nights, so... Yeah.<eos> And then we'll come and get you, and we'll bring you home.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think that went relatively well.<eos> I don't.
Never mind. [Chuckles] I don't even know why...<eos> 'Cause you want a family.<eos> 'Cause I want a family?<eos> Don't we want a family?<eos> No, of course we do.
Look, I want this bad.<eos> I need you guys to want it, too.<eos> 'Cause if you don't, - there's no reason...<eos> - Jack.<eos> I do.
We know that; he doesn't.<eos> You can tell him you have another copy, and he'll have to believe you.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Even if he believes she made another copy, he still has to believe she has a good reason to blackmail him.<eos> Well, luckily, she does.
My friends and I need a room for the night.<eos> Had to be the honeymoon suite.<eos> So, how do we contact Chrysalis, anyways?<eos> You don't have a computer.<eos> Sure we do.
Let me see your hands!<eos> Go!<eos> This way!<eos> I thought she told him to come alone.<eos> I did.
Well, a wise man once told me that "I'm sorry" only starts the conversation.<eos> So... who's ready for another game of truth or dare?<eos> I love truth or dare.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
Oh, hey, don't mind me.<eos> I'm sure you have all the answers.<eos> I'll just be over here, all gnarled up.<eos> Do you know what the TB protocol is?<eos> Well, in fact, I do.
Well, things are looking up for me, too.<eos> - I got a date tonight. - Oh!<eos> Is it someone in the hospital?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Your face did.
Everything I said, the stuff we were fighting about earlier, I take it back, all of it.<eos> I-I thought I'd lost you, Max.<eos> I mean, for a minute there, I thought you died.<eos> I thought all of us were going to die.<eos> We didn't.
Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Oh, what, just because I was in jail, - I'm also a car thief, right? - Shh, shh.<eos> You want to ask the black guy next? S-Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
I, uh... I went to my mother's house, wanted to run away.<eos> And my mom was there.<eos> Or you know.<eos> And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.<eos> Except... Except maybe... maybe I do.
That bad, huh?<eos> Angie.<eos> Don't.<eos> You cut the camera feed?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Turns out our agency has a pedigree.<eos> Paul Jennings, Davy Crockett, sacagawea.<eos> Every one of them is an American hero, and they all worked right here in this room together.<eos> I always thought Daniel Boone was the one who wore the fur cap.<eos> Technically, they both did.
My sister used to post up here.<eos> Loved her coffee. From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
It's been two years since she's seen you, Mitch.<eos> I know, but it's not like I could just pop over from Afghanistan for the weekend.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> I know.<eos> - So does Molly. - Mm.
Is there any indication what they have planned?<eos> No, but it can't be good.<eos> I know no one wants to confront the reality of the situation, but the fact of the matter is that it falls to us to act in the best interest of Dreyfuss Enterprises.<eos> We've had no contact with Malcolm for days, and serious decisions need to be made, so...<eos> Yes, they do.
As long as it will lure it towards us.<eos> Look, I'll research the correct symbology to paint in gold leaf onto your version of the box.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, Miss Jenny, you say you have a plan to procure enough gold to make weaponry.<eos> I do.
Very good.<eos> Godspeed, all.<eos> This can't be possible.<eos> You said it burned down.<eos> Well, it did.
He's free.<eos> Okay.<eos> And he told me to tell you something.<eos> He told me that you should let Molly have that new cell phone that she's been asking for.<eos> - He did, did he?
Are we to assume you are... the biblical Satan?<eos> The serpent who tempted Eve?<eos> Why box myself in with definitions?<eos> I'm the Devil you know.<eos> And many you don't.
I'm just saying.<eos> My wife has spent the past 14 years raising our son by herself.<eos> And it is Captain Hunter's fault. and still he asked me to abandon mine.<eos> He doesn't have a family.<eos> he did.
We haven't gotten any time.<eos> Someone needs to make a decision.<eos> Ms. Lance.<eos> You're the Captain. after everything that he's done?<eos> I do.
You waiting around so that you can get caught?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> That looks like something you might hide something in.<eos> Yes, it does.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
I would die to come here!<eos> Stop trying to cheer me up by saying you'll die.<eos> Right now, it probably feels like the world is ending, but I know if you don't give up and you think positive, things will work out.<eos> -I want to fight you.<eos> -No, you don't.
-I want to fight you.<eos> -No, you don't.<eos> I would destroy you.<eos> So instead let's think about why you wanted to come here in the first place.<eos> I didn't.
This is where Felicia was last seen.<eos> No obvious signs of a struggle.<eos> No, but maybe the assailant or assailants were able to disable Felicia quickly before she could put up a fight.<eos> In a space this open, no one saw anything?<eos> Maybe someone did.
Da.<eos> Old friends come to visit... It warms the heart.<eos> You two must be in real trouble, you come down here.<eos> We have some questions for you.<eos> Of course you do.
Right here.<eos> The second victim is Brent Miller, date of birth, May 15, 1982.<eos> I asked Garcia to find out what she can about him.<eos> How'd they make the I.D.?<eos> Oh, he did an ICM.
Much as I hate to agree, juries get lost in technobabble, so they're likely to find for a young widow over big tech.<eos> But this case has a young woman behind it, and Ginny has accomplished more in her first 26 years than most do in an entire lifetime.<eos> Who knows what she's gonna do in the next 26?<eos> You really think she's going to make that big of an impact?<eos> I do.
It's enough to get her a retrial.<eos> We're not getting her a retrial.<eos> We're getting her out.<eos> - We need to be reasonable.<eos> - No, we don't.
But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
Would you care for some wine or a cocktail tonight?<eos> Uh, just water, please.<eos> Just water, please.<eos> I love water.<eos> I do.
Name this price.<eos> 100lb weight of silver.<eos> My lands can afford no more.<eos> Does this man speak for Alfred?<eos> He does not.
Lord Odda.<eos> You will set tongues wagging, drinking with the peasants.<eos> Let them wag if it please them.<eos> You asked me some days ago if I agree with the payment of a ransom.<eos> I do not.
Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and forget about all of this.<eos> I lost my daughter because of my obsession.<eos> What will you lose because of your obsession?<eos> I will never close my eyes, Owen.<eos> And up until last week, you didn't, either.
Just pretend we're two old friends.<eos> We are old friends.<eos> Oh, there we go. That's the spirit.<eos> Now, just breathe, relax, have a coffee, enjoy my company.<eos> You usually do.
Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes... Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.
This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.<eos> They do.
SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.
What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.
But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow. All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
What the hell are you saying?<eos> What?<eos> Hey.<eos> You said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.
You'd be surprised how many people feel that way.<eos> This might help you understand them a little bit.<eos> Marx?<eos> I thought he hated religion.<eos> Uh, h-he did.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-Sure.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> S-So... you know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
I admire you.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You're fighting so things like that won't happen to other people.<eos> I wish I could tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
Okay.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.<eos> The Centre has nothing to do with them, come on.<eos> And so what if they do?
- Jiya, try it.<eos> - I just want to talk.<eos> - Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.<eos> And I do.
But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> No, no! No!<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
- I'm here for Lily.<eos> I always knew this day would come.<eos> Probably not what she's here for.<eos> How do you know our daughter?<eos> I don't.
If you're confident, I'm confident.<eos> Because you know what I'd do to you if you blew my money.<eos> All right, you are about to get an important lesson on self-reliance, young lady.<eos> I know he's serious when he calls me "young lady."<eos> My dad did the same thing. Okay.
I'm liable to have knocked you out.<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> - I was gonna fix that, anyway.<eos> Ay. Like you were going to clean the gutter?<eos> Coach Gary did it already.
All you have to do is admit that you want the job.<eos> And, like, get down on your knees and beg.<eos> Says the guy who's romancing a woman through a phone that isn't even on.<eos> A woman that he described to me in private as a skinny little fuck factory.<eos> Oh, no, I didn't. God.
All right.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit. We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
Now I'm promising you, one way or the other, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> D.C. sent me down to eliminate Ciudad Natal embeds from New Orleans, and that's what I've done.<eos> Time for me to go home.<eos> But the face of the Natal, Javier Garcia, is still walking around like he owns the place. Yeah.<eos> But he doesn't.
Curious how you heard.<eos> It-It makes no difference how I heard, I just did.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out what the hell's going on, and why this scum rates protection.<eos> Must have something valuable to offer.<eos> Well, obviously he does.
Yo, mind your own business.<eos> Hard to do since you can hear everything through the wall.<eos> Everything.<eos> Well, I hope you enjoyed the show.<eos> Oh, I did.
This is on me, guys.<eos> I thought...<eos> I really believed her.<eos> I always believe her.<eos> We all do.
Nobody listen to him.<eos> Well, you know, I just think that YA is the most interesting thing happening in fiction today.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> - I do.
It is our plan.<eos> Does anybody wanna come and see me perform in my Whitesnake cover band this weekend?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We're pretty good.<eos> - I do.
Alright.<eos> You look so hot in those goggles, bro.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I am gonna tell Ethan what happened.<eos> Unless you already have.<eos> No. I did not.
You're turning 40! We're having a party.<eos> - That's what you do when you turn 40.<eos> - Well, I don't want to.<eos> I wish you'd told me that six months ago.<eos> I did.
- What's your plan?<eos> - My plan is to tell her about us. Before she brings it up first, okay?<eos> Did you see how she just greeted me?<eos> - She definitely knows.<eos> - She does not.
I'm sure he appreciated it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Another round of your most expensive liquor.<eos> - And who wants caviar?<eos> - I do.
You all right?<eos> Yeah. Pulse is normal, I'm breathing regular.<eos> There's not a thing wrong with me.<eos> Why do you look like someone just died?<eos> Because Tammy almost did.
It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I...<eos> I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
You're right. It's gross.<eos> We are animals.<eos> Why does that feel so good?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It always did.
Found that out from Tina.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> I didn't.
Now at least they'll know this, too.<eos> It's so sweet, Colt.<eos> And you even put the comma in the right spot.<eos> Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.<eos> I didn't... I just...
Man, that is fuckin' awesome.<eos> Damn it, Dale, you know?<eos> And speaking of Dale, you're not gonna be able to hire him, 'cause he's not on our approved list of vets.<eos> - What? No one told me that.<eos> - I did.
I can't do this.<eos> I thought it's what I wanted, but... now that I'm here and it's all happenin'...<eos> Okay.<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm done.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Well... does the break room have a lock on the door?<eos> It does.
Not at all.<eos> With a little luck, a blow will land.<eos> All he's doing is showing off his feathers.<eos> I believe the lady feels the same.<eos> They usually do.
This plan can never work... there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.<eos> It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.<eos> Do we have a plan, King Guthred?<eos> Yes, we have a plan... and we have an agreement, do we not?<eos> We do.
Well done, Your Highness.<eos> My head feels like it was stomped on by The Colossus of Rhodes.<eos> Yeah, well, Valerian sleeping drugs will do that to you.<eos> You know, it would've been nice if you'd mentioned that your sifu had joined forces with Lam.<eos> He didn't.
All right, to be continued.<eos> For right now, what about Shangri-La?<eos> Lam's about to take it over and we're not gonna let that happen.<eos> Lam can take it over, but only if he has the staff.<eos> He does.
- It's why the Library exists.<eos> So magical items stay in the hands of the people who comprehend them.<eos> You mean a failed academic, a cowboy, a janitor, and a crook?<eos> Clearly you don't understand these people or what they do.<eos> - But do you?
Two of them, three of us.<eos> Easy peasy, lemon squeasy.<eos> "Never fear moving forward slowly; fear only to stand still."<eos> Who said that? Oh!<eos> He did.
Stone, give him the "pfft"!<eos> You guys get the staff from Lam.<eos> I got this.<eos> Sifu, please, you don't want to do this.<eos> All right, maybe you do.
We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field.<eos> Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
I've got the pen. It's all ready for you.<eos> This is your family Bible.<eos> You want me to be a Cuthbert?<eos> A real Cuthbert?<eos> We do.
He wanted land here.<eos> He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.<eos> Mmm. And we all know what happened.<eos> Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.<eos> We do.
But she's suffered a loss - she's grieving - so she's disinclined to be home alone in Charlottetown<eos> - since her companion passed away. - Her companion?<eos> Her best friend forever and ever.<eos> Aunt Josephine never married.<eos> Neither of them did.
My brain, Diana. My personality.<eos> As in, who I am.<eos> I'd like to believe that's what truly matters.<eos> If romance matters at all.<eos> Which it doesn't.
Thanks, guys, that means a lot.<eos> Boy, that was quite a trip, wasn't it?<eos> Sure was.<eos> And we learned a lot about blue jeans, - didn't we, guys?<eos> - Yes, yes, we did, yeah.
Look...<eos> I just wanted to say I know what it's like.<eos> Believe me,<eos> Kanan's not the easiest teacher to have, but he means well.<eos> Does he?
And people told him, these are experts told him,<eos> "We need to lower the cost of getting into low Earth orbit."<eos> Elon thinks of Earth as a hard drive, and he thinks of humanity as a very important file on that hard drive, and Elon looks at the history of mass extinction events and sees the hard drive has a tendency to crash.<eos> Some people think it's fine, just stay on Earth forever.<eos> And some people don't.
But since you have me here, what kind of car are you driving?<eos> Because we have some incredible lease programs right now.<eos> Okay, the only thing I want to hear out of you right now is your alibi for last night, assuming you have one.<eos> You got one of those?<eos> I do.
Oh, nah!<eos> Forget it.<eos> Absolutely no way.<eos> Nardole agreed.<eos> No, I didn't.
What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What about him?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> They don't feel pain.<eos> - I think they do.<eos> Yes, they do.
Impossible, Rogue Nation,<eos> -The Sum of all Fears.<eos> -Those are just movies!<eos> This is real life.<eos> So, do it!
Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
Hi. So, uh, you get right back after it, huh?<eos> No days off.<eos> Can't afford to. Every moment these kids are in here, they're not on the streets.<eos> It's a game of moments, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Sam, Hetty has something else for you.<eos> Where is Hetty?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, all she said this morning was that she had one last card to play.<eos> She always does.
Whoever left that info for you in the elevator didn't want it traced back to them.<eos> Well, luckily, they gave us enough to figure out where the anonymous tip was placed from.<eos> City directory says it's a pay phone in the Financial District.<eos> - They still have those?<eos> - In 2011, they did.
What did you think would happen?<eos> That you'd get on your proud, little soapbox, make your speech, and they'd just, what, slink away into the darkness?<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You asked me to pick a side.<eos> Well, I did.
- You okay?<eos> - Well...<eos> I'm exhausted and I'm sore.<eos> I thought we agreed never to speak of that.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Well, I'd rather it be for fun than, work.<eos> It's always fun.<eos> Especially since Mardi Gras is coming up.<eos> Hey, tell Gibbs you need a little vacation.<eos> We all do, Christopher.
Looks like it's just a bunch of song lyrics.<eos> Must be another code.<eos> Maybe operational info on Chen's next attack.<eos> When's Interpol gonna make a move on the yacht he's staying on?<eos> They did.
When were you gonna tell me? !<eos> Tell you what?<eos> Chen.<eos> How long have you known that Chen was working with the CIA?<eos> He didn't.
What?<eos> You think you don't?<eos> You can let the Kai Chens of the world operate as long as it serves your greater good; we cannot.<eos> Our greater good helps a lot of people.<eos> Of course it does and so do you, but just not the way we do.
I knew he was officer material.<eos> I was helping him apply for a commission.<eos> We sent off his application to Officer Candidate School a few weeks before he went missing.<eos> In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?<eos> Only with Baxter, but... so did everyone.
She saw the same potential you did.<eos> He's been posthumously commissioned rank of ensign.<eos> I knew Collins would make a damn good naval officer.<eos> He had a good role model.<eos> Yes, he did.
All right, thank you, guys, very much.<eos> Thanks, guys. Bishop, Bishop, did you see that, with the notepad? Hmm?<eos> He was being nice.<eos> No, he brushed his hand against her when he handed it back.<eos> He did not.
Yeah, mostly by you.<eos> Those sick rumors still floating around?<eos> You can think what you want, but I'm telling you the truth, straight up.<eos> I didn't kill my homies.<eos> Sure you did, straight up.
It's a whole lot of ifs, Ducky.<eos> Why you hit the-the emergency button?<eos> Because I can.<eos> We don't have an emergency, Gibbs.<eos> Or do we?
What's with the long face?<eos> Delilah. She hated it.<eos> She hated the tux.<eos> What? No, no, no.<eos> No, she didn't.
She's also been notified of her brother's death.<eos> And it didn't take a criminal mastermind to break in.<eos> The padlock on the freezer's just flimsy.<eos> How do you steal a body on board of a ship full of people and nobody saw anything?<eos> Maybe someone did.
I am dropping off our revised guest list.<eos> You're in charge of invitations and these need to go out this week.<eos> Wait, 308 guests?<eos> I thought we agreed on a small wedding.<eos> We did.
Trust makes mounted police work possible.<eos> They're flight animals.<eos> They run when they're scared.<eos> How does that work in the big city?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
No way.<eos> Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.<eos> I thought you said this was about revenge.<eos> Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.<eos> Oh, I-I do.
- Keep your comms open.<eos> The list of charges against the Citizen's Liberation Front, which includes both of you, is... why don't we start with arson, assault, conspiracy to defraud the government, possession of a biological weapon, extortion, homicide in the first and second degree.<eos> Right, and treason.<eos> I was told these people wanted to do good.<eos> They did.
No. No.<eos> First I needed to sober up... remember what I'd done and pack my meager belongings.<eos> What you said last night...<eos> You were right. I didn't get what I wanted.<eos> But nobody does.
Come on.<eos> I think you're just trying to get me out of my clothes.<eos> I mean, we are in a hotel room alone.<eos> We do not have to hear this story again. - Yes, yes, we do.<eos> - Yes, we do.
We both know you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.
And my guess is is that you have an awful lot at stake in clearing Deeks' name once and for all.<eos> Somebody is trying to create a problem where there isn't one.<eos> Who is the source of this new evidence you have?<eos> You know what? It occurs to me now you probably know what happened all those years ago.<eos> Maybe more than you did last year.
I'll plot a course.<eos> While you're doing that, I'm gonna hook up the video game Lance and I bought.<eos> Yeah! Let's get this baby set up.<eos> Where can we...<eos> How do...
"Madam, this is not a provocation... but your life does not seem interesting enough that you have to go around the world and tell it."<eos> And he's right, isn't he?<eos> And that was how the tour ended is he said "not a provocation"<eos> and then gave me a big old provocation.<eos> And then he did one nice thing.
I know what that means.<eos> His daddy was in the war.<eos> His daddy wore black boots.<eos> He wants to wear his daddy's boots in his coffin."<eos> And he doesn't.
So I guess... this idea's played out.<eos> Well, ma'am, if I may suggest one other option.<eos> And I do so knowing just how far over the line I might be stepping.<eos> You think that I should come forward about what happened to me.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.
I don't know because I was drugged.<eos> It was all hazy.<eos> How'd you get blood on your hands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Scratch dots his Is and crosses his Ts.<eos> We know that. But a jury won't.<eos> A jury will only see what Scratch wants them to see.<eos> You think they'll convict me? I don't know.<eos> But if they do, 5 years...
Well, if Jane and Kathy were both being coerced, then why did Jane end up dead?<eos> Maybe she got cold feet.<eos> I mean, I can't even imagine having to choose between my best friend's life and my brother's.<eos> But even so, why kill Han?<eos> Maybe she didn't.
[Artie chuckles] He's a terrible person.<eos> So what brings you two here, besides the obvious shoplifting?<eos> That's profiling.<eos> Just 'cause my clothes aren't as nice as some of these other people doesn't mean I'm a thief.<eos> That does.
I mean, the Tom Cruise was so lifelike, you could almost bend over and pat his head.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna submit a spearhead that I found while hiking in a rainforest in Brazil.<eos> It was Honduras.<eos> I think I know my rainforests.<eos> Do you?
Here comes Santa Claus.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, w-who's been drinking my prep?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
You're not done with me yet.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> But you and Barnes needed a time-out, so... excuse me.<eos> Agent Seger, three years ago, you took a leave of absence.<eos> - Yes, I did.
You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
No, no, we don't need to know if he's a hypocrite.<eos> We need to know why Dyad is buying up cosmetic companies.<eos> Great, then pay attention because I have a surveillance kit and an earpiece.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Congressman Lewis is 20 minutes late as usual.<eos> Is there a spot for him on financial services?<eos> Doug, stay where you are.<eos> I thought you said you were telling the CIA to stand down.<eos> I did.
I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called.<eos> They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
So the rest of America can sell.<eos> I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend, we're here at this camp selling ourselves.<eos> Character speaks for itself.<eos> People want a president they can trust.<eos> No, they don't.
No, but they're still being tracked.<eos> Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.<eos> -This interview cannot happen.<eos> -We still have time.<eos> No, we don't.
We will let you know if you are needed.<eos> - Sir... - That was not a request.<eos> Why did you have to go talk to him?<eos> There has to be a way out, Francis.<eos> Does there?
He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.<eos> The information about Macallan is still out there and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.<eos> You've been sabotaging me from the moment you stepped into my house.<eos> You don't care for me very much, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
-Tell the truth!<eos> Preach it!<eos> So... maybe there's no such thing as real religion because it's all just people, and people are bad.<eos> Like Miss Clara, who stole that brooch from the clothing drive.<eos> [congregation gasps] She didn't, baby girl.
What's that? Are you working on your resume?<eos> No, it's my brother's.<eos> I'm trying to help him get a job out here.<eos> Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.<eos> No, it doesn't.
He's not gonna go for it, Mike.<eos> Hey, if Mr. B. thinks I'm gonna fall for it, I am not gonna let him down.<eos> All right.<eos> Who wants to learn a little bit about tools?<eos> Oh, I do. A lot more than Ryan.
More lousy bots?<eos> Stay together, and target them one at a time.<eos> (LAUGHS) Just like bowling.<eos> Who wants to knock down the pin?<eos> I do! (GRUNTS)
Does the false information relate to the Ranger attack?<eos> Has GlobeSpill reported false information?<eos> Really?<eos> Tamsin didn't betray those Rangers.<eos> GlobeSpill did.
- Tamsin!<eos> - Lieutenant, stop, you'll only make things worse for yourself.<eos> - You know who got those Rangers killed?<eos> - GlobeSpill.<eos> GlobeSpill did it, not Lieutenant Dale.
You have a wife and kid?<eos> Yes, and I love them very much, Ryan.<eos> Then let me go.<eos> You got too much to live for, man.<eos> I don't. No.
It's a fancy way of saying "apprentice architect."<eos> Yeah, "Assistant Medical Examiner." It doesn't sound very fancy either.<eos> Is that what you are?<eos> Yeah, but I love it.<eos> I do.
Hang on!<eos> I got you!<eos> You don't want to die. What?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
Check this out.<eos> You'll love this.<eos> Do I look like a Terminator dog?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
The Black Fairy is in Storybrooke.<eos> This is the only hope the Savior has of defeating her.<eos> I wish it were that simple.<eos> There seems to be a curse keeping me from finding my way back home, unless you have some magic that can lift it.<eos> I don't.
How?<eos> It was easy.<eos> We just all shared a tiny bit of your curse.<eos> I take it Emma hasn't told you my secret.<eos> Oh, she did.
I'm gonna have to use the men's room - before we get on the train. - Okay.<eos> Dr. Cooper to Radiology. Dr. Cooper to Radiology.<eos> You're still here.<eos> I thought Louis gave you the location of the Double Eagle.<eos> He did.
I think me and my brothers and sisters realized early on the best way to deal with him was to minimize our feelings as much as possible so as not to call attention to ourselves.<eos> But you do that long enough, and your feelings start to atrophy to the point that you're incapable of having them.<eos> Two things I knew I could feel were ego and adrenaline, so I basically just set out to achieve a bunch of shit to give myself a surge of good feelings.<eos> Like, I got into NYU film school, which was a miracle at that time.<eos> I did so bad on my SATs.
Remarkable recovery you've made for a woman your age.<eos> Women my age either recover or die.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Officer Kalakaua, can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you believe that there's a thin line between love and hate?<eos> Because the way that you were laying into me back there, that was so over the top,<eos> I was like, Wow, maybe she likes me.<eos> I don't.
- It's fine.<eos> How can that be fine?<eos> He's blowing you off.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
I'll do it. This thing goes off, we're both screwed anyway.<eos> Besides, you know I'm a control freak.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you.<eos> You want to do it, you do it.<eos> Do me a favor.
Your Internet must have gone kaput during the storm.<eos> That's why you cut out.<eos> It's nice to meet you, but you have to go.<eos> We have a major problem right now.<eos> Yeah, you do.
David, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> I know you're terrified, but they know what they're doing.<eos> No, I'm sure they do.<eos> You just have no idea what it's like to have a child that you worry about every second of every day.<eos> Actually, I do.
Help!<eos> Voice-over: Getting more and more intense.<eos> Got to fall deeper in to beat them.<eos> I've lost friends before, but not like this, Not in a box where I have no control.<eos> Or do I?
So 14. Ok, we can do this.<eos> You haven't asked me how I'm doing.<eos> Every time I talk to these Agents, It's the first thing they want to know.<eos> I guess it's just the natural thing to ask.<eos> But you didn't.
You haven't asked me how I'm doing.<eos> Every time I talk to these Agents, It's the first thing they want to know.<eos> I guess it's just the natural thing to ask.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
What about us?<eos> I mean, we can't just sit around here doing nothing.<eos> Well, we won't be.<eos> We have plenty to do to keep us busy.<eos> We do?
Oh.<eos> What is it?<eos> Granger.<eos> There's been a shooting at the hospital. I thought he had 24-hour protection.<eos> He did.
Let me do it.<eos> Well, how old is your dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, why don't you know?<eos> Just don't.
You evidently caught him sneaking back in.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> Mangled his arm good.<eos> - He said you had a gun.<eos> - I did, yeah.
She's not well.<eos> I don't know what I can possibly tell you that I haven't already.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, we were just wondering... and I know we've asked before... but we still wonder whether it's possible that either you left the key in the ignition...<eos> Of course I didn't.
♪ Who has a lap for babay ♪ [moans] Oh.<eos> [Buckley] Mom, what are you doing?<eos> You have to remember, that was months ago.<eos> Honestly, Jacqueline, you didn't even get on our gaydar, which is a machine we have here at Bravo...<eos> We do.
"you know what-ing" me while we were in the "you know where"?<eos> Okay, when you meet Alex Trebek, don't get freaked out that he has legs.<eos> What?<eos> No, I know people have legs.<eos> Lieutenant Dan doesn't.
Fasciolaria trapezium.<eos> [sighs] Russ, this is still inside you.<eos> I know. Because my brothers...<eos> No, I mean, that kid in the attic is a big part of who you are, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> Well, then the question is, why?<eos> Sears was connected... to Alicia's daughter's murder, but did they ever find the actual killer?<eos> No.<eos> No, we did not.
Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?<eos> How does this fit in to their endgame?<eos> Could just be a terrorist attack.<eos> - And we don't know it was them.<eos> - Yes, we do.
People will hide their votes until the last minute.<eos> So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.<eos> And how do we do that?<eos> The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.<eos> No, but I do.
The rest is up to me.<eos> And with this veto, President Haas sends a clear message to the American people.<eos> "You're on your own."<eos> Now, the rich are safe in their mansions and their gated communities, but common, everyday Americans are left to fend for themselves, unsure of when the next jihadist will strike.<eos> And when they do...
No.<eos> How do I put them on?<eos> Check the Internet?<eos> Did you know that originally condoms were made out of leather?<eos> I did not.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. No more special treatment for you, buddy.<eos> Don't worry, ben.<eos> She has no power over us.<eos> Oh, i don't?
Are you feeling dizzy?<eos> Any nausea?<eos> Only when I drink tequila.<eos> I'm trying to establish whether or not you have a concussion.<eos> I don't.
See over there?<eos> Only Kona has that kind of detail on the label.<eos> Well, clearly, I am in the presence of a craft beer savant. Hey, yo.<eos> We got something?<eos> Oh, we sure do.
And you are?<eos> Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type.<eos> Oh. Or you and I do.
He cheat on you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You cheat on him?<eos> - What did he tell you?<eos> - Not as much as you just did.
- That was incredible.<eos> Incredible. Wow.<eos> Made that jump with room to spare.<eos> I thought he would have gone for the bonus, but he's playing it safe.<eos> Doing good, Ryan!
Who is this?<eos> My goodness.<eos> This is my girl.<eos> I tell ya, staffers just keep getting younger and younger,<eos> - don't they?
This is an interesting theory.<eos> Why don't you bring it up?<eos> You guys, we've been at this for hours and still no answers.<eos> Well, Nimah has one.<eos> No, I don't.
Already on it.<eos> Plan trade data coming in.<eos> Alex, I've put us on closed comms.<eos> I got an answer from Keyes about the recruit Leon mentioned who died in the car crash.<eos> They didn't.
Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
This is all too exposed.<eos> You must know my friend Kate.<eos> Should've told you about Janet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
He's a con artist.<eos> He was lying.<eos> What if he wasn't?<eos> Look, she chose this life, all right?<eos> Patrick didn't.
No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Your dad is in the next room.<eos> By law, I have to let your lawyer up here unless you tell me not to, or you can sign this waiver and just talk to me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Sarah, you could've asked me for a lawyer at any time,<eos> - but you didn't.
That's fact.<eos> There's no "belief" involved.<eos> But that's not what you're asking.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I got to say, some days I wish I didn't have a sister.<eos> Oh...<eos> - What? - Nothing.<eos> Oh, I thought you asked me what was going on with my sister.<eos> I did not.
But don't worry, he'll be fine.<eos> He just needs to wear this brace for a while - to correct it.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> Now, does he have any school pictures coming up?<eos> Yeah, he actually does.
Did he do that?<eos> Yes, officer.<eos> He did.<eos> Do you have a gun?<eos> I do.
He's a murderer.<eos> So?<eos> That's why I told you he was dead.<eos> I want to see him.<eos> You don't.
[Ángeles] If you'll excuse me.<eos> Talk to her. Stop her from telling anyone else.<eos> I'm sorry you had to lie again because of me.<eos> -I don't care about that.<eos> -Well, I do.
You didn't see anything.<eos> You made it up.<eos> She didn't make it up, Ángeles.<eos> She didn't see him with someone else.<eos> I did.
No one can live life with their back turned to reality...<eos> -Let's talk, Ángeles!<eos> -[Alba] ...as much as they may want to.<eos> -I don't want to talk.<eos> -Well, I do!
Cops!<eos> That's the house!<eos> Hold on, Peter, we can't go in there.<eos> We got to wait for backup.<eos> The hell we do!
I've got to walk around in my life not knowing which three bitches I've got to kill.<eos> This actor, he wanted to go out of the house all the time.<eos> "Let's dress sexy and get out of the house."<eos> I was, like, "I can be sexy, if you like nights in and some opinions."<eos> He did not.
The guest list looked like the Panama Papers.<eos> It was just, like, very...<eos> And in this country, I've noticed that posh people think that only other posh people are on their level and care about them.<eos> See, we don't even have class in Canada.<eos> We genuinely don't, right?
Oh, a disappointing end for Ivan Zepeda.<eos> Next up is César Curti from Brazil.<eos> And let's see if he can make an all-Brazil final a reality.<eos> Does he have enough speed? Does he have enough speed?<eos> - He does!
Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> You know he's going for that Point Thruster.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Heeyong Park don't mess around.<eos> - No, he doesn't!
I'm Latina. I don't vote.<eos> We don't vote!<eos> We don't vote!<eos> Not unless it's American Idol or The Voice, right? We don't do it!<eos> We don't do it.
I was in that tank for ten years.<eos> Then you don't know your own expiration date.<eos> Sucks for you.<eos> Why would the Shepherds put the bio-drive in him?<eos> We didn't, all right?
Call.<eos> Find out.<eos> He died. The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Well, I couldn't find anything inside.<eos> If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay. - Mm. Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.
Go on!<eos> And to perfect stitching, we need to fully map the human brain, right?<eos> And now that Cameron has me piloting the stitches...<eos> Then we can spend a little more time in the regions that we need to map.<eos> - Okay, except that we don't...
And to perfect stitching, we need to fully map the human brain, right?<eos> And now that Cameron has me piloting the stitches...<eos> Then we can spend a little more time in the regions that we need to map.<eos> - Okay, except that we don't...<eos> - Yes, we do.
Get an ambulance!<eos> Stand back, sir.<eos> Hey, hey! What did you have to tell me?<eos> They stopped looking for... ffor me.<eos> Who did?
He's sitting right there on his laptop, across from the woman scanning tickets.<eos> He never gets on the plane.<eos> That's it.<eos> I couldn't figure out how they were able to hack the airline's secured server.<eos> They didn't.
We walk to the garage together for safety.<eos> This is why he called you in?<eos> Well, that and the fact that someone tried to kill him last night.<eos> Tried to kill him?<eos> Who did?
It's free.<eos> And I'm very good.<eos> I imagine you're fantastic, but I'm-I'm good, thank you.<eos> We do have an hour to kill.<eos> We do.
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.<eos> Special Agent Chegwidden.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Do you know a man named Yaniv Kornberg?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
And you?<eos> Next time you try to ditch somebody, make sure they can't catch an Uber.<eos> Son of a bitch stole my line.<eos> You know we could've shot you, right?<eos> But you didn't.
Saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
No, what is wrong with you?<eos> Aha, you are upset.<eos> I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.<eos> Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.<eos> It doesn't? No.
Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job.<eos> Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.<eos> Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking for a new head of sales at my company.<eos> And we don't sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you'll be telling is we print on recycled paper.<eos> We don't.
Okay.<eos> Okay, that's fine.<eos> I'll go make us some chambourgulon.<eos> [groaning] [yelps cheerfully]<eos> Hey, slugger, how you doing?
That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
He said take a metric ton or nothing.<eos> I understand it put us in danger.<eos> So why'd you do it?<eos> Because now you have a choice.<eos> With nothing, you don't.
Whatever happened to the Crocodile?<eos> The Federales ran him out of the country.<eos> I got into this life so you wouldn't have to come home and see your mother and father hanging from a tree.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You do.
Well, hey there, Cal.<eos> I thought you were headed back to Berkeley.<eos> Well, I couldn't leave without saying goodbye to mi familia.<eos> Do you know that word... "goodbye"?<eos> No, you don't.
Hutner has this amazing mentoring program, where they pair up students with working designers.<eos> And Bayard has this top-notch business program.<eos> You could learn how to be an omnipreneur.<eos> You guys don't think I'm gonna get in to Rafferty.<eos> - No, no, of course we do.
Jason's got to get in there and build on the friendship.<eos> That's not exactly what I told him.<eos> You didn't tell him<eos> - to fight for her?<eos> - Well, he did.
There are extenuating circumstances.<eos> Know how many times a day I hear that?<eos> I give in to him, the other will come crying.<eos> SSA Reid has rights.<eos> He sure does.
Will they pull the plug on this operation?<eos> They wouldn't do that.<eos> We just need a new angle, a new plan.<eos> What we need is to admit we screwed up.<eos> We didn't.
He took the phones.<eos> - What are those?<eos> - Kamikazes.<eos> Well, aren't you guys gonna have one?<eos> We just did.
Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
Well, tell him Ka-hey for me.<eos> Will do.<eos> You still have a thing for her, huh?<eos> Who says I have a thing for her?<eos> Who doesn't?
- Okay.<eos> We asked the cops for blood samples.<eos> Uh, closed cases, so we could...<eos> Create a control group to see if your technique actually worked.<eos> And it did.
These guys are not gonna stop until they find you.<eos> And besides, if you leave now, you won't be able to finish your work.<eos> Oh, my work?<eos> Yeah, who cares about my work?<eos> I do.
I picked up the phone, he was gone. You know?<eos> I-I don't know what to say.<eos> I had to trace the call to find his motel room.<eos> You let your only possible witness get snatched from underneath your nose, and you still think I should keep you on this case?<eos> I do.
What? I plugged a thing into a thing.<eos> I don't mean that specifically.<eos> In general, good job.<eos> You didn't have to, um...<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
Come on. You're a good cop.<eos> I'm a good cop? Now I'm a good cop?<eos> You didn't want me around in the first place.<eos> I'm a good cop. You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Which is not my problem. You would be well advised<eos> - not to try and make it...<eos> - Denny, don't you want to kn...<eos> Lieutenant. don't you wanna know what happened?<eos> Already do.
Look, Lavar Spann is the bigger catch.<eos> He brainwashed and recruited these kids. He orchestrated these robberies.<eos> We've been through this, Sergeant.<eos> - You don't have anything on...<eos> - Yes, we do.
They're more like a franchise.<eos> Perv Hunters have dropped ambush videos in Winnipeg, Montreal, Vancouver.<eos> The first one hit the States in Chicago last month.<eos> Yeah, but burning people alive? That's not their MO.<eos> They do public shaming videos,
Oh, sorry.<eos> I got lost on the way to the loo.<eos> I'll help you find your way back.<eos> Liam, you have a visitor in the lobby.<eos> I do?
Maybe it got caught on my clothes, fell into the briefcase.<eos> That's before I knew how far you were willing to go.<eos> Just how far did you go, Grace?<eos> - Right now, that doesn't matter.<eos> - It does to me.
Just smart tech designed to prevent espionage.<eos> You're wasting time...<eos> Time you don't have.<eos> - You have the wrong man!<eos> - Do I? !
I can't go back to the Pentagon without proof the EmDrive works.<eos> Okay, follow me.<eos> You want proof?<eos> You want answers?<eos> Yes, I do.
We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
Karissa, I can't raise Liam or Nelson on the phone.<eos> Tracking them.<eos> Their signals are... dead.<eos> When did they check in at the offsite facility?<eos> They didn't.
Give it to me.<eos> Now, you'll have 4 hours. Not yet.<eos> You have to wait till the second hand comes around.<eos> You want to give me a hint before we start? Do I look like a girl that gives hints?<eos> Actually you do.
Why didn't you go?<eos> Truthfully, I got distracted.<eos> I was trying to figure out a way to help my mom.<eos> She didn't have time.<eos> Morgan, Savannah, and little Bobby did.
Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.
If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.
It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.<eos> She does.
I must remember...<eos> My name is Lin Kai.<eos> I'm a drug trafficker.<eos> Who wants to play?<eos> I do, Father!
For my children<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> I love you, with all my heart.<eos> You must have so many questions.<eos> So do I.
What are we going to do?<eos> -We have to bust them out. -[Zyan] How?<eos> He doesn't give out names, streets, or anything.<eos> [Ovni] I can check if he recorded the video with the location function on, but... [keyboard clicking]<eos> -No. No, he didn't.
What if she talks?<eos> They'll nab us.<eos> No, Dolores won't tell them anything.<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
-I don't want to leave.<eos> -Emiliano.<eos> I need you to try and remember.<eos> Do you remember where your mom and sister went after the Independence Day ceremony last year?<eos> No, Grandpa, I don't.
I thought I was doing the right thing... but they used me.<eos> Just like they used Diego.<eos> Like they used you.<eos> The CIA also assassinates presidents and kidnaps teenagers?<eos> Or do the cartels do it for them?
I think you have an admirable drive for excellence.<eos> Oh. God, I'm just as bad as they are.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I have to go back to my desk.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I'm not one of your little people.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> And I do want to see paystubs.<eos> Of course you do.
What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?<eos> It's not important.<eos> I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> I do.
It doesn't much matter.<eos> Roarke has his 38 states.<eos> Still, I wrote a hell of a barnburner for the New York delegation to give during floor debate.<eos> Why does this feel like a double date all of a sudden?<eos> My God. It does!
So many people!<eos> This is awesome.<eos> Zahid's my friend. Paige is just a girl from school.<eos> Come on in. You know the drill.<eos> I certainly do.
We did that as an icebreaker at Sam's camp last summer and, boy, were there some red faces.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ay, yai, yai. These kids are a pain in the ass. Did we make enough food?<eos> You are adorable.<eos> Yes, we did.
Oh, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Meatball.<eos> Yeah. I never spoke with him, but he had a kind face.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Best of friends.<eos> Seeing my mom and sister make up: Funniest shit ever.<eos> Just seeing my mom cry.<eos> "I just want you to know that... I didn't think you gave your pekpek away to everybody."<eos> "Well, I didn't, Mom.
Wait. We can't do this.<eos> We have to keep this room clear for the Villanueva wedding.<eos> We're in the middle of a hurricane.<eos> Rafael was very clear. He promised Jane.<eos> Of course he did.
Mmm. Oh, yeah.<eos> Not one student showed up to school just because a pack of ferocious, masterless dogs are roaming the playground.<eos> Ow! Damn it!<eos> I thought we sent Willie out there to deal with them.<eos> I did.
You don't have to do it.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> You never have to do anything because you can kill yourself.<eos> If they send you a letter from Motor Vehicles, come in and:<eos> "No, I don't.
I took her to the vet. I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
Wait. When I got pistol-whipped, I was talking to an English guy.<eos> We don't have an English guy.<eos> I... you have to remember me!<eos> Uh, actually, I don't.<eos> And also, I don't, so...
Congratulations, I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> Well, now...<eos> I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
To do something I should have done a long time ago.<eos> Once kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.<eos> Cooper tried to shut it down.<eos> Harold has to work within the system.<eos> Henry Prescott does not.
How did that work?<eos> It worked fine.<eos> Here, you contribute, you're in.<eos> - Everybody loved him.<eos> - Well, somebody didn't.
- I know the point you're making.<eos> Her daughter and her pals left the bones on the beach.<eos> Until I'm convinced they know nothing about the heart, D.S. Redford is compromised.<eos> Plus, you fancy her.<eos> No, I don't.
No.<eos> You're here for one reason:<eos> Your ability to communicate with the animal kingdom.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Why in the world did you do this?
Okay.<eos> Dad.<eos> I miss home.<eos> I know.<eos> I do, too.
She starts crying and runs out.<eos> I was like, "No!<eos> She's going to tell Dad."<eos> Let's focus on what's important here.<eos> But she didn't.
I'm a scaredy-cat.<eos> We can speak two languages.<eos> We can speak at home and outside.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> I didn't.
And I was like, "No, I have my bike."<eos> And I just biked home and played Mario Kart.<eos> That's the nicest I've ever been dressed, playing Mario Kart.<eos> I wish I had said, "Fuck that, I'm going to the dance."<eos> I didn't.
And I don't know why...<eos> I get to Kaiser and run upstairs.<eos> My mom and my sisters are crying.<eos> My sister looks at me, she's like, "They don't know what you did.<eos> I do."
She was way out there?<eos> She's got mean dogs.<eos> LAPD was canvassing for witnesses, so far nothing.<eos> He didn't just fall from the sky.<eos> Or did he?
It's nice to meet you.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Cameron didn't tell me your name.<eos> Of course he didn't.
The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
We can't even launch the thing. The Russians are just gonna shoot it out of the sky.<eos> The EmDrive will take weeks to propel the gravity tractor up to that asteroid.<eos> We need to work fast and hope that the government ends this geopolitical quagmire in time.<eos> Since when do you have faith in the government?<eos> I don't.
It's OK.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> - You have a child now.<eos> - I do.
No fucking intermission!<eos> They ruin the flow of the show.<eos> Would you stop the Super Bowl halfway through to do a bunch of bullshit?<eos> You are not leaving to go to the bathroom.<eos> [moans softly] OK, I don't...
With social security cards and everything.<eos> Yeah. We drink wine.<eos> And I'm, like, getting really into amber beers, like Schleinbach.<eos> I like to curl up with a good book.<eos> - Oh, yes. - We all do, we all do.
You know what else isn't in there?<eos> The penguin necklace you got me.<eos> I lost it, at some point, last Tuesday, and I really, really miss it.<eos> And I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to hurt your feelings.<eos> But now I do!
Pirate stuff. It is just the best!<eos> There is no way I am going to choose the Evil Queen.<eos> I heard you say "choose the Evil Queen." So be it.<eos> No!<eos> I did not.
I was maimed and beaten in every way imaginable.<eos> Oh, I didn't say fun for you.<eos> Ah-ha! Just as Dulcinea's power came from her mirror, your power comes from your pen.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, no, it doesn't.
- Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, yeah, but if we go to trial, we have to establish motive.<eos> And so far...<eos> There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.
Do people become tougher if they have sex?<eos> I guess some people get tougher.<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Do people get tougher or not?<eos> No, they don't.
Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
If you have an idea for your next work, could you tell us about it?<eos> Well, as usual, I will write the kind of work that I'm capable of.<eos> It's time for our final question.<eos> Does anyone else have a question?<eos> I do. I do.
Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing.<eos> Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
Do I need a reason to fall in love?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hug me tight.<eos> Why are you doing this, Hitomi?<eos> Just do it.
Stupid Miles!<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> But, you know, it's not the end of the world.<eos> Mom had a boyfriend when I first met her.<eos> She did?
When will I be old enough?<eos> When your father decides you are.<eos> Mother?<eos> I prayed for my big brother to get better.<eos> And he did.
But the answers are the answers for a man.<eos> That is one bridge I cannot build.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> But God can, and we must trust him.<eos> I do.
Do you really wanna put yourself through this again?<eos> It's a world that doesn't wanna know you.<eos> So what's new?<eos> Are you trying to tell me you never had a dream when you were a kid, Dad?<eos> Course I did.
At least I'm wearing a jacket.<eos> This is my jacket, pal.<eos> Maybe you should wear one, too.<eos> - Drinking doesn't agree with me.<eos> - Neither does ski-jumping.
No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
They took that back.<eos> - Who did?<eos> - President did. There's a new president now name of Johnson.<eos> So who gets all of this?<eos> He does.
I don't know where to go.<eos> Rebs burned my first farm.<eos> Sherman burned my second.<eos> Guess they agree on that.<eos> Yeah, they do.
We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up north, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up north.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, your honor.
Terrorist!<eos> God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell?<eos> We do, Claire.
God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell?<eos> We do, Claire.<eos> Of course we do.
We didn't hang out or anything.<eos> But I knew who you were.<eos> You did?<eos> Sure.<eos> Everybody did.
I see.<eos> I'm getting older, cheeky...<eos> And very impatient of lost years.<eos> I know the medals are ridiculous.<eos> I do.
But were you to succeed, such an undertaking could earn you soldierly decoration and even reclaim your family name.<eos> You know, we knew your father.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did not.
It.<eos> When he... hurts me.<eos> Oh. I like it.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
Not only is she a master of the female arts but the deadly as well.<eos> I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that is thus accomplished.<eos> Nor I, I'm sure.<eos> Then, Mr. Darcy, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.<eos> I do.
No honor among thieves, eh?<eos> But he tangled with a metahuman and lived to tell about it.<eos> And have you heard of the pyro kinetic homeboy?<eos> How'd you catch him?<eos> We didn't.
Call'em.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug-induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> My dumbass didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
Jesus, Bridget.<eos> I can still remember when you bought it.<eos> That was several decades ago.<eos> Sustainability dates say nothing.<eos> Do you?
- No,no.<eos> - Yeah, we got a big problem.<eos> Your friend, here, really insulted my friend and he needs to apologize.<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> He doesn't.
I remember that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So how come I'm okay?<eos> Nothing got me then.<eos> Maybe it did.
I understand completely.<eos> It just seems you've got quite a few resources here.<eos> Wow, is that a 50 cal...<eos> Yeah, that's a 50 cal.<eos> Um, why not do it yourself?
I made sure I had Zima for that little pain in the ass.<eos> Man, I so hate all of this.<eos> There are times when I really wanna put a gun in my mouth.<eos> Have you had a job like that, americano?<eos> Actually, I did.
I submitted you, you nutty genius.<eos> You and your marvelous book.<eos> I would've told you earlier, but I was afraid they would reject you.<eos> And there was a very strong possibility of that.<eos> But they didn't.
You're gonna take this life-sucking, puberty-fucking tumor out of my brain through my nose?<eos> Can we go now?<eos> But why couldn't you tell your best friends that you're a weirdo?<eos> - You don't have to answer that. - Why?<eos> Because you just did!
I've buried two children, and now I'm burying my husband.<eos> You know, I was jealous. Of that dress you wore in Vienna.<eos> I know that it's hard to see it right now, but you have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> You do!
I know that it's hard to see it right now, but you have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> You do!<eos> That's a terrible, terrible thing to say.<eos> But you do.
You all set?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> This is Manny.<eos> How we doing?
No it's not. It's a gamble.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> But, look, if there was a time to roll the dice, this is it.<eos> I mean, you just don't know how to give up.<eos> No, I do.
What's your plan, Lu?<eos> Lie in the grass?<eos> I mean, with your life.<eos> Did you have a plan?<eos> Yes, of course I did.
I have to take these... These are just...<eos> This is interesting.<eos> A Rioja, Reserva Especial.<eos> - You speak Spanish?<eos> - No, I don't. Actually, no.
Thanks, Poppy.<eos> Thanks to all of you!<eos> Even you, I guess.<eos> I just never thought something like that could happen to me.<eos> And it just did!
- Yeah, I'm Frank.<eos> - The fault is yours, then, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
Oh, yeah, yeah, he did. They truly are monsters.<eos> Those monsters are gonna kill Brenda.<eos> She's somewhere out there in a cart.<eos> I tried to warn everyone, they didn't believe me!<eos> Of course they didn't.
And then he met Tom.<eos> I can't let him go.<eos> Aline, go home to your family.<eos> They need you.<eos> Tom doesn't.
Let's have some fun.<eos> - I can't.<eos> They're working girls, Max.<eos> It doesn't count.<eos> Yes, Tom, it does.
You don't have to square up on me.<eos> You come over here and blame us for them fools, huh, puto?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> That's exactly what you said, motherfucker.<eos> I didn't.
Find your mother.<eos> Sit down, Michael.<eos> Have some tea.<eos> We have much to discuss.<eos> We do?
Put him in a comfy cell? They're not.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> No, I didn't know him.<eos> But Marcus sure did.
I like you, Ray.<eos> I feel really bad for what they did to you.<eos> I don't need to look a gift horse up the ass to know there's shit in there.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> We do.
Hello, Hollywood.<eos> - Mike!<eos> - What's the word, Dale ? !<eos> - What do you know?<eos> We done? - Not much.
Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you? I...<eos> - I know what this is about.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
But not quite where I...<eos> Oh, I think I found my favorite.<eos> Oh, yeah, my parents love that one, too.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - No, they don't.
Oh, yeah, my parents love that one, too.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> That's just... No, they're very conservative.<eos> No. They don't.
So, where are you staying?<eos> At a motel in Pasadena.<eos> By yourself?<eos> What do your parents think about that?<eos> They don't really.
So I could wear a ponytail.<eos> Didn't it hurt?<eos> Anything worth having hurts a little.<eos> Besides, nobody likes the way they look.<eos> I do.

Yes, we did.<eos> Right. Yeah.<eos> ♪ Mighty, Mighty Eagle ♪<eos> ♪ Rescue me ♪<eos> Now, you do the second verse.
Get to the castle.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> Over here! Me!<eos> Me!<eos> Me! I do! Hey!
I was about to fire the entire office.<eos> Anyway, when I was over there, I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.<eos> Did you know his uncle works at the Albanian defense ministry?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Well, he does.
- Hey! - Hey!<eos> I'm getting nothing but static, sir.<eos> It's that antenna.<eos> I thought you had it looked at.<eos> I did.
Sorry.<eos> Not the reaction you usually get, I'm sure.<eos> Well, it's early days.<eos> You still have options.<eos> No, I don't.
- Three years ago.<eos> Some sort of horse riding accident.<eos> So, the time of death fits.<eos> If she had the boy within two weeks of her death...<eos> She didn't.
It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Tell him to put them back on.<eos> - Mac, put the goggles back on.<eos> Mac, do it now.
Why they look like people.<eos> I can't tell you how they did this.<eos> What I can tell you... is that someone made them.<eos> If someone made them, they don't escape the laws of the world.<eos> Nothing does.
Nothing is free anymore.<eos> Even freedom isn't free.<eos> It used to be.<eos> But now everybody wants your PIN number.<eos> Sure they do, old girl.
Even freedom isn't free.<eos> It used to be.<eos> But now everybody wants your PIN number.<eos> Sure they do, old girl.<eos> Sure they do.
Now here I am.<eos> Just fat and old and hated... and nothing.<eos> I'm getting in.<eos> Darling, I know you think I don't know who I am and what I've done.<eos> But I do, darling, I do.
Yes. Um...<eos> These are all the files you wanted.<eos> I cross-referenced them by year, and alphabetically, so...<eos> It must have taken you all night.<eos> It sure did.
Those two bottles of insulin.<eos> You know, I just thought that you would appreciate me treating you like an adult, right?<eos> So, here's what I got.<eos> You administer your own accidental insulin overdose, and just... Die.<eos> But do it with dignity.
Ordered his son, Little Tony, to kill Francis.<eos> Kid fucked it up.<eos> Francis ran, became a federal informant in return for protective custody.<eos> Could have turned my career around if only I'd listened.<eos> I didn't.
- What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
Do not know if I want to get stuck in the sky and never see the sea and the forest again.<eos> You do not see them if you are in heaven.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Do not know.<eos> But you do not.
I don't wanna be more!<eos> I like who I am.<eos> You don't even know who you are.<eos> What do you...?<eos> Of course I do.
I don't think he did it for the money, if you know what I mean.<eos> He stole money from us, and then he stole half of it again from you.<eos> I think you got it wrong.<eos> You'll never understand this, Gage, but Decker could have taken it all.<eos> He didn't.
Three hearts?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't have three hearts.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't!
And when you do that, you'll be home.<eos> Dad.<eos> Does this mean we have to say goodbye to Dory?<eos> Yes, Nemo.<eos> We do.
Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
Right, Raymond?<eos> Yes,...<eos> Dear Simon, you said the home is for the, Who have no one to love them.<eos> You were wrong. We have not forgotten you.<eos> And the others do not.
- Very good.<eos> - We have already met.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Of course we know.<eos> Yes, we do.
I do not want to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> I do not want to do what I'm forced to do.<eos> I do not force you to do anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
Well, are you some kind of architect or...<eos> - Well, funnily enough...<eos> - Look at you!<eos> Oh, I guess that you're a man who knows his way around a hammer, too.<eos> I do.
There's no one else here.<eos> I was screaming for help for hours.<eos> Dana, we have been down here the whole time, and we did not hear a thing. Honest to God.<eos> We didn't hear a thing, Mommy.<eos> We didn't.
Good!<eos> How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?<eos> Jeff must've mentioned it.<eos> Right, Jeff?<eos> - No. No, he didn't.
Yeah, so?<eos> So, he can navigate the bazaars of Marrakesh, but he gets "lost upstairs" looking for a bathroom?<eos> Karen, let me tell you something I learned years ago.<eos> When people have to poop, they get embarrassed.<eos> As do I, sometimes.
It's just that I specified that we...<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, I'm so sorry.<eos> Did I do something wrong?
Should you really be wiping my ass for $9 an hour?<eos> Sounds like you and Trevor had quite a night last night.<eos> - Yeah, sorry about...<eos> - I specifically warned you about the nature of your relationship, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did, but...
To Iraq, I mean.<eos> I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.
I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But if you did.
So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But if you did.<eos> - But I don't.
- I'm just saying.<eos> - Shut!<eos> Do you wish we had a choice, is that what you're asking?<eos> Well...<eos> We don't, Sergeant.
Talk is cheap.<eos> But money screams.<eos> This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.<eos> I think we should all fear for it.<eos> I do, Dave.
But it's just...<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> It's just so sad.<eos> We thought you kind of liked us.<eos> But I do.

Do you think you could find your own way out?<eos> Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Roennfeldt.<eos> Good to see a smile, girlie.<eos> I know you've been sad. You missed your old life.<eos> I do.
He says, "Do you have someone for me yet?"<eos> He wants to make an example of someone.<eos> He doesn't care who.<eos> No.<eos> He does.
Sometimes.<eos> You're not gonna tell my parents, are you?<eos> They're very worried about you, Cassie.<eos> They care for you deeply.<eos> No they don't.
Then we look elsewhere.<eos> Does that elsewhere include the possibility of demonic attack?<eos> Father, if I may be frank, the church's obsession with demons and spirits is what may have planted the idea in Cassie's head to begin with.<eos> -So you don't believe in demons?<eos> -No, father, I don't.
How about a horse?<eos> Mary Beth was the rider.<eos> A horse would only remind me of her.<eos> You like to fish.<eos> Not enough to do it every goddamn day.
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer stay with you till your father arrives. - All right?<eos> - Okay. Didn't happen to have your surveillance cameras on this morning, did you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, so you have the robbery on video.<eos> Of course we do.
Thank you much.<eos> Let's go get a room.<eos> Welcome to the Comanche 66.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> We do not.
Got an old hardware store that charges twice what Home Depot does, one restaurant with a rattlesnake for a waitress.<eos> I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?<eos> People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years, but they don't do it no more.<eos> Well, maybe your people did.
To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.<eos> And, in answer to your question, yes... apart from a few technological upgrades, I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.<eos> The original.<eos> The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.<eos> Of course he did.
Maybe I was a little too hard on her.<eos> She just... You know, we just weren't a good match.<eos> Doesn't mean you walk out, though.<eos> You don't let a person wonder, even if she hated me.<eos> She didn't.
Okay, well, we knew that.<eos> He's your son?<eos> Adopted.<eos> Do you know the birth father?<eos> Yes, I do.
Ma, behave.<eos> I said nothing.<eos> The wine was asking.<eos> Ask your heart.<eos> I do.
Pour him a double.<eos> You know, at the Battle of Sichuan, I did hire out to those raiders.<eos> But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.<eos> I know that.<eos> Always did.
Never is.<eos> It's easy to say that the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly do they?<eos> No. They don't.
Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?<eos> How you doing, Rose?<eos> Mr. Bono, how you doing?
I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.<eos> Go on. I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!<eos> Yeah, he did!
Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!<eos> I'm sorry, we can only serve Premier Badge holders.<eos> Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?<eos> Well, there's our relaxed dining area, and there are stalls outside.<eos> The Pig in a Poke does a nice hog roast in a bun with apple sauce.
Just a few minutes more.<eos> So, um... Patrick wants to meet you.<eos> Running man?<eos> Why? I think he wants to know who I'm spending all these late nights with.<eos> My parents do, too.
If you want me to.<eos> Ah! Lads, welcome.<eos> Bernard Clark.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...
Why not?<eos> Because Mom's at work and you're fresh out of prison.<eos> Okay, white-collar crime doesn't count!<eos> Yes, it does!<eos> No, it does not. It does not.
Buzzworthy.<eos> Absolutely, yeah.<eos> I mean, they're raving.<eos> - I have to go get coffee.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
My sweet Tito.<eos> Fucking Tito.<eos> Mom, we can't let her sleep on the street.<eos> Do you really not have anywhere to go?<eos> No. I don't.
We don't need to brush our teeth today.<eos> Our teeth are fine.<eos> You need to wipe some of that off your face.<eos> You know it dries darker?<eos> - No, does it?
I'm all in.<eos> Dana, I quit.<eos> I'm gonna start my own business, okay?<eos> - I have my own business.<eos> - Yes, she does.
That you can hear its roar at night.<eos> They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.
They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.<eos> I sure did.
You need help.<eos> You need Pete.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you just see that?<eos> I sure did.
Well, that's just crazy talk.<eos> Who else is gonna guard this place after I'm gone?<eos> From what? The wolves?<eos> Maybe you're sitting up there waiting for something that's never coming back.<eos> What if they do, Fleet?
What's up, double trouble?<eos> Terry.<eos> Cousin of the bride. Get at me later, we'll make a Terry sandwich.<eos> Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.<eos> - Everybody does.
Cousin of the bride. Get at me later, we'll make a Terry sandwich.<eos> Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.<eos> - Everybody does.<eos> - No.<eos> Not everyone does.
Why? Are you?<eos> Well...<eos> You know, you think that every moment is going to feel... Warm and glowy... And absolutely magical.<eos> But, then, some stuff happens.<eos> - Sure does. - Yeah.
I do not know if she is still alive. My parents may see the corpse.<eos> You will not see her body.<eos> That's part of the plan.<eos> Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.<eos> - I do.
- Tell me.<eos> I trust the man behind the plan and the plan.<eos> OK.<eos> You trust the plan.<eos> I do.
No, no way.<eos> My father has made it very clear.<eos> The is only for emergencies.<eos> Huffy, consider your virginity quiet as an emergency.<eos> I do.
- Do not hide again in the dryer!<eos> - I'll eat you alive!<eos> - Crap!<eos> - I can reprogram.<eos> - I do it.
Come on, lie down, sleep now.<eos> I spread yourself to yet.<eos> So. And now go to sleep.<eos> That has never been my dad.<eos> That he did constantly.
You just encrypted a drive for Troy.<eos> Troy? I-It doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I don't know any Troy.<eos> It don't ring a bell?<eos> No, it does not.
You just admitted to about four or five crimes right there.<eos> That's Fifth Amendment. A couple of days ago, I may have taken some money from his account and put it into mine.<eos> - You "may have"?<eos> - I didn't think he'd notice.<eos> - Apparently, he did.
You're just helping out a guy.<eos> A guy who went to the Rock for stealing something.<eos> We're three of a kind.<eos> What do you mean, my wife picked her up?<eos> She did.
How about that?<eos> Hey, Jacob, didn't Coach Gordan say this afternoon that we weren't supposed to have girls upstairs?<eos> He said something about that, didn't he?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
- What the fuck is the gap method?<eos> - You're looking at it, Plum.<eos> Like you were saying, most people lose at this point not because they get shot, but because they get overrun.<eos> But I discovered that they actually don't shoot you from the absolute front row.<eos> - Shit, they don't?
I drink a fucking screwdriver!<eos> Everybody I know drinks a fucking screwdriver.<eos> You know who drinks a screwdriver?<eos> - My little sister drinks a screwdriver too.<eos> - Really? Does she?
- Jakarta'.!<eos> Indonesia.<eos> Edward, what would you think... of me renting a car through the hotel?<eos> Do you have an international driver's license?<eos> No, I don't.
- Where did you get it?<eos> - I would rather not say.<eos> What, you think you might endanger your source?<eos> - Oh, you think that's funny?<eos> - I do, yeah.
You were choosing between very different products... with different heritages, sensibilities, techniques.<eos> - Well, that's gone now.<eos> - What happened, in your view?<eos> - I thought you studied our case.<eos> - I did.
And I realized that you might come up short, so I went to the bank and got you some cash.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's why I came round today, to make sure you and the kids were okay.<eos> Em, come on, you didn't think I would just, like, leave you hanging, did you?<eos> You did, didn't you?
Let's log in.<eos> Warning!<eos> Preliminary readings indicate a native toxic atmosphere.<eos> Prolonged exposure might cause paralysis or death.<eos> -How we doing?
I'll give you a fair trial!<eos> No one gets that.<eos> Anything from the silver seat?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I did not.
There's too many lives at stake, Jerico.<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> Leave them.<eos> They don't matter.<eos> They do to me.
The woman, she seemed...<eos> Seek and find.<eos> Uh. Well, seemed so dangerous.<eos> No, you got to have somebody we should call.<eos> I do?
I know what it's like to lose your friends because you're different.<eos> But I also know that one person can change everything.<eos> And you just have to open up to them.<eos> How did you know you could trust the people you opened up to?<eos> I didn't.
- Our fears were in vain.<eos> - What?<eos> - The engagement's off. - How?<eos> Well, Lady Susan broke it off herself.<eos> She did?
- Does she look quite well? - Yes.<eos> That was your impression?<eos> London's vaporous air is not, I think, healthy for her.<eos> - Does she not seem pale?<eos> - She does.
And of course... it did.<eos> - You're making a joke.<eos> - Do I look like I'm laughing?<eos> - You trained my brother Muay Thai?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Did you train him to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea how he learned this.<eos> - Did that just happen?<eos> - Yeah, it did!
- Thanks.<eos> - I never will be the same... - I couldn't believe it.<eos> If I wasn't actually there, I wouldn't think it happened.<eos> And then, suddenly, he came out of nowhere.<eos> - Who did?
But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
- This should be it.<eos> The house of the man who shot the last murderer.<eos> One Jeremy ruckner.<eos> What, do you live in your car? Uh-huh.<eos> Course you do.
My problem is I'm literally all power.<eos> So Shotokan.<eos> One punch.<eos> So it's like, "Oi, mate, I don't want any trouble."<eos> "Well, I do." "Oh, sorry."
It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
Do you know anything about his birth mother?<eos> There's nothing in the file.<eos> Only that she died.<eos> I assume the way my wife did.<eos> The way your husband did.
You were right.<eos> Was I?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know who I was before... but I do now.<eos> I do now.
Lemi does shit for him too.<eos> Like murdering my wife?<eos> Listen, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Neither did my partner.<eos> Well you do now.
Bring him.<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God chooses us over you.<eos> Not today, he didn't.
Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I bring danger to you all.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we're up here.<eos> They already do.
Guys, just chill, alright?<eos> Look, I don't have a grudge against him, okay?<eos> My parents didn't work for him.<eos> Hm.<eos> Yours did, Amanda.
There were some non-critical injuries, but everyone, everyone, survived.<eos> The first pictures of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...<eos> You think that you're gonna die.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> And then, miraculously, you don't.
You eyeballed it?<eos> Yes.<eos> The best chance those passengers had was on that river.<eos> And I'd bet my life on it.<eos> In fact, I did.
Sweetheart, what happened?<eos> I realized just now, for the first time, that there were...<eos> There were 155 people on that plane and you were one of them.<eos> We almost lost you.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't.
Captain?<eos> We've all heard about the computer simulations And now we are watching actual sims.<eos> But I can't quite believe you still have not taken into account the human factor.<eos> Human piloted simulations showed that you could make it back to the airport.<eos> No, they don't.
I mean, she was always so bright.<eos> Sohappy.<eos> To think she was carrying around all that pain, all that unhappiness every day.<eos> I should've seen it.<eos> But I didn't.
Benjamin, thank you for coming.<eos> We're grateful you could make it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, the funny thing is, James always hated funerals.<eos> Yeah, don't we all?
It's why he believes you're here.<eos> Why do you believe you're here?<eos> To protect your people.<eos> The Dominion will never find us.<eos> I did.
Hi, dad.<eos> And this here is Luke.<eos> We call him that because he's got leukemia.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He doesn't really.
I mean, I think I am.<eos> That's why Conner... he went into the store.<eos> It's okay. Have some water.<eos> How did Conner know the store clerk?<eos> He didn't.
Which is one more thing than we do.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I was wondering when you'd come.<eos> Miss DeGracie, we need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.
I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.<eos> Fine, Scott.<eos> And afterwards... why don't you stop by the principal's office and explain to him... that you're disrupting class again?<eos> I trust you know the way.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
A good neighbor... a good worker.<eos> I want to believe that's who you are.<eos> It is.<eos> But nobody in this town really knows you.<eos> Yes you do.
You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?<eos> I can't stop you.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> But trust me, this won't end well.<eos> Nothing does with him.
No, sir, it's not me.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I have a witness who can exonerate me.<eos> But he has to live first.<eos> Why don't you...
This is a trial.<eos> And I yield, to the wishes of the people.<eos> It is time, that we break from the past!<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Neither did your sheep.
Four, you know nothing about David.<eos> You've no idea what we've been working up here.<eos> What have you been working on?<eos> Do you have any idea what is going on out there?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Do you?<eos> I've known forever that she wasn't going to make it.<eos> She'd keep telling me she was getting better all the time because that's what I wanted to hear.<eos> And I believed her.<eos> Except I didn't.
Good morning, Mr. Moon.<eos> Miss Crawly.<eos> What, uh... What's going on?<eos> You got a lot of animals waiting to see you, Mr. Moon.<eos> I do?
Didn't you see this?<eos> Huh? Look, it says I'm a "danger to society."<eos> "A deluded, washed-up charlatan "who never had a hit in his career."<eos> Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Listen.<eos> You're not the only one who lost something here.<eos> - We all did.
Okay, guys, listen up!<eos> Look, I gotta tell you, um, there's not much of an audience out there tonight.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't.
But you gotta remember, I'm old.<eos> You're not old.<eos> For a lawbreaker I'm ancient.<eos> What was it like with the painted ladies?<eos> Did they do it good?
Good with God?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Christ forgives.<eos> He forgives.<eos> Yes, he does, mister,
Yes, sir.<eos> Christ forgives.<eos> He forgives.<eos> Yes, he does, mister,<eos> Yes, he does!
Yeah, that's right.<eos> You see...<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> You see Christ forgives.<eos> He does.
I'm well-upped, though.<eos> You cut on out, get back to your family.<eos> You're the boss.<eos> At least we got two of them,<eos> Yeah, we did.
- Are you alright?<eos> Ah, yeah, thanks.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I know how much Barnes mean to you.<eos> I really do.
Because you're a very polite person.<eos> If I see a situation pointed south, I can't ignore it.<eos> - Sometimes I wish I could.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't. Sometimes...
You'd never see them coming.<eos> This would be a lot easier if we could...<eos> If we call Tony.<eos> - Oh, he won't believe us.<eos> - Even if he did.
The defendant, Mike.<eos> Your father testified that he and his dad, that their relationship went downhill.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And you saw that.<eos> Yes, I did.
This is what he does.<eos> This is what he's always done.<eos> And then he does it all again.<eos> Jeremy, I understand you're frustrated.<eos> I really do.
But it's also true that nobody has ever been an exception to it.<eos> Logic, logic, logic.<eos> I understood what my mistake was.<eos> Not everybody reaches that.<eos> But I did.
I don't know, I...<eos> I do feel like the answers are in that house.<eos> I do too.<eos> You wanna go back?<eos> I do.
The lead vehicle bottomed out.<eos> Okay!<eos> Heads on a swivel!<eos> Didn't we come this way?<eos> We most surely did.
I'm just saying, as journalists, we have an obligation to this story.<eos> And Afghanistan should be on our air more, period.<eos> With the resources we have over there, Afghanistan should definitely be on our air more.<eos> But the problem is, as much as everyone loves the troops, they don't actually want to watch them on the news anymore.<eos> They just don't.
So you must know about my friend Iain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.<eos> I did hear about this, yes.<eos> Yeah, well, everybody heard about it, but a powerful man such as yourself must actually know something.<eos> Or your friend Pacha Khan knows something.<eos> - Or his friend does.
Where are you crashing tonight?<eos> No, seriously. You've seen D?<eos> Seriously, I'm on the script.<eos> I mean it this time.<eos> Yeah, who doesn't?
Taste like turkey?<eos> - Not even vaguely.<eos> -It does!<eos> - Tastes like rubber.<eos> - No, it doesn't!
- I thought you wanted to help me.<eos> - I do, sweetie, but this is insane.<eos> What is it?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
You kept at her until she couldn't take it anymore.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> She got what she deserved.<eos> Did she?<eos> Did she really?
Yes, sir. What up, son?<eos> Does everybody in here that's working...<eos> What up, Dad?<eos> -got at least $20 in their pocket or purse?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Does everybody in here that's working...<eos> What up, Dad?<eos> -got at least $20 in their pocket or purse?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Indeed, I do.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you<eos> Happy birthday, dear Anna<eos> Happy birthday to you<eos> Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
I wish I could tell her.<eos> I picked everything in that house.<eos> I fucking picked everything in that house.<eos> I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.<eos> But this morning, I did.
I picked everything in that house.<eos> I fucking picked everything in that house.<eos> I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.<eos> But this morning, I did.<eos> I did.
You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car? Did Megan get in your car?<eos> No!<eos> Yes, she did!
No. Stay. Stay.<eos> Do you need a drink? No.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> All those things that you said I did...<eos> Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
I should take it back.<eos> You used to rap?<eos> Man, don't sleep on your old man, son.<eos> I had sick flow with this freestyle shit.<eos> Probably still do.
You couldn't have stopped it.<eos> It's prophecy.<eos> It's fate.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Of course I do.
What's this?<eos> Glad you're putting it to use.<eos> - Well, I'm trying.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So how we doing?
No risk of criminal prosecution.<eos> Then we're done.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Did he just buy back the evidence?<eos> Yes, he did, and he did it legally.
Oh, come on.<eos> I have a net worth of $8.7 billion.<eos> Do I look like a man who would hire street thugs to do his dirty work?<eos> I never wanted any of this.<eos> Of course you didn't.
She fell.<eos> Her head hit the table and she didn't get up.<eos> I could have helped her, but I didn't help her because I thought that if she...<eos> If her heart stopped beating, then mine would stop hurting.<eos> It kind of did.
What's up?<eos> What did you say?<eos> You called me an asshole?<eos> - No, I'm calling... - Why would you call me an asshole?<eos> - I... I never do that.
And use this phone only, in case anything happens- given the gravity of the situation, you might want to consider tempering that arrogance of yours.<eos> - These targets are your friends, Grady.<eos> - Nope, these targets are my targets.<eos> - I'm guesses that sounded better in your head.<eos> - Yes, it did.
Why have you and your giant come to see me?<eos> I think you would remember that, Your Majesty, if the mixing went well.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> You have a plan. You need me.<eos> Yes, we do.
No!<eos> You give up your responsibility to the little girl.<eos> And you came crawling down here with your dick in your fucking hand to grovel like a dog for mercy!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't do mercy!
Well, sir, the Webbs, um, are just checked in.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And the other thing?<eos> The other thing.<eos> As you can guess, I imagine, Reynard wants more money.<eos> Of course he does.
What?<eos> Jellyfish, they're immortal.<eos> Bob told me.<eos> Just because Bob says something doesn't mean it's true.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I know you think you're hot shit ever since you moved to New York, but don't be an asshole, okay?<eos> This guy's got Mom's life in his hands.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't think I'm hot shit.<eos> Sure you do.
Major difference.<eos> Major.<eos> I just thought that you said you didn't have feelings for her anymore, and she just had a kid.<eos> I don't.<eos> She did.
We still have time.<eos> I tried, you know.<eos> I did try.<eos> You got to know that.<eos> - I do.
Like a stalker on a TV show.<eos> He got away.<eos> - Pat, go in with her.<eos> - No, don't bother.<eos> - Do it anyway.
Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.<eos> What's that?<eos> Call yourself a Catholic?<eos> You don't know the excommunication rite?<eos> And you do?
It's a shame that your return is not under more festive circumstances.<eos> It is said that the Western Coven was utterly destroyed.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It's a blessing you escaped with your life.<eos> Well, many did not.
- I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Catch... I think.<eos> You think?<eos> It's behind the other two rings, and I can barely see it, but I heard something latch, did you hear it?<eos> No, I didn't.
And can you comment on Thad Castle's open bashing of the late Walt Disney?<eos> He's called him, and I quote,<eos> "A short, anti-Semite... "with less imagination in his whole "Jew-hating body than I have in the tip of my pee-hole."<eos> He said "pee-hole?"<eos> - He did.
How could I miss it?<eos> I used to park right here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I remember those good-night kisses.<eos> Oh, you do, huh?
We-- we're both sorry.<eos> I am not fucking sorry.<eos> She's 16.<eos> You got any at home, you'll understand.<eos> I don't.
It could help the both of you to put the past behind you.<eos> I don't want to put the past behind.<eos> The past is Merry.<eos> There's no way I want to put that behind.<eos> But Dawn does.
-I don't know.<eos> I'll figure it out, but listen...<eos> This is a good thing.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do.
It was in Glenn's blog, you were being detained in airports for hours? 37 times.<eos> Investigating your own country's wars.<eos> That's why I'm going back to Berlin to edit.<eos> You can trust me with this<eos> -I do.
You could've joined one of those gangs, but you didn't, because you wanted to help.<eos> Say it.<eos> You wanted to help.<eos> You want a second chance, right?<eos> Yeah. I do.
I'm really glad he likes you.<eos> He typically doesn't like any of my friends.<eos> What about me?<eos> Oh, he loves you.<eos> But then, so does everybody.
- Classic.<eos> - It's so visceral.<eos> A lot of guys like action films, but I do too.<eos> Mitch, you love Saving Private Ryan.<eos> - He does?
You rotate them around.<eos> It'll be like a whole new outfit.<eos> - The chain looks great on you.<eos> - I...<eos> It does.
- Yeah.<eos> But it's 2:00 am.<eos> It's 3:00 am.<eos> I thought you just said she was okay. Hang on.<eos> I did.
She's making me nervous as hell.<eos> Stephanie: Woe is you.<eos> Hey, y'all, this is not a middle school dance.<eos> Go bother somebody else.<eos> Hey, you doing all right?
Mrs. Glenn, be reasonable.<eos> This is a high-profile case.<eos> Your niece is a very famous actress, and the head medical examiner lD'd her himself.<eos> I saw her through the front window.<eos> - You didn't.
And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> -It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
Yeah.<eos> Greasy Toby, the guy with the OCD?<eos> Yeah. That and ADD.<eos> He tried to kiss me.<eos> - He did?
Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... my friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
There's something seriously wrong with this dog.<eos> - Just quick scope the fucker. - What?<eos> Just shoot it.<eos> - Just keep going. - Really.<eos> Yeah, just do it!
Really, really tired.<eos> Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.<eos> I do believe the first kill came rather quickly this year.<eos> I'm rather disappointed.<eos> The first one always does.
The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through, yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...<eos> -What did you just say? -Sorry?<eos> About a note, what did you just say?<eos> -I said the murderer did leave a note.<eos> -No, they didn't.
It's funny you mention that, Amelia being so positive...<eos> First time we had lunch...<eos> It was in her quarters.<eos> We were both new to the ship, and she fit in so well, but...<eos> I didn't.
What would you like to discuss about the house?<eos> Well, my kids found this very old chest in the attic.<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe I mentioned that the remains of the house were part of the purchase.<eos> Yes, you did.
Mommy says Huntington's a gift from God.<eos> The pain reminds us how precious life is.<eos> Your granny said the same thing to your mom when she was your age.<eos> Did Granny die of Huntington's?<eos> Yeah, she did.
- So what went wrong?<eos> No way to know for sure but if I had to guess...<eos> They gave it a mind of its own, and it decided to use it.<eos> You see, we never opened the source file.<eos> So then who did?
Andreas?<eos> Just tell me where she is.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - You think I'm playing?<eos> - No, I don't.
- I-I saved the city.<eos> - You saved the city!<eos> - I saved the city, man.<eos> - You fuckin' saved the city!<eos> - I did it! I did it!
Busy? - Yeah.<eos> I'm losing my house because of you.<eos> I can take care of that.<eos> How are you gonna take care of that, Vic, huh?<eos> How you gonna do it?
Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
Yes, sir.<eos> Dr O'Brien, how was your flight?<eos> Very pleasant, thank you, General.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> We do.
- I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I guess they found nature.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yes, they did.
Okay, um, well, I'll see you around.<eos> Ahem! I think I'm gonna be sick.<eos> So you have the hots for him.<eos> What?<eos> No, I don't.
You are Mccreighton-hill.<eos> The girl who got into Greene because of her parents.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I, uh, I don't buy that.<eos> Everyone else does.
- Yeah.<eos> See you up there.<eos> I'm wondering, for each of you, what's that thing that really makes you... want to get up in the morning?<eos> Well, for me, I guess, the simplest answer is... I like money.<eos> I do.
That... That's his company phone?<eos> Isn't that crossing the wall?<eos> Well, technically there's nothing criminal here.<eos> So Remson doesn't have a policy prohibiting... this kind of romantic relationship between two employees?<eos> Some banks do, but nope.
He seemed to think that Cachet was gonna go well.<eos> We hope so.<eos> Yeah, what about you?<eos> Think they're onto something?<eos> I do.
Raising money for your company... while still promising our investors a deal for coming on board...<eos> Look, you begged me for this IPO.<eos> Do you want me to call Channing Trust?<eos> I don't actually remember begging.<eos> Does anybody else?
- Sobel.<eos> - He told you.<eos> And that's how you got the edge.<eos> - You have to call me.<eos> - Yeah, I sure do.
Do you understand what's happening here?<eos> Cachet can sue you.<eos> No, they said they would take care of that.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
Did that help diffuse her outrage?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.<eos> How did two people like this live under one roof?<eos> They don't.
I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?<eos> I don't, because I haven't been back there.<eos> She didn't.
Any case, there's nothing else to do.<eos> We're out of witnesses.<eos> We're done.<eos> I want to call Naz.<eos> No, you don't.
You're killing me, and that's fine, but don't kill him.<eos> Go home and write and your closing argument.<eos> You think you can handle it?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I do.
I got you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Officer.<eos> In the short time you and Andrea were together, did you develop any feelings towards her?<eos> I did.
And you?<eos> I panicked and I ran.<eos> I wish I hadn't done that.<eos> I'm ashamed that I did that.<eos> But I did.
Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait.<eos> You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
Trying to take a chopper off in the middle of downtown, are you fucking crazy? !<eos> You motherfucker!<eos> Hubert got away!<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah. We do.
But it ends here.<eos> That's not how this is gonna go down, mims.<eos> I need to do it for her.<eos> This has nothing to do with her.<eos> Maybe it does.
My father.<eos> Jamie.<eos> He didn't die at Culloden?<eos> Well, he meant to die, but...<eos> He didn't.
- Where'd you see it?<eos> In the woods.<eos> Something ate it.<eos> - Should have left it alone.<eos> - I did.
We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Neither does Fred Johnson.
Jimmy still hasn't found his place, but at least he's free.<eos> Guys, this is taking way too long.<eos> It's composite titanium.<eos> If we'd started an hour ago... - Who said that you could talk?<eos> - I did.
Hey, thanks for the assist.<eos> Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here?<eos> No. No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
Uh, why?<eos> I thought that since you had a certain... friendship with her, that you might have some insight that would help us.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Did you know that Peter Drax isn't Louis' biological father?<eos> I did.
And it's a good fight, and they're shaking the guy's hand, and everything's going on.<eos> And really the concern that everybody don't see is the damage being done to this individual.<eos> And with every applause, there's just as much downward spiral.<eos> And so is the UFC and Bellator and all the rest of them want it out?<eos> Hell, no. Of course they don't.
No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
All right.<eos> [toilet flushes]<eos> She's as crooked as a dog's hind legs, and you know it.<eos> And Principal Wayne knows it.<eos> I sure as hell do.
Well, Principal Wayne, some of the kids are assholes, and I have to treat them accordingly.<eos> The language you use could be argued as inappropriate to some.<eos> Some of them deserve it.<eos> You feel it's working?<eos> In fact, I do.
Men are disgusting.<eos> How can they be so single-minded?<eos> What's on my mind?<eos> You don't really believe that I crave your body?<eos> You do!
Well...<eos> Uh... I mean I can't.<eos> Well, naturally I assumed that Joe had discussed all this with you.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one knows where she is.<eos> I do.
And turn around.<eos> Here's the camera.<eos> Do not go anywhere.<eos> - You don't know this young man?<eos> - No, I don't.
I've always loved this place.<eos> I know you have.<eos> More than Felix anyway.<eos> I hope you realise what you're taking on.<eos> Of course he does.
Craig was right.<eos> I should have done more. I should have tried.<eos> You did... nothing wrong.<eos> No. He deserves to know the truth.<eos> You both do.
Maybe this is the first one of our cases destined to go unsolved?<eos> Unsolved?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm guessing you have a dog?<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh, I doubt that.<eos> I wanna talk to the boy again.<eos> And I wanna live forever.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> You did.
I wanna talk to the boy again.<eos> And I wanna live forever.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> You did.<eos> But did you before?
Well...<eos> My mother wears pink.<eos> I was eleven years old when I decided to marry Soraya.<eos> And every day for six years I prayed for the courage to talk to her.<eos> But I never did.
# How can I keep from singing? #<eos> The body of Christ.<eos> - Hey, Father. - Hey.<eos> She seems better today.<eos> Does she?
Your boss is too much. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure what that means. You do.<eos> She took you with her when she stole my client.<eos> - Tell me I'm wrong. - She didn't steal anyone, Mr. Stone.<eos> She did.
It's up to you.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He offered to help me in here.<eos> - And you said?<eos> - I didn't.
He will not leave this to the voters.<eos> He does not believe in the American system.<eos> Angel, believe in me.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> We do.
Rose, that night at the summer ball, I wanted to kiss you very, very much.<eos> I should have kissed you, like this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I had feelings for you then, rose.<eos> I still do.
- Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> - Like just back and forth is overwhelming, but if I were just riding the train coming to a point, it would be fine.<eos> I mean, transferring is not an issue, although I do always get overwhelmed in rush hour 'cause I'm bumping into people.<eos> - It's good you aren't in any Chris Tucker films.<eos> Doing really good, dude.
That's too bad.<eos> But that's not going to happen.<eos> I decide who leaves.<eos> And I decide...<eos> - that nobody does.
- I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
Yeah, well, that's what this town keeps on telling itself.<eos> You think my uncle did it?<eos> I think it's something worse.<eos> You think it's haunted.<eos> - You don't?
- I hate this goddamn house.<eos> - I don't blame you.<eos> At least we know what we're dealing with.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Nothing does.
- Do you have a problem with him?<eos> - Yeah, he shoved me inside of my own locker freshman year.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> - Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.<eos> - It didn't.
- Yeah, he shoved me inside of my own locker freshman year.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> - Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.<eos> - It didn't.<eos> It didn't.
Come on.<eos> Here, now, we got to go.<eos> He was fine.<eos> That nigga's a maniac, yo. He took my cousin's fucking eye out.<eos> No, he didn't.
- All I care about is truth.<eos> Or dare.<eos> Truth or dare!<eos> Yo, that chorus do kick in nice, though.<eos> It does, don't it?
- What?<eos> First of all, I don't care if they like Shark Tank more than Techtonic.<eos> They're murderers!<eos> All right.<eos> Second of all, no, they don't!
I mean, it needs a lot of work, but...<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> He's standing downstairs.<eos> Do you have any wine?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.
That sacred bond between mother and child?<eos> I have no doubts. I only fear she does.<eos> Hard work makes a mother.<eos> We like to think something magical happens at birth.<eos> And, for, some it does.
That's wonderful, Daisy.<eos> Come on, you lovebirds.<eos> Save your courting... Till we've got you safely in that ambulance.<eos> Baby's turning, Daisy, it knows just what to do.<eos> Like you do.
Dumbo, not Jumbo.<eos> Dumbo.<eos> Em, did you thank Mommy?<eos> Say thank you?<eos> - Yes, we did. - Yes.
You take the other.<eos> So, now we're traitors, murderers, and horse thieves.<eos> Tell me, does it ever occur to you that taking Claire to wife might not ha' been the wisest thing you ever did?<eos> - No.<eos> - Hmm. It doesn't.
I encouraged her to become his widow.<eos> Black Jack will die tomorrow at the Battle of Culloden.<eos> But if we succeed tonight, there will be no battle.<eos> Then perhaps his death will come about by some other means.<eos> And if it doesn't?
We're wasting our time.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Somebody's in there.<eos> - No... no way Scarfe got past us.<eos> - Well, somebody did.
What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
I want him to suffer.<eos> He should know what it feels like when your life is over, while everyone else's life goes on as if you don't exist.<eos> You sound like you're speaking from experience.<eos> You should trust me, Misty.<eos> Like Pop did.
You'll come back to the club in a few days when it opens.<eos> You think it worked?<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> She won't fold.<eos> What if she does?
It's on me.<eos> This stops now! This stops now!<eos> This stops now! This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> Yes, it does. Yes, it does.
- No. No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
Membership has its privileges.<eos> He sprung you?<eos> You think this is funny, don't you?<eos> You got this all figured out, huh?<eos> No... actually, I don't.
I liked the club better.<eos> I'm a man who needs his space.<eos> Space is a good thing.<eos> Especially when you come to kill a man.<eos> Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.
That's not what I meant. I...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No. No, I don't.
As the world waits and worries about our two journalists in Ecuador, the whole station joins me in thinking of Ian Finch, - whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
- What happened to the girl? - She was going to kill you.<eos> - I had to take her.<eos> She disappeared.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I don't know.<eos> But when the time comes, you'll know what to do.<eos> Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> And so did your father.
Dad?<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Hey! What's up, homie?<eos> How you doing?
Never mind.<eos> Valčík, you take this street behind me.<eos> We have some sun, so take this.<eos> If he approaches without an armed escort, then use it to signal.<eos> And if he does?
You've been running around here... with your little dinkle out and stuff.<eos> - Cut it out!<eos> - Did she tell you she don't like you... 'cause you look like Lionel Richie?<eos> I don't look like no fucking Lionel Richie.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Stop that shit right now.<eos> You can't hide forever!<eos> - Look, they purging', all right?<eos> - She killed somebody.<eos> - I did!
I liked your maturity at dinner, or what I took to be maturity.<eos> I made a joke about it, but I liked your intensity.<eos> I never met anyone so intense before.<eos> I liked your looks, Marcus.<eos> I still do.
Mama, where's Mr. Church?<eos> He's sleeping.<eos> Sleeping?<eos> He never sleeps.<eos> Of course he does, baby.
And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
Kyle had an accident.<eos> He had an accident with door trim?<eos> How do you even do that?<eos> Why didn't he fix it?<eos> He did.
Proud.<eos> Yeah, 'cause it's, uh, sticking out, like it's boastful, right?<eos> You see, uh, carpentry is only the illusion of perfection... but we can come close.<eos> They say God lives in the details.<eos> He does?
The film ball at the Palasthotel am Zoo was a big yearly event.<eos> Gustl always looked forward to.<eos> That ball was far more important to me than anything happening in Germany.<eos> You're probably going to ask me now when I first met Hitler and Goebbels.<eos> Everyone does.
Captain sent a few riders out to that homestead you told us about.<eos> Circuit judge come out from Salt Lake.<eos> We had us a trial yesterday.<eos> He hand down a judgment?<eos> He did.
Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
I gave you boys damn near a month to finish this thing.<eos> Well, looky here, just when I was starting to get lonesome.<eos> Jim.<eos> - Heard you found your family.<eos> - I did.
Campbell won't pay.<eos> John Campbell cannot afford the political fallout of my death. - He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...
John Campbell cannot afford the political fallout of my death. - He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...<eos> - If they do.
Yes.<eos> I've been through the books.<eos> There's no wire.<eos> - He sold his personal stock.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Nothing famous about that.<eos> Now, this is the famous Beacon Hill.<eos> This is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the entire city, and it's home to my sweet, sweet boyfriend, Tom Brady.<eos> - Does he really live there?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
- No, Abbie, I don't want to.<eos> What do you mean, "No"?<eos> We're gonna fall. Go!<eos> - Abbie, I'm scared!<eos> - Just do it!
I didn't wanna make it worse.<eos> It looked like the resource thing was happening, so I didn't mention it.<eos> But now, I'm mentioning it.<eos> They have to give you some sort of grace period, right?<eos> They did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Do I care about anything you're saying right now?<eos> Nikki: No, you don't.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to go?<eos> Yes. He does.
What if she hates us?<eos> Why wouldn't she?<eos> I hate my parents.<eos> You do not hate your parents.<eos> Well, I do.
You killed yourselves for that money!<eos> I wouldn't go that far, but, yeah, it took some effort.<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Maybe-- maybe-- maybe it like just fell out or something.<eos> It didn't.
Excommunicated.<eos> You're shamed.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't have the strength.<eos> But he does.
Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm? Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> You did, huh?
Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
You guys have a movie to get to.<eos> I don't really want to get into this right now. What?<eos> No, come on.<eos> No, we don't let stuff go like that.<eos> No, we don't.
But there's a way that certain white people talk to black people.<eos> It's disingenuous.<eos> - Fuhrman doesn't have to be a witness.<eos> - What? He's not even the cop who entered the gloves into evidence; he doesn't have to take the stand.<eos> Yes, he does.
I would expect so, Your Honor, barring any acts of God or further child-care crisises from Ms. Clark.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> I am offended by Mr. Cochran's remarks, as a woman and as a mother.<eos> Mr. Cochran may not know what it's like to work a 70-hour work week and also take care of a family, but I do.<eos> And many other people do, too.
So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.
This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.<eos> And I didn't.
You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.
I know the outcome.<eos> My hand is bigger than Bob's!<eos> Put me in, Coach.<eos> So, saying we wanted to, how would we present it?<eos> We don't.
Oh, please, Mr. Darden!<eos> I... if this is the witness' statement, then he is the racist, not me.<eos> But that is what you're suggesting.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! I suggest nothing!<eos> - Oh, yes, you did!
She was running away from the man who said he'd kill her.<eos> She saw the explosion coming.<eos> Why else fill a safe-deposit box with threatening letters from the defendant, a will and police photos of past beatings?<eos> She knew that the bomb could go off at any second.<eos> And then it did.
You've been called the architect of the defense team.<eos> You were the first one hired by O.J. Simpson.<eos> It was the day after the murders.<eos> Who hired Johnnie Cochran?<eos> I did.
You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.<eos> That so?<eos> I had to work hard to get him talking.<eos> But he talked.<eos> They all do.
His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
They remember the Stark name.<eos> People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
I will always love my brother.<eos> His soul is pure and perfect.<eos> His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.<eos> He just needs... to atone for them.<eos> We all do.
They're from the Brotherhood.<eos> They follow the Red God.<eos> Aye, well, all are welcome here.<eos> Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.
Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
Show me your stance.<eos> Now listen to me, Pod.<eos> See how your feet are about a yard apart?<eos> Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.<eos> 'Cause they do, Pod.
Well, that is convenient for you.<eos> You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?<eos> Your square jaw, your golden armor.<eos> Tell me, I want to know.<eos> I truly do.
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.<eos> We can't give up on our brother.<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> He wants you to make a mistake.<eos> Of course he does.
He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.<eos> He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.<eos> Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.<eos> You and I have that in common.<eos> We do.
If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
It happened when I hit the water.<eos> I floated downstream, and it slammed into this jagged rock.<eos> Thought I was going to drown.<eos> Do you think he made it?<eos> Of course he did.
My feelings for you are what keeps me going.<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Elf Hunters, huh?<eos> Do you know anything, or not?<eos> Of course, I do.
We use those to speak to the loved ones that left us behind.<eos> We listen to their tales, and guide their safe return to the blissful pure land.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you speak to someone?<eos> Yes, I did.
Wasn't me, I swear.<eos> Paper runs out, as does patience.<eos> I didn't ask them to do that.<eos> The second time.<eos> I didn't!
Now, take one last look with that lonely eye, one last look at this wretched place you call home.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> For every horrible thing down here, there's something far more beautiful.<eos> My mother saw it.<eos> So did my father.
- In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
That's no life.<eos> Julieta, we're all doing as well as we can.<eos> Do you know what it would cost to put your mother in a nursing home?<eos> I thought you hired a woman to care for her.<eos> Sana'a does.
Then, this one Saturday... my grandmother came crying Mother's name.<eos> And I knew, in that moment, that... Mama had died.<eos> I lost her for a second time.<eos> I, too, thought things could never change.<eos> But they did.
Well.<eos> You look... I don't know... You look like a real cavalryman now.<eos> And you look like the cat that's got the cream.<eos> You Guards get the best of everything, don't you?<eos> We do, we do. The receptions, the dinners, the balls.
Oui, peut-être. Ooh, and with a silk ribbon to tie it up?<eos> Katya, go fetch us a ribbon to match with the dress.<eos> We are going to make you look fit for a prince.<eos> You know, you have to make a little effort, dear Marya.<eos> Everybody does at these times.
I'm just...<eos> I assumed you'd want to.<eos> Who says I don't want to?<eos> I didn't have a chance to tell her all the things I wanted to tell her before she passed away.<eos> Hmm. We never do.
I just wanted to be able to talk to Daddy again.<eos> I just wanted you to be able to talk to Daddy.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He lives in the dark and the cold and he screams and screams and...<eos> No, he doesn't.
How long have you been lying?<eos> And what for?<eos> Some boy from another tribe?<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> I really don't.
- Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up. How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
- Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand! - You don't?<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
- I have a hole in it.<eos> It keeps getting bigger apparently.<eos> I think my demons are feeding on it.<eos> You have demons?<eos> Sadly, I do.
And that someone just happened to know that you'd be paying Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?<eos> I told you, I didn't know that he lived there.<eos> Forensics traced the bomber's call to a pay phone in the building.<eos> Bullock will back me up.<eos> He did.
Turns out staring into the cold, dead eyes of the man that killed your parents doesn't bring the right amount of closure.<eos> Bruce never should've been in that room.<eos> I should've gotten to Malone first.<eos> Yes, you should have done.<eos> But you didn't, did you?
I said, where's The Lady? !<eos> No one knows!<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> Someone knows.<eos> I don't.
But it's been more than 24 hours since he's made contact.<eos> Perhaps that's because Jim Gordon still breathes.<eos> But if the police catch him first, how do we explain...<eos> Something that cannot be explained?<eos> We don't.
I will deal with that myself.<eos> There's been a jailbreak, and the Mafia's at it again.<eos> Hey, what's going on here?<eos> I didn't realize we had more questions to ask Mr. Gotaro together.<eos> Oh, we don't.
But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.<eos> Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop. Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
So do it.<eos> Oh, he's amazing.<eos> He's like a big, lazy Michelle Kwan.<eos> But how's he gonna get up the stairs?<eos> Jake! He already did.
But seeing you both overcome your fears did help me, and I think we've all grown as women.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Stab me! Stab me!<eos> Do it, just do it!
I'm 100% sure about this.<eos> Well, guess who solved the puzzle?<eos> - Who?<eos> - We did.<eos> Oh, we did?
CID, they're all tossers.<eos> Why do we not like doing house-to-house, us wooden-tops?<eos> Why did they all groan when she announced it?<eos> Because... when do they come and help us out with our workload, eh?<eos> They don't.
- Maybe it's out of date.<eos> - May 2017.<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't you want to do this?<eos> No, I do.
Fuck it, take me to the apartment. (MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> RICHIE: What was that? Do you hear that?<eos> Pull over.<eos> - The expressway is right here.<eos> - Just do it.
In the fucking hospital.<eos> Not for nothing, but he does have pretty bad asthma.<eos> What's that?<eos> Asthma.<eos> They all do. All the Osmonds.
- Calm the fuck down. - He put his fucking hands on me.<eos> Calm down.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck did you do?<eos> What did I fucking do?
Do you want to fool around... With me?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Do you really want to know what it's like?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't have them.<eos> What?<eos> None of my friends do.
I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... i can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Get this shit out of here.<eos> Move.<eos> All of it.<eos> You don't got no Danish at 11:00 in the morning?<eos> Of course we do, sweetheart.
You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone that there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> - Well, she was mistaken.<eos> - What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
Oh.<eos> How about something in a neighborhood of "Christmas With Bob"?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Does he go by Bob?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
- Why?<eos> Amrita, look at them.<eos> Some of them have been working in our office... for 5... 10... 12 years.<eos> But I didn't even know their names.<eos> Unfortunately, now I do.
- Yes, yes, yes.<eos> - Him.<eos> Him.<eos> - He liked me.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
What is it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't.
To think of Nikolai in danger, I can't bear it.<eos> I used to cry when he fell over and hurt his knee and now he has to face bullets.<eos> Don't.<eos> Do you think about him all the time?<eos> Of course I do.
Just give me the damn key.<eos> - I'm afraid it's not hotel policy...<eos> - Do you know who I am? !<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Right.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Quite the Roper acolyte.<eos> How things change.<eos> Yes, they do, don't they?
_<eos> _<eos> Mr Burr always wanted to come to the Swiss Alps.<eos> He likes the peace and quiet, does Mr Burr.<eos> You don't?
They're my father's.<eos> It's private.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise it meant that much to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
Jack Linden.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Get out.<eos> Nobody even lives here!<eos> Well, I do now.
They'll be here any minute.<eos> You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?<eos> He cheated me.<eos> And you didn't like that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Long trip on the high seas, sailor boy?<eos> Yes.<eos> Er... we got a little lost in the ocean.<eos> - But we got here in the end.<eos> - You did.
Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who you are.<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know... who that man was who tried to kill you... why your parents died... why there's so much death around you... why you couldn't save Kelly.<eos> You want answers?<eos> Come with me.<eos> How we doing on his I.D.?
We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh...<eos> Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
Sing or get lost!<eos> Sing or get lost.<eos> Sing or get lost!<eos> You want to hear a song?<eos> Do you?
Who's this up in my motherfucking house?<eos> Shit!<eos> Look who it is.<eos> - What's going on, man?<eos> - Chance! How you doing, brother?
What to do?<eos> Guys, we gotta act fast.<eos> What are we gonna do? I don't know.<eos> We don't have enough for a month.<eos> Shit, what do we do?
I to kill someone.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> I want to know who I am.<eos> You have not to do this.<eos> I do.
Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you. - He does.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Don't disparage yourself, Fedya none of us will believe it anyway.<eos> Then I'd better say nothing about myself at all.<eos> How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong.<eos> - You did.
You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
I'd trust him with my life.<eos> Whereas, that one can't you see he's trying to take Sonya from you?<eos> He's just being nice to her.<eos> He likes you, too.<eos> No, he doesn't.
The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.
The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - I do.
We could live like this, in the country, all the time.<eos> I wish!<eos> Do you? Do you really?<eos> Of course, I love Andrei.<eos> Of course, I do.
Who are you?<eos> Oh, I think you know who I am, what I want.<eos> The creature, the beast.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
A credible one, as well.<eos> Otherwise I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to track him down. Who's putting up the money?<eos> How does he even know it exists?<eos> I don't know and I don't care.<eos> He obviously does.
I know, but...<eos> Look, I want normal as much as anybody, but I've been a part of something not normal for years, ever since my best friend became a beast.<eos> Do I miss it?<eos> But did it form me, change me?<eos> Yeah, it did.
What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
Although Jason and I haven't worked on a project together in, I don't know, almost a year.<eos> I miss working with him.<eos> - I know it's difficult, but do you know if Jason was working on something outside the office on his own?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - I don't...
I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Uh... Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
Holy water irritated him severely, but had no long-term effect.<eos> Will you pray with me?<eos> You are very brave to return.<eos> He doesn't like the light.<eos> My mother didn't either.
Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!
Here comes the check.<eos> "Hey, wait a doggone..."<eos> 24 bucks for a side of buttermilk biscuits?<eos> "That doesn't sound right, now, does it?"<eos> No, it does not.
Jesus. Solicitation?<eos> Let me tell you, when we were building this case,<eos> I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.<eos> That was solicitation. But did he say "boo"?<eos> Bullshit he did.
That's great!<eos> Please let me be there when you tell Howard. Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, of course I do.
Not at all.<eos> Come in.<eos> I hear clinking.<eos> Does that mean we have something to celebrate?<eos> We sure do.
And he sent Ernesto away.<eos> My brother was gonna take care of me.<eos> And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<eos> Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!
My brother was gonna take care of me.<eos> And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<eos> Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!<eos> You do... for your own good.
Good evening, my beautiful wife.<eos> And how was the rest of your day since last we met?<eos> Not bad.<eos> I take it you had a good day.<eos> Aye, as a matter of fact, I did.
And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I ken what these men will face, and I know how to prepare them for it.<eos> You don't.
Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
Well, attack, damn it.<eos> Pardon me, Your Highness, but... but for the life of me, I cannot understand why General Murray insists we waste our time in dilly-dally.<eos> I rushed the army here to ensure our possession of the high ground.<eos> And now you wish us to abandon such a strong defensive position and attack the enemy in force?<eos> Indeed I do, sir.
There's no such path marked.<eos> Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?
Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
Nassau is dead.<eos> It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.<eos> We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.<eos> If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.<eos> No, I don't.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> It never does.
No, you don't, but you're going to play anyway.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I want to be heard.<eos> But for that to happen, I need someone to listen.<eos> And if I don't?
Yeah.<eos> Nice girl, but still. She's so controlling.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't mean it like that because I don't know her that well.<eos> But I don't like her.<eos> I don't.
About everything, of course.<eos> Honestly, I didn't know how to explain him over the phone.<eos> I just kept imagining... Mom Googling Laird Mayhew and you guys jumping to conclusions before you even got a chance to know him.<eos> Well, now we know him.<eos> No, you don't.
You have to find a way in.<eos> You have to do something for him that's truly special so that he knows that your intentions are pure.<eos> Dude, Goose, I don't know how to talk to the guy.<eos> It's like we speak two different languages or something.<eos> You do.
Oh! Okay...<eos> I've been back and forth about this decision many times but the conclusion I come to:<eos> I've fallen in love with another woman and I can't live without her.<eos> Wow! I'm no expert in this area. But of course these things do happen.<eos> Not to me, they don't.
I value substance and character.<eos> Who the hell do you think I am?<eos> I wasn't implying anything like that.<eos> I was just thought it might be Hedy Lamarr, because how much she adores you.<eos> What! ? All of your clients do.
Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
I suppose I knew she was dead but... there was a part of me that thought maybe she was alive... ..living elsewhere... ..in a better place because I wasn't there.<eos> The last memory I have of her, she was very angry with me, angry for something I'd done. I don't know what.<eos> You know you worked on a suicide helpline for some years?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
You're safe.<eos> In the end, that's all that matters.<eos> Mother sends her love.<eos> Well, we have a lot to talk about, don't we?<eos> We do.
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Bradley-- no, I didn't.<eos> Shut up. You cannot play with this!<eos> Well, you shouldn't have left it out then.<eos> I didn't.
Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...<eos> Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls, co-workers, friends, some waitress that served me.<eos> They were crushes.<eos> God, they were crushes.<eos> Never acted on any of it.<eos> Never did anything.
You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
Because the lab was about to explode.<eos> Somebody set the lab to self destruct.<eos> Right.<eos> We don't have a self destruct.<eos> No, actually we do.
Don't you see?<eos> You have no choice.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do I have to kill people?<eos> Because I already did!
Jesus, is this the reputation I've garnered?<eos> Gold medalist in ethical limbo?<eos> I see no ethical problem with reframing an issue.<eos> Trying to win the female vote by taking the gun lobby and dressing it up in a frilly pink frock, it is so crude, it could only have originated in a room full of old men.<eos> Well, it didn't!
No one's even come close to proposing that.<eos> And if they did, it would have its own day in Congress. Next.<eos> And it's two steps away from confiscation.<eos> The gun lobby's rhetoric is based on the falsehood that we want to take something away from people.<eos> We don't.
I do not fucking believe!<eos> ...in the shadow of a giant rat.<eos> It's on all of the national news outlets.<eos> How the hell did she manage that?<eos> She didn't.
You don't know that.<eos> He waited for them to leave.<eos> There's no other reason.<eos> And the cops haven't even bothered talking to him.<eos> But you did.
You just push it.<eos> You know what I felt after?<eos> Bad for my mom.<eos> She never understood it.<eos> To this day, doesn't.
He didn't succeed his father.<eos> It was Hrothgar's right to name his successor.<eos> He always did have a sense of mischief.<eos> You don't think a woman can rule?<eos> Many do.
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.<eos> Then someone goes and tells Dr Caldwell and I'm in the sweat box for a week.<eos> We won't tell.<eos> We promise.<eos> We did stories last time.
He was cooking that junk up in his bathtub before she got involved.<eos> She's the one that gave him cash as long as he didn't deal in Banshee.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> - I told her he wouldn't stick with it.<eos> - And he didn't.
You got me.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
- How is he?<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
Kurt, did you know?<eos> If I knew, I would have said something to you.<eos> Look, we need to take a step back and figure things out.<eos> This changes things.<eos> Not for me, it doesn't.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.<eos> See, I'm pretty kinky, but you guys, you're fucked up.<eos> You come here, too?<eos> - How'd you know I was here?<eos> - I didn't.
We didn't call no police.<eos> - Must have been your neighbors.<eos> - Must have been.<eos> - 'Course, we ain't got none of those. - No.<eos> No, you don't.
It's not lack of confidence.<eos> You've got a secret.<eos> Or secrets.<eos> Maybe I just don't like you.<eos> But you do.
It was in my head.<eos> He was talking to me in the only way that he knew how.<eos> And I knew what I had to do.<eos> They said I killed my baby.<eos> I didn't.
I get it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't. No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Tequila? - I wanna dance on the bar!<eos> Last time I was here, I was in a leather vest.<eos> Oh, I remember.<eos> That seems like a long time ago.<eos> Yeah, it does.
- Oh, my God.<eos> For my job. - Oh, my God.<eos> Anyway, I didn't get it.<eos> I, uh, I heard he hired some 19-year-old muscle queen from LA.<eos> Of course he did.
- Hi, guys. - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> You know, this city drives me freaking crazy sometimes, but right now, I think it feels like the best place in the world.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Yes, it does.
You think he had an existential crisis?<eos> I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition.<eos> And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do.<eos> Do we know where the error originated?<eos> We do.
I like you, John.<eos> We've known each other for a long time.<eos> But this job is a lot more complicated than putting away bad guys.<eos> - I think I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
In Miami.<eos> You know about the place in Miami?<eos> Yeah, I used to hang out there with him sometimes.<eos> Did you know about it?<eos> I did.
When did you know he was dealing drugs?<eos> I was suspicious when he had all that money.<eos> I knew he wasn't making all that money working here.<eos> You never said anything to me about it.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Her daughter says you pushed her.<eos> Sir, I was tryin' to make an escape...<eos> - Did you push her?<eos> - After the smoothie.<eos> - So you did...
They do not talk too much.<eos> When you have the kind of cynical wit of McCoy, and you have the swagger and braggadocio of Kirk, and then you have the intellect and cold reason of Spock, he's like the perfect human being all wrapped up in one.<eos> The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.<eos> That first night of the premiere we had to actually go to some friends' house, because they had a color TV, a big console color TV.<eos> We did not.
That book has prostitution in it, among other things.<eos> Well, Principal Simmons, we do call ourselves the land of the free, home of the brave.<eos> I think we can handle it.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does. Okay.
No.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Don't any of you do that again.
She's not in school.<eos> She's broke.<eos> How is that my problem?<eos> She said you're taking clients away from her.<eos> 'Course she did.
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.<eos> Fucking-A right I did.
We're not selling the company.<eos> Richie.<eos> We have a binding verbal agreement.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yes, we do.
And the timing can work as we've planned? Yes.<eos> These particular schools are used to business people's children coming and going for a variety of reasons.<eos> Will you be enrolling them under their real names?<eos> What?<eos> Some don't. The stigma.
Talk to Evans?<eos> David didn't say.<eos> He must have said something.<eos> He must have given a reason why.<eos> No, he didn't.
You'll get it, when your friends start working for different sides.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Are you waiting for me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And if I don't?
You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.<eos> David didn't say.<eos> He must have said something.<eos> He must have given a reason why.<eos> No, he didn't.
- I dunno what you're talking about... - Okay.<eos> Let's all just take it down a notch.<eos> Are you waiting for me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And if I don't?
They're sending in a platoon to back our boys up now.<eos> A platoon? That's it?<eos> That's all you could get?<eos> I couldn't get anything, sir.<eos> The embassy Marines did this.
- What? - Oh, my gosh.<eos> You don't know.<eos> - I know. If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
If you guys want to take this one, fine.<eos> Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> You know, I always figured you gave me this job because I speak my mind.<eos> - I did.
We would bring the herd down off the mountain in the fall.<eos> Sometimes we would lose one along the way, and I'd worry over it.<eos> My father...<eos> My father would tell me... that the steer would find its own way home.<eos> And, often as not, they did.
As another old friend of mine likes to say, "There's a path for everyone."<eos> Your path leads you back to me.<eos> You ever wonder why I've kept you with me this whole journey?<eos> Maybe you like the pleasure of my company, you sadistic fuck.<eos> Why, maybe I do.
William, we have to go now.<eos> Lazo's been conning us the whole time.<eos> He was never gonna give the nitro to the Confederados.<eos> We have to run.<eos> Of course we do.
You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, i don't know why the suits at delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
Good, if she likes you so much she doesn't care if you're married.<eos> Bad, if she doesn't want to sleep with you and so she doesn't care.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to sleep with her.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Watching them play.<eos> That's all?<eos> The girl sang very well.<eos> And how did it end?<eos> It didn't.
- You're the chicken butt.<eos> - You're a bigger chicken butt.<eos> - Daddy's a chicken butt.<eos> - These actually look really good.<eos> They do.
You'd be amazed how many military historians see that as just a detail.<eos> They see him as a serious historian who happens to see things from Hitler's point of view.<eos> Yeah, but it's not a detail.<eos> You know, I think it's at the center of everything he thinks and does.<eos> So do I. Yeah.
We need to hear your voice.<eos> Just a quick word.<eos> Lying Jewish bitch!<eos> You think it all finished with Hitler?<eos> It didn't.
I like to treat myself, don't you?<eos> Why should all the bad people have all the good things in life?<eos> Like this?<eos> You had a good morning.<eos> Yes, I did.
Why should all the bad people have all the good things in life?<eos> Like this?<eos> You had a good morning.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I did, didn't I?
You do?<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...<eos> Almost never, actually.<eos> And when he does...
- The shrink.<eos> She was called for a psych eval.<eos> She said you knew about it.<eos> Damien didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> Oh, but he did.
I was only 20.<eos> You know what? Mike and I never got our twenties.<eos> Like, you know, the fun twenties, and...<eos> I feel like maybe he missed that. Oh, my God.<eos> Maybe I did, too.
Like what?<eos> When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Nothing's wrong with it, it's just... Sounds smart.<eos> It does?
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Nothing's wrong with it, it's just... Sounds smart.<eos> It does?<eos> Yeah, it does.
- I understand.<eos> - You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss.<eos> Yes, I do.
There is no reason to be afraid.<eos> You know her.<eos> You heard her story.<eos> We all went through this together.<eos> Yes, we did.
Why can't they make quiet ice cubes?<eos> - Here, hydrate.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Are you going to see Toby?<eos> I already did.
I'm very sorry, and we will pick this up at a later date.<eos> OK, thanks, Christine.<eos> My source at the police station called it the Tug Show, actually.<eos> - He said that?<eos> - Yes, he did.
As you were.<eos> The name which I can see...<eos> on a sheet of paper...<eos> She seems better.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
- Okay.<eos> And just ashy in some places.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough with the small talk.<eos> We have a long drive ahead of us.<eos> We do.
This one?<eos> Oh, no, that could've been anybody.<eos> The brick on the ground says "Property of Christian Black."<eos> "Christian..."<eos> Yeah, yeah, it does.
"Who the fuck am I to rewrite that?"<eos> I'm being honest with you all.<eos> You know the real reason why I wouldn't help my lady if she got attacked by a mountain lion?<eos> I don't know if I wanna be with a woman that survived a mountain lion attack.<eos> I don't...
The pocket ass.<eos> The pocket titties.<eos> I was disgusted.<eos> I bought all of it.<eos> I did.
Yeah. And, Bernie, if you don't mind me asking, how much experience do you have with constitutional law?<eos> Some.<eos> Very little.<eos> You realize this case could alter the constitution of the United States?<eos> I do.
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
She sings like an angel.<eos> Well, she got it from her father.<eos> What?<eos> You got pace Mr. Calleros?<eos> Back in the day, I did my thing a little... - A little?
You did what, stupid?<eos> This family has already tragically lost an heir.<eos> This family uses the term "heir" as if we're in a Shakespearian play.<eos> Technically, if we're talking about heirs, we need to find Lola.<eos> No, we don't.
What?<eos> These are game consoles.<eos> Right, but just the last gen.<eos> We don't have time for games.<eos> No, we don't.
So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
Could be.<eos> They're well funded with Saudi money via Qatar.<eos> Maybe they gave him some of that money.<eos> That's what we need you to find out.<eos> And if they did?
Why would you do that?<eos> Might be because you could've killed me the other night but you didn't.<eos> Or maybe I like knowing you're out there, a ghost, still doing what needs to be done.<eos> How'd you know it had a false bottom?<eos> I didn't.
That's not an instinct we should hope to nurture in any artificial super intelligence.<eos> Not even one that we call our own.<eos> She's our only ally in this war.<eos> You need to learn to trust Her.<eos> But I do, Ms. Groves.
Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
- Ms. Shaw.<eos> It's good to have you back home.<eos> Harold, do you know how they found you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
Many mistakes.<eos> But we helped some people.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
Where'd you hear it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song? I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain.<eos> Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
Nina!<eos> Prairie believes her father's alive and sneaking her messages about where to find him in dreams.<eos> She also believes her dreams are premonitions, and that the Russian Mafia are after her.<eos> Kids tell tall tales.<eos> I did myself.
Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
Mystery Man's got to see how committed we are.<eos> Right?<eos> Especially after what we did.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah, he does. For sure.
Uh, yes, Patrick. She...<eos> She's gone.<eos> The poor kid.<eos> She really didn't have that coming, you know?<eos> No, she didn't.
So if you're done with your fucking questions, I think I'm through.<eos> I know you know something, you little weasel.<eos> All the crocodile tears in the world won't convince me otherwise.<eos> I'm gonna find out what it is and when I do...<eos> When I do...
You're just gonna let him walk out of here, Commander?<eos> - In a word, yes.<eos> - Harley Cohen is at the very least a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Don't you think it would be prudent to hold him for further questioning?<eos> I do not.
They say they feel more alive.<eos> The Chilean aristocracy likes to show its wealth.<eos> But the poet should not be impressed.<eos> Esteve nos sal es de Paris And this provincial imitation makes you laugh.<eos> But he does.
I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
No, I feel like the worst person in the world.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Nuria!<eos> - You didn't need to come.<eos> - Of course I did.
Declan Harp.<eos> The man who used to work for the Hudson's Bay Company and now steals from them?<eos> That's who you want me to meet?<eos> It sounds bad when you put it like that.<eos> Does it?
You... and her.<eos> Why do I always have to do bad things to get your attention?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I have nothing left.<eos> Of course you do.
Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I noticed, uh, everybody's real cozy with Deacon now.<eos> I'm really not sure how all this is gonna work now that you're here, and not back in 2016.<eos> We have a mission to finish.<eos> We do.
We've got 300 security enforcements.<eos> We'll shutting down Rue-Ian's secret laboratory.<eos> No one can get in anymore.<eos> Now, do you believe me?<eos> Now I do.
Mm. What's your proposal?<eos> 8%.<eos> 8%?<eos> This must really matter to you.<eos> It does.
And the reason it really seems to me that you're involved is there's someone we care a fuck of a lot about on the other side getting squeezed.<eos> No, my father would never... He did.<eos> Did he, uh... Did he sell yet?<eos> No. Not yet.<eos> But when he does...
Rigging an election is a serious accusation.<eos> All the more reason to listen to Peggy.<eos> Where are those newspapers?<eos> I-I had to leave them behind.<eos> Well, of course you did.
Okay.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.
I just painted some U-238 with a radium mixture.<eos> Good job, Aloysius.<eos> Really good work. Oh.<eos> See you learned my first name.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Well, no, but you see someone else here who can?<eos> What does the machine do?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> A cannon.<eos> Something to do with gamma radiation.
Okay, babe, let's do this.<eos> You know who else gets your special medicine?<eos> Who?<eos> Spider-Man.<eos> No he doesn't.
Neither of us slept.<eos> We sang nursery rhymes with her and told her stories.<eos> He'd never had the time to tell her stories before.<eos> At the end... she asked me to sing that song.<eos> And I did.
"I thank whatever Gods may be for your unconquerable soul."<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will treasure it.<eos> Well, I hope this very gloomy looking young man knows how to treasure you.<eos> He does.
No.<eos> I came home to tell him, but I never had a chance.<eos> Grace? Is that you, sweetheart?<eos> -You didn't have to come.<eos> -Of course I did.
You see this door...<eos> It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
Years ago, Mum died, he was sure that... he was visited by her.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
So, she's real crazy.<eos> She's a genius.<eos> Can you decipher it?<eos> I don't speak megalomaniac.<eos> Fortunately, Howard Stark does.
Show of hands... who here has invented a hover car?<eos> Nope?<eos> Nobody?<eos> I win. - It didn't even work!<eos> - The second one did.
I don't want to go get a scone with you this morning and now I'm cruel?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> You're... you've got to be kidding me.<eos> I want to fucking die.<eos> - No, you don't.
It's an honor beyond reckoning.<eos> Who would say no, hmm?<eos> No one.<eos> No one.<eos> And I didn't.
Did she say where she was going?<eos> No.<eos> She was here when I fell asleep and gone when I woke up.<eos> She give you any indication of where she might go?<eos> No... but he did.
This is a coup.<eos> This is the law, her law... a unanimous vote of the ambassadors or death are all that can remove a commander from power.<eos> It's not unanimous.<eos> We don't recognize the legitimacy of Skaikru.<eos> We do.
- No. It isn't, not even close.<eos> Why don't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday?<eos> Come on, Kane.<eos> I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know.<eos> We do.
_<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
We're too late, anyway.<eos> It's already dark.<eos> Raven...<eos> The Raven Reyes I know doesn't give up.<eos> She does now.
It's already dark.<eos> Raven...<eos> The Raven Reyes I know doesn't give up.<eos> She does now.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Well, you just started a war that'll kill us all.<eos> You need to wake up, and don't tell me the difference between Azgeda and Trikru.<eos> Trikru killed 37 of my friends before you even touched the ground.<eos> We didn't start anything.<eos> They did.
- John... - It's not a survivor's move.<eos> Then wait for me.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> In this world, when people leave, they don't come back.<eos> - I did.
Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.<eos> Octavia doesn't.<eos> Your people did not vote for Kane.<eos> Some of them did.
He... He used to beat us.<eos> Koll saved us.<eos> He took my daughter as his own.<eos> We came back to my home, here, to Herot, but I never knew what he was.<eos> I never did!
Each of us are heroes with our own jobs, our own lives, our own problems to deal with.<eos> No joke. Smashing can be a full-time job.<eos> Point is, since there's nothing threatening the world right now, I'm gonna adjourn the...<eos> - Friday, do we have a gavel?<eos> - You do now.
You must want to help the girl, right?<eos> Maybe a little medicine... will trigger your memory, hmm?<eos> You have to understand, the Silent Brothers aren't like us.<eos> They lack your charm and superior people skills?<eos> Yeah, most people do.
It's this way.<eos> I'm sorry... about what I said before about your mom.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> It's cute. You assume I have feelings.<eos> I don't.
"I'm hard AF just thinking about tonight."<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - Calm down, he's doing you a favor.<eos> Girls love that shit.<eos> No, they don't.
She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> - Cool! - Uh-huh.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
I'm not afraid of my past.<eos> I'm just unwilling to believe that you're my future.<eos> And the more you keep repeating that we're destined to be together, the more I want to prove you wrong.<eos> And maybe that makes me childish, and I'm... No.<eos> It doesn't.
Shall we continue with the tour?<eos> Pleased to meet you both.<eos> You two have something in common, I believe.<eos> Isn't that so, Dr. hale?<eos> Yes -- yes, we do.
Don't be taken in.<eos> Bullen -- he sent those men after you?<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out, but it's better you know.<eos> Silas has no intention of bringing your boy to Alexandria.<eos> Never did.
poise in a dinner jacket.<eos> - We need an actor now, am I correct?<eos> - Yes, we do need someone pronto.<eos> - You got a better idea?<eos> - No I don't.
Thank you.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Mr. Dubrow has a telegram on a kidnapping.<eos> - He has it now?<eos> - Yes, he does.
- I need some petty cash. - Okay.<eos> - A hundred thousand.<eos> - A hundred thousand?<eos> - I'm sorry, did I say "petty"?<eos> - You did.
Benedict there, that's Benedict de Bonaventure, he wrote "The House of Ahasuaris."<eos> Enormous hit.<eos> Made the studio millions of dollars.<eos> Did you see any of those millions of dollars, Ben?<eos> I did not.
Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Whoa. Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do.
Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, he's got tattoos.<eos> You have to get those exact same tattoos as Butch.<eos> I do, do I?
No one quits while they're ahead.<eos> This isn't France. It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that. Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> I have to ask... Did you know about Aiden's decision to leave the team?<eos> Yes. He told me this morning.<eos> And did you know he'd signed for Ravonsdale?<eos> No. I didn't.
We had no idea.<eos> I know all of this from the investigation.<eos> I know you had to open some of the roads, but not that one.<eos> Judith opened the wrong one.<eos> No, she didn't.
I've got a small confession to make...<eos> Daddy?<eos> Good afternoon, the police please.<eos> - He begged me to forgive him.<eos> - And did you?
Let's get this thing going, grab our gear, come back for the car later.<eos> Take another way back.<eos> See what we can see.<eos> Think it'll start?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You can't.<eos> Carl?<eos> I thought I saw her that night.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did.
We got tracks right here.<eos> They gotta be in there.<eos> We moving in or what?<eos> How do we know this ain't firecrackers in a trash can?<eos> You don't.
We can help each other.<eos> We're doing fine.<eos> Are you?<eos> We want to generate trade.<eos> Gregory does.
You don't have to do this. You don't have to fight.<eos> Your people killed all of my people.<eos> Of course we gotta fight.<eos> - We didn't want to.<eos> - But you did.
Yeah.<eos> This is good.<eos> Mm, it is.<eos> Jesus came through.<eos> They all did.
No.<eos> You started something.<eos> That's where she died.<eos> All right, so he had to start from here.<eos> He did.
Which way did Dwight run?<eos> Rosita?<eos> We should let him do this.<eos> But he doesn't know what he's doing.<eos> We don't.
If they are, they're dead.<eos> I hope not.<eos> We need them alive.<eos> We need to find out more.<eos> Yeah, we do.
It's fundraising season.<eos> The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job. I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
That's a bold statement.<eos> That's a true statement.<eos> I put you back together again when your whole world burned.<eos> And I found meaning in that.<eos> I still do.
Then I hypnotized him out of it. - Mm.<eos> You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Oh. - Huh? - It only works on him.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
We'd all be better off dead.<eos> We won't have long to wait.<eos> Another month, winter will come, and we'll freeze in these mountains.<eos> They need us for this railroad.<eos> No, they don't.
Your choice.<eos> Why are you scratching your hand?<eos> Why were you doing that?<eos> I had an itch.<eos> No, you didn't.
'Cause the sooner I can help figure out who's after him, the sooner I can focus on packing.<eos> And I think the bossy blouse is perfect, Captain.<eos> You didn't think I was listening, did you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Come on, man. Do you not want this anymore?<eos> If you don't, it's okay, man.<eos> Just be honest with yourself.<eos> I want this fight, Case.<eos> I do.
Prefrontal cortex is barely active.<eos> But memories are backed up in other areas, as well, traces and images tucked throughout the brain.<eos> Just need to dig them out.<eos> You have a problem with this?<eos> Because I do.
We went to Princeton together.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
- Can you see the truth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you receive the evidence I sent to your house?<eos> - Yes, definitely.<eos> - You did?
I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Announce my ascension.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> Don't talk to me as if I'm a fool, Roan.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> He does.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
Roan. He's got you doing everything wrong.<eos> - You're hiding.<eos> - I'm not hiding.<eos> I'm waiting for him to return with the Flame.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
What are you doing?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Monty?<eos> We got here first.<eos> No, we didn't.
Who could blame her?<eos> Go.<eos> What?<eos> Heda requires your presence, Flame Keeper.<eos> Of course she does.
Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> - Oh, jeez.<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh?
He doesn't go, I don't go.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll go without you.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> Actually, we do.
Larry snored.<eos> I used to stick books under the top of his side of the mattress so his head would stay elevated.<eos> - And that worked?<eos> - Not really.<eos> But half an Ativan did.
He's definitely sooty enough.<eos> And he's definitely flush.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> If he has something to hide, I imagine he'll run.<eos> And if he doesn't?
It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
Sit down.<eos> I record my sessions for later review, saves taking notes.<eos> I've never heard my own voice.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> No one does.
Shut up!<eos> No, I take it back!<eos> Ask me one last question!<eos> They'll have us for lunch!<eos> Do something, sir.
Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.<eos> Bobbi and I were on holiday, picking mushrooms ...<eos> In the woods of Siberia in the dead of Winter.<eos> Do you know a better place to find the jumbo chaga mushroom?<eos> Because I certainly do not.
Multiple witnesses saw you pull the trigger.<eos> Do you deny this?<eos> Your first victim.<eos> - Why did you kill him?<eos> - I didn't.
So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.
The water must have collapsed the circuit.<eos> You could've told me.<eos> I would've run faster.<eos> Chadmont, your buddy Nader almost triggered a nuclear disaster.<eos> No, he didn't.
It suggests that he's done this before.<eos> So, potentially, there are more victims in the water.<eos> We need to drag the bay, asap.<eos> I'm sorry, Jack, I don't have those kind of resources.<eos> Well, I do actually.
It's been more than 25 years.<eos> I handle all their paperwork.<eos> It's not easy to deal with the NRIs.<eos> But we had heard that they.. ..Donated a part of their property to the lmambara.<eos> Yes, they did.
You're gonna shut off your brain... and breathe into your body.<eos> - Close your eyes... relax... and let me do all the work.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
Why Grotto?<eos> Because we know your client has worked with Brass before.<eos> You got an in.<eos> If he could get Brass to talk, he would be instrumental in taking down a major drug ring.<eos> If I don't?
You get them Brass and they get you away from the psychopath hunting you.<eos> It ain't just him.<eos> What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?<eos> What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?<eos> They didn't.
I'm proud to be married to one, and I'm proud to have served with one, like Congresswoman Jones.<eos> Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service, and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.<eos> Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn, that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.<eos> Did you connect with LeAnn?<eos> No, I didn't.
No, Your Honor.<eos> You may step down, Ms. Thawley.<eos> Why do they look so angry?<eos> Because they think we lied to them.<eos> But we didn't.
Nice shoes.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you. It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So, you did have a plan.<eos> No, you did.
I promised him I'd be home.<eos> I wasn't there enough for Matt growing up.<eos> - I don't want to make the same mistake.<eos> - He turned out just fine.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You wanna go check the pantry for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> So do you and Caleb see much of each other in DC?<eos> Uh, yeah, we do.
That was awkward.<eos> Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but... Aria maybe.<eos> Why would Ali think that Aria had anything to do with Charlotte's death?<eos> Maybe she did.
You know, all the work you're doing the person you've become your dad would be really proud of you, Emmy.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wasn't expecting anyone.<eos> I thought you went back to Boston.<eos> I did.
- I know him. And I know that Ezra can't look me in the eye when he lies.<eos> And when he told me he went home, he didn't... Look at me.<eos> Well, we have to tell someone.<eos> - Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.<eos> - No, we don't.
Good shot, Arban.<eos> We'll be home behind a wall soon.<eos> Then he will be in someone else's safekeeping.<eos> You said you didn't choose this place.<eos> - I didn't.
Hello, my Princess Ling Ling.<eos> - Am I still a princess?<eos> - Of course you are.<eos> Master Ahmad says I may marry a prince one day.<eos> Does he now?
- Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
-What?<eos> -Your mommy!<eos> That old bag hated me for not being one of her polo club friends' daughter!<eos> -My mom didn't think that.<eos> -Yes, she did!
Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.<eos> -But spare me the setup, all right?<eos> -I don't have a setup.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
O'Neill?<eos> I heard he had kidney stones.<eos> But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
Stop it, Lolly.<eos> We cannot move it.<eos> If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?<eos> Maybe for a minute.<eos> Good, 'cause I did.
We are binge-watching this whole show.<eos> I mean, I haven't been this into something since The Shawshank Redemption.<eos> Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> It does to me.
As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.
I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.
It tastes much better than what you get in the store.<eos> You have been on such a cooking jag lately, sweetie.<eos> - I find it meditative.<eos> - I find eating meditative.<eos> Of course you do.
- Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
Somebody doesn't have to be you.<eos> All right, especially looking like this.<eos> I mean, what if they think you killed her?<eos> Maybe I did.<eos> You didn't.
Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
You're too smart to need anyone.<eos> And it's the smart ones who always survive.<eos> Then survive with me.<eos> Look, Scott's going to have a plan.<eos> They always do.
A means to an end.<eos> I am beyond life and death.<eos> I am infinite.<eos> I have no use for your Deputy.<eos> But we do.
Don't listen to her.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Malia.<eos> I'm taking back what you stole from me.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> But you did.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe someone else who should be Captain?<eos> We'll make it.<eos> Well, guess we have to go now.<eos> No, we don't.
You went by that name in the Army, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Best years of my life.<eos> Do you know any of us?<eos> Of course I do.
Yeah, umm, so, so somebody else updates your calendar for you?<eos> Uh, yeah. There's a campaign aide in charge of coordinating.<eos> That's probably who you talked to, to schedule.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Umm, yes, I did.
Well, I doubt she's asking him for a ride to the airport.<eos> It was a meeting of the minions.<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> Did he go in there with that tube?<eos> No, he didn't.
I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
Unfortunate.<eos> We're evenly matched.<eos> One of us must yield or this will go on for ages.<eos> I have nowhere else to be.<eos> I do.
With magic.<eos> Magic.<eos> Yeah. It's a long story, but the short version is that this totem gives me the ability to channel the ashe-- or the spirit-- of any animal.<eos> Do you have anything of William's with you?<eos> Yes, I do.
There's still some concern about the Star City operation.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Phase 5 requires control over city hall, yet somehow we've found ourselves mired in a petty political race to see that happen.<eos> We didn't exactly plan on Oliver Queen, did we?<eos> No one ever does.
And he saved me.<eos> At great risk to himself, he kept me alive.<eos> I have more reason than anyone to hate this man, but he's our best chance of going home.<eos> He killed your brother.<eos> Yes, he did.
Exactly.<eos> Once I solved that, I knew this might actually work.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
Felicity and I are fine.<eos> Yeah, well, if you were listening to her little asides, you would know that was not true.<eos> John--heh heh--you were the one who told me to give her time.<eos> OK. Do you want to get back together with her?<eos> I do.
Listen. He's not gonna come for anybody. Ok?<eos> He can't.<eos> Merlyn has the idol. Look.<eos> He's probably delivering it to him right now. No, Andy.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You spared the life of the man who killed your mother.<eos> And you killed a friend of mine.<eos> You killed tens of thousands of innocent people.<eos> With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.<eos> This time, I don't.
You can tell people.<eos> Hey, so how was the spa?<eos> Oh, it was fine, though I don't know why they made us face each other during the mother-daughter bikini wax.<eos> Did you two have a nice afternoon?<eos> Sure did.
- So what?<eos> No need to be shy.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'll be really happy if you kissed her.<eos> You did...didn't you?
Anyone so much as sneezes, and it might kill you.<eos> So until you've fully recovered, you are a prisoner... you're my prisoner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I just don't know what to do.<eos> None of us do.
None of us do.<eos> Did you at least tell Coulson we might have a cure?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we don't.
We needed to drain actual Kree blood.<eos> Which is what I have pumping through my veins.<eos> Coulson used it to bring me back after Quinn shot me.<eos> Ward should remember.<eos> He does.
I promised him a multi-million dollar licensing deal with Mobilo Tech.<eos> Elaborate.<eos> First of all, this app doesn't suck.<eos> You see, most smart phones don't seamlessly block... all of your unwanted calls or texts.<eos> This app does.
Where the hell is he?<eos> Hey, Kareem.<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - We're waiting, like, 20 minutes. Does Charlie know the meeting time?<eos> Uh, yes, sir, he does.
She's a nuclear weapon in the wrong hands.<eos> How many of these Inhumans is he controlling?<eos> Not many.<eos> He tried to create his own, but we rained on that parade.<eos> We did.
Then, and now.<eos> It was I who told the human servants long ago of the Emblem's power.<eos> To make them feel safe in our alliance.<eos> I never thought they would use it against him.<eos> But they did.
No, he, uh--<eos> I dropped out.<eos> Joined the army.<eos> Since when does the US Army accept high school dropouts?<eos> They don't.
Move over.<eos> -It was Zig and Sharko.<eos> -Well, I was close.<eos> -I would've thought you knew that.<eos> I do.
-Hello, Budlas. -Oh.<eos> Oh, we're bringing Budlas back?<eos> OK, well, then, hello, Brianna-donna-ding-dong.<eos> - Never caught on.<eos> - At my house it did.
I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
- And once that...<eos> Barry, hurry up!<eos> It's charged.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did. Didn't I?
- Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now, timed with their ascent.<eos> I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one. Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
I cut them there with a stone when I was in this cell. Like you.<eos> Be quiet. Don't...<eos> Don't speak to me.<eos> You have no right to speak to me.<eos> I do.
In the old days, people were afraid something horrible would happen to them.<eos> Now they're afraid nothing will happen to them.<eos> If Zack hadn't come into my life when he did...<eos> I really don't like to think about it.<eos> I really don't.
I asked you to do one thing for me.<eos> To believe in me.<eos> To choose my side.<eos> I asked you to choose me.<eos> But you didn't.
The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
Now, you may have spent your entire life searching for us, but I never, for a second, wanted you.<eos> There's something strange going on in this city.<eos> I can't put my finger on it, but I need to know what it is.<eos> "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."<eos> Unless it don't.
They signed over the deed to the place; they put it in the sister's name.<eos> You can't get in unless she invites you.<eos> Hmm, perhaps I'll lure him out another way.<eos> If killing his girlfriend didn't get him out of the house, I don't know what will.<eos> I do.
I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.
I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I can.<eos> If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.<eos> Of course I do!
Van Nguyen.<eos> All grown up, I see.<eos> Not that it matters, man.<eos> This ain't got nothing to do with you.<eos> Actually, it does.
Do it!<eos> You just need to tell us!<eos> Come on and tell us!<eos> I don't know! - Tell us!<eos> - I don't!
I just want it to be over.<eos> I go on Instagram, I go on Vine, and somebody's got my picture, somebody's saying some stuff, and... My mom just keeps wanting me to talk about it.<eos> She's... she's doing interviews and crap.<eos> She's... She just wants to be there for you.<eos> Now she does.
So, okay.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> All that bitch does is yell.<eos> Do not talk about Mom like that.<eos> She does.
I don't want to fight with you.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now. Haha!<eos> But I do, too.
Uh, who?<eos> My mother.<eos> Oh, well, she would have liked it.<eos> Norman, I don't believe we ever truly lose those we love.<eos> Neither do I.
You did.<eos> I'm sure I can contribute more if I was just put in a position to.<eos> Did you know the Mandels?<eos> No.<eos> Not many people in the LA art community did.
Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
And you still don't.<eos> But you need to know everything.<eos> It'll help you find the Mortal Cup. How?<eos> You're just gonna have to trust me.<eos> I do, more than anything.
Help me! Aah!<eos> We gotta split up.<eos> Not a good idea. I said split up.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Just do it!
Man, do I look like I got 'em?<eos> No.<eos> Dude, I told you to get 'em from the truck.<eos> That ain't what you said.<eos> Man, yeah, I did, man.
Dude, I told you to get 'em from the truck.<eos> That ain't what you said.<eos> Man, yeah, I did, man.<eos> You told me to help what's-his-face here!<eos> No, I didn't, man!
And then what?<eos> Marshmallows.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Does anybody have a car?<eos> I do.
War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
No, I announce the gold category.<eos> -You gave out the bronze.<eos> -I gave out the bronze.<eos> You gave out the silver.<eos> Then I do the gold.
- Poussey got Oriental Trading over there.<eos> Yeah, I think Final Call here is a little different.<eos> Come on, man. Chill.<eos> Uh, Alison... do you have hair?<eos> I do.
Look, you hold the reins here, both of them, and you go one way or the other.<eos> That's very good.<eos> My son loved orcas too.<eos> He always asked me to take him to the attack channel.<eos> I never did...
Hey, Lexi?<eos> If Red Bucket didn't exist, what would happen to the horses?<eos> Where would they go?<eos> Red Bucket does exist.<eos> Well, yeah, but what if it didn't?
I was never on your side.<eos> I was on my side.<eos> - You'll never win!<eos> - Wake up, pal.<eos> We already did.
I bet nothing's moved.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - So tell me.<eos> - How does a blind man box? - Oh, uh...<eos> I don't...
Learned to live with it.<eos> He probably went underground.<eos> Well, six feet, I hope.<eos> You don't have to feel sorry for me.<eos> I don't.
Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
How's your side looking?<eos> The fact of the matter is, Ms. Reyes, the only person who shouldn't be here right now is you.<eos> Seeing as it's a breach of ethics for the prosecuting attorney to communicate with the defendant without his assigned legal counsel present.<eos> So, if you'll excuse us, we'd like to resume convincing Mr. Castle that, unlike his current legal counsel, we can actually help him.<eos> - You already did.
Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
Reyes ordered the DNR on Castle?<eos> His family was gone.<eos> Castle was hanging by a thread.<eos> She just wanted the problem to go away.<eos> Well, it didn't.
Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny.<eos> For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it.<eos> I just--<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
Without this, I'm not alive. I'm not.<eos> Not really.<eos> And I know that now, thanks to you.<eos> I don't know what we are together, and if we have any chance in the future...<eos> I don't...
They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
And he's just one kid?<eos> Alone?<eos> Kid grows up, rounds up every warrior he can.<eos> Men, women, young, old, doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.<eos> And they do.
- That's younger you?<eos> - What'd you tell him?<eos> That we work for a secret agency called A.R.G.U.S.<eos> - I think he bought it.<eos> - Course he did.
Don't act like you're that same cold-hearted bastard that I first met.<eos> I remember Russia.<eos> And you were the one who told me not to kill Stein.<eos> Yeah, because you seem to have a problem with being a killer.<eos> I, however, don't.
- Our Holy of Holies.<eos> The Oculus viewing chamber, our most powerful window into past, present, and future.<eos> The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.
Stop and hear me out.<eos> Men they always want to talk.<eos> Enough!<eos> We want the same thing!<eos> Oh, do we?
What do you get?<eos> Well, sometimes, I have something in mind, but, usually, like with Benny, it's simply to be repaid at a later date.<eos> A devilish IOU, if you will.<eos> Who would take a deal like that?<eos> They all do.
I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.<eos> I'm joking. Puppies don't waltz.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> (laughs): I don't have insecurities.<eos> Mm. Everyone does.
Well, I added it to my joint. (sighs) Well, it's the best part.<eos> So our only evidence is currently in your lungs?<eos> Uh, you really wanted to say "up in smoke" then, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I most definitely did not.
Your mother's Penelope Decker?<eos> - Queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> (gasps) You have to introduce me.<eos> Mm, I don't.
- I'm happy to oblige.<eos> - What do you get?<eos> A devilish I.O.U., if you will.<eos> Who would take a deal like that?<eos> They all do.
God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.<eos> Even in our darkest moments.<eos> Oh, you really believe that.<eos> I do.
I mean, you had moves that made even the Devil blush.<eos> Oh, no, this is bad.<eos> Whatever happened last night, don't tell me, I'd rather not know.<eos> What, that we didn't do the nasty?<eos> We didn't?
It's not my fault that you betrayed your boss.<eos> My problems are your problems.<eos> Which would be the only thing that you and I have in common.<eos> And so you came here because... because you have nowhere else to go?<eos> Yes, I do.
I make a nice living, thanks to my corporate work.<eos> Yeah, you protect your clients like a bulldog, but underneath it all, you're a big softie, aren't you?<eos> I don't need to take money away from those kids.<eos> No.<eos> But Vanessa does.
Gosh, they got away with murder.<eos> You did kill your husband, didn't you?<eos> No, that's absurd.<eos> I have to admit, I'm not entirely sure why, but Detective Decker will figure it out.<eos> She always does.
No need.<eos> We already have everything, how she embezzled money from the foundation, and when Tim found out about it, you killed him.<eos> Ah, see? Told you she'd figure it out.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Actually, we do.
Why do I feel like I'm walking death row?<eos> Should I order my final meal now to save time?<eos> Dan says he has it handled.<eos> You do, right?<eos> I do.
Hi.<eos> Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.<eos> Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.<eos> I thought he killed you.<eos> Oh, he did.
Their dicks up proud in the air<eos> Cuz a vet will fuck you anywhere<eos> They are men - yes sir! With giant balls, for her<eos> They like a laugh, they like a drink They like to screw and we do too!<eos> Oh yes, they do, and we do too
Flu's bad for pigs.<eos> But he's better now.<eos> You have a pig in your truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all do.
My boss isn't always willing to take the necessary steps to get things done.<eos> You're going rogue?<eos> How fun.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Hank.<eos> J'onn.<eos> I should have known... this isn't your fault.<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
Look at me.<eos> J'onn, look at me.<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
-Nobody wants to be around her.<eos> -No.<eos> Just a second--<eos> Oh, come on, you've been saying she drives you crazy for years.<eos> Well, she did.
-No.<eos> Just a second--<eos> Oh, come on, you've been saying she drives you crazy for years.<eos> Well, she did.<eos> And she does.
With those fucking lyrics?<eos> They'll be arrested.<eos> No, they're cool over there.<eos> Nobody will call the cops.<eos> Great if they do.
-Huh? -It is not gay.<eos> At least in the pejorative sense.<eos> We are a group of like-minded individuals that does not want to see this prison overrun by gangs and gang violence.<eos> Don't you want that?<eos> I do. Ow.
I have been crazed.<eos> Yeah, no, don't mention it.<eos> I've been having so much fun.<eos> You'll love it.<eos> Kyle did.
- Thanks.<eos> - Um, are you sure that you don't know anyone by the name of Dmitri Voynov?<eos> Boys, no jumping on the furniture, remember?<eos> Do you have any guns in the house?<eos> Yes, we do.
- Wait, what happened?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> He doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> You sure Secretary Hill said that Albert worked for Voynov? - Yeah.<eos> Doesn't he?
We... saved them. I can't move on, and why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does.
That looks amazing.<eos> I really want that old guy confidence that I see... in the locker room. Yeah. That's another thing.<eos> Another thing I've noticed since joining the gym, there's two types of guys:<eos> Guys that are 65 and older, and then guys that cover their dicks.<eos> Because old guys... do not.
There's like no street parking and your neighbor's dog is a dick.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All right, let's start with the basics.<eos> -Do you have a résumé?<eos> -I do.
I asked myself the exact same question when I lost Brad.<eos> All of that pain, it is... it is overwhelming, isn't it?<eos> It burns.<eos> And that's why you felt the need to take the lives of those boys because each time you took one from this world, you thought that it would stop that pain.<eos> But it didn't, did it?
You really don't want to do this, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't have a choice.<eos> No, no, no, we all have a choice.<eos> You didn't.
He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
-Yes.<eos> Everyone did.<eos> Why-<eos> - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
And I hated you for it.<eos> Robert, this is the great love of your life.<eos> And you're just gonna throw it away?<eos> I didn't throw it away.<eos> He did.
I dig you.<eos> I mean, that's before I found out you were Ted Nugent.<eos> So what is it?<eos> You don't want to hear about the Chilean soap opera that's become my life.<eos> Actually, I do.
There you go, guys.<eos> But-- But why not stay a pilot?<eos> Because I almost died.<eos> I was-- I was flying over Lake Placid one day, and my co-pilot dared me to walk out on the wing and jump.<eos> So I did.
A Mr. Hugh Hefner.<eos> If you'll remember, it was me who lobbied for you when we first met.<eos> I was the one that wanted you as a major investor.<eos> I do remember, and then you threw in with some perfume magnate instead.<eos> No, I didn't do that.
So then you won't get an erection.<eos> It's the point of the wires.<eos> The body doesn't lie.<eos> Look, Dr. Masters, I want to get better.<eos> I really do.
He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
You don't want to do this.<eos> This doesn't have to be the end.<eos> I could not let him go without good heart.<eos> - He deserves that.<eos> - He does.
And now he's come here to finish the job.<eos> Setrakian may be a thief, but he's a fighter.<eos> Which is more than can be said for the lot of you.<eos> We want to know what you've learned from the Lumen.<eos> Of course you do.
The signal paralyzed their communication systems when it paralyzed them.<eos> They just went off his grid.<eos> You want to seal him in this, the device can help you do that.<eos> It worked on strigoi, but do you think it could also incapacitate the Master?<eos> I do.
I heard you, motherfucker, we good.<eos> - Let's get money.<eos> - Let's get it.<eos> Man of the hour, Mr. Rashad Jennings.<eos> James, how you doing?
What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Oh, you know, now it's our club too.<eos> Now that the paperwork is signed, we have to talk.<eos> I don't have a damn thing to say to you.<eos> Oh, but we do.
Is it true?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> And?<eos> Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?<eos> Yes, he does.
Bjorn!<eos> What?<eos> Tell everyone. We're going to make camp here.<eos> Why would we camp here?<eos> - Just do it.
Don't you dare be sorry, Sabine.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> You know, the truth is, I work with men all day and right now, I cannot believe how nice it is to be talking to a woman.<eos> - I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - You did.
Okay.<eos> But together.<eos> I was thinking about something.<eos> If I had found the location on Lobos, you had a plan in place?<eos> I did.
Did you murder Janine Laurent in the early hours of this morning?<eos> This is my child.<eos> It doesn't matter to me what he's done or what becomes of those... ..little tarts who walk the streets of Montmartre at night.<eos> Did you kill Janine Laurent in the early hours of this morning?<eos> Yes, I did.
This is my child.<eos> It doesn't matter to me what he's done or what becomes of those... ..little tarts who walk the streets of Montmartre at night.<eos> Did you kill Janine Laurent in the early hours of this morning?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Yes! I did!
- And where is he?<eos> - With my parents in Bucharest.<eos> But how can you stand it?<eos> Don't you miss him?<eos> I do.
Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
He's not?<eos> His manners, his speech, his drinking...<eos> - He needs a drug and alcohol program?<eos> - No. He used to drink a lot.<eos> And now he doesn't.
Adding to the tension is the defiant Bernie Sanders.<eos> Don't let people tell you that you can't think big!<eos> The Democrats are still struggling to fight the unconventional campaign of that most most unconventional Republican candidate, Donald Trump.<eos> Eight years ago, many Hillary supporters swore they would never vote for Barack Obama.<eos> But then many did.
They're very friendly.<eos> Yeah, I think he... picked up on that.<eos> Isn't he supposed to have a muzzle?<eos> Yeah, he is, but he didn't like it.<eos> Oh, he didn't?
Please, have a seat.<eos> We want to be inclusive.<eos> We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.<eos> We have major support on both sides of the aisle.<eos> Well, you do for now, but not for long.
It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!
Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!
Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!<eos> No, you didn't.
If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.
They still fighting?<eos> Um, they've been inseparable since you left.<eos> You know they take care of each other when you're gone, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course they do.
Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
That was long after he cut off my arm here.<eos> - Grandpa cut off his arm?<eos> - Son.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Last night I'm a hero, but today I'm the enemy.<eos> Where there's a mouthpiece, there's a secret.<eos> Until the virus dies out, we can't break the cordon.<eos> Then how do we get the healthy people out?<eos> We don't.
Can I ask you something?<eos> This Jackson guy.<eos> He wasn't at our wedding, never even heard his name before last week, and then, all of a sudden, he's Boots' lawyer?<eos> How do you guys all know him so well?<eos> We don't really.
- Yeah. And you flip all of them.<eos> They should all reboot.<eos> Got it.<eos> Once that's done, you power up the cannon. - The breach should stabilize.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
It has very little to do with the dead bodies you found at my clinic.<eos> They were simply collateral damage.<eos> My confession deals with the professional killer Frank Kitchen or whatever his real name is.<eos> Contrary to my oath as a physician and all civilized medical standards I performed unwanted and unnecessary radical surgery on Mr. Kitchen whom I admit was a completely unknowing and unwilling patient.<eos> I did it partially for deeply personal reasons.
All right.<eos> Mrs. Willis, what aren't you telling me?<eos> I was just trying to protect her.<eos> Malik's mother doesn't know who her son really was.<eos> But you do?
Leave me alone.<eos> Oh. We got this, girls.<eos> March it out.<eos> Well, for whatever it's worth, dad, I didn't notice.<eos> Gloria did.
-It comes with its own antioxidants.<eos> -It inhibits cancer growth.<eos> It has amazing mouthfeel.<eos> And it doesn't affect taste or smell.<eos> Coconut oil does.
You know, I might have said some terrible things to her, but I was drunk.<eos> -I didn't mean it.<eos> -Oh, really?<eos> Did you know in North Korea they use vodka as truth serum?<eos> No, they don't.
-Big picture, Robert.<eos> -Ooh, pretty.<eos> I don't understand the problem.<eos> The problem is you don't understand the problem.<eos> - I don't.
I don't need no police.<eos> - So why'd you call us?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You didn't call us?<eos> Who did?
He just needs to talk to my brother.<eos> About what?<eos> You know, my family's helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so if you could just tell him to contact my brother.<eos> I don't even know if I'll hear from him again.<eos> - But if you do?
I want the truth, Bobby!<eos> All of it!<eos> I told you everything on the tape yesterday.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Usually they're along the retaining wall of the property.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hmm. No valve out here.<eos> You all have a basement?<eos> We do.
We can't trace all these people.<eos> Until the virus dies out, we can't break the cordon. Yeah.<eos> OK, fine.<eos> But how do we get the healthy people out?<eos> We don't.
Can we save the detective act for the morning?<eos> Please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you have a bad day?<eos> In an endless stream of them, yeah, I did.
Well, with this heat, could you blame her?<eos> Just because you haven't seen her, that doesn't mean...<eos> You know exactly what that means.<eos> I know you're probably gonna tell me that me being up here, being able to look in, has absolutely no effect on whether she's still alive.<eos> No. It doesn't.
You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> - Don't test these guys.<eos> - I didn't even touch him.<eos> But I did.
They're letting people out!<eos> You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours.<eos> - Get out of my way. - (guns cock)<eos> I didn't even touch him. LEX:<eos> I did.
We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.
He took our blood.<eos> He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C.<eos> - What are you doing? - Come on, man.<eos> We got to try it again.<eos> That thing that we did in World War II.
- And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.<eos> Change the course of the entire world.<eos> So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times,<eos> - how do we stop him?<eos> - We don't.
Yeah.<eos> I just snapped.<eos> And I'm not sorry about it, either.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, he had it coming.<eos> They all do.
Boots is lying in a hospital bed.<eos> Gil told me you're his lawyer and that he got arrested for attempted murder.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> - I didn't lie.<eos> Yes, you did!
No papers, no clothes, no place to hide? You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos<eos> - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
You "had to"?<eos> I, I had to.<eos> I believed I had to.<eos> Like you believed you had to sacrifice your boy to the power you're serving now.<eos> What if you didn't?
This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no. Sabine,<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
Sharing secrets.<eos> She told Sabine that she killed René.<eos> Wait, René died in Ste.<eos> Lynette.<eos> Yeah, he did.
I will no longer be France's vassal.<eos> In a few years' time, he'll be ordering his Council to double the price of wheat and throwing anyone who protests in jail.<eos> Do you have a problem with this?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
What are you doing, Marcheaux?<eos> Let's see who the orders are from?<eos> No royal assent?<eos> Minister Treville needs no royal assent.<eos> Yes, he does.
The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
I've never called you that.<eos> Really?<eos> I think I'd remember calling you a stupid nickname.<eos> Thought maybe that interview triggered something.<eos> Oh, well, it didn't.
You all knew him.<eos> You worked for him.<eos> And when he got drunk, he was a totally different person.<eos> One time, I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> But he didn't.
I've been checking all the bars nearby.<eos> I want to know if anyone saw my friend here the other night, hmm?<eos> Oh, yeah, I know him.<eos> He's the guy that killed that actress.<eos> No, no, he didn't.
I really don't want to hurt you, but I just felt it best to be up front and honest.<eos> Of course.<eos> And I suppose it was a lot of me to ask of you anyway.<eos> So, you understand?<eos> I do. Completely.
I had Zoila then.<eos> Men have come and gone, but Zoila...<eos> She was my constant.<eos> She just needs time. She'll come around.<eos> What if she doesn't?
The winter of that year proved to be unseasonably warm, and by February, all that was left of the snow on the sides of the highways had turned mostly black.<eos> It rained too much in the spring, and the fruit in the trees hung heavy at the ends of bent branches.<eos> The sun in the summer months was unreasonably hot and stung my bare shoulders whenever I let it.<eos> I remember thinking that it felt like fall would never come.<eos> And then it never did.
- It's true.<eos> - Was this part of the plan?<eos> - No.<eos> This just happened.<eos> No, it didn't.
You have something you want to talk about, T?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eddie.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> We do?
Ever since the skies parted and showed me another world... with another speedster.<eos> Once I saw you, I came here, figured out what I had to do.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> We saw you die.<eos> You did.
I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> I shouldn't have put you in this position.<eos> I wanted it.<eos> I still do.
- I didn't give him your badge.<eos> - You lost that on your own.<eos> - Oh, Jesus, come on.<eos> Did it feel good, Mark?<eos> Doing what you did to him?
I want him to see me on my feet.<eos> For him to know that I've beat the count. Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
He better pack up his shit and get the fuck out of town before whatever you're here for gets real.<eos> What do you think I'm here for?<eos> Must be big.<eos> Considering what I'm guessing you did to get this house.<eos> And what you did to Anderson.
He is a false prophet.<eos> If we don't stop him, the devil will reign for a thousand years.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> That that man is the devil and that you have to stop him, no matter what?<eos> Yes, I do.
You know, I've been asking myself the same thing.<eos> But doesn't matter now.<eos> I'm not gonna stick around much longer.<eos> Wait, I thought you said your powers don't work inside this cell?<eos> They don't.
- To help on the case.<eos> He's already pleaded guilty.<eos> What do I need help with?<eos> - You made it.<eos> - Of course I did.
- You're the whore.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You waited until after you screwed me to show me that gun.<eos> And I fell for it, even thought about breaking the law for you, because I thought I knew you.<eos> But I don't, do I?
Jason lied to you.<eos> He stood there over your son while he bled out.<eos> Hate won't win.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Well, it just did.
- Who did?<eos> - My foster family.<eos> They thought it'd help me acclimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> No, of course you did. I-I just...
- You mean you do?<eos> You said you wanted to know me, even the bad things.<eos> Because I never thought you'd admit - to killing a pregnant sorority girl. - Hey.<eos> Everything that has happened, Sam dying, whatever it is that happened to Rebecca, although something tells me you killed her, too.<eos> - I didn't.
Because you want me to ignore what you did.<eos> That's not what I'm asking for.<eos> Then why are we down here?<eos> To find out if I told Annalise?<eos> Well, I didn't.
What can I help you with?<eos> Philip Jessup.<eos> Wish I had something.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Now you do.
Where were you at 8:30 p.m. the night Emily Sinclair was murdered?<eos> Uh, that was a long time ago so I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I think you remember.<eos> - Except I don't.
Stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just... You're welcome for saving your relationship.<eos> I thought you stopped drinking.<eos> I did.
After everything that he's done...<eos> You act like he beat me.<eos> No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.<eos> How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.
Good. Could've told me that downstairs.<eos> Yeah, I-I know. I just thought maybe we should talk about... you know.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.
She won't, and neither will Caleb, who hopefully isn't dead right now.<eos> Yeah, I do just... I want to say this.<eos> Um... It was bad morally. I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
Well, sure.<eos> It makes for a good story.<eos> Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage that we can't really control.<eos> You know, I mean, these things have a way of taking on a life of their own.<eos> Like the Zoe Barnes story did about my nomination for Secretary of State.
Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage that we can't really control.<eos> You know, I mean, these things have a way of taking on a life of their own.<eos> Like the Zoe Barnes story did about my nomination for Secretary of State.<eos> Except that one we planted.<eos> - And this one you didn't.
Why the fuck am I yelling?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> - Hey. - How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
What?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Don't make a big deal about this.<eos> - Oh, my God. He fucking lied.<eos> Of course he did.
How? You told us she was dead.<eos> Her hair was different, the way she moved was different, but it was her, I know it was her.<eos> But she died in your arms, Nick.<eos> You said.<eos> She did.
Her hair was different, the way she moved was different, but it was her, I know it was her.<eos> But she died in your arms, Nick.<eos> You said.<eos> She did.<eos> She did.
By herself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, somebody does.
Awesome.<eos> All right, Dean, you need to go back.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, no, we got to -- we got to go see if it worked, see if Amara is alive or dead.<eos> We don't.
Panhandle.<eos> What brought you down here?<eos> I came for my son.<eos> - He told me you two had met.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Now, she's just a friend.<eos> I thought you weren't divorced yet.<eos> Well, I don't think London wants to hear about this. - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> - Oh, she does.
No.<eos> Did Chip live here with his ex-wife?<eos> What was her name again?<eos> Tilly.<eos> No. No, he didn't.
Nothing.<eos> - I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Okay, tomorrow.<eos> - You're certain Underwood knew?<eos> - And Walker didn't.
Come on, Charlie.<eos> - Have you ever been in the Oval?<eos> - Once, when I was a kid.<eos> My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.<eos> Of course they did.
Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this, but let's just cut to the chase.<eos> The allegations that you're making are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.<eos> I had nothing concrete then.<eos> This time I do.
Yeah, she's my partner.<eos> Is she gonna take a shot at me if I untie her?<eos> Not if she knows what's good for her.<eos> You fuckers really don't know who this is, do you?<eos> He does.
You're sure?<eos> Well, it couldn't have been a Quantum. He had some kind of tech. Maybe he's a shape shifter.<eos> It looked like Laser, but it wasn't him.<eos> Yeah, we don't know that.<eos> I do.
I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
- I'm on a rescue mission.<eos> - Who are you trying to rescue?<eos> Ross Edwards.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you.<eos> For what?<eos> Well, in the time of crisis, a group needs a leader, and you're that leader.<eos> I didn't ask for that.<eos> Yeah, well, a leader never does.
- I could get them information about the campus... entrances, exits, how many guards.<eos> The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.<eos> But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.
The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.<eos> But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> I do.
But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> I do.<eos> Your mother does.
That's all that this is.<eos> Or anxiety or exhaustion or any of the number of excess pressures they put on us here.<eos> Don't forget I have four weeks on you.<eos> This will pass.<eos> And what if it doesn't, Drew?
What do you want?<eos> I think you know who I am.<eos> Secretary Hill hired you, uh, twice to take me out, if I remember correctly.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you do.
They may just pardon you.<eos> - You told her.<eos> - What?<eos> About me.<eos> I didn't!
Fuck her.<eos> What are you doing? Not right here.<eos> Come on, big college man.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> I do.
"You shoot the shit out of him. "<eos> Before I got into the Tower, and this is not too nice, I took up a position behind a column at the Academic Center.<eos> And I gave him the I-talian digit.<eos> He fired once at the column and hit it.<eos> But he didn't do it again.
Maybe half the Hero League for all I know.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Remember the question?<eos> ! I had no idea that shit was gonna go down!<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, well, guess what.<eos> Mikey McFarlane was just in Grand Rapids and he told me how you fucked me, college buddy.<eos> You have any idea what happened to me after I missed out on that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
Three, two... One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you.<eos> - I do!
Can we slow the fuck down, please!<eos> Who walks around with their passport in a foreign country?<eos> - I do.<eos> - So do I. Everybody does.<eos> No, they don't.
Yeah. Um, I know.<eos> Well, you know, I didn't think he was gonna do it.<eos> But then I was pretty sure that, you know, he was gonna come back.<eos> So I'm-I'm not exactly sure if this, like, affects things m-moving forward. Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
Maybe that's all part of it.<eos> A whole other conversation happening with your smile.<eos> Do you want to fuck?<eos> I used to not say what I think.<eos> Now I do.
- in her murder.<eos> - Okay, look.<eos> You can speculate all you want on that, but you're gonna have to have some pretty hard evidence for that to stand up in court.<eos> - I didn't kill her.<eos> - Then who did?
If you are able to tell us who murdered her and we are able to secure a Case on the strength of your information, then I see no reason why we cannot release you.<eos> Joel Kransey.<eos> You know where he might be?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, I'm interested in reading contemporary social sciences.<eos> No, look, how do blind people read big books?<eos> They said, "They don't."<eos> Anyway, um, I'll sort it out, so thanks for your advice.<eos> They don't.
I have my kingdom and the future of my reign to consider.<eos> And our child. Wha...? What of our child?<eos> Elizabeth, that child gives us motive. We could both go to the gallows for Amy's death.<eos> But this child was to be our greatest blessing, and what do I do about it?<eos> Robert, what do I do?
Yeah?<eos> They must have spotted Vincent coming to the park.<eos> What?<eos> - I don't know how they did it, but he's got to get out of there.<eos> You both do. Now.
No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her.<eos> - The problem is... - How can they not know?<eos> - They don't pay 'em!<eos> - No, they do!
- That might make me happy.<eos> - Sure! Absolutely.<eos> Except I haven't got one.<eos> - You do! - No...<eos> - Do I?
That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife!<eos> - I know.<eos> - But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
I was struggling but then he had his hand on my throat.<eos> He's pressing down on me, he's inside me without a condom and I can't breathe.<eos> And he's a big fella and I can feel meself going red in t'face.<eos> And he goes, "If you don't stop wriggling, I'm going to shove "a broken bottle up you."<eos> Did he indeed?
! - Get out. - Do you have any idea where you are?<eos> Get out. Get out of here.<eos> G... they're just stupid kids, man.<eos> I don't know what happened here, Gil.<eos> Nobody does.
you have to be careful.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.<eos> But we need answers, right?<eos> Yeah. We do.
So, what do you want to listen to?<eos> Little classical, jazz, some hip-hop?<eos> All right, we'll go with some jazz.<eos> You know why I pulled you over?<eos> No, I don't, Officer.
Talk to me.<eos> Killian!<eos> He doesn't know we came for him. We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.
It really is nice to meet you, In person, finally.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Tell me a little bit about yourself.<eos> Do you really have 3 ph.D.S? Yes.<eos> Um, I--yeah, I do,
Right now is what's--<eos> You are here.<eos> Do you know what's happening right now?<eos> It is--it is done. The dirty dozen is done.<eos> Yes, done.
Please.<eos> The party was lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When were you going to tell me that you lost your grip on reality?<eos> I just did.
You're the easiest way to get to Stefan.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.
Yes.<eos> A nice little visit.<eos> It's the least I can do for one of my fans.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
So, what I was thinking was, well, maybe we can make it back here later in the month to see it ourselves, you know?<eos> Solo tu y yo. And believe it or not, your father actually won some money tonight, so he can pay for everything.<eos> That'll teach him.<eos> I know how much you wanted to see it, mijita, and what it means to you.<eos> Everybody does.
just like you did before.<eos> you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
Open the door.<eos> N-A-V-A-B-I.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Do it!
Agent Mojtabai, stand down.<eos> Aram. Aram, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't blame you for letting me out.<eos> I don't.
I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
Except she found out the truth, confronted you, and that's why you killed her.<eos> I didn't kill Robyn.<eos> I-I didn't even know she found out the truth.<eos> Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.<eos> I just did.
Yeah.<eos> You know, sometimes, I wonder if I do... have it naturally.<eos> What if it's all just one big party trick that never adds up to anything?<eos> So?<eos> What if it doesn't?
To the murder site!<eos> Do you think you've been clever?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You told her about Sally.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Did you notice any strangeness in mood or behaviour?<eos> Not that I can recall.<eos> From something he said, I had the feeling...<eos> You may think me callous or hysterical, but I could almost believe that Francis had intended to kill himself.<eos> Did he?
Perhaps you'd better secure the lady before you start spending her fortune.<eos> Mr Aukitt.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Remind me, you still have shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm weary to the bone.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I did see him with my own eyes.<eos> Elizabeth looked well tonight.<eos> She did.
- Pennsylvania?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's where Andre Hannan is. He's on death row.<eos> - You want to go see him?<eos> - I do.
art forgery.<eos> You know, Bob Ross always made it look so easy.<eos> Happy trees, happy clouds.<eos> Bob didn't paint psychologically disturbing naked people.<eos> Well, Winton Miller did.
My name is Rebecca Harris, and you're probably wondering why a bullet is coming my way at about 1,900 miles an hour.<eos> I wasn't raised for gunplay.<eos> In fact, I grew up in a creative household, surrounded by art and laughter.<eos> If things had kept going the way they started, I'd probably still be making pictures today.<eos> They didn't, though.
Sit.<eos> Down.<eos> You're angry with me, huh?<eos> You don't want to get into this with me right now.<eos> I do.
Down.<eos> You're angry with me, huh?<eos> You don't want to get into this with me right now.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
- She's wondering if Peter is on his way.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> The Director got to your office two minutes ago.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
I wouldn't know.<eos> But you're going to have the distinguished honor of becoming the first American official ever to be charged with even a single war crime let alone the slew of them you will undoubtedly be accused of before the week is out.<eos> The United States isn't party to the Rome treaty.<eos> - We don't recognize its authority.<eos> - But Venezuela does.
If someone can't pay We sit down, we discuss it<eos> Like civilized men And women, no?<eos> ...Doña venganza,<eos> You need to teach them a lesson.<eos> All the lords do.
All right? We go to mid-bosses and we beg for money.<eos> This place is built on bad blood, On the body of a dead kid.<eos> So we're going to go there again.<eos> I didn't kill kate.<eos> Carlos did.
The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.
Philip!<eos> Philip!<eos> Philip!<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes ya do.
Thank you Philip.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Y'all know how to read?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do?
Why is that?<eos> 'Cause I know you ordered the murder of Nomar Arcielo, and I know you had Tommy Egan do it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I didn't kill anyone, and I don't even know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course we do.
Well, what the fuck are you waitin' for?<eos> Go!<eos> I don't think he likes taking orders from me.<eos> Little secret? Mmm.<eos> Nobody does.
She was all bitten up by rats. Covered in blood, foaming' at the mouth, all right? So, I ran, I got Dad, and I...<eos> Are you fucking with me right now?<eos> - Dad shot Peaches?<eos> - No.<eos> I did.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> No. Ohh, ohh...<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Actions have consequences.<eos> I didn't do it.
No, the call's just to discuss the decision.<eos> Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.<eos> D'you want us to read it to you?<eos> But he should have called you first.<eos> But he didn't.
Come on, you know what I mean.<eos> I'm not here just so you can pimp my ride or to help you around the house.<eos> It's time to get back to shit that matters.<eos> Yeah, Special Forces certainly doesn't make a habit of putting gimps back in the action.<eos> No, they sure as hell don't.
Well, I couldn't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> Mike's been arrested.<eos> Jessica's talking about unindicted co-conspirators.<eos> Okay, well then, he and Harvey will just have to work it out.<eos> And what if they don't?
I think McCarthy's telling Slavich that he needs help getting out of the country.<eos> Slavich's next shift starts in four hours.<eos> We're gonna take a team, stake it out, see if McCarthy shows.<eos> Abby Carroll may turn up with McCarthy.<eos> And if she does?
Yes.<eos> And you didn't hear anything?<eos> I've been... taking a tonic to help me sleep. Why didn't the poltergeist kill you, too?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I do.
There isn't.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I do.
Rachel, what's going on?<eos> I just got a call.<eos> They took Donna down to the US Attorney's office.<eos> We have to get down there right now.<eos> No, we don't.
He wanted to know if you would consider investing in his real estate project.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do that.<eos> You just said that you would do anything for me.<eos> I meant I'd consider anything.<eos> And I just did.
You better watch yourself.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now, you do.
But you?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> You trust me to do that?<eos> (SCOFFS) No, Mike.<eos> Jessica does.
I told you, the only problem with that theory is,<eos> David Green tells Gibbs about you and his career is done.<eos> Then he must have told her anonymously.<eos> Which doesn't help us, because we still don't have any proof that she contacted the Dean.<eos> No, we don't.
Donna, he may not be my enemy, and you may not be my enemy, but as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson,<eos> I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
Mr. Specter's interviews for the position currently filled by Michael Ross.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I assisted in the process, yes.<eos> Did you find it suspicious that Mr. Ross wasn't listed on the Harvard class ranking from his first year?<eos> - No, I didn't.
It says you don't have faith in him.<eos> Donna, you don't know what you're saying. Don't I?<eos> I know I'm not a lawyer, but isn't it true that if Mike gets found innocent, there's no double jeopardy, but if a mistrial happens, they might come after him again one day?<eos> Yes, Donna, that is true, but Harvey and I are banking that never happens.<eos> - And what if it does?
I know, because he'll never be convinced.<eos> Which is why we need to go to Gibbs together...<eos> - Goddamn it, Jessica, we don't have any time!<eos> Did it ever occur to you that if Mike gets found guilty, the first thing Harvey is going to do is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you?<eos> - No, it didn't.
I don't know, Donna, but I can't afford to be wrong about this.<eos> Then let me as you a question:<eos> Why aren't you talking to Dr. Agard about this?<eos> - How do you know about her?<eos> - Because I do.
Although I suppose life in the abbey must be full of intrigue.<eos> What I am interested in is a proposition.<eos> Care to hear it?<eos> RICHARDS: You have a job for The Vehm?<eos> I do.
Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
Isn't that right, comrade Rostova?<eos> I told you not to call me that.<eos> Comrade--<eos> Mr. Pitt and I have a plane to catch.<eos> We most certainly do not.
Josephine's father was the most prolific criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe.<eos> But for all his success, he had a problem, an enemy.<eos> An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl--<eos> Yes, you did.
LIZ: It's very generous.<eos> I can appreciate that it comes from a place of concern.<eos> But it's dirty money, and I just don't want it.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> No, but your child does.
You brought him here.<eos> No, i...<eos> Does he know about me?<eos> What i've done?<eos> Does... He...
He told me you're estranged.<eos> And my name's Elizabeth, by the way.<eos> He couldn't find you, so--<eos> Anyway, he says it explains everything.<eos> Yes, it does.
I'd forgotten.<eos> I understand we'll be working together to find the man who took Elizabeth.<eos> - You took her from me.<eos> - No.<eos> Alexander Kirk did.
Ensign. You're supposed to be off-duty right now.<eos> Sorry, captain.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> Our visitor leaves a strong impression.<eos> Yes, it does.
The exoskeleton is quite formidable.<eos> Complex living polymer chains interwoven with infrangible metals and minerals.<eos> I am not able to calculate how it propels itself at... such high velocities, although obviously it does.<eos> Nor am I able determine how it survives the vacuum of space, but...<eos> But obviously it does.
- Affirmative.<eos> Yet you turned down admission.<eos> Did your "human emotions" play a role in that decision?<eos> No sir.<eos> They did not.
A large faction on Tellar Prime argues against our government's stance on this matter.<eos> And I, for one, am part of that faction.<eos> I believe one of your greatest human writers once said...<eos> "A lady's 'verily' is as potent as a lord's."<eos> That he did, sir.
And she spoke of you and Paige, wanted to send a message that she loved you.<eos> Did she?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did she really say that?<eos> Of course she did.
Who was the... First one?<eos> Mark, when I was, um, in eighth grade.<eos> He used to come over.<eos> How did it... Start?<eos> It just did.
He was defending one of us.<eos> Evy was being harassed.<eos> Mateo was protecting her.<eos> S-she doesn't deserve suspension.<eos> Those black boys do.
I went to the bathroom door and called the kid.<eos> Then she started screaming.<eos> - I took off.<eos> - You went in.<eos> I didn't.
But here is where I need to start rebuilding.<eos> You know, this has all... It's all played out very publicly, and when things...<eos> It... it doesn't make it any easier<eos> - to focus on what you need to focus on.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
Look, I'm boarding from New York right now. I'll take a direct flight to Indy.<eos> Just... breathe.<eos> I'm going into work.<eos> No, n-no. - Mm, yeah. - Don't...<eos> Don't do that.
We got about a mile...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> We got about a mile, and then it got too dark for us to see anything, and you told me to turn around.<eos> And we did.
Your wife was almost two months pregnant,<eos> Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
She was gonna... she was gonna keep it.<eos> So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something? You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
He was found torched in his car yesterday.<eos> Are you messing with me right now?<eos> No.<eos> You have anybody in custody?<eos> No, we don't.
And you let Evan step into her shoes.<eos> I'm gonna talk to you however the hell I want to talk to you.<eos> You flip the minnows to get to the sharks.<eos> Do you even know how Narcotics works?<eos> - Actually, I do.
You ever want to see him again?<eos> So these are copies of what I submitted to the Ivory Tower.<eos> My NPR and a To-From to my commander and a closing report.<eos> It lays out what I did...<eos> And what I didn't do.
And then everything dies anyway, right?"<eos> --"But you just keep doing it."<eos> Washington showed me this when I started the garden.<eos> She thought I'd like it.<eos> I do.
What are you asking me?<eos> If she deserved to die?<eos> No!<eos> There were conflicting reports with some key witnesses claiming she had a weapon.<eos> Man, like hell she did!
Shoot him!<eos> You like that? Huh?<eos> Come on, girl!<eos> Come on!<eos> Just do it!
You like that? Huh?<eos> Come on, girl!<eos> Come on!<eos> Just do it!<eos> Do it!
Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
- He doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> So you don't like it?<eos> He likes it.<eos> We both do.
Congratulations.<eos> For?<eos> Effective immediately, you're promoted to acting director of the Stitchers Program.<eos> Not sure I want the job.<eos> Sure you do.
She wants to get her hands on this house.<eos> Pack me off to watch Wheel of Fortune and drool with other unloved old people.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> She seemed nice.<eos> Of course she did.
I mean, come on, we both know I'm not innocent.<eos> Yeah, but you never--<eos> Okay, you did... shoot a human being with a hunting rifle.<eos> But she had it coming.<eos> No, she didn't.
She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
Call me.<eos> You want to tell me why a federal prosecutor's bugging my apartment?<eos> Is it better or worse when you thought I was CIA? - No, no.<eos> You have no right...<eos> - Actually, I do.
- Start talking.<eos> He's one of our founding members.<eos> Integral to the design of this plan.<eos> We should have paid attention to the warning signs, but his strengths outweigh his flaws.<eos> - Till they didn't.
Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?<eos> Ryan, how was D.C.?<eos> Well, I briefed Congress, who seems to think that I know exactly what happened.<eos> Still not sure I do, but...
Sadie Beakman caught her in the act and the defendant killed her in order to get away.<eos> Isn't that all circumstantial?<eos> Yes, which is why it's a good thing I have you...<eos> An eyewitness. The defendant really should've taken that plea deal I offered.<eos> Yeah. Why didn't she?
You couldn't just leave it, could you?<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I did.<eos> Except Sadie didn't, did she?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
She seemed fine.<eos> Her usual upbeat self.<eos> When did you realize that something was wrong?<eos> Usually Claire would beat me home from work.<eos> But that day she didn't.
- No, you're engaged.<eos> - Maybe we can bet just pennies.<eos> I think I'm more comfortable with pennies.<eos> Is it true that everybody has a tell?<eos> Well, I most certainly do not.
Milah was here?<eos> Milah?<eos> She helped us get to you.<eos> Hades has much to answer for.<eos> Indeed he does.
I would never have said you were.<eos> May I remind you that neither of us will ever discover anything more important or wonderful than what is in that desert?<eos> - If only everyone felt the same way.<eos> - Yes, well, they should.<eos> But they don't.
This is Carter you're talking about!<eos> You have known him for 15 years.<eos> He is your best friend.<eos> He went behind my back!<eos> No, he did not!
Real sister?<eos> How?<eos> Uh, we have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
Rachel's contact, he did their wet work, their cleaning.<eos> - Is he your source?<eos> - Yeah, I made a decision.<eos> Sometimes you have to work with people you don't like.<eos> No, we don't.
You keep banging on my door asking for favors.<eos> You ever think about what I might want?<eos> All right, what?<eos> I need to know exactly what's going on between you and this twin of yours.<eos> - No, you don't.
Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
Susan gets to restart human cloning with new lab rats to study the genome.<eos> And in return, you get that bot out of your face, and we get to collaborate on a cure.<eos> Aren't you and Scott well on your way to that?<eos> The last viral vector didn't work.<eos> And even if the next one does...
It wasn't me!<eos> It doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> You don't actually believe her?<eos> She's got the genome, she doesn't need to do this.<eos> But Ira does.
You still feeling it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two-day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
Hello, this is Doctor Ana?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hi! - Hi!<eos> - Do you speak English?<eos> - Yes I do.
It can be very... tense.<eos> And the models, getting them to do what you want,<eos> - when you want, the way you want.<eos> - I try to keep a level head.<eos> Uh-huh. You didn't, though, on December 10th, 2014, did you?
But one of us would have seen him.<eos> Not if he had his timings right...<eos> It takes two people to get someone into a dress?<eos> Quite intricate.<eos> .. which he did.
This... .. is the photograph we enlarged, only to discover that within it was the image of Zoe's actual murder taking place.<eos> The other ten or so images are the ones that were taken around it, and there was something about them that bothered me, something that I couldn't quite get my head round, and then it hit me -- they were all framed identically.<eos> The angle didn't change once.<eos> And you presumed we'd never notice.<eos> But unfortunately for you, we did.
So close, Jay.<eos> So close.<eos> Mind your head.<eos> Excuse me, do you have a moment?<eos> Of course I do!
She's alive.<eos> We still gotta do it.<eos> No.<eos> We don't have to do it.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I'm not a mechanic.<eos> McDonald, let's put our new trainees to work while we wait on the fix.<eos> Everyone, grab a shovel and let's get started.<eos> Uh, shouldn't we finish going through safety training - before we get started?<eos> - You did.
I mean, he's all over.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, just because I sit behind a desk all day does not mean your job is harder than mine.<eos> As a matter of fact, it does.
But we cannot do this without safety divers and assistant divers.<eos> They will make sure that we get out safely, and they act as a link between us and the surface.<eos> I am the surface manager.<eos> I handle the operation on the surface.<eos> The others do the diving.
We felt so great after the successful dive on Monday.<eos> In many ways it went better than we expected.<eos> Even though you try to avoid being lulled into thinking the next dive will be easy, that's kind of what happened.<eos> You should never expect that a dive will go well.<eos> Because then it never does.
- $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
So you from Mexico or Guatemala?<eos> Mexico.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Know how to cook that Mexican food?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Please...<eos> You don't have to do...<eos> You don't have to do this...<eos> You don't have to... do this...<eos> No, I don't.
I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So, until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I do.
I'm gonna take another quick look for Gorman...<eos> It's a gong show up there because of that explosion and you got ferals everywhere,<eos> You are gonna have to take point, you ready for that?<eos> Always gotta be last man out, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't think so, you know what I mean?<eos> You only get it once.<eos> You're going to live it to the full.<eos> Have it!<eos> And we did!
Writing songs is difficult.<eos> Talking shit is easy.<eos> When I do an interview, I'm there to be a fucking gob-shite and to cause as much fucking trouble as possible.<eos> As soon as people realise that the majority of people in this country take drugs, then, I mean, the better off we'll all be.<eos> Everybody does it.
Okay, I reconsider cutting this short, since we know you're a paid informant for the FBI.<eos> You told Agent Lange you have no connection to Heavy.<eos> But... she doesn't know that your boy, THX, helped him kill Retro Girl.<eos> - She doesn't know?<eos> - No, she does not.
Waverly, I can explain.<eos> There is a face that I didn't want to see again.<eos> Jay Novak, my probation officer.<eos> Why would your friend Henry kill him?<eos> - He didn't.
- Auggie never made it to court?<eos> - Mm-mm. Disappeared the night before the trial.<eos> People say foul play was involved.<eos> Wait. How can August be a revenant, I mean, if Wyatt didn't kill him?<eos> Oh, but he did. Most definitely.
I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.<eos> You have all the time in the universe...<eos> - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.
So all of Zoom's meta-humans are locked up in Iron Heights?<eos> Most of them.<eos> Some are somewhere else.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> No you don't.
- Ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can't stop thinking about my dad's doppelganger.<eos> Seeing him, knowing that he's out there, that should've made it easier.<eos> It doesn't.
- My son is a hero!<eos> You hear me?<eos> He's a hero! You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
That's it. That's all that happened, okay?<eos> - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
Yes, but I never specified a timeframe.<eos> Are you serious? I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this?<eos> - In the front, Richard.<eos> - Laurie, did you know about this?<eos> - I did not.
Where'd you learn to kill?<eos> Your pops?<eos> It just came to him like it comes to all of us.<eos> Necessity.<eos> How many you done?
All my guests, it was a sickness.<eos> I couldn't let it spread.<eos> I locked them in...<eos> Hector and I... till help could come.<eos> It never did.
Shoot, you could come out of this a hero.<eos> I don't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you.<eos> Look, just be careful how you play this, Dad.<eos> We need them.<eos> No, we don't.
You know, he was-- he was sick and we were still figuring shit out.<eos> We didn't know how it worked. We didn't know what was gonna end up happening to him.<eos> We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn.<eos> Troy knew that, so he made us promise not to let that happen to him.<eos> And we didn't.
What?<eos> I just- - I thought I was doing the right thing by not telling you. I didn't know.<eos> I just- - I didn't know what--<eos> You told me he fell asleep.<eos> He didn't.
Good luck, fellas.<eos> Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.<eos> Leave all the talking to me.<eos> And if you mention my Montblanc, then... don't make it overt, like I told you to.<eos> But do.
I could simply change you, make you follow me.<eos> But that's not my way.<eos> I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you.<eos> Because when you do, you won't have the faintest idea what to do with yourself.<eos> And I do.
I want to know, is Fitzgerald Grant hell-bent on making a difference in the final days of his presidency, or is he happy just tending the store?<eos> I want to know if the man I voted for thinks he succeeded or failed.<eos> I have no ulterior motive here, aside from wanting to write a damn good article.<eos> Do you want me to write a damn good article?<eos> Of course we do.
Rub your penis without the cream, it'll get bigger."<eos> That is the nature of rubbing and penises.<eos> They bloody love it!<eos> Second thing, if this stuff actually worked, wouldn't the guy in the after photos in the advert also have massive hands?<eos> He did not.
Always wanted to visit the postcard museum.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop.<eos> We don't.
Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did.
Good night.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> Was that a "bending" compliment, or a real compliment?<eos> Why should it matter?<eos> Because it does.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You see, I'm a writer, too.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> I have an idea for a nikki heat novel.<eos> -Of course you do.
The man that closes that hatch is a hero, isn't he?<eos> If this doesn't work...<eos> If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
So tell me about all the cool stuff your mercenaries will be doing when you pump 'em full of Super Max.<eos> They gonna be dodging bullets Keanu Reeves-style, huh?<eos> You know, the thing about private military contractors is that they love gabbing with strangers about what they do.<eos> So, I've noticed you have a lot of undercover security here tonight.<eos> Do I?
We spoke about this!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> It's not just him, okay?<eos> I went to pick him up, and we took some drugs and some cash that was laying around...<eos> You did wh...?
How good are these records?<eos> If a name's not on there, they were never here.<eos> Kids never even made it.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Yeah, I did.
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
Now here's what we're looking at.<eos> It's a single GSW, through and through.<eos> The size of that skull, I'm thinking adolescent male, maybe 12 to 14 years old.<eos> No, we don't know the gender.<eos> Actually, we do.
Good.<eos> Do you want to know what you're having?<eos> Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound, so I can tell you if it's a boy or a girl.<eos> If you want to know.<eos> Actually, I do.
He went to his car. He came back with his gun, and he pistol whipped her.<eos> He didn't kill her, but he might as well have.<eos> She has irreversible brain damage.<eos> I ran his name yesterday. I didn't see anything about that in the system.<eos> Of course, you didn't.
Queen Elizabeth-- like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> We're not deaf!<eos> I never called her that.<eos> I didn't!
We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> We're not deaf!<eos> I never called her that.<eos> I didn't!<eos> I didn't!
I'm going to Houston to meet Dany for the exchange, so we'll keep it a surprise till I get back.<eos> And I know...<eos> "Not doin' jobs anymore, Tulip.<eos> I'm a soul-saving preacher now, and no means no."<eos> - Yes, it does.
And I know...<eos> "Not doin' jobs anymore, Tulip.<eos> I'm a soul-saving preacher now, and no means no."<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> - No, it doesn't, Jesse!
It's all aboveboard.<eos> Had Miles take a look at it last night.<eos> I'm sorry... you need a pen?<eos> Odin, I didn't agree to this.<eos> Yes, you did... in my office.
I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know!<eos> None of us do.
I know you're scared.<eos> But we just need to stay strong, be true to ourselves, okay?<eos> We don't need god.<eos> And I'll let you guys in on a little secret, okay?<eos> We never did.
Welcome to the Fortress of Solitude.<eos> Hey, that's the pod that brought Kal-El...<eos> Clark, to Earth.<eos> Can't believe Clark never invited you here.<eos> He did.
Well, there you go.<eos> Everything you need to know, you know.<eos> You're 10R, after all.<eos> Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding.<eos> Huh. Don't you?
Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
Can't you reprogram them and destroy Myriad from the inside?<eos> I tried. There's some pretty epic force fields around those satellites at the moment.<eos> You're always 10 steps ahead, Max.<eos> I know you have a plan.<eos> Of course I do.
- What the hell?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, whatever that is, that killed your father!<eos> - No, he didn't.
And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot. The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
I'm afraid that's my cross to bear.<eos> The candles?<eos> I'm sure you waited...<eos> Until the scene was processed.<eos> Yes, I did.
And when I looked through the broken window,<eos> I saw something.<eos> What did you see, exactly?<eos> You're not gonna believe me.<eos> They certainly didn't.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Either way, you're unfaithful.<eos> No doubt you have some twisted Brahman justification to explain it away.<eos> He does.
You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
They lost us when we went in that cave, right?<eos> And they found you two when you went outside with the rubies.<eos> We never even had a chance, then.<eos> We don't.<eos> But you do.
The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
Maybe... see a movie?<eos> Take a romantic walk in the park.<eos> Why do I always have to be the guy?<eos> Hey, just because I have feelings doesn't mean I'm not a man.<eos> Eh, it kind of does.
I'm glad.<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> Well, uh, that's a little tricky.<eos> You get how this situation is complicated.<eos> I do.
I'll make up two rooms, then.<eos> The fever is infectious.<eos> Reckon she caught it from the Partridge lad.<eos> She needs a doctor.<eos> They both do.
It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
You're not the only one who lives under this roof.<eos> Skinny, paying bed and board.<eos> And Johnny Blackwood.<eos> He and Red never saw eye to eye.<eos> A lot of folk didn't.
The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.
Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
- How could you?<eos> - Margaret.<eos> You gave me your word.<eos> Promised me he'd still be there when I got back.<eos> - I did.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> Arrest me for breaking and entering.<eos> You don't get to select our cases.<eos> Then who does?
David Tennant this, Tardis that, all night long.<eos> I love my Time Lords as much as the next guy, but I need eight hours of man sleep.<eos> Sounds like an episode of Nerd Love.<eos> Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?<eos> She does now.
I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does? What if...
There's nothing to tell.<eos> All right? We went out once and she blew me off.<eos> I just wanted a second chance.<eos> She didn't have to call the cops.<eos> She didn't.
You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.<eos> Hodgins did.
So, you let a known drug user work in your office defending clients.<eos> It wasn't right, but I understood.<eos> If she lost a case, a family got broken up or a child's hopes for the future destroyed.<eos> She needed an outlet.<eos> We all do.
He was in the helicopter that night.<eos> He killed the King and got Diana.<eos> Meisner has Diana?<eos> I said he got her, not that he has her.<eos> Then who does?
No one's forcing you to stay, Deacon.<eos> You could always join the rest of your men.<eos> How many was it went AWOL this week?<eos> I'd ask what's keeping you here, but we both know, don't we?<eos> Does she?
God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
- I'm Cameron.<eos> - Cameron met a girl.<eos> Her name is Nina.<eos> - Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?<eos> - She does now.
The kind of hero you spoke about at the gala?<eos> Somebody like Janice, or a Power full of hate and vengeance?<eos> Both.<eos> You know you need me.<eos> We don't.
- Not even the Crypt Keeper, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> The shit on my car smells like a fucking fish farm, okay?<eos> I just want to know if Cooperman had anything to do with it. Did he?<eos> Of course he didn't.
- No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> I came because I wanted to ask you a question about my education.<eos> What about it?<eos> - The fact that I didn't receive one.<eos> - You did.
Your Majesty, I've had the opportunity to think about your very kind offer to become your Private Secretary.<eos> And I'm afraid I must decline.<eos> Why?<eos> In this instance, I really do believe you'll be better served by Michael.<eos> No, you don't.
Yes, but they're far more intelligent than I am.<eos> Any confrontation, they'd out-debate me, out-think me and out-maneuver me.<eos> But this isn't about education or intelligence. This is about integrity and principle.<eos> Ma'am, you say you don't have what it takes to do battle with these people.<eos> You do.
I think we should start fast, and run at a good clip.<eos> - Noted.<eos> - I am right sometimes, you know.<eos> Even you said yourself that I have good instincts.<eos> You do.
He wants total control.<eos> Well, any artist worth anything would insist on that.<eos> - You don't really want a flatterer.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
The framing itself, indicated to me that you wanted us to see something beneath all the muted colors, deep down in the water.<eos> Terrible despair.<eos> Hiding like a Leviathan. Like a sea monster.<eos> - You saw all that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Yes.<eos> Part of the furniture.<eos> Well, as long as you don't sit on him anytime soon.<eos> - Well, that all seemed to go well.<eos> - Yes, it did, didn't it?
I don't, um-- I don't know.<eos> It never came up.<eos> Gabriel said that our people were with my mother when she died, that she wanted me to know that she loved me.<eos> Paige knows we love her, right?<eos> Of course she does.
- Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
I suppose you think, uh, I should be okay with letting him walk.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> You made a deal with him.<eos> Yes, in order to save Elizabeth, I made a deal with the devil of the day.<eos> I did.
But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> -Easy for you to --<eos> -You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But i-if they do?
[ Both laugh ] It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
Guy I hooked up with while I was on the inside.<eos> Nobody you would know.<eos> That's reassuring.<eos> Look, I would tell you that you can trust the dude, but really, I shouldn't have to, because you should trust me.<eos> I do, Levi.
But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets inside the magazine.<eos> Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.<eos> I was able to lift them during a process called cyanoacrylate fuming, ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.<eos> Eric... did you get a hit?<eos> Indeed I did.
That's right.<eos> I was... just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
We think it's more than that.<eos> We?<eos> Wait, who's we?<eos> His... his doctors feel this way?<eos> His entire treatment team does.
And this is where you would sit.<eos> - Looks like home.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> So do you have any experience in the dental field?<eos> Oh, no. I don't.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He got the message.<eos> Damn right he did.
Tell me one.<eos> I hope you come to my trial.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> Think you can lie your way out?<eos> I do.
We're not gonna talk about that.<eos> Listen, so I was thinking maybe, uh, Jack should stay with us tonight.<eos> That is a good idea.<eos> I mean, 'cause our couch doesn't have bullet holes in it.<eos> It does not.
Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> A client like Borns Tech has most files online already.<eos> We don't, actually.
We know Bailey threatened to expose your academic fraud.<eos> That gives you motive.<eos> Oh, you think I killed her?<eos> Oh. Yeah, no.<eos> No, I did not.
But unbeknownst to me, Bailey was trying to set him up.<eos> She didn't know he was a CI.<eos> He found the wire on her and he used it to strangle her.<eos> - He admitted all of this?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
We now take Bitcoin.<eos> I can bring you a brain in return in a couple days.<eos> It's not brain friends, Liv, it's brain business.<eos> You did hear the part about the apocalypse, didn't you?<eos> Sure did.
I mean, look, Ned, you just don't need to get so wound up, okay? - I mean...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I get it.<eos> I really do.
He was assigned to the National Security Agency, where he was instrumental in developing part of their mass data collection program.<eos> Now, that I didn't read in the book.<eos> It was highly classified, and for that reason, SECNAV has tasked us to investigate his murder.<eos> We got a crime scene?<eos> We do.
I bet you have a pet. A dog.<eos> Monty.<eos> Does Monty have a butler?<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
Come on, you know where it is.<eos> Let's go get it right now.<eos> - I didn't steal it.<eos> But I'm gonna find out who did.<eos> And when I do...
And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.<eos> Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?<eos> Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces...<eos> Okay, the point is that we accept your apology.<eos> Uh, maybe you do.
It's original brickwork.<eos> This museum's built on the bones of an 18th-century church.<eos> This is original subfloor. - A smuggling vault.<eos> - The church smuggled?<eos> - Ooh. - Everybody did.
FBI!<eos> Morgan?<eos> Spence.<eos> Anyone want to say anything?<eos> I do.
Morgan?<eos> Spence.<eos> Anyone want to say anything?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Pop, I'm scared.<eos> Dying is easy.<eos> Not being there for your son.<eos> I want to.<eos> I do.
Yeah, that's all well and good, but there's still one thing we need to do.<eos> Somebody's got to tell Abby.<eos> He did what?<eos> ! How could you let this happen? !<eos> I... I-I didn't.
I'm very excited for you.<eos> Cool, thank you.<eos> I'm kind of sad.<eos> You don't want to see me graduate?<eos> You do but you don't?
Fuck that.<eos> I'm tired of everyone telling me I need to do something.<eos> Nobody's ever even told you you need to do this, this, and this.<eos> Yes they do!<eos> Everyone does!
And he has a legacy that I have to fulfill for him.<eos> And that I will fulfill for him.<eos> Gun violence, for me, was always just something that I saw in the news.<eos> And I certainly never thought it would impact me or my community.<eos> And then it did.
And so, I think I was hacked. I think, you know, whatever it is, I don't...<eos> I don't I mean, the same stories I was telling, I was...<eos> It started out as my... my telling her.<eos> Did Huma want you to get back into politics?<eos> Well, she did.
I don't I mean, the same stories I was telling, I was...<eos> It started out as my... my telling her.<eos> Did Huma want you to get back into politics?<eos> Well, she did.<eos> Uh, she did.
It's awful what he did."<eos> I tried making the reference to like Bill Clinton.<eos> And then she said, "No, Bill's different."<eos> I believe in Anthony and..<eos> Some people don't, but a lot of people do.
Thank you very much.<eos> If you mean that.<eos> That's a good man, a good politician. - Thank you.<eos> - I support Anthony Weiner.<eos> - Yes, we do. - Yes, we do.
Main counsel for personnel matters.<eos> Donald Cooperman.<eos> Once again, Donald Cooperman.<eos> Mr. McBride, do you have any more questions for this witness?<eos> Oh, no, Your Honor, I don't.
And she's just doing her job.<eos> And I'm doing mine.<eos> Does she want to win?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I?
Between appeals and motions of remittitur and the present-day value, by the time you get it--<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, are you under the impression that you won?<eos> Because you did not at all.
What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
Are you sure about that?<eos> You broke into my locker?<eos> Gaston, I want to help you move on.<eos> If you still have this book, it must mean something to you.<eos> Of course it does.
Calista and I will go in together.<eos> I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> He wants to talk to you, alone.<eos> 'Course he does.
Ok. You're ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, try doing that hanging upside down.<eos> This will work.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
I know, it was stupid.<eos> I just got off a 14 hour flight.<eos> I'm tired, I'm cranky.<eos> You know how I get when I get cranky.<eos> Yeah, I do, yeah, hmm.
Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.<eos> Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.<eos> I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.<eos> I-I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.<eos> I did.
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM TRUTH.<eos> They require so much.<eos> I was arranging a... a pickup for my son after school.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> No, I don't.
My parents didn't have baby pictures.<eos> I can't believe it came from McCarthy.<eos> He's a fu... monster.<eos> Briggs knows the controls?<eos> No, he doesn't.
My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
It's his. He loaned it to me.<eos> He did?<eos> The day the police arrested Phil.<eos> He knew I liked cats, so he thought I might like poems about them, too.<eos> I didn't.
You're proposing a partnership?<eos> Scrooge and Fagin.<eos> It has a certain warmth to it, does it not, my dear?<eos> May I speak plainly?<eos> Please do.
SHE SIGHS I feel sick.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> ..Martha, a glass of water?<eos> I don't want to be late.<eos> Or do I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm on my way down.<eos> It was nothing, Doctor.<eos> You would have found it eventually.<eos> But I didn't, Mr. Palmer.
Dan the creepy '90s owner man was right.<eos> We checked those backdoor cameras, and the wires had clearly been snipped.<eos> Likely for a reason.<eos> You check the back alley?<eos> We did.
It's just surreal, you know?<eos> The two of them, they were cell mates.<eos> Now he's just on the payroll.<eos> I'm sure Voight has his reasons.<eos> Yeah. He usually does.
- No, of course not.<eos> Go spit it out!<eos> For real?<eos> - I swear I don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Look at what mom sent me.<eos> Wool cap for the baby, sweets!<eos> Everything's going to be fine now.<eos> Go, serve them tea.<eos> - What? No way! You do it.
of CIA surveillance!<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute!<eos> If you told us why you were here, we would have handled it differently.<eos> I don't owe you any explanations...<eos> The hell you don't.
I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped?<eos> Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
NOPD canvassed the street Calloway was killed on.<eos> An old woman said she saw a white utility truck with some ad on the side.<eos> Sounds like the same truck I saw Bashir escape in.<eos> She get plates?<eos> She did not.
You are not quitting.<eos> I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.<eos> If you hadn't talked me down back there...<eos> I had every intention of pulling that trigger.<eos> But you didn't.
-So, I'm thinking...<eos> -Same thing I am.<eos> Hey, give that back, seriously!<eos> -Who wants a grilled cheese?<eos> -SAM: I do.
You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> [somber music] I didn't, either.
No, we bought those junk boxes because driving around in nice cars got too expensive.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times some feminazi shattered their windshields or keyed their cars.<eos> Forensic evidence shows that Emil was struck multiple times in the head.<eos> Do you know of anyone who threatened him?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Through this doorway is our group therapy room.<eos> And, uh, was Lola involved in group therapy as well? Certainly, yeah.<eos> We-we focus on coping mechanisms in high-stress environments.<eos> Mock interviews, conflict resolution.<eos> And how did Lola do with that?
Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.<eos> Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.<eos> The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?<eos> Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
You won't, of course.<eos> - You don't need me anymore at all.<eos> - Yes, of course I do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Neither of you does.
I didn't send for anyone.<eos> "Come to the offices of the Low River Company at once.<eos> Douglas Brown."<eos> I didn't write this.<eos> I did.
It was just a small amount.<eos> Yeah, but there's still a warrant for your arrest.<eos> All right, listen, you talk to us, answer some questions, we'll take care of that.<eos> It's not gonna be a problem.<eos> And if I don't?
What are you talking about?<eos> You aided and abetted a known terrorist and mass murderer.<eos> Not to mention fraud charges.<eos> I have no authority to cut you a deal.<eos> I do.
- We got to stop him.<eos> - No, Walker, Morrison.<eos> No, Morrison doesn't exist.<eos> - I've looked...<eos> - The fuck he doesn't!
The last one's the problem.<eos> Turns out that if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does as well.<eos> So we can't kill her. No.<eos> But the good news is the armory has her, and they're not gonna let her escape.<eos> Except for that time they did.
We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
And then he ran away.<eos> She didn't want it to happen, but it did.<eos> She was scared of what you'd do to her.<eos> I told her she had to tell you, Nick.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dixon was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
- And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We have to call the police.<eos> We can't do that, honey.<eos> We can't draw any attention to ourselves.<eos> Did you have to... do that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Who is this?<eos> I am Chopper's friend.<eos> Friend?<eos> Chopper doesn't have any friends.<eos> He most certainly does.
Oh, hey!<eos> Sorry, kids.<eos> I was just breaking in the new bathroom.<eos> So who want to get in the pen and help me feed the warthogs?<eos> I do!
Help us!<eos> Rex, prop his head up.<eos> Oh my god! Am I starting to turn into one of those things? No.<eos> We don't even know if what they have affects humans.<eos> But what if it does?
I don't need anybody to like me.<eos> I kinda like you.<eos> No you don't.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I don't.
I'm afraid so. Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you may have dropped this?<eos> Did anybody lose a 20?<eos> I did.
Next, I started getting stressed about the mess.<eos> I had surgery in the morning and I can't go to sleep with a dirty house, so I started doing the dishes.<eos> The soap must have lubed up my hands, because my Harvard class ring fell of.<eos> Did I tell you I went to Harvard?<eos> Well, I did.
My dam of guilt is finally cracking.<eos> I want to cry, but I'm so high that I can't.<eos> There was an Indian man working behind the counter, and I made fun of his accent.<eos> And talk like this.<eos> "Hello, how you doing?"
Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality.<eos> So fuck God.<eos> He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.<eos> Please tell me I didn't say all of that out loud.<eos> Shit. I did.
Be that as it may, it is a slower path, and time is of the essence, Phillip.<eos> I want to remind you that closing the plant is not an option.<eos> And how many minutes have you allotted for this phone call?<eos> I didn't start this game.<eos> You did.
Dream.<eos> You got to find out the future you're fighting for.<eos> Sometimes you got to close your eyes and really envision that shit, bro.<eos> If you like it, then it's beautiful.<eos> If you don't?
We need that gun.<eos> - OK, I'm not doing this.<eos> - Wyatt Earp's gun.<eos> - Same one disappeared the night... - Told you, never talk about it!<eos> - And I don't!
Please...<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> I didn't realize you had a child at this school.<eos> I don't.
Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
This is going to really, really suck, so my advice to you is to tell us who took care of Fiona's body right now.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Defiance. Defiance.<eos> That's an extraordinarily stupid attitude. But I like it.<eos> I really do.
He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do. - No, we don't.
He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do. - No, we don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
Waller gave her up too.<eos> We put a call in to Interpol.<eos> Customs official ID'd her in Grenada.<eos> She won't talk.<eos> Oh, she already did.
Thank you, Terry.<eos> Anyway, I need you to see our friend,<eos> Winston Campbell, about this issue tonight.<eos> I understand he still owes you some favors.<eos> He does.
Moombas have been plotting against us this entire time, and you mock me.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The moombas have been injected with an explosive compound, but it only reacts to a certain kind of protein.<eos> Don't eat meat, no problem.<eos> But if they do...
I am not in favor of this plan.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> What do you mean, make an antidote?<eos> Antidotes don't grow on trees.<eos> Or do they?
I just said.<eos> - I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - No.<eos> You said you thought you put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> Well... I did.
- Hassan El-Sayed?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That's why we got it.<eos> - You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.
♪ No work till Monday... ♪ How's it going?<eos> Hey, I'm, uh, Detective Danny Williams.<eos> I'm with Five-O.<eos> Got a badge to back that up?<eos> No, I-I don't.
If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
That woman.<eos> Excuse me, that woman...<eos> No, no, she could not breach my security and kidnap me on her own.<eos> This didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, actually it did.
Question is... what has he been doing in L.A. for the past month?<eos> Probably planning this charity gala.<eos> It's tonight.<eos> It starts in an hour.<eos> Of course, it does.
- Yup, okay.<eos> - Chili!<eos> None of this changes how we at 51 feel about you.<eos> If you need help, just ask.<eos> I just did.
I wanted a glass of water, and I got stuck.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Why didn't I close that door so you didn't get stuck like Manny's gerbil in the glue trap? !<eos> But you said he ran away.<eos> Yes, most of him did.
Songs are in the book.<eos> Anyone want a cocktail?<eos> You know how to make a Manhattan?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
It's - - It's about the song that you sang yesterday.<eos> It seemed like you were trying to express something -- some feelings you might be having that you think might not be met with approval from your... "community".<eos> Or it's just a song.<eos> Has nothing to do with his personal situation.<eos> -No, it does. -Ha! Ha!
Whoever turned out the lights, please turn them back on.<eos> They're not working.<eos> Might be a fuse.<eos> Oh, um... Mitchell, we have a problem.<eos> No, we don't.
This is illegal, man. You can go to jail for this.<eos> You lost those rights when you let bad guys on to the tarmac to shoot people and steal old statues.<eos> I wasn't involved.<eos> They almost killed me.<eos> Yeah, but they didn't.
Meet Denise Buchwald.<eos> She's a swimsuit model who grew up on a popcorn farm just outside Des Moines.<eos> Still calls Iowa home.<eos> She doesn't look like she could kill anything.<eos> She didn't.
I want to send a big shout-out to my man, our host this evening, Mayor Hamilton.<eos> Come on up here, Mr. Mayor!<eos> Hey!<eos> Here he is-- John Cleary!<eos> How you doing?
Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
Let's say I was willing to help you. And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
Yeah, I know how she feels.<eos> How can a woman recently sprung from a hippie forest cult...<eos> Be our big sister Willa?<eos> I don't know her at all.<eos> Dude, none of us do.
You don't look a miracle in the mouth, Wy.<eos> This could heal us all.<eos> We need to get her memories back, and I don't have a magic pill for that.<eos> You could start by telling me the truth.<eos> I did.
I remember we used to play in here with gummy bears.<eos> We would dance them across the beams and into our mouths.<eos> Then you turned 11 and you wanted to practice making out with the gummy bears.<eos> And you promised - to never tell anyone that.<eos> - I never did.
I get it. Feeling like you're about to lose something.<eos> It's OK if you don't like her, you know.<eos> I'm happy she's back, I really am. It's...<eos> I never really knew her, you know.<eos> Still don't.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.<eos> - All of us.<eos> You're good at what you do.<eos> Doesn't matter how many Willas come back.<eos> Doesn't.
Where we keep our most dangerous political prisoners.<eos> We can't have the enemies of the Company running free.<eos> My job is to extinguish the Old Town rebellion, not feed it.<eos> Why not just send in Company Officers?<eos> Oh, I did, twice.
I'm still waiting to hear how you're going to stop us from leaving, Fuzzy.<eos> Because all your magic can do is make a dog roll over and beg.<eos> True.<eos> I don't have the magic to keep you all penned in here.<eos> But I do.
You realize you're being used, Jacob?<eos> Used and manipulated.<eos> So they're gunning for you.<eos> I thought you said it came from only one of them.<eos> It did.
But I just started worrying about you guys.<eos> Turns out if I love someone, I worry about them.<eos> And if someone's gonna stress me out, I'd rather it be my family than you guys.<eos> Did Stan just say he loves us?<eos> He did, Gorney. He did.
When I was a kid, my dad would always take me to the same beach.<eos> So for father's day, I drew him a picture of our beach.<eos> My bedtime story that night was a 45-minute critique of my drawing.<eos> Well, if it were me, I would have drawn it on a single piece of paper.<eos> I did.
But don't expel him.<eos> Give me a chance to give him a chance.<eos> There's no way this guy's qualified to teach those kids.<eos> Well, he did go to Harvard.<eos> No, he didn't.
Another time...<eos> I will tell it to you all.<eos> Everything.<eos> Anyone up here request an Uber?<eos> Yes, we did Commander.
I know this is very hard for you, Theo. But it's also hard for them, you know?<eos> To find the right balance between not enough information and too much.<eos> You know, when you, when you wake up, and you're taken out of the cryogenic pods...<eos> You don't believe this. You don't believe any of this.<eos> At first, I didn't.
And then, to confirm the results, I actually processed it through imaging electro-spray ionization, as you can see.<eos> The results were definitive.<eos> The plus sign was made up of two different inks.<eos> As a gentleman, I will do you the courtesy of not saying "I told you so."<eos> Even though you just did.
Only young women wear that.<eos> Yeah, but she's got a motive.<eos> Her husband was having an affair.<eos> Kerry Napoli's got an alibi.<eos> Does she?
Has been quite some time since we've seen one another.<eos> For business.<eos> I've had no need for diplomatic negotiations of late.<eos> So unless you have something else of an official nature to discuss.<eos> I do.
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.<eos> Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.<eos> You may have actually just come up with something.<eos> You think so?<eos> I really do.
Time out. We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
Of course, the fear is that by then it might be too late.<eos> Commander?<eos> Do you have a direct line to Lieutenant Rollins?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Gosh, I should be thanking you.<eos> It really should only take a couple of hours.<eos> Don't even worry about it. Take your time.<eos> Kelly and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, you, we do, don't we?
It really should only take a couple of hours.<eos> Don't even worry about it. Take your time.<eos> Kelly and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, you, we do, don't we?<eos> We do.
Captain, there are things, things about this mission that you do not know.<eos> Flash Gordon there will be under guard<eos> - Until we reach the coast.<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> And if we do not?
No one in this region has been to Edinburgh Castle, let alone the portrait gallery.<eos> Rest assured, your identity is a secret here.<eos> And one I intend to keep.<eos> I don't understand how you knew.<eos> I didn't at first.
Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
Thank you.<eos> Deliveries are around the back.<eos> Actually, I'm here to see Livi.<eos> I'm sorry. I thought you just said you were here to see Livi.<eos> - I did.
Is that important to you, having your relationship described as normal?<eos> No, no, I just don't think that we are abnormal.<eos> Yes, we're close, but we had to be.<eos> You know my father died, right?<eos> I do.
What what?<eos> I said Severide's name, and your face turned all 50 shades of red.<eos> - You guys know each other?<eos> - My face got 50 shades of red?<eos> - It... it did. - Okay.
I hope you cleaned the bathtub out beforehand.<eos> That's what I like about you, Jake.<eos> You're a funny guy.<eos> Sense of humor's important, don't you think?<eos> I do.
How'd you know about that disagreement?<eos> NSA hard-ass, remember?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> If one of my associates talked to the NSA out of school, you have the obligation to inform me.<eos> Anna didn't.
Kirsten?<eos> Um, Cameron, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, any one of them could have wanted Anna out of their way.<eos> My parents had another daughter?<eos> Your father did with his first wife, Elizabeth.
I know, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Yeah, it's no big deal.<eos> We're all done here.<eos> Yeah, it's just, I didn't hear the alarm, so...<eos> Oh, I did.
It's a horse.<eos> He'd drink outside in a trough.<eos> Well, this horse wanted something stronger.<eos> Horses don't drink alcohol.<eos> This one does.
You think I don't know that?<eos> We've done nothing but mainline lore for a week, okay?<eos> We've got Jack on another hand of God and Amara, and we've got even less Jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does...
You know what?<eos> Why don't you go ahead and tell us about the night of the attack?<eos> Nobody believes there was an attack.<eos> E-Even the Internet thinks I'm crazy.<eos> Well, we don't.
Okay.<eos> After I do this, go get the doc and tell her to, um...<eos> If not... no hard feelings, okay?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You can leave the basket there.<eos> Call the police, go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Would you please lock it?<eos> If I hear sirens, 'cause you just told those two kids to call the police, I am gonna cut off her nose right in front of you.<eos> - I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> All right, everybody who's donating blood, y'all follow me.<eos> Right now, let's go.<eos> I understand Ms. Dunhill ended her relationship with you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
All right.<eos> - Mr. Amberson?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I don't know how to say this, but I had a feeling that something terrible could've happened today.<eos> Thanks to you, it didn't.
Because he's connected to Daniel Stinger.<eos> And Maggie wanted me to find out what information I could get on him.<eos> I suppose she didn't want you telling me.<eos> No, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.<eos> So, I didn't.
What, you never heard of that?<eos> The girls at St. Bridget's invented it.<eos> I can't take any more of this!<eos> That's what they said!<eos> But then they did.
- Mom.<eos> Look, if this is some sort of apology... it's just a little late.<eos> Just let her talk.<eos> I wish I could go back and change our history, but life doesn't work like that.<eos> Nope, it doesn't.
I'm a cop, I wanted answers.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Did we come up with the same answers?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Did we?
Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.<eos> And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.<eos> Danny couldn't sing.<eos> Yeah, but he did it anyway.
Did I?<eos> It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.<eos> I mean, your parents didn't.<eos> Right?<eos> Danny didn't.
And so he turned the screws on my family.<eos> Threats... and promises.<eos> After the trial, Henry awarded me the Boleyn family lands.<eos> And Henry knew the chambermaid's story was a lie.<eos> Of course he did.
I'd be happy to.<eos> It's from... your early years as a criminal mastermind.<eos> When you and James Lam were arrested for extortion.<eos> Only, Lam never went to prison.<eos> And you did.
Reverend.<eos> I don't have to tell you that this case is the highest priority right now<eos> Sergeant.<eos> You know Reverend Pembelton?<eos> Yes, I do.
Good news.<eos> We could use some.<eos> I was able to contact Maurice Owens.<eos> Know of him?<eos> I do.
That's what he said to me.<eos> With a smile on his face.<eos> Was it this man who said it?<eos> No.<eos> The one doing all the talking.
Uh, David Woods and his wife Jeanne?<eos> There's no way they're involved, boss. I didn't say they were.<eos> Well, of course not, but they might know people who might know people.<eos> And right now, we don't have a whole hell of a lot else to go on, do we, DiNozzo?<eos> No, we don't, boss.
Nah, I'm not sad.<eos> Or stood up.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I got a friend coming.<eos> Doesn't everybody?
Look, uh, I'm just gonna get changed, and I'm coming back in.<eos> Oh, no. You're staying home.<eos> Will you please take the day off?<eos> I mean, Portland will survive one day without you.<eos> And what if it doesn't?
The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
No.<eos> Here he is, Mr. Harley.<eos> Thank you very much, Officer.<eos> My dad didn't come down? Uh, no.<eos> No, Walt, he didn't.
Buy.<eos> As in Harley-Davidson Motorcycles with someone else's name on it.<eos> What's the difference between a Harley-Davidson bike with a Japanese name on it and one that says Ford?<eos> You know about the Ford proposal.<eos> I do.
I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
And speaking of marksmen, there's no way Petty Officer Muldoon would've taken three shots to drop that guy.<eos> He would've nailed him on the first shot.<eos> He's a pro.<eos> Yeah, well, pros do miss on the first shot.<eos> You sure as hell did.
I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay.<eos> You said you had something.<eos> I do.
So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
Come on! You got to admit there are a lot of unanswered questions.<eos> We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.
- The Happer of Tek is gone, no one knows where.<eos> And no mortal can wield it.<eos> - Well, with the Iron Crown of the Dwarves, I could.<eos> - Szorlok has the Iron Crown.<eos> - That he does.
Slight problem.<eos> The stun gun that Tim gave us back at the base must've been hit by a stray rock on the drive. Shoot.<eos> It's broken.<eos> We need that.<eos> No, we don't.
We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
You know...<eos> Dr. Edwards is such a good doctor, and, um... and I know you've been working hard, but real change takes time, and if you just work with him just a little longer, you'll be that much stronger when you do come home.<eos> All right?<eos> That makes sense, doesn't it?<eos> It does.
- Are you married?<eos> - I was married for 26 years.<eos> Now I'm divorced.<eos> Potential Juror number 11, before your divorce, did you and your husband ever seek any kind of counseling or therapy?<eos> Yes, we did.
I... hoped.<eos> There... there's no way.<eos> I have to review this statement, and, uh, I'm working on a list of questions for the prosecution's witnesses.<eos> You really don't think that Keller's got that covered?<eos> What if he doesn't?
The Park Chancery?<eos> He... he's got nothing to do with this case.<eos> Prosecution thinks he does.<eos> Well, believe me.<eos> He doesn't.
Because you you don't love me.<eos> What?<eos> That is preposterous.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't.
I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece!<eos> We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife! The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
Is that something that can be treated?<eos> It is.<eos> Do you masturbate successfully on your own?<eos> - I do.<eos> - He does.
And here I... I wanted to take your breath away.<eos> As if I still could.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you take your husband's breath away.<eos> Oh, he-he doesn't look at me.<eos> Or he does.
See, you gave her hope.<eos> She thought she had found a cure.<eos> Abracadabra, I come in and you'd wave your magic wand, and just like that it'd all be better.<eos> I tried.<eos> I really did.
She thought she had found a cure.<eos> Abracadabra, I come in and you'd wave your magic wand, and just like that it'd all be better.<eos> I tried.<eos> I really did.<eos> We did everything you...
It's getting late anyhow.<eos> Do you mind giving me a hand with the dishes before you go?<eos> Sure, sweetheart.<eos> I'm sure Gini mentioned that, uh, I came in to see her.<eos> - Uh, yes. Yes, she did.
This is about your work with us as our publisher.<eos> Our relationship to Little, Brown.<eos> Which we assumed was an exclusive relationship, in that we've given you the rights to all our work.<eos> And in entrusting our work to you, we assumed it would engender a loyalty between us, one that went both ways.<eos> Of course it does.
I still think - I should wait until next year to apply for the grant.<eos> Why?<eos> You're eligible now.<eos> Technically, but they always give the grant to a senior resident anyway.<eos> Except for when they don't.
But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
Listen, what I said before, that was just me being...<eos> Insecure.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You could have said a lot worse.<eos> I did... earlier.
They were gonna shoot him unless I did something.<eos> They needed validation.<eos> Proof that you have what they're looking for.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't!
- That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
(screams)<eos> (yelp)<eos> (sigh) Is it time to get up already?<eos> Twilight, we really have to talk about this.<eos> No, we don't.
(screaming)<eos> Fluttershy, enough with the screaming.<eos> - I didn't scream.<eos> - For once.<eos> Nobody did.
Wow, glad that didn't happen, huh?<eos> Sorry girls, I didn't mean to.<eos> I don't know how to control this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> None of us do.
You are Elizabeth's rival.<eos> Once you're ruling on England's borders, then Lola's value as a hostage increases tenfold.<eos> Elizabeth will keep my wife captive forever.<eos> But I don't suppose that even crossed your mind, did it?<eos> Actually, it did.
We've had enough of you talking.<eos> We're just the kids who skip class, call it a sit-in.<eos> Yeah, well, if that bomb would have gone off,<eos> - different story.<eos> - Well, it didn't, so...
Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Let me find my son.<eos> But every time one thing here seems almost rational, two things pop up that make absolutely no sense at all.<eos> Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon; you know this.<eos> I've had lives in my hands.<eos> Held a human heart, beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
Once you make the deal to have a government, that government takes on another kind of authority.<eos> What, like a moral authority?<eos> - Well--<eos> - So Ronald Reagan has moral authority?<eos> Of course he does!
So, yeah, at that point, moral authority kicks in to, uh, defend the minority against the will of the people.<eos> And that's when the spears come out.<eos> Yeah, I watched the news last night too, Barry.<eos> Jesse Jackson said that thing about slavery.<eos> Yeah, he did.
- Hey.<eos> - How you doin', PJ?<eos> - I'm good, Ms. Denise.<eos> - I'm fair for a square.<eos> How you doing?
This guy's a lefty.<eos> Didi, I got something for you.<eos> So I talked to the contractors from all five houses.<eos> And all used the same Parisian pasta porcino guy, didn't they?<eos> No. But two of them did.
And here we are.<eos> You can joke on me all you want, but something's happened to her.<eos> Something she didn't choose.<eos> Now, I don't got the resources to find out what.<eos> But you do.
It's not my nothing!<eos> It's got to be mine.<eos> Change it back.<eos> Look, I liked your version.<eos> We both did, right?
I'm not myself today.<eos> Thank you, Charmain.<eos> Sure.<eos> We got a meeting with Cutler.<eos> We do?
- Hey, don't you want to follow the map?<eos> - Map, schmap.<eos> We have a D.T.S. Diego tracking system.<eos> My nose, and these instincts, can't miss.<eos> They just did.
But as far as every individual sequence, they leave it to us.<eos> The first thing we do is a first rough pass.<eos> Rough, dirty awful looking drawings, and then you pitch them in front of the whole room.<eos> You act it out.<eos> You do voices.
Yeah, but he's all cleaned up now.<eos> He's got a good job, bright future, and without hair, probably moves pretty quick through the water.<eos> - (Laughter)<eos> - Christy, all kidding aside, do you still have feelings for this man?<eos> Yeah, do you?
Come on, Christy.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> - I do.
What say you?<eos> - Is she up to it?<eos> - Yes, I'd say so.<eos> Besides... we have to start breaking her in gently, don't we?<eos> Do we?
- Now, Peter.<eos> - Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses.<eos> I have to make a decision about Christmas.<eos> Tell me, do you think the King will be well enough to go to Sandringham?<eos> I do.
This is where Tommy lives." So, I...<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Dion, this is Pilar.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Is he badly hurt?<eos> We don't know right now.<eos> we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here.<eos> Claire needs some medical things -- she thought you might have some for the animals.<eos> Of course I do.
It's late.<eos> We are raw from travel.<eos> Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?<eos> I do have a proposition for you.<eos> You yankees always do.
You're not responsible for me or my happiness.<eos> So, my maids' gossip is true.<eos> And I thought Melaniee came along<eos> - because she could cook.<eos> - She did.
_<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
You're just gonna try and change my mind.<eos> We should at least have this conversation instead of calling some stranger.<eos> In case you haven't noticed I don't have anyone else to talk to.<eos> We're gonna catch this freak.<eos> And what if they don't?
He cut a deal to save this firm.<eos> He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison.<eos> We give Evan people who already want to go, and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.<eos> And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?<eos> Then we do.
Damn it, Louis.<eos> I told you not to call him. Well, I did.<eos> Because he's a partner, and like he just said, he was the one who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.<eos> You're right, Louis.<eos> I did.
- God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
She... I need 15 minutes to myself.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I cut a deal, and now I'm here. Wait a second.<eos> If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance to turn on someone to get out of it.<eos> They did.
Because it's like you.<eos> I can't stand it, but it's part of the family.<eos> Speaking of family, where's Gretchen?<eos> I can't believe she would walk out on us too.<eos> She didn't.
We're doing a run.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> I thought she got to choose her own Counsel Assisting.<eos> She did. Oh, wow!
Studied electrical engineering at TAFE.<eos> Fixed EFTPOS machines for a living.<eos> Married his best mate's sister two years ago.<eos> That's Elaheh? Correct.<eos> She did science.
TI's activated and timing of ID installs on three houses, plus the roster for 'Eyes On Keisha' that began last night.<eos> So far, she came straight home from work.<eos> Hasn't left. I've gotta run but I'll meet everyone later.<eos> She knows her stuff.<eos> She does.
Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
I've been telling everybody how much I need you.<eos> This battle between us is over.<eos> But I need you to give me the girl, Teresa.<eos> When my son was murdered by the cartel, I spent every waking hour trying to find the man who did it.<eos> I never did.
Those motordromes sell out darn near every event.<eos> Their riders are stars.<eos> Now, some of them dead stars, sir.<eos> They basically make money for the manufacturers, you know. And fans love it.<eos> Everyone does.
What if this racing thing's a bust, they don't take me back?<eos> You want to sell them or ride them?<eos> People are already flocking to the tracks. Just wait until the wrecking crew resurfaces.<eos> Plus, we got a war hero.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Everyone steals from each other.<eos> We didn't steal anything.<eos> I designed the damn thing. I...<eos> You just didn't patent it?<eos> Well, apparently, someone else did.
Lame.<eos> So lame.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> We sound just like...<eos> Yeah, we do.
Clear!<eos> - 200!<eos> - Bailey!<eos> His heart stopped?<eos> Yes, it did, but only just for a second, and then...
You made an astonishing error in judgment that I'm trying to accept and forgive.<eos> And it's gonna take me a lot longer than six months.<eos> All bleeding must stop.<eos> Well, I am sorry I disappoint you.<eos> Sometimes it does so at a cost.
Oh, good.<eos> You got it.<eos> This is for you guys.<eos> No, you did not need to do that.<eos> Yes, we did.
Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious.<eos> Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.
Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious.<eos> Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.<eos> We do.
He's gone.<eos> He herniated.<eos> He was brain-dead minutes ago.<eos> Time of death, 18:09.<eos> Did I...
Yeah, I'm not.<eos> I just did what Robbins...<eos> No, you helped that woman through the scariest hours of her life.<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you did.
- Actually, um... I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.<eos> You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.<eos> No, I just want what's best for you.<eos> No, you don't.
So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?<eos> He's got us by the balls, Harvey.<eos> If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through the other night even for?<eos> Which means right now, we just have to figure out how much we're willing to pay.<eos> No, we don't.
Where is your sister, pretty lady?<eos> Come on, Waverly. We just wanna talk!<eos> Forget talking.<eos> Where's Wynonna?<eos> Bullshit, they do.
- You are betting my ass, Detective.<eos> - You are literally betting my ass!<eos> - Hey, it worked in the movie.<eos> - No, it didn't!<eos> - It did for a second!
Everyone at Heritage worked really hard to save it.<eos> What made this worth saving, hmm?<eos> I'm not... sure I understand.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> You never did.
That shop, it was my...<eos> Home.<eos> When you came to this country, you left behind the only home you'd ever known.<eos> And you had no idea how hard it would be to find a place where you felt like you belonged.<eos> But I did.
No.<eos> We have a daughter.<eos> She's never done anything to anybody.<eos> She has got no bad karma coming.<eos> Your husband does.
-Yeah.<eos> -No.<eos> -No.<eos> But I do have to leave.<eos> I do.
The way he transitions into a canter, it's like...<eos> like... Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- All the same, maybe it's time to start treating her like an enemy combatant, and less like our nation's favorite houseguest.<eos> You want to take a terrified young woman to a black site for enhanced interrogation.<eos> - Yeah, hello. - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay. - 'Cause this approach does not.
That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
Too many.<eos> But the campaign events are done with.<eos> It's not gonna be a problem going forward.<eos> I'm holding you to that.<eos> Please do.
Like 99% of all the other bands.<eos> You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.
Look at all those parents whose kids disappeared.<eos> They spend years in court trying to clear their name.<eos> How did you know Courtney's neck was snapped?<eos> Well, you told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
That I went on a date.<eos> So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know? - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
- Oh, you should come to her birthday tomorrow.<eos> - Oh, I would love to!<eos> Wait, how do I get there?<eos> - Do you have a car?<eos> - I do!
- Ooh, jell-o shots.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I am starving.<eos> - How's it going? - Excuse me.<eos> - How you doing?
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.<eos> Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? Yes.<eos> You were just gonna lie to everyone?<eos> Did you know about Karev? No!<eos> I didn't.
Sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> You didn't punch the guy.<eos> But I told Bailey.<eos> You did?
I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
Sorry, four children, using their birthdays, to the same clinic where Nadir was born.<eos> Means they have parents.<eos> Use it.<eos> You have a family out there.<eos> No, we don't.
Doesn't that cause violent vomiting?<eos> Well, for a short period.<eos> But it's harmless.<eos> Hetty, one of us could have opened that.<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Hm?<eos> TTX. It's a neurotoxin found in several species of fish.<eos> It's extremely potent.<eos> And yet he survived, so do you have an explanation.<eos> No, but your husband sure does.
Certainly hope not.<eos> I mean, it was cute but just overly cute.<eos> Alan. Huh?<eos> Do you know who ordered the L.A.H. for Zantium?<eos> I do.
So, uh, why carry it around with you? Why don't you just - leave it at home?<eos> - We had some wolves get into our apartment in Halifax.<eos> It was bad.<eos> I got out.<eos> But Kelly didn't.
- When you give me the gun.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Do you realize how crazy this sounds?<eos> Yes, I do.
We sit here, we wait for him to come out, we stuff him into a bag and we throw him off the Taylor Bridge.<eos> Ah, it's not going to be that easy with this guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Worked for Rasputin.<eos> Actually, it didn't.
- The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest.<eos> For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
Everything else points to Dr. Brennan.<eos> The way the victim was clothed.<eos> The way her hair was cut.<eos> The question is, how does killing Melissa get him closer to Bones?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
When I'm called out to a scene where the remains are badly burnt or decomposed, I call in Bones.<eos> He calls me "Bones." Mm-hmm.<eos> Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still refers to me by a nickname I despise.<eos> Well, you used to despise it, but now I think you like it.<eos> No, I don't.
And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie.<eos> I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
♪ Oh, baby... ♪ What is all this?<eos> Locations, caterers, florists, honeymoon ideas.<eos> All you need to do is kick back and fill in the checklist.<eos> Okay. I thought you said you wanted to make this quick so you could get back to your case.<eos> I do.
Don't you think I realize that?<eos> This man has money and power.<eos> And in my experience, people with money and power will do anything to keep it.<eos> Why would I trust you?<eos> Hmm? Your boss didn't.
I'm afraid you are mistaken.<eos> Well, here's what I'm not mistaken about.<eos> The thief working with her was six-foot-two, athletic build, and knew exactly when the Topkapi Dagger was gonna show up.<eos> Does that sound like anybody you know?<eos> Maybe it does.
"Working from home" is usually code for "too hungover to come into the office."<eos> Why do you want to talk to him?<eos> God hates the Midnight Ranger.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> He just does.
What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
But we met on the phone.<eos> Which is why... I couldn't bear the idea of you seeing me and giving me that look.<eos> Like the woman behind you is giving me right now.<eos> Don't turn around.<eos> - No, don't...
What are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean, what is she going to do?<eos> She has to tell Bonnie.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - I don't?
So, here's the thing about SWAT.<eos> They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.
And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared... Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
It doesn't have to be work.<eos> What about that flyer we saw in the lobby of your building.<eos> Something about water aerobics at the senior center?<eos> You promised you'd try that.<eos> Oh, I did.
- Because I was trying to protect him.<eos> And I couldn't.<eos> I'm so, so sorry that you had to go through something like this.<eos> You know, I- - I know what it's like to lose a parent.<eos> - I really do.
I'm telling you, there's more to him than you know.<eos> He could do more for us.<eos> - I think it'd be good for both of you.<eos> - Okay, you really don't know what you're talking about right now.<eos> I do.
Yes, boss lady.<eos> Look, Jon, I know you've become close to the family.<eos> It's not about that, Bernie.<eos> We all want our clients to be exonerated.<eos> Of course we do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I got nowhere to go.<eos> Free as a lark.<eos> But I do.
Just was.<eos> Well, what about neighbors or friends?<eos> Could they go get it for you?<eos> We had a falling out.<eos> Who did?
It was just a business he could support his family with.<eos> Your dad was in the family business.<eos> What brought all of this on?<eos> I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist.<eos> I really didn't, Amantha.
Let's roll.<eos> Name's Ted.<eos> Dog.<eos> Did you say "Dog"?<eos> I did.
I think it's safe to say that his last contact was with the pole.<eos> I made a joke.<eos> Wow. You cut the car in half.<eos> No.<eos> The firefighters did.
Can you tell me what the bumper sticker says?<eos> Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.
Well, how did you contact her the first time?<eos> I met her at a bar.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> She approached you.<eos> Well, they usually do, but I...
I wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> And I get to say hello to Kate and Ziva in their cute little bowl.<eos> Yeah, Ziva's gained a little weight.<eos> You can drop by anytime.<eos> Senior does.
- They seem interesting.<eos> - That's one word for it.<eos> I can't believe you're leaving.<eos> - Your mom came by and talked to Tina.<eos> - Did she?
More that I'll be a kind of creative gatekeeper.<eos> Make sure everything goes well and everybody stays reasonably happy.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Do we?
I never should've agreed to marry them.<eos> Ali never should've agreed to marry him.<eos> I mean, they only dated for one week.<eos> We know nothing about him.<eos> Yeah, well, apparently, neither did she.
That's it.<eos> The town's only been here since the '50s.<eos> It was all virgin forest till they found coal here.<eos> So then how do people explain the missing?<eos> Mostly they don't.
Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
You killed my brother.<eos> - I didn't.
Well, we've got his DNA, there's evidence at his house, and he hasn't got any alibis.<eos> Our man is a methodical cold-blooded killer.<eos> Yann doesn't fit that profile.<eos> - He could have faked the panic attack.<eos> - He didn't.
Thank you.<eos> You're saying Andrew Barnes was murdered?<eos> It seems like it, yes.<eos> That's terrible, but what's it got to do with us?<eos> You did business with him?
It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
You with us?<eos> The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?<eos> You got it.<eos> Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not.<eos> No, we don't.
I mean, we're essentially all set up.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he's the one that boxed us into doing this.<eos> You'd think he'd have the decency to --<eos> Show up?<eos> He does.
We will not lose to an inferior product.<eos> - I refuse to be Betamax.<eos> - 'Cause I don't remember inviting her.<eos> Oh, no, we didn't.<eos> Joanie did that all on her own.
I'm just a little surprised by how completely off-book you went.<eos> I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it. That's the sport of it.<eos> It could have gone the other way.<eos> But it didn't.
So if I made anyone feel uncomfortable, then I'm sorry.<eos> Well, that little speech made me very uncomfortable.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> - It never happened.<eos> - What? - It so clearly did.
Now, can we try to get back to where we were?<eos> Okay, great. The big Ryan-shaped hole.<eos> Did you find any prospects last night?<eos> No, but I decided we don't need anyone.<eos> - Of course we do.
You know, there'll be a whole slew of Valley big shots there.<eos> It's a great opportunity for John to make some business connections.<eos> Sure.<eos> But... nobody calls him John.<eos> I do.
Are you his buddy?<eos> I have connections, and I--listen.<eos> You let these people go, and I'll make something happen.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> No, we most certainly do not.
He said it had to do with the movie, but I could smell his, uh, desperation through the phone, especially when I said no.<eos> And later that night, he was dead.<eos> Pero Mira.<eos> I didn't bring you all the way out here to talk about Los muertos.<eos> You didn't?
Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab,<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
Say good-bye for me, too.<eos> You hate him.<eos> I don't hate Wafiq.<eos> Then you hate me for loving him.<eos> No, I don't. I...
Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.<eos> Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.<eos> How can you of all people say that to me?<eos> They had it coming.<eos> They all did.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.<eos> And a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
Damon, did the spell work or not?<eos> ! I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
I know, but...<eos> Damon, help me.<eos> What if something happened to her?<eos> What if the Armory took her?<eos> They didn't.
I'm searching!<eos> Mr. O'Brien?<eos> Ah! Look what I found!<eos> Does this help?<eos> Sure does!
- What the hell did you do?<eos> - You shot me!<eos> What is your problem?<eos> Stay down! What are you doing?<eos> I didn't do anything!
You get me those reports ASAP.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Ellis?<eos> I'm Detective Halstead, this is Detective Lindsay.<eos> They're saying Michael shot the police.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Yeah, I have.<eos> Josh, you know, he's just another read-option clone.<eos> I mean, he can hit the short crosses and extend plays with his feet, but he stares down his primary receiver and that is just begging to be intercepted.<eos> Okay, now I'm offended they didn't ask you to be the new coach.<eos> Well, actually, they did.
- He's cute.<eos> - Hey, how we doing, boss?<eos> Nikki has a thing for cops.<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
I'm going to put on that robe, have a glass of wine, turn on those Jacuzzi jets, and have myself a good old time.<eos> Now I get it.<eos> It's so I don't jump.<eos> Who wants to do a shot... from my mouth?<eos> I do.
You don't need my help to fuck up your life.<eos> Who does that?<eos> I mean, I was cool with you going out with her sister, but you don't bang the mom, dude.<eos> Hey, I like the mom, dude.<eos> No, you don't.
I mean... me and you, we can eat Colt.<eos> What are the cows gonna eat?<eos> I didn't work my ass off all year, so I could go in the hole.<eos> We can hold on a little while, things will turn.<eos> And what if they don't?
I made a deal with Jimenez.<eos> I gave them a piece of my Dallas operation, and in return, they will move our product.<eos> In addition to that, I want to regain market share, and in order to do so, I need to increase shipment by 30% a month.<eos> We don't have the infrastructure to move that amount.<eos> Ah, but we do now.
And pretty boring, so try not to fall asleep.<eos> Well, I don't think I'll ever sleep again, so it shouldn't be a problem.<eos> Sooner or later, this guy's gonna come up for air, and the cops'll be there. Yeah.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> The whole house does.
- Your name... please, sir.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Mr. Crowley, did your parents ever teach you any manners?<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Oh, but you do, sir!
Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
- Look.<eos> The system is maintaining its own stability. The quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means? Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, they're lucky to have you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Do you realize what's happening here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We're not into faking things for TV.<eos> But your "heroic" group sure came out of nowhere to find fame and fortune by flashing around some pretty cool powers.<eos> Stolen powers, based on my scans.<eos> Do you know what you can do with your scans?<eos> [laughs] Yeah, I do.
This is like nothing else.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm still shaking.<eos> I rode it until it ran dry twice.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
These are your new friends?<eos> Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not if there's no conflict of interest.<eos> We didn't know you had a contract with Bill.<eos> We don't.
Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Don't forget.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Our neighborhood needs to change.<eos> Of course it does.
Once you got back to the station, then what happened?<eos> Until my first night in here, that was the most scared I've ever been in my life.<eos> They kept saying...<eos> Tell us the truth, Seamus.<eos> I did.
Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
- Yes.<eos> Out in the restaurant you struck an obscene conversation with Rajvir to which the manager is a witness.<eos> What was that about?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> You don't?
Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.
After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.<eos> You did.
And since you were a woman of questionable character in the eyes of the accused Rajvir Singh and his friends on that day, at that moment, what did you do to make it clear that right now I am not interested in sex?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I refused<eos> - What did you say?<eos> What exactly did you do?
Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!
Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!<eos> You did take money!<eos> Of course you did.
Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister? Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
Yes. Okay.<eos> That was interesting.<eos> I'm hungry. Are there any egg bagels left?<eos> Did she come by for a date? Yes.<eos> Yeah, she did.
And what day was that?<eos> September 11, 2011.<eos> The day of the bombing.<eos> We need to find that bag.<eos> Yes, we do.
Why didn't the defense bring this up at trial?<eos> If you found an alternative cause of death, why didn't you disclose it?<eos> Could this have cleared Penny?<eos> Tess. My contract with the defense forbade me from revealing any findings, and the defense had no obligation to reveal any information that would not benefit their clients.<eos> My findings did not.
I don't have anybody to watch him.<eos> His mother's not exactly available.<eos> What about all the bullying?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Walker, but Andre has to learn that his actions have consequences.<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
I mean, is Nate in danger?<eos> Is Callen?<eos> Is there a plan?<eos> If he is in trouble, I just wish he'd reach out somehow.<eos> Maybe he did.
I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
And I'm being told an osprey is heading towards our guys.<eos> It'll never make it in time.<eos> Beale, is that drone armed?<eos> Yes, sir, but we have no authority to order a strike.<eos> But Duggan does.
We can't destroy the satellite because the missiles are grounded, but if we can disrupt the satellite's signal before it gets to the ship, then we can regain control of the destroyer.<eos> But even if we disrupt the signal, you can't reprogram the Corbett's computers without physically being on the boat.<eos> You try to go out to that destroyer, Walt, I guarantee you the hackers will use the ship's weaponry to turn you into Swiss cheese.<eos> And it's moot, anyway, because we have no way to disrupt the hackers' sat signal to the ship.<eos> Yes, we do.
Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
Wait, this is "Badass Cop"?<eos> I thought you said they had a million hits.<eos> This say 403.<eos> You know, the view kind of resets after you hit ten million.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
Hajimemashite.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Sake, lots of it.<eos> What he meant to say is thanks for your hospitality, but we must be going.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Only one way to find out. Ah.<eos> Thought you'd never ask. Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
That's where my mother was born.<eos> We must follow her.<eos> I believe in her.<eos> I believe in them.<eos> Then I do, too.
They'd all stepped down and given up.<eos> But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you? Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
Absolutely not.<eos> Whatever Darhk is planning to exchange with the Soviets, @ ~ it can't be good.<eos> Well, I'll contact the FBI.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> Except we do.
I wanted to say that.<eos> - There's our train.<eos> - Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the east.<eos> - How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> - We don't.
- There's our train.<eos> - Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the east.<eos> - How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> - We don't.<eos> I do.
Yeah, which makes me the last person she should talk to about not using her powers.<eos> Okay, Snow...<eos> Caitlin... You and her, you've always had such a special relationship.<eos> You talk to her.<eos> - No, we don't. - Yeah.
Power... yes, the monster.<eos> That's... ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R.<eos> - Can't be it... - 'Cause we would have detected<eos> - a surge in the power grid. - We did not.
But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad. So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster. I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
See? Ah.<eos> What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.
Good thing your kid won't have to grow up with it like your brother did, huh?<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> How's all that going, anyway?<eos> You ever find that group that paid me to off him?<eos> They didn't.
Lyla, I didn't have to pull that trigger, but I did.<eos> Something's wrong with me, baby. Then let me help you.<eos> We will figure this out together.<eos> When I thought Lawton killed Andy, all I wanted to do was bring his murderer to justice.<eos> I still do.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.<eos> I drew the short straw.<eos> I don't see you on the list.<eos> Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.<eos> You sure he didn't?
That notebook belonged to my father, and when I was first starting out,<eos> I thought that it was my way to save the city.<eos> Well, I think we now know the message Prometheus is trying to send.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.
Heh.<eos> Too soon? Probably.<eos> I was able to cross-reference the list with the city census, nailing it down to 6 potential targets.<eos> How do we know who he'll hit?<eos> We don't.
I just need to speak with Thea.<eos> I think I saw her talking to Malcolm over by the ice sculpture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you need to clam down.<eos> We both do.
Those look like crematorium ashes.<eos> The question is whose?<eos> Right. Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No. Of course you don't.
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
I'd met him.<eos> They sent a version of me to kill everyone on the hobbs list, And now you want my help.<eos> Jennifer, it has nothing...<eos> Jennifer? She never told you<eos> No, she didn't.
With just a few people that you love and that love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> And I know that a small beach wedding Sounds absolutely incredible.<eos> It does, right? Mm-hmm.
We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
I got to get this back to the lab, see if I can crack this sucker.<eos> Yeah, the only thing I found strange are these.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Bond visited maybe the most romantic destinations in the city.<eos> Hmm, pretty damn intimate for a couple of operatives.<eos> Yeah. Kind of unusual, but then again, NOLA does that to folks.
I don't think he's being tortured at all.<eos> I heard that call.<eos> He wasn't being tickled.<eos> He said this wasn't a game and Toby wouldn't be leaving with any parting gifts like on a game show, so who wants to bet he saw us when Sylvester was on The Price Is Right?<eos> Even if he did, so what?
But I can't just leave him here.<eos> Tell them how to save Toby!<eos> Now! Or what, you'll brain me?<eos> I clearly don't care, Walter.<eos> But you do.
Okay.<eos> Wow. That was... messy.<eos> Yeah, it's a mess that I made.<eos> I should've stood by my position on intraoffice relationships.<eos> I didn't.
It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.<eos> They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.<eos> Until the part where the elephant got away.<eos> Great, but I thought you said you got a clear picture of him.<eos> I did.
Okay, uh, that's-that's fine.<eos> We think, uh, maybe he wasn't behind it, but he had something to do with it and knows who it was.<eos> As a matter of fact, we're pretty sure your client was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen.<eos> You have any evidence to support these claims? Yeah, we do.<eos> We do.
You sell 99 cent virtual penguin food, all right?<eos> Get over yourself.<eos> Winner, winner, chicken-waffle dinner.<eos> You got a location?<eos> I do.
Speaking of people who need looking after, the killer saw Hirsch's face, so until we catch this guy, he's gonna need some protection.<eos> Yeah, who's, uh, who's gonna be in charge of that?<eos> Officer Kalakaua.<eos> When they told me I was getting protection, I was hoping you'd volunteer.<eos> I didn't.
That guy was... he was terrified of you.<eos> But Jimmy Brigante, he's a tough kid.<eos> I mean, I guarantee you, he's gonna give you up in a second if it means less prison time for him.<eos> Her lawyer's upstairs.<eos> How you doing in there anyway?
Strange as it may sound, if she was allergic to something on the shooter's clothes, it might help us catch him.<eos> Was she having any symptoms before he grabbed her?<eos> Is it possible it was something in the food?<eos> No. She didn't have any food allergies.<eos> No one in my family does.
I saw that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You saw what?<eos> You do remember her.<eos> Course I do.
And every time you got knocked down, you'd get right back up.<eos> And you never made the same mistake twice.<eos> Well, being a field agent definitely forced me out of my comfort zone.<eos> Well, Gibbs made the right call.<eos> He always does.
- Uh, excuse me?<eos> You asked if I had any fives.<eos> So what you need to do is go grab a hook, pop a worm on it, and go damn fish.<eos> He said a swear!<eos> He certainly did.
What's going on?<eos> You know Mariela Hernandez?<eos> Yes.<eos> She says she delivered a baby girl here two weeks ago.<eos> She didn't.
Sounded like a semi-auto.<eos> You trained on handguns?<eos> We're both tactically certified.<eos> Do you all carry weapons?<eos> - Some of us do.
Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
Now I must find someone fast!<eos> Do not talk like that to the commissary, Gaeta, what are you going to think?<eos> Poor, with what happened to him, was very bad.<eos> - Do you know if Serafino is wearing the alliance?<eos> - Of course he does.
Let me explain something to you two about how this works.<eos> First, you build a case, then you go for an arrest.<eos> I don't know who the hell told you it was a good idea<eos> - to bring in...<eos> - I did.
- Uh, of course not.<eos> I've never worn your pants.<eos> But anyways, this is what I'm saying... I think it would just benefit everyone here if you gave me your number.<eos> Or I could just look it up in your file.<eos> Or... maybe I already did.
Didi, tell him the wrinkle.<eos> This is excellent work.<eos> I couldn't do my job without you.<eos> If there is by any chance that this story has another wrinkle...<eos> Why, it does.
You had everything to do with it!<eos> And that's when I knew I couldn't let you get away with what you'd done to me.<eos> So I got in touch with my friends in low places.<eos> Keeping watch until someone made a mistake, and then...<eos> Someone did.
I woke up around 5:00 a.m., and... Heather or Destiny or whatever the hell her name is was already gone...<eos> along with my credit card.<eos> I'm the real victim here.<eos> All right, it's not that we don't believe your story.<eos> - We don't.
- We didn't shake on it.<eos> Captain, we're detectives.<eos> Don't you think this is a little beneath us?<eos> Just curious, did either of you donate half a million to the mayor's reelection campaign?<eos> Because Walter Brighton did, so...
Taken.<eos> By them.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Who is this man in the yellow hat, dude?<eos> He takes a monkey into a bakery and just leaves him there.<eos> And then he decides all of a sudden that he wants to go run errands.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He did the same thing last episode.
If we take what we've learned and bring it to Taymor...<eos> He'll arrest us before we even get a chance to talk.<eos> And even if he does let us talk, we can't prove any of this.<eos> But we have to do something.<eos> Yeah. We do.
You signaled to me.<eos> I was signaling to anyone who was watching.<eos> I didn't even see you out there.<eos> I don't even know how he fits an ego that big into a frame that small.<eos> Did I do it?
Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
- Hey.<eos> Come in!<eos> Your project sounds wonderful.<eos> I just hope you remember this home as a safe and loving one.<eos> I do, yeah.
You're like my reason for living.<eos> I do love you and want you to get better, but... not for me... but for yourself.<eos> As long as I have you, I can do that.<eos> I do have you, right?<eos> Yes, you do.
We'll find another way to get Jamie and find a cure.<eos> What he said.<eos> Did Chloe ever mention "The Courier"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did, right...
It supplies water to all the farms in the county.<eos> My thought is that the snakes are shedding their toxic glass directly into your farm's water supply.<eos> What about the drinking water?<eos> The county draws it from the river, so at least we don't have to worry about - contamination.<eos> - But we do.
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Bishop, focus on the case.<eos> It's not right, Gibbs.<eos> When troops fight for their country, their families do, too.<eos> Anne Marshall, all the military spouses out there, who-who fights for them?<eos> We do.
- Sure.<eos> Careful.<eos> Hey! Well, if it isn't Emma's co-conspirator.<eos> Oh, so sweet of you, but you didn't have to bring anything.<eos> Oh, I didn't.
Hey, let's go...<eos> let's go say hi to some people.<eos> Why did you invite Stavo?<eos> I thought he creeped you out.<eos> He does and I didn't.
He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should...keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
Let's go.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We told that kid that he didn't kill his friend.<eos> He didn't.
Got a minute?<eos> Ben. What are you...<eos> I just came by to, uh...<eos> You know, I-I had a nice conversation - with Don Heller just now.<eos> - You did?
You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
I know that you're worried, but I... I really...<eos> Look, what about a fetal MRI...<eos> To get a better look at the baby's brain?<eos> To get a clear image, I'd have to put you and the baby under general anesthesia, and I... I don't want to do that unless I have to.<eos> Neither do you.
No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Um, Louise, do you remember your son at all? Donnie?<eos> Son? Son? I...<eos> I don't have any children.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, a-actually, you do.
I've never met him.<eos> Look, he goes by the name of... of Bobby B.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I thought you said this case doesn't have anything to do with your mom anymore.<eos> It doesn't.
Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
But honestly, I did it for you.<eos> Because I believed in you so much...<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - You know I did.<eos> - Y-You didn't.
- No, you didn't.<eos> - You know I did.<eos> - Y-You didn't.<eos> - You know I did.<eos> You didn't.
You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
And why would I do that?<eos> Because there's still time before the primary, which means there's still time for me to change my mind and endorse someone other than Senator Grant.<eos> Say, Susan, for instance.<eos> Do you realize what you're suggesting, Governor?<eos> Because maybe you don't.
Say, Susan, for instance.<eos> Do you realize what you're suggesting, Governor?<eos> Because maybe you don't.<eos> Maybe we want to call this a mistake?<eos> Maybe we don't.
True?<eos> I'm about to "convince" sleazy Branson to keep his mouth shut.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> You came to me because you said that I'm dark and I understand this stuff.<eos> Well, I do!
- She's still breathing.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Brooke, you were supposed to stay outside.<eos> - Did somebody call an ambulance?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, he did.
If that hadn't happened, who knows what I would have been walking into?<eos> This isn't good, Maggie.<eos> Emma and I came back here.<eos> We didn't find anything.<eos> Well, I did.
Why tempt him to disappear his favorite assassin?<eos> If we can find Krasnov and connect him to Vikner...<eos> We'll have them both.<eos> The police know about Krasnov. How do we explain Vikner?<eos> We don't.
For God's sakes, that was just me kibitzing.<eos> That's what I do, I kibitz.<eos> You still never said you were proud of me.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
Okay, you ready? No.<eos> All right.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you'd just ignore what I want.<eos> Well, of course I did.
Because she was asking if the three of us wanted to hang on Saturday, so I thought maybe she suspected something.<eos> No, I would never do that.<eos> I know how to keep a secret.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Too bad Rafe doesn't.
He didn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, no offense, Dillon, but you know nothing about our relationship.<eos> No, but I know quite a bit about Elliott.<eos> Not as much as I do.
- We haven't eaten in two days.<eos> This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.<eos> He's got apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
I couldn't really blame them, though.<eos> Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
That's believable.<eos> We're not here to eat.<eos> He has apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
And Cameron has no idea this is happening?<eos> It's all talk at the moment, but I...<eos> I have to explore every option.<eos> We don't own 35% of the company.<eos> - Yeah, sure we do.
I shouldn't trust you. Trying to turn this whole thing around on me, huh?<eos> See you dudes later.<eos> Good luck with that cough.<eos> You do trust me, right? Yeah.<eos> Of course I do.
How you gonna hunt down $15 million?<eos> None of your goddamn business where I'm gonna get it from.<eos> I'll get it. Tell me you're not gonna get it from your clients.<eos> Spence, that is the reason why me and you are in this mess.<eos> Please, do anything but that.
Aw, look at the little babe.<eos> - She's adorable.<eos> - Oh, my "widdle-widdle."<eos> Aw, you know, Manny, she really likes you. Manny:<eos> She does, she does. Julie:
I mean, the level of purity-- there's an industrial process going on here.<eos> And Oahu is too small to run that kind of operation without attracting attention.<eos> See?<eos> He looks a little confused.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Who shot Joelle?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do. - You do know.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - I really don't.
That ain't how we do.<eos> I'm the one who say how we do.<eos> Jey-jey'd want me to waste 'im.<eos> - He didn't kill nobody.<eos> Davis did. - Eye for an eye.
Ah, I knew you would not let your old partner, Hondo, rot away in this prison.<eos> Hondo, it's good to see you.<eos> Not really.<eos> You better have the intel you promised.<eos> Yes, we do.
What's that driver doing?<eos> We're not rebels!<eos> They're over there!<eos> SABINE: When did Kanan teach you that?<eos> He didn't.
Well, we kind of figured you wouldn't give us the jellyfish.<eos> - Antivenom.<eos> - Thinking these might come in handy.<eos> - We don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, we do, okay?
It's a carnival of religions out there.<eos> ...so much that even God is paraded on streets. Each religion flaunting its might of majority.<eos> But we... real children of God... converse with him.<eos> Do you converse with God?<eos> Do you?
...so much that even God is paraded on streets. Each religion flaunting its might of majority.<eos> But we... real children of God... converse with him.<eos> Do you converse with God?<eos> Do you?<eos> I definitely do.
I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
We may have had our differences...<eos> He literally carried you to Hell.<eos> But I created him.<eos> Certainly that has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
But never so many collected in one single room.<eos> You know, if I ever go back to Hell, I am getting me one of these.<eos> Selfish bastards get to see everything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
Great.<eos> Who's the target?<eos> Well, it could be either one.<eos> We got to get to both of them.<eos> Yeah, before he does.
I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
I was angry.<eos> The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like? No.<eos> No, I don't.
Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
Yeah. That's how he plays, dirty.<eos> All right, well, I don't care about all that.<eos> This kid's future is bright.<eos> So whatever y'all did to tempt him, you need to undo it.<eos> - Oh, I do, do I?
So, where is Cookie Lyon?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Let's give her... a few more minutes.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I don't. Mother.
Listen, so far, we got nothin'.<eos> All right, no disrespect, but your cornball half-brother lives like a monk.<eos> Okay, he doesn't gamble, no drugs, doesn't really drink, I mean, it's damn near insulting.<eos> I thought we had somebody on the inside.<eos> We do.
Don't you understand that by keeping her here, we're protecting you?<eos> By doing what?<eos> Beating the hell out of her?<eos> Pain purges sin.<eos> No, it doesn't.
So I need something specific.<eos> Something you've actually seen.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> Actually, Nate, I do.
What things?<eos> Good God.<eos> I told you.<eos> You had it coming.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Now!<eos> How do they know where to go?<eos> He refuses to eat.<eos> He will eventually.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Marissa's your sister?<eos> Marissa's Mr Barber's lover.<eos> She is 27 years old.<eos> She occasionally stays here when Mr Barber does.<eos> When he does?
Good. Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
You know me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know you!<eos> I don't know you because, Nick,<eos> I don't, okay?
The catch... is that you're not gonna use that to blackmail him.<eos> You... work for us now.<eos> You're gonna use it to bring him down without implicating us in any legal activity.<eos> I don't think you understand how this works.<eos> - We don't? - No.
I mean, there's a lot of good options.<eos> Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that really jibes with my overall message.<eos> You have an overall message?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
Followed by the greatest proposal ever.<eos> Yes, the discount skywriter.<eos> "Mar Me Elibet."<eos> Hey, it worked.<eos> It did.
Elise.<eos> Russell...<eos> Now that I'm on the other side of this, it is pretty rude.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - The cure is just not working.<eos> - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down, I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
What, to kick those up a notch?<eos> Hey, why don't we both go?<eos> We'll grab some more colors, a couple of lattes, and then we'll come right back.<eos> You can trust her.<eos> I do.
Because I'm Abby Sciuto, and I know things.<eos> Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much... Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
And that's where Jake is right now!<eos> Instead of up here, with me, where he belonged.<eos> Unless we wake up and stop acting like this isn't Murderville, we're all gonna end up like Jake.<eos> And we'll deserve it.<eos> But he didn't.
No wonder Noah's still a virgin.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for that to sound so...<eos> Jealous?<eos> 'Cause it did.
They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled.<eos> How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
Got your regular order right here.<eos> Not today, Henry.<eos> I'm trying out a new rifle.<eos> You got any .338 Lapua Magnum?<eos> Sure we do.
- Yeah.<eos> - Well, that's what you call a joke? Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, you guys have those.<eos> - You guys have those here, right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.
What about them?<eos> They want their cut, too.<eos> You really wanna have that conversation now?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually.
Some people do call America Heaven.<eos> Why did she go there?<eos> She went there to work, and grew fond of that place.<eos> Did she love me?<eos> Yes, of course she did.
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi.<eos> It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do.
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
- Please, take Karina.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I said don't do that!<eos> Don't do that.
Let me know when there's no one making threats to me or my entire family. We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
I just don't want him to try and hook me up with a job or anything.<eos> I know, I know, but look, that's my dad, okay?<eos> It's literally the only way he knows how to show people he cares about 'em.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
It's literally the only way he knows how to show people he cares about 'em.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Valencia.<eos> - What do you do there?<eos> - Small business loans.<eos> What, he didn't... he didn't tell you all about it?<eos> - He did. - Yeah.
- Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
- I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
He wants to know why you.<eos> He wants to know your personal story.<eos> Nick: Well, I can tell him about microfinancing and NGOs.<eos> I can't imagine he wants to hear that.<eos> He definitely doesn't.
You about it? You about it?<eos> Cook your own meat.<eos> Don't I take care of y'all?<eos> Don't I take care of y'all niggas?<eos> You goddamn right I do!
Fuck him too!<eos> Marcus Miles is pretty cool, man.<eos> You know he got that invisible car?<eos> What?<eos> Nigga, no he don't.
I know, Mom, soon as I'm out, I'll get back in shape, move around.<eos> No, Lelluccio, you're fine like this, just stay calm.<eos> Then when you're out we'll get moving again.<eos> Just trust your mom, OK?<eos> I do, Mom.
That's the hero rate?<eos> I've had expenses.<eos> I think Swagger just sent me a message.<eos> You think?<eos> Either he did or he didn't.
You'll be allowed to serve out this tour.<eos> You'll never get another chance to command troops in the field<eos> Like you have that kind of juice.<eos> I don't.<eos> My boss does.
What about what you said?<eos> About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
You can't answer that quickly.<eos> Before, I was wrong.<eos> But now I have something to fight for.<eos> Unless you don't want to.<eos> I do.
And you poured everything into the pan and finished the omelet.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - No.<eos> What I do remember is Mom coming downstairs and saying that she was craving pancakes.<eos> She did, didn't she?
Excuse me?<eos> You have eyes, right?<eos> You can tell I'm not a child, and I am definitely not your son, so don't call me "boy."<eos> I'm not sure you realize where you are, boy.<eos> Actually, I do.
God forbid we have real emotion in this show.<eos> What do we got here?<eos> We got a real suitcase.<eos> Finally, we got something real.<eos> Oh, no, we don't!
Don't you want this?<eos> You want it?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come on, smalls.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
I reckon so.<eos> Don't overdo it out there.<eos> I know my limits.<eos> You worry too much.<eos> No, I don't.
You know, I thought it was a good idea when Charlie pitched it.<eos> But now that they're gone.<eos> Aw, honey, don't worry about it.<eos> Charlie knows what he's doing. He does?<eos> Sure, he does.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> I got it!<eos> Grandpa, help me.<eos> I thought you had it trapped.<eos> I did.
- Nah, Dad... - Tell me.<eos> Really.<eos> Well, I, uh... I really wish that you had read my book.<eos> I've read your book.<eos> - No, you didn't.
You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.<eos> I tried that.<eos> I wanted to be a writer, and you wanted me to be you. Or at least one of your beloved Mustangs.<eos> That's true.<eos> I did.
You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did.
It's just that my medical bills have been eating up a lot of my savings...<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.<eos> I don't...<eos> That's not... No, I don't want that.<eos> You don't?
You're making very little sense.<eos> You know that thing they say about how you're supposed to sleep when the baby sleeps?<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Babies don't sleep. - I'd like to sleep.<eos> - At least my baby doesn't.
Right?<eos> What do we do?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - It worked last time.<eos> - No, it didn't!
And they wouldn't let Riggins do it, I guess, but they like me... more... better, because they gave me $80 million.<eos> We have to kill everybody who knows about it.<eos> So... I guess I got to kill you, too. No.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> You don't, uh...
- I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't!<eos> - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
- Why do you want it?<eos> - Why did you take it?<eos> - We don't know!<eos> - Why did you kill Patrick Spring?<eos> - We didn't.
You're Lydia Spring.<eos> Are you the one that wrote this letter?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you really have answers?<eos> I do.
They're a key piece in what's happening.<eos> Two of them even came after us while we were trying to dig up the machine.<eos> - Got them both, though. - Yeah.<eos> You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.
Cops showed up at the temple, had to kill one of them.<eos> Should I be expecting more?<eos> You lost your mind when you betrayed Rainey.<eos> The Supreme Soul had a plan for us, for all of us. Oh, really?<eos> Did he, now?
No, you didn't stutter.<eos> Why'd you make the decision?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Because we landed Benedict Blush for 1.5.<eos> Nick did it.
Things that I don't want to run away from.<eos> And by "things," you mean your cousin's girlfriend?<eos> Don't you understand that if we stay, we risk them finding out everything about us?<eos> Yeah, no, we gotta go.<eos> No, we don't!
Fabulous.<eos> It's a crumbling, creepy house.<eos> Yeah, there's also a crumbling, creepy barn to match.<eos> It used to belong to the James family.<eos> Or it still does.
Emma!<eos> You know... he probably really liked you.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> And the best part is... you just told me you love me.<eos> I did.
This is Mimiko's mirror, a Japanese shaman queen.<eos> It is one of the Library's rarest relics.<eos> How did I end up with it?<eos> Well, you asked earlier if the Guardian guards the Librarians, who guards the Guardians, and there is your answer.<eos> The Library does.
Not on the menu. Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny.<eos> It's a place. And its Count has quite the reputation.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
She can't be.<eos> Yeah, well, it looks like she is.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> We'll find a way to stop her.<eos> We always do.
You know.<eos> I try not to think about the ones I'm going to catch.<eos> I prefer the think about the ones I'm going to save.<eos> You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?<eos> Of course I do.
First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.<eos> Why would you even know that?<eos> Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.<eos> - She wrote that note.<eos> - No she didn't!
- I'm coming.<eos> - She'll be gone before you've got here.<eos> We have a minute, maybe less.<eos> Mattie, hack the global uplink network, push the code to all units.<eos> I did it before.
You help us out, I'll put in a good word with the judge.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> A reduced sentence.<eos> That should wipe the slate clean - between us.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> Wouldn't be surprised.<eos> Everyone, the Reverend Brother's back!<eos> Devyn brought an outside girl here, and she attracted a flying beast.<eos> No, she didn't.
That level of violence definitely matches the Juarez M.O.<eos> I tracked down the serial numbers for the guns recovered at the scene.<eos> Three months before the massacre, they were recovered in a raid by the New York DEA.<eos> How does a Mexican cartel steal weapons from the New York DEA?<eos> - They don't.
Doctor, I can't emphasize enough how important--<eos> FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20, and the technology Beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
Hey, hey, let her go! Let her go!<eos> I'll shoot!<eos> I'll shoot.<eos> We have a shotgun?<eos> We do now.
By the way, Norm, word of advice...<eos> You had your safety on.<eos> Shit.<eos> I heard something on the radio, but they weren't supposed to hit the Earth.<eos> Well, that one did.
We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers.<eos> We're not baby-proofed.<eos> Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!<eos> Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.<eos> Do we?
Doesn't feel good to have somebody encroach on your job, does it?<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> I have complete control of editorial content.<eos> No. No, you don't.<eos> I do.
Everyone's itching for a fight.<eos> Report to me when you got news from Junk City, hmm?<eos> I find out they wasted a flare, I'll personally go down there...<eos> I don't think they would do that.<eos> I really don't...
Karen, those bugs.<eos> Parasite or predator? Parasite.<eos> They were feeding on the corpses.<eos> Only thing we can do is get it out.<eos> Then do it now!
So Hannibal and the Lusitanians are made for each other.<eos> If you're right, and Rome is the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen...<eos> I am right.<eos> Then you'd better have something they don't.<eos> I do.
If Viriathus unites the tribes?<eos> I cannot go back to Rome without the head of Viriathus.<eos> The head of your ghost, sir?<eos> We don't even know who he is.<eos> Someone does, Marcus.
Then they're dead, you bastard!<eos> When they get word of your rebellion in Rome, they will kill them. They were dead anyway.<eos> They would have been taken next year as fodder.<eos> At least this way they have a chance.<eos> Your daughter did not.
And she goes, "It's stuck," right?<eos> And I just said, "Hey.<eos> How'd it get there?"<eos> - You did not say that.<eos> - I did, I did...
You made this.<eos> Had you, didn't I? It's fan-fic.<eos> It's a love letter.<eos> You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.
You're gonna be all right.<eos> We're survivors.<eos> You still have a son.<eos> And he needs you.<eos> Like sons always do.
This is my patient. And I accept full responsibility for him.<eos> He can't just do that, can he? Can he?<eos> Well I have the cure for 10K fever right here.<eos> Well then, if you have this under control...<eos> I do.
Kahlo.<eos> Uh, let's see.<eos> She painted The Wounded Deer.<eos> Yeah. Wow.<eos> She did.
-Oh, come here.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> -Okay. Have a seat.<eos> I think we should let Bethany decide if her legs work or not.<eos> Because they don't.
No, all wrong.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I just--<eos> Those were just some sword flourishes that I thought would translate nicely to the flags. But...<eos> -Uh, but they didn't.
You know what? Let me stop you there.<eos> I went to that theater and I got myself a gig.<eos> -You did?<eos> Without me?<eos> -Yes, I did! I did!
I only know what she told me.<eos> That's a problem.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> - Does it? - Yeah.<eos> It does.
And, um, he wanted to know, did I see anyone else there?<eos> Anyone else?<eos> What did he mean by that?<eos> Did I notice anyone odd or different or unusual?<eos> -And did you?
-Yeah.<eos> He was talking to me.<eos> Tell Nina.<eos> I don't remember a doctor being there.<eos> Yes, you do.
The beer was the best.<eos> -The Altstadt.<eos> -The Altstadt.<eos> He told me to... well, wait there in that bar.<eos> Uh, but I didn't.
Drugs that came from here.<eos> Does this business have something to do with his death?<eos> You don't sound too surprised.<eos> Are you saying that you knew he was thieving drugs?<eos> Uh, yes. We did.
-How about you?<eos> Now I get the feeling that you need chemical aid in that department.<eos> Am I right?<eos> A few days ago we didn't know about Mainline.<eos> Now we do.
Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
In the dream?<eos> You said, "He's here."<eos> Did I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you?
Has to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it has to.<eos> It's just so great to see my favorite customer, right back where he belongs.<eos> I always did my best thinking on this stool.
Gimme a hug.<eos> Well, um, I know you'll are busy and I'll get out of your way.<eos> You mean, you're not staying for Christmas?<eos> Your grandfather never really liked the holidays.<eos> - I did.
Do your fishing in Cabo, Foster.<eos> That case was open, and now it's shut.<eos> The wallet was found in the kid's backpack.<eos> Luke Tate didn't steal anything.<eos> Then who did?
Hey, who here knows how to tap dance?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have a quick question.<eos> Who here knows how to tap dance?<eos> - I do.
I know where she is.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I wanted to understand a few things.<eos> You think her father and I gave up on her?<eos> We didn't.
Still unconscious as of last night.<eos> So... do we still have jobs?<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, I think so.<eos> Don't we?
Oh... just practicing my marksmanship.<eos> Why?<eos> So I can qualify with my service weapon.<eos> Well, technical operators don't require a service weapon.<eos> Yeah, but special agents do.
Where's she going?<eos> What, you're letting her go?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I can't believe you let her play you.<eos> She didn't.
No, that doesn't matter now.<eos> Listen. You said that when you got arrested, you turned down a deal to turn on Sutter.<eos> I need to know exactly what they said.<eos> I don't understand what that has to do with Jill.<eos> It doesn't.
Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> Is there a question?<eos> Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> Yeah, they sure as hell did.
I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job, but I have a lot to learn from you guys.<eos> Your job? What was your job?<eos> I was a marriage counselor.<eos> You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.<eos> And I did!
If he has kids of his own, it might have something to do with them.<eos> I can't imagine what would drive a parent to do something like this.<eos> If he's mentally or chemically imbalanced, a tragic life-altering event could have been the trigger.<eos> Pyros like to watch, right?<eos> Yeah, they do.
It's over, Widow.<eos> There's no way out of this one.<eos> Cap, don't make me go out there.<eos> I'm afraid I have no choice.<eos> None of us do.
Did you see Frank Gallo with him?<eos> Did you or didn't you?<eos> Are you trying to get me killed, man?<eos> Did he touch his food or not?<eos> Yeah, he did, last night at dinner.
- Then get Rachel to do that.<eos> - Harvey, Rachel has law school.<eos> And besides that, this is something that I want to do.<eos> Donna, I don't give a shit about Louis and his tenants.<eos> Well, I do.
I don't know. When does their lease expire?<eos> Oh, my God, I cooked in an extension option!<eos> Louis, relax. The important thing to remember here is that this is your fault for not listening to me.<eos> How does that help me?<eos> It doesn't.
Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Thank you.<eos> Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You must trust him a lot to let him in on your little arrangement.<eos> I do.
Oh, my God, it's perfect.<eos> Is it still available?<eos> - An offer went in this morning.<eos> - We have to beat it.<eos> No, Louis, we don't.
Well, you certainly didn't tell me that you and Maria were high the night of those murders.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - Georgina Casey.<eos> You went to see my old lawyer?<eos> Yes, I did.
Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean what am I doing here?<eos> I need to know if you have anything yet.<eos> - I don't.
Why doesn't it say it on the card?<eos> Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.<eos> Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level, everybody has their person.<eos> Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.<eos> And now I do too.
Then don't forget this.<eos> Because someday, I'm gonna come calling.<eos> Mike, sit down.<eos> I hope you didn't come all the way down here just to tell me that we're running out of time, 'cause I already know that.<eos> I didn't.
You have one week to find a witness. After that, his execution date is set in stone.<eos> We found the guy who's been feeding Sutter his information.<eos> Phillip Allen. I know.<eos> He came by to cut a deal two hours ago, so I gave him one.<eos> - No you goddamn didn't.
We think she knows her assailant.<eos> A guy came in the district last week, made threats.<eos> I want to know why, and I want to know who, and fast.<eos> Sergeant, you know we got those new cameras installed downstairs?<eos> We do?
Huh?<eos> "Police." Is Leonard Milwood here?<eos> He's talking to you.<eos> I don't have to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
You just wait until those untold stories play out.<eos> But here's a little spoiler.<eos> Cinderella's story won't end well.<eos> Why would you want to hurt Ashley?<eos> I don't.
- When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing.<eos> I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
I'm just glad to see you're safe.<eos> Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> I thought you trusted me.<eos> Well, I do.
Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up... that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.
- And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> He did.
Madam Secretary, I don't know where you're getting this information.<eos> From the server you tried to destroy.<eos> But we'll come back to the cyber warfare another time.<eos> You've got bigger problems right now.<eos> Do I?
N-No, no, no.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The...fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.<eos> - You know how that goes.<eos> - I do.
Jekyll has a head start on you with a new serum, one that can destroy Hyde for good this time.<eos> He just needs your help.<eos> Rise and shine!<eos> Well, well, someone had quite the night.<eos> I did?
Please, please sit down.<eos> All right.<eos> So what is this about, detectives?<eos> Mr. Lawson, do you know Hassan Ali?<eos> Yes, I do.
Thank you.<eos> Hey. Yeah, I do understand.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
You're not confident, you're stupid.<eos> You think you can come down here and shake me down?<eos> And here I was thinking that we'd have some time to ourselves.<eos> You never said to come alone.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
I don't know you.<eos> There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend.<eos> Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum.<eos> Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.<eos> And when it does...
I just...<eos> I wanna explain...<eos> I screwed up. And that's on me, but... and...<eos> I know I should've thought of you more.<eos> I do.
I wanna play guitar."<eos> Then the black guy has to run in, "Don't worry, dog.<eos> It's gonna hurt and shit."<eos> I never had to worry about doing anything great with my life.<eos> I didn't.
You're gonna kill us before marco does. That's a brilliant plan.<eos> Come on!<eos> what?<eos> You told me to wait in the car.<eos> Technically, I did.
They're highly trained and very careful.<eos> Every member hidden by multiple false identities.<eos> Every expense paid for by shell corporations.<eos> - So how do we find these guys?<eos> - We don't.
Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
Yeah, those... Those feelings.<eos> So, Maggie thought that I should... Tell you.<eos> And so I did.<eos> I just...<eos> I just did.
Ah, okay, before you say anything, you should know that this gentleman here...<eos> Stand up, Brian.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Brian here has a bad habit of not paying back his debts promptly.<eos> I do.
Not too bad, yourself, man in the van.<eos> You want to keep on doing this, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So do you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
The new guy.<eos> Of course.<eos> Guardian?<eos> I thought you said he helped you.<eos> He did...
Emergency Admission by Certification, Section 3.610, right here.<eos> "Not later than 24 hours, the respondent," that's Casey,<eos> "shall be examined a second time by a psychiatrist,"<eos> and that didn't happen.<eos> - Mom, it did. - No.
Emma, this is the opposite of how therapy's supposed to work.<eos> - I mean, we're... we're making progress.<eos> - Well, I don't see it. My hands are still shaking and the visions are still haunting me despite all the hours on the couch.<eos> So no more talking.<eos> Today we do something.
Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna go make a call.<eos> Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her. They want to mourn her.<eos> Of course they do.
No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me. I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
No Percy?<eos> No, she had to go home.<eos> Thank you. Stepfather's sick.<eos> Didn't think they got along.<eos> They don't.
Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer. Why?<eos> Because I'm Jewish?<eos> That's like me saying, "Hey, you're Indian.<eos> Doesn't your cousin work in a call center?"<eos> My cousin does work in a call center.
Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.<eos> I love your French toast.<eos> Oh, thanks, man.<eos> So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?<eos> We didn't. Sheldon did.
Earl's got people hunting him down across time and space, and I can't get a second date?<eos> Earl!<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I recognize that swagger.<eos> She does?
You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
Oh, ho, that is one magic car.<eos> You know what that means.<eos> Even Han got sex before Caroline.<eos> Who had 32 years for Han in the pool?<eos> Uh, I did.
If there's anything I can do to get you to reconsider, you let me know.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You're a good partner.<eos> I wish there was.<eos> I really do.
That was a joke name we gave him on account of he was always talking about his job.<eos> Wait, he works?<eos> Nah.<eos> Don't know where he went to, but it wasn't a real job.<eos> Did it every single day, though.
In the morning, as soon as the light got in, you took the pigs one by one.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> FBI!<eos> Drop the weapon now!<eos> Do it now!
Kensi, whoa, Kensi's the best.<eos> Do not mess with her, because she can do good cop, bad cop all by herself.<eos> She just uses her good eye and then her weird eye.<eos> She probably freaks people out with that thing.<eos> She does.
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do. You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
You ever wake up one day and not recognize your own life?<eos> Es, actually.<eos> A lot lately.<eos> And now I never know what's going to happen next.<eos> I really don't.
She didn't see anything, okay?<eos> What else do you want?<eos> Go on, Eva.<eos> You seem like a good guy.<eos> You do.
I used to pray every day, hoping somehow she was still alive, being kept somewhere.<eos> I used to dream about it.<eos> But now, after this, I hope she died quick.<eos> I feel like when we were little you told me you saw his face.<eos> Did I?
- Ten skills!<eos> - [Eep and Thunk] Three skills.<eos> Right, three.<eos> I meant to say three.<eos> Sure you did, Dad.
- [Eep and Thunk] Three skills.<eos> Right, three.<eos> I meant to say three.<eos> Sure you did, Dad.<eos> Sure you did.
- The eggs also aren't real.<eos> Then what are we even talking about?<eos> Handprint, please.<eos> Okay, you have three smashfruit.<eos> I do?
What are you doing?<eos> You're supposed to scare it, not entertain it.<eos> [gasping] [screaming] Why did you teach those kids those useless, beautiful sounds?<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Or do, but not like that.
Stop laughing!<eos> [snickering] It was a trick question.<eos> They're all poison.<eos> [grunting] [screaming] You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Of course I do.
My side's got more sunshine.<eos> Well, my side's got better clouds.<eos> - My side's got Womp.<eos> - Yay!<eos> - My side doesn't.
Fine, fine, you did your thing.<eos> Now let's, uh...<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Move!<eos> Do it for true love!
[groans] Do you even know where "there" is?<eos> Next question.<eos> Admit it.<eos> You don't know where we're going, it's dark, and we don't even have a place to sleep!<eos> Sure we do.
Now, for you to think that I would...<eos> I don't know what to think of you.<eos> Well, now you know what they're capable of.<eos> You have to cooperate.<eos> We both do.
One-handed.<eos> Get. He has to take this letter to General Houston.<eos> John Smith is gonna be the first mayor of San Antonio.<eos> - You have to deliver this.<eos> - The hell I do.
Hey, fill in Pride on what you found out, all right?<eos> Uh... okey-dokey.<eos> And that's Scott Hamilton...<eos> I wish I could help you, I do, but I don't know how.<eos> Yes, you do, Dana.
And that text indicates that they're planning a hit today, in our town.<eos> You know where?<eos> She left the location out of the digiverse.<eos> You think they took Dana to pull off - one more heist?<eos> - If they did, then they did it by force.
For what?<eos> Just being cautious.<eos> Hey, Mac.<eos> I thought you said this train was nonstop.<eos> I did.
Watch our backs.<eos> You're our eyes and ears now.<eos> And what am I supposed to do if those guys find Katarina before you find them?<eos> You don't know martial arts, do you?<eos> No, of course you don't.
We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
This whole alpha male pissing contest isn't helping, Kurt.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> He's not gonna open up with you there.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He just did.
All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
Yeah, I don't think that...<eos> I don't think I hoped they would do anything with it, quite frankly.<eos> "This is a book for anarchists... "those who feel able to discipline themselves "on all the subjects, from drugs to weapons, to explosives."<eos> I don't think the book actually says, "This is what you should do with this information."<eos> In fact, it doesn't.
You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
Look out!<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> We have a problem?<eos> No, we don't.
What?<eos> You liked it more than I did.<eos> I did not like it more than you.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I didn't.
ELTs are notoriously unreliable, especially if they're... submerged underwater.<eos> We've narrowed the search field to 220 square miles.<eos> SAR teams are gearing up now.<eos> I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen, but I don't know if I have the strength to lose her again.<eos> None of us do.
We're not gonna do this now.<eos> She hates me.<eos> Uh, yes. For now.<eos> She needs time.<eos> We all do.
She hates me.<eos> Uh, yes. For now.<eos> She needs time.<eos> We all do.<eos> We all do?
- Six days ago.<eos> Then you'll be seeing him within the next 24 hours.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, I-I-I don't.
You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
It's a civilian project.<eos> Okay, then why would Chapman keep it in a secure lab?<eos> You'd have to ask him that.<eos> Or, more importantly, how did you get into a secured lab?<eos> I didn't.
My family only receives $120 a month in benefits.<eos> They're living in poverty.<eos> They're starving.<eos> And they deserve much better.<eos> Yes, they do.
Six months of solitary can do that to you.<eos> Solitary?<eos> How would you know that?<eos> León likes to talk.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Because I like you.<eos> And unlike everyone else, you don't lie about who you are.<eos> How are we gonna win?<eos> They told us to leave our phones there.<eos> I did.
I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah. Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.
No, it's terrible, because what if he asks for money?<eos> What if she can't say no?<eos> What if she gets caught up in his whirlwind of manipulation?<eos> Did she put it that way?<eos> No, I did.
But then you always suck.<eos> Newbie.<eos> I had 14 hours. I think I win, right?<eos> Uh, who had 11?<eos> Oh, I did.
I remember this.<eos> His 32nd birthday party.<eos> His sixth grade graduation.<eos> He made the Honor Roll that year.<eos> Yeah. He did every year.
He was poisoned.<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> Abbs, McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
Well, thank you very much.<eos> Do you want a tour?<eos> I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to...<eos> He wants to find out where the earring came from.<eos> Of course he does.
She deserves a father.<eos> We figured out how to balance our lives, right?<eos> So can he.<eos> The fact that he wants to turn things around says a lot.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Everything's been knocked out.<eos> There's no communication.<eos> There hasn't been much upkeep on the infrastructure there, but a quake that size could be devastating.<eos> Do we have an embassy in Caracas?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know Carla Alvarez.<eos> Did you know her well?<eos> I'd see her when Vincent and I visited down there.<eos> Arabelle doesn't know I ever went to the ranch.<eos> Unless she does.
It does make your hand a bit dirty.<eos> But, no, that's a handy reminder. It is.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No, you're absolutely right 'cause you know, sometimes you drive an unfamiliar car, you're on the motorway and you think, "Oh, did I change into sixth?<eos> Yeah, I did."
- Yeah, exactly.<eos> Actually, no, it doesn't matter, because they've come up with something else instead.<eos> This look.<eos> This is actually an homage to the original 2002, which is the old car on the left, and that, I think, actually looks pretty fab.<eos> -It does.
Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> -Did that go well for you?<eos> -No, it didn't.
Yes, I did.<eos> -Did that go well for you?<eos> -No, it didn't.<eos> -Oh, did it not?<eos> -No, it didn't.
You get back in.<eos> We'll bring a car in so that...<eos> Yeah, so you've got something to reverse up to.<eos> I need to drill some holes for your eyes.<eos> - You bloody don't!
Hey.<eos> Uh...<eos> I was just kind of wondering if... maybe this year, I could wear the hat?<eos> Oh, you want to wear the hat?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I am thankful for my family.<eos> I am thankful that everyone's safe.<eos> And there is no one in the whole world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> Grandma always says the same thing.<eos> Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
Dead.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You knew him how?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
So, looks like this guy also kept financial records on his laptop.<eos> It's a tangle of shell and holding companies.<eos> Very confusing stuff.<eos> Which means you probably found something, right?<eos> I did.
It was never your fault.<eos> I got this.<eos> We go to great lengths to keep the people we love safe.<eos> We spend days and nights worrying about them.<eos> Did we do enough?
- Yep. Is he someone we can even, verify having existed?<eos> Well, there goes our fun-spirited, team-building game.<eos> Yeah, his name was Elliot.<eos> What'd he do for a living?<eos> He didn't.
Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
! When did that happen?<eos> It's okay. It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Sorry. I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Destroy the doc. How?<eos> I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
I am grateful to you.<eos> Why are you saying this now?<eos> Because it needed to be said.<eos> You told them.<eos> No, I didn't.
You two lost?<eos> Perhaps one of you can direct me back to the place mortals call, "North Hollywood"?<eos> So be good commoners and start talking, or else my buddy Thor here will rip you guys to shreds.<eos> Hey, brother, you just call us "commoners"?<eos> Yeah, we did...
Do you think that my son could play with yours sometime after school?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think we can do that.<eos> And does he need sunscreen or not?<eos> He does, right?
And then you imported those scarves then it just, like, took off from there.<eos> Oh, and you're divorced, you have no kids and you look amazing in wide-brimmed hats.<eos> I assume.<eos> You just have the head for it.<eos> I don't.
Thereabout.<eos> So you were clean then?<eos> Just... functional?<eos> Because you know what this little black kid was doing?<eos> I don't...
Which means she's very strong and she can wait.<eos> Our patient will die in hours.<eos> She needs this.<eos> I know she does.<eos> And so does Granny June.
If the clot hadn't killed him, that joke would have, so it's a really good thing he didn't hear it.<eos> That's not funny. How can you...<eos> Edwards.<eos> No, you have to find the good.<eos> Andy did.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
They could be listening to us right now.<eos> We know they pose among us.<eos> So, maybe as we speak, we'll expose them.<eos> - Why should we trust you?<eos> - Because Alex and Ryan do.
I think you'll have your secret weapon locked and loaded before the regionals.<eos> Dr. Webber, do you think I would push her to get surgery for some silly tournament?<eos> She's tried to drop out of the team six times, and that team is the only thing that keeps the lot of us from sitting around, watching TV in the common room, and moldering away like all the other old, wet sponges.<eos> She needs to stay in the game.<eos> We all do.
When you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> Oh.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> You know, but I'm also a realist, and I understand there's a possibility that she doesn't wake up.<eos> Or what if she does...
- You know, I spent a year as an agent afloat early in my career.<eos> It was amazing, but would any one of you rather go? 24 hours of seasickness?<eos> No, thanks. I'll pass.<eos> You know, they make medication for that.<eos> Do they ever.
Yes.<eos> And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Mm. It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Put your hands up.<eos> No!<eos> - So, why don't you tell us why you boarded the ship as Stewart Baxter and filmed classified areas.<eos> I didn't. I mean, I did.<eos> I did.
Walter!<eos> It's no use.<eos> He's out.<eos> All right, so if he's out cold, how we gonna get the oxygen to him?<eos> We don't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> No one can see us from the road, and nobody in the whole world knows about this place, except for me and my best friend.<eos> We built it together.<eos> After my mom died.<eos> Mine did, too.
She's fine.<eos> Screaming.<eos> I know we're supposed to let her cry herself to sleep, but talk about cruel and unusual.<eos> She missed you tonight.<eos> We both did.
Well, you're very good at it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, because I know we're all anxious to get out of here and start our holiday,<eos> I hope you have something very fun planned.<eos> We do.
And you didn't think I'd want to know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I came here tonight to tell you I'm sorry;<eos> Did you?<eos> I didn't.
She does.<eos> I remember that I couldn't control my body sometimes.<eos> There was just this voice.<eos> It kept asking me to come closer.<eos> And when I did...
Me.<eos> Do people ever say that to you?<eos> That you look like a young Chris MacNeil?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Well, you do.
It's not possible that... she could have done this, is it?<eos> I mean, I hardly think that's possible.<eos> Mrs. Rance, please, we're not trying to upset you here.<eos> Did they have families?<eos> Mr. Harris did.
So marriage, as well?<eos> Sure.<eos> Kelly was a frequent topic.<eos> Not to speak out of school. No.<eos> Please, do.
Who?<eos> Who took him?<eos> The Black Fairy.<eos> Storybrooke felt like a dream.<eos> Now this does.
Nothing.<eos> How the hell are we gonna get lucky?<eos> Well, not everything the CIA knows comes up on the TIDE database, so...<eos> - You got a source?<eos> - I do.
- Where is he?<eos> He's on foreign soil, Mr. President.<eos> I thought we froze his passport.<eos> - How did he get out?<eos> - He didn't.
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
Reddington got to her.<eos> If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk, Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
I'd never seen anything like it.<eos> She had A joy for living.<eos> She was more alive than anyone I knew.<eos> When I heard she killed herself... I didn't believe it.<eos> I still don't.
She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
Well, you know, um, she's at a new school, making new friends.<eos> That's probably all it is.<eos> Why don't you try that again and maybe, this time look me in the eye?<eos> Cuz, you don't really want to know what I think.<eos> Actually, I do.
Grace, I promised her that I would not spy on her tonight.<eos> Um, so I don't want to spy on her, but I want to ask you some questions, do a little research.<eos> Look, Mr. Williams, I-I already know where this is going, okay?<eos> You want me to tell you about her boyfriend.<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See?<eos> That. That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you. Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Oh, it's very reasonable, but, uh, there is one catch.<eos> Uh... fish don't, uh, travel well across the pond.<eos> Oh, I will be the best fish mom. Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not. They did.
I'll do whatever I can to make it right.<eos> I've been in here 10 years.<eos> Do you have any idea how long that is... when you're locked in a cage, staring at a cement wall?<eos> - I know you've been through hell.<eos> - No, you don't.
So, he turned for help to Jess Marcum.<eos> Marcum came to Trump's casino in Atlantic City.<eos> He analysed all the data about the way the Kashiwagi had been playing. He then told Trump to suggest a particular high-stakes game that he knew the Japanese gambler could not resist.<eos> His model, Marcum said, predicted that Kashiwagi had to lose.<eos> And after five agonising days, he did.
Second time's the charm and all, right?<eos> Do we have picture?<eos> We sure do.<eos> How you supposed to steer it?<eos> You don't.
It happens all the time.<eos> Tomas, St. Anthony's will be shuttered, whether you accept this promotion or not.<eos> And, believe me, it is a promotion.<eos> You don't want me here.<eos> Of course we do.
I definitely don't wanna go to hell.<eos> I don't wanna got to hell.<eos> I don't wanna go to hell, Paul.<eos> I don't even know how hell works.<eos> I don't.
Come on. Come on.<eos> Hey, need some help?<eos> No. Just, um... trying to get my card to work. You got to have the right kind of clearance to get in.<eos> Yes, I'm supposed to have all access, so...<eos> Just like you do.
I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did.
You're glad I'm not another psycho hacker hell-bent on ending the world?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That. - Mm.<eos> But, Riley, I will admit, I had my doubts.<eos> He never did, though.
He's gonna do it again.<eos> I just do not like him.<eos> Enough. I don't want to hear anymore.<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> We do.
By who?<eos> The defense firm I worked for.<eos> We were told to help prolong the confinement of detainees who refused to produce Intel vital to the War on Terror.<eos> And how do you sleep at night?<eos> I didn't.
They weren't even on the FBI's radar, were they?<eos> You told me yourself, she came to you, told you what they were up to.<eos> If it wasn't for her, you would never have had it.<eos> Did he tell you anything?<eos> Yes, he did.
They do not have us surrounded. They do have us unsettled, only because I wasn't here to lead a... a direct counter attack here.<eos> If we hadn't gone back to Rome, we wouldn't be in this predicament.<eos> But we had to go back to Rome.<eos> We had to go back.<eos> Yes, yes we did.
What'd you do that for?<eos> I dropped the knife!<eos> Doesn't matter. You grabbed for my gun.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> No, I didn't!
The 18 in selected sherry oak casks.<eos> Are we celebrating, or should I be worried that you've gone on the pad?<eos> That's one thing I haven't been accused of.<eos> I thought that shooting team gave you a clean slate.<eos> They did.
And that's when he attacked you?<eos> Ending his Navy career.<eos> Giving him even more of a reason to have it out for Heather Cobb.<eos> Petty Officer Gordon doesn't drive a white Jeep, does he?<eos> As a matter of fact, he does.
As a matter of fact, he does.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> I've been studying these crime scene photos for hours.<eos> Shouldn't you be processing evidence?<eos> I did already.
I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate.<eos> Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I'm here to put the crib together.<eos> Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
please forgive me.<eos> how are you and Fabian?<eos> why do you ask?<eos> I think he likes you.<eos> he doesn't.
We need a copy of the execution briefing sheet.<eos> Got to love New Yorkers.<eos> Knocking's a formality.<eos> You said for me to make myself at home.<eos> - No, I didn't.
There's no proof that memo wasn't just made up.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Nina kept a copy.<eos> Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?<eos> She did.
You were always jealous of me.<eos> The Viking warriors always paid more fealty to me because they liked me better, and that made you crazy.<eos> Well, you bribed them!<eos> You said they'd cross oceans if they prayed to you.<eos> - They did! - Oh!
So, basically, you're blaming God.<eos> I am so glad we're doing this.<eos> Uh, Mike, want to say the blessing?<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> Why doesn't Rob do it?
I got a phone call from prison officials.<eos> They said that a riot had erupted at the prison and that Bob was unaccounted for.<eos> And that's when I threw the phone.<eos> I thought, "If I get this phone out of my hand, it'll all go away."<eos> But it didn't.
By 2015, they'd become the drug underworld's most sophisticated tunnel rats.<eos> But Altiplano poses a whole new set of challenges.<eos> How do you dig out of one of the best guarded prisons in Mexico?<eos> The answer?<eos> You don't.
The first was a young boy.<eos> Will was his name.<eos> His father was the detective assigned to my daughter's case.<eos> No one believed me.<eos> Not even my dad, but... she did.
- Who the hell knows?<eos> - Quick, let's go.<eos> - Don't use your cell phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They did.
Not if he's summoned.<eos> Chop chop.<eos> Did you summon him, Moroes?<eos> No.<eos> He did not.
What?<eos> - No!<eos> - Things are changing.<eos> None of us have enough time to be in a band anymore.<eos> I do!
I was mesmerized.<eos> I was mesmerized by your beauty.<eos> I even had to get off at the wrong Metro station just to ask you your name.<eos> I lied.<eos> She did.
I think I know someone who can help us.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> But I do.
- He was talking to the IMF.<eos> I heard.<eos> He said a referendum.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - He promised. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
And she goes, just like she fled our marriage.<eos> Straight into the arms of academia.<eos> Safe, stable academia.<eos> - Still misses me though.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Burning up the track.<eos> - Burn, baby, burn.<eos> Shakira?<eos> - How did he get Shakira?<eos> - Well, maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
- I do. No, I do. I blame myself.<eos> I'm a woman with a nail in my head that I cannot afford to fix, which might hemorrhage and kill me at any time.<eos> But he was a man who I have learned happily crushed every piece of health legislation that he could get his hands on during his 31-year career.<eos> But... do you know what his last dying words were?<eos> I do.
- Again?<eos> Dear champion vending company, comma. This letter is in regards to No, wait.<eos> In regards to vending machine number 714 located in the intensive care unit of Saint Andre's hospital.<eos> I put five quarters in the machine, and proceeded to push b2, which should've given me the peanut MM's, period.<eos> Regrettably, it did not.
Should I call my mother?<eos> Phil.<eos> They called the house.<eos> Told me you were up here.<eos> They did?
I've gotta go.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> "Moreno" means brown in Spanish, did you know that?<eos> Yes, I did, of course.
How far back is she?<eos> She's gaining.<eos> - I don't think... - I don't...<eos> We need a new plan.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
I won't have you making fun of that boy.<eos> Just because somebody ain't quite as smart as you don't give you no right to look down on him.<eos> Who am I looking down on?<eos> You just said. You just said William Ernest is retarded.<eos> I did not.
- Yeah.<eos> - Welcome back to the driver's seat.<eos> - At your service.<eos> We have a small window to gain control of our cyber intruder.<eos> Yes, we do.
Poor Gilcrest.<eos> You took the vanity road, didn't you?<eos> You ruined yourself to impress a girl.<eos> And did you get the girl?<eos> No, I didn't.
And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
But that is my one bullet to fire at the heart of Skynet.<eos> Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
Happy Saint Patrick's Day.<eos> How are you?<eos> Everybody always commented on my work, right.<eos> - Sure, they did.<eos> - They did! They did!
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
- Leave him to me. - Say, anyone notice that bright light?<eos> Encroaching gunfire?<eos> - Get out. - I can do this.<eos> I know this machine.<eos> He does.
"and wasting the funds which come into his hands."<eos> I've been wasting the funds.<eos> Audrey ran up a hell of a tab at Lowry's Furniture.<eos> The owner says he wants it all by the end of this week.<eos> Does he now?
Is that Adolf?<eos> Long time.<eos> Still not German.<eos> And we don't need any more help.<eos> Yes, you do.
Do something! We gotta go!<eos> Guys, can you hear me?<eos> Sue! Can you hear me? Johnny!<eos> Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
They had a kid!<eos> We're fine. We're totally fine.<eos> What if one of the neighbors saw my license plate?<eos> No one saw you. How do you know that?<eos> - They didn't.
We fucking did it.<eos> - I told you we could do it.<eos> - We made it.<eos> We did it.<eos> We fucking did it.
- Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
I already know.<eos> They shack up together in Barstow.<eos> It turns out Andreas is her boyfriend, Brad.<eos> I did not see it coming.<eos> I actually did, about one, two words into your story.
I don't think the door's gonna hold.<eos> Let's just go up there and fucking kill 'em all!<eos> No, they're just paper tigers.<eos> Radiation sickness fucks up your strength<eos> - as much as it does your...
That's dumb, Lawrence.<eos> There's always markers.<eos> Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well... Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
- You can touch me. - Always?<eos> Only in V.I.P.<eos> No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.<eos> And you have more than one loan on a property?<eos> Everybody does.
And you have more than one loan on a property?<eos> Everybody does.<eos> At least down here.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Everybody does.
Jesus, come on.<eos> I say when we sell.<eos> Look, I get that this is personal for you, but we have a fiduciary responsibility.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
It makes me feel... Sad.<eos> Every time I fucking hit "refresh" it's dropping, man.<eos> And as fun as it is to watch pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, and you are wrong, sir,<eos> I just know, that at the end of the day average people are going to be the ones that are gonna have to pay for all this.<eos> Because they always, always do.
But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley-- why it survived, why you and I did-- because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> Not everybody does.
She loved bees.<eos> My father would be freaking out right now.<eos> Do you know what this will do to people when they find out the truth?<eos> I don't think that most people would want to know the truth.<eos> I do.
You're invincible.<eos> Of course, they tell you all kinds of things to scare you.<eos> "Nothing comes easy." "There is no pleasure without pain."<eos> But, there's something about the Summer, the promise that anything can happen.<eos> And in my case... it did.
So I'm here to help him.<eos> - Why don't you help me.<eos> - With what?<eos> If I had 15 minutes, we'd drink tea, eat biscuits, I'd talk, you'd laugh, and we'd be on our way.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't.
So, based on his calculations, it would pass by Earth in the winter 1981.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - No<eos> God!<eos> It did not!
And then when she dies, I'd get her pension, no questions asked.<eos> I could pass it along to Stacie, no problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical hard ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system, or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
Isn't he, Jacqueline?<eos> And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.<eos> Isn't that right, Mummy?<eos> Do you still believe that they understand you?<eos> - Don't they, Mother?
I am Cinderella.<eos> Your Majesty, I'm no princess.<eos> I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.<eos> I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.<eos> But if it does,
- So...<eos> - You have a question?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Question?<eos> You do.
And people don't like him because he's with you. They like him because he's, like, an amazing guy.<eos> Look, I like myself.<eos> I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.<eos> And I realize now that none of this matters to me.<eos> But it does to you.
He's an abomination and he's got to go.<eos> The challenge for me was I was the only human in that scene.<eos> Everyone else was living dead.<eos> So how did that affect how you played the role?<eos> It didn't.
- I didn't know either.<eos> Is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are trying to pitch me.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did.
Is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are trying to pitch me.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
And you told me that if I came clean and admitted it, you'd get over it.<eos> So don't forget that.<eos> I tried, Eric.<eos> I mean, I didn't move to New York because I really wanted to try.<eos> I did.
We got a real problem with this Travis guy, and I need my manager-producer back now, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did Ari tell you why he's not gonna release the money?<eos> - He didn't like the movie?<eos> - What didn't he like?
No, I mean, what in the actual fuck are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, I never really had a plan for when life shits the bed like this.<eos> Do you have any sense of how many phone calls and hysterical emails I've gotten?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Bin laden, Saddam Hussein-- they have Anthrax now.<eos> Bump.<eos> What is it?<eos> You said you had a lead on marzin.<eos> We do. "We"?
You're really not gonna tell me where you're going?<eos> You know what?<eos> Truth is, it's probably better I didn't ask you to come with me.<eos> This way, I got to spend the next 13 years pretending that you might have actually said yes.<eos> And I did.
Richer than rich.<eos> Famous as shit.<eos> More women than you know what to do with.<eos> I'm telling you this, and I've got to ask, why are you sitting there staring at me looking like that information scares the livin' shit outta you?<eos> Because it does.
She looks like a young Jackie O.<eos> I look absurd with her.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> We have to make her sign a prenup, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
What fun stuff? Like...<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> No, you said a day.<eos> Remember?<eos> No, I didn't.
I know the bill of goods those Cardiff boys sell you.<eos> You got something against clean drinking water?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Maybe I do need a shot. No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
- "Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?
She doesn't want to see you today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I think we're gonna have to give her some space and respect her wishes.<eos> She said... she-she said that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
- Yes.<eos> - Poor old boy.<eos> Never wanted the job, did he?<eos> Got on with it, though.<eos> Yes, he did, didn't he?
Sorry we're late.<eos> This is my friend, Jack Hodges.<eos> He should have breakfast with us.<eos> I don't think that that would be appropriate.<eos> Well, I do.
"and with my own hand labour'd it to grow."<eos> "And this was all the harvest that I reap'd "I came like water and like wind I go."<eos> Miss Bell, you know poetry?<eos> - You know Omar Khayyam.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- I'm Fattuh. The servant of Ms. Bell.<eos> Ms. Gertrude Bell, I know who you are.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
Do you really expect me to believe this joke?<eos> I can only tell you what happened.<eos> And your friend just flew across the room?<eos> I wouldn't believe it either before this.<eos> I do now.
Maggie?<eos> Maggie?<eos> Get in the truck!<eos> -What's wrong?<eos> -Just do it right now.
Um... I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.<eos> You want to sue the Catholic Church? Um...<eos> We're just filing a motion but, uh, yes.<eos> You think it's that important?<eos> Yes, I do.
I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> Yeah and there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.<eos> They're broke. They don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
The Globe does.<eos> If we cover this story, everybody will hear about it.<eos> The Church thinks in centuries, Mr.Rezendes.<eos> Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?<eos> Yeah, I do.
From Snap? Oh, boy.<eos> We reported on him too.<eos> I thought you were watching the game, Steve.<eos> That guy's pretty banged up.<eos> We did a couple stories on him.
I mean, this was like God showing up, you know?<eos> Sure, right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really want to hear this shit? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Patrick, I do.
How are you?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.<eos> You talked to Phil Saviano about all of this, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Anyone else?<eos> Occasionally the Church would bring in another defense attorney to help out.<eos> You have names?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I don't.
Thank you.<eos> I appreciate you joining us.<eos> We're very proud of the work we do here in Boston.<eos> Oh, the Cardinal said you had a nice visit.<eos> Yes, we did.
I didn't ask for this.<eos> Well, where else could we have gone?<eos> I'm only here because I'm sick.<eos> They must think I'm so fucking selfish.<eos> No, they don't.
Shit!<eos> Rory, get up!<eos> Someone spitting.<eos> - How did you know I wasn't dead?<eos> - We didn't.
More chains!<eos> Go!<eos> This way!<eos> Bitch deserved it.<eos> No, she didn't.
You are so much better because of her.<eos> Last year, when Ivan got bedbugs and then came over to my place, and promptly gave my apartment bedbugs as well, they were generous enough to have me on their couch for about two weeks.<eos> And every morning Jon would make coffee, which seemed like a simple thing, and then we would all get up and have breakfast together.<eos> And it wasn't until the third or fourth day that I realized that Jon doesn't drink coffee.<eos> Elissa does.
That was the exact medical procedure that you would follow if Jon had gotten a snake bite on his penis.<eos> - You okay, Phil?<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Daphne. - Phil showed you the wedding video?<eos> - Yes, he did.
I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
A man dies.<eos> Manslaughter in self-defense at most, I would say.<eos> "Wanted for murder." Have it copied.<eos> I thought you said it wasn't...<eos> I did.
Earlier, when my father was here...<eos> I was reading.<eos> I didn't hear a thing.<eos> Did he say anything interesting?<eos> No, he didn't.
Was I going to?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did I want to provide for my family and for my kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I didn't.
The truth will set you free.<eos> The ID number matches the one that came through the wormhole.<eos> But that's probably just a coincidence.<eos> You people don't believe in coincidences.<eos> Sure we do.
- Then it's like it never happened.<eos> - Have you considered--<eos> I'm here.<eos> It happened.<eos> Yes... yes, it did.
- You're the guy I snaked, right?<eos> - Yup. And the one who plucked you off the ocean floor.<eos> I guess you never surfed anything that big before, right?<eos> - Has anybody?<eos> - He almost did.
At Flint, right before the Mac launch.<eos> I was recompiling . I was trying to debug the voice demo.<eos> And you said if I couldn't find a solution, you'd call me out in front of the audience.<eos> Did it say "hello"?<eos> It did.
Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture.<eos> I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer, are you there?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> If the system is a lie, automated... how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
Family!<eos> - Yes, she needs me!<eos> - Look, look!<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> She does.
You gonna pay for those?<eos> - Um, I did.<eos> Didn't I pay for these already?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I didn't.
Doesn't have to be that way.<eos> I watched you run.<eos> You can beat somebody.<eos> If I felt like it.<eos> Which I don't.
Cotton, I guess.<eos> We said there's no way you're gonna do it.<eos> So what'd we do?<eos> Said, double your quote.<eos> And he did it.
We packed light.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did you pack, Tina?<eos> The basics, bikini, mouthwash, diaphragm.<eos> Hell, yeah, you did.
Oh, my God.<eos> I think I almost just pissed my pants.<eos> - You did piss your pants.<eos> - What?<eos> No, I didn't.
Who are they?<eos> They're the new counselors.<eos> They're super nice.<eos> - We don't have new counselors.<eos> - Well, now we do.
- Well, you're not a virgin.<eos> I am, too, a virgin!<eos> I technically am that...<eos> Whatever, what does it matter?<eos> Because it just does, Vicki.
But clearly that's not the case.<eos> So more like, "Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth before I left the house this morning."<eos> Or studio apartment, if we're getting real here.<eos> Did you really not brush your teeth this morning?<eos> No, I did.
That's my jam.<eos> Let's get us some light cannons and blow this sucker back to whatever planet it came from.<eos> No!<eos> No, light cannons don't kill Pac-Man.<eos> Those little ghosts do. Boom!
She's hot!<eos> And limber.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Yes!<eos> Actually, it does.
That was a 2.2.<eos> Our model's predictive.<eos> We got it right, man!<eos> Finally!<eos> Yep, we sure did.
What do you mean?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have to go to Plan B.<eos> I didn't think we had one.<eos> We do now.
Triangle of life.<eos> Let's go.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> But how do we get through that?<eos> We don't.
Insurance wouldn't step up, so we took care of things.<eos> It was the only way to get the little girl back on her feet again.<eos> You shouldn't have come here, Eddie.<eos> - This doesn't concern you.<eos> - Like hell it doesn't!
I can't.<eos> I couldn't even if I wanted to, But I really, really don't.<eos> Daniel, Daniel, I fucked up, Okay, I know I fucked up,<eos> But for God's sake, man, don't do this!<eos> I already did.
I'm so sorry, help!<eos> Oh, please, no!<eos> Oh, mom...<eos> Sorry, do you speak English?<eos> Yes, I do.
Michael!<eos> Put that gun down.<eos> - I'm innocent!<eos> - I know.<eos> - I didn't do anything!
If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
Our father...<eos> All right.<eos> Our father...<eos> I don't think I know that one.<eos> Then do the "Hail Mary" prayer.
A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right.<eos> You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> I did, just not all in one place.
Yeah.<eos> Could you point to the man?<eos> Let the record show the witness points to the defendant.<eos> Do you know the defendant?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know you don't take any of this seriously.<eos> - I don't.
- Georgia? Which part?<eos> - Savannah.<eos> How nice!<eos> Although I hear it gets really humid in Georgia this time of year.<eos> Oh my god it does.
Why does it have to be like this?<eos> If you would just sign the contract you wouldn't have...<eos> Why do you care so much about the contract Christian?<eos> - Don't you like me the way I am?<eos> - Of course I do.
the women were saved.<eos> Can you help me find my daughter?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Yes, you do.
Now, 600 words, and I insist you spend the minimum amount of time on it.<eos> That "Franklin Journal." It's always striving for excellence. Yeah.<eos> Did my, special order come in?<eos> The biographies?<eos> Yes, the did.
So, don't minimize my company's interests.<eos> Now, if you would please, as I said before, walk with me.<eos> We can discuss this in my office.<eos> Chuck, just because you caught me... which is, granted, a pretty big feat... in a trust fall at the company retreat... which you make us all go to... and that I don't like, by the way, that nobody here really likes.<eos> Nobody does.
I just got shot, all over.<eos> I'm just explaining why I look so effed-up.<eos> "Effed up"?<eos> "Fucked."<eos> Oh, "fucked." Yes, you do.
I could make a little salad, turn it into a dinner for two, like we did that time and never did again.<eos> You know that was over five months ago?<eos> No, no, we got to do that again, for sure, but okay if we take a rain check?<eos> - You're awful cute, you know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
You know what? I don't think she meant it.<eos> She'd miss you too much.<eos> I'm starting to think that Maddie is bipolar.<eos> - We go through this every other day.<eos> - We do.
And if you could actually promise her things would fit...<eos> - See?<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> - You have a favorite quote?<eos> - I do.
Relax, fellas. This is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> The key is under a flowerpot.<eos> We go in, we delete, we disappear.<eos> - She doesn't have an alarm, right? - Nope.<eos> She does not.
- She's in a meeting.<eos> - Interrupt her.<eos> - Ben, what's up?<eos> - Jules, your mother has an alarm.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
So, you excited about our trip to San Francisco tomorrow?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I hope you don't have what Matt has.<eos> - I don't.
To me, it's pretty simple.<eos> About The Fit needs you, and if you don't mind me saying, you need it.<eos> Someone may come in with more experience than you, but they're never gonna know what you know.<eos> I never had anything like this in my life.<eos> Not many people do.
If it's done for the wrong reasons.<eos> True repenance... Self knowledge.<eos> And it's made without hoping for anything in return.<eos> Come on, everybody that comes in here want something in return.<eos> Some do.
They had not cleared the contract... - I just need to...<eos> - Frits Ahlstrøm what has gone wrong?<eos> We must admit that it is a little unfortunate what happened.<eos> - Will Horst Wohlers coach?<eos> - No he does not.
You need to tell me everything you know about L'Americain.<eos> Go to hell!<eos> I gave your father my word!<eos> And why should I trust you?<eos> Because my father did?
Not really.<eos> I won't ask what that means.<eos> Would I get married again?<eos> No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.<eos> Of course I do.
But, make sure you're not being follow.ed<eos> Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
This isn't prove, it's a test, like everything else.<eos> The only way to pass, is to go back.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I betrayed Lane's trust too many times.<eos> And in every instance, you did so on you own volition.
- It was her.<eos> Was she right?<eos> Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
$100.<eos> How much did this cost?<eos> $20.<eos> That doesn't pay off, then.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
I thought she was some weekend prostitute or something along those lines.<eos> I was shocked to find out you actually had a kid.<eos> Didn't really work out.<eos> No.<eos> No, it didn't.
Uh, that's a good question. I don't know exactly.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm on Radio Hill across from Dodger Stadium.<eos> - Right. - Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
I would've joined you, but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.<eos> They used up all the hot water.<eos> I should've joined you.<eos> Missed our window.<eos> Did we?
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
It will be better.<eos> - When everyone is dead?<eos> - That is not...<eos> The human race will have every opportunity to improve.<eos> And if they don't?
You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The team is in the city. It's about to light up.<eos> I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.<eos> Yeah. I did.
Fine.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Wanda.<eos> If you stay here, you'll die.<eos> I just did.
And they met in the grief group?<eos> Mm-hmm, while we were still married.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could have put odds on our divorce.<eos> No, people don't think like that.<eos> Yes, they do.
Mm-hmm, while we were still married.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could have put odds on our divorce.<eos> No, people don't think like that.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> No, they don't.
My last boyfriend was eight years ago.<eos> And he wasn't even my boyfriend.<eos> He was almost 60 and fat and he worked in Human Resources and he had a wife and his daughter was older than me.<eos> And the only reason he pursued me was because he thought he'd have a good shot.<eos> Which he did.
I wish I could, sweet pea. Why not?<eos> Pretty please?<eos> Hiya, sunshine.<eos> Daddy, I want Mommy to come.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> So, I'm sure you thought it was a man who sent you back your gloves.<eos> I did.
Your uncle, Maria, died...<eos> At the end of the war, 1945.<eos> So, contrary to the request in Adele's will, the paintings ended up in the Belvedere well before his death.<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, he wrote his own will before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.
But I just want to say that I've... you know, it's like... It's not like I've ever forgotten you.<eos> I've never... I've always thought about you and you've always been in my, you know, my thoughts.<eos> Um, well, I know exactly what you went through.<eos> I have seven children, and I...<eos> Yes, I do.
It was all fear, basically.<eos> The fear was... was put in...<eos> And I still have fear.<eos> I still have fear to this day.<eos> But who doesn't?
Can you please be more respectful?<eos> Yes!<eos> Slap it!<eos> - She likes it.<eos> - Oh, I do! I do!
- You know you can always come home.<eos> The Man won't find you up with us.<eos> Neither will email.<eos> You know we love you.<eos> Yes, we do, baby!
"Before the world ends, I have to dance all night."<eos> Pretty dumb.<eos> Hey, I wrote that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
You were fantastic hypnotizing half the world,<eos> Let alone my two guys at the bank,<eos> But now we have something that you're gonna have to do for us,<eos> Something that we knew about,<eos> But my stupid son didn't.
That she'd go on to make another 100 record-setting patents.<eos> Skinny 'velvet-hangers' make neater closets.<eos> That's a big deal to a lot of people.<eos> I mean, who thinks of things like that?<eos> Joy did.
-Go get the next person, Tony.<eos> -OK.<eos> Neil.<eos> Sorry, we have legal stuff with Barry, now.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't know where he is... I don't know where Johnny is.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Hey, what did you just say?<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - Nothing. I didn't...
Thank you.<eos> Oh, thank...<eos> Get away from here.<eos> You... you have to help us.<eos> I already did.
You know, I think if I went home right now and, with the little space that I've got, but I put my mind to it, I could finish that tree house lickety-split, you know?<eos> Sometimes we make our problems bigger when we put off doing it the right way the first time round.<eos> Then they just get harder and harder to face.<eos> You think?<eos> I do.
This is about her.<eos> You don't have to be here right now...<eos> But she needs somebody to support her through this.<eos> - Uhh! I'm fine!<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Fucking dare you.<eos> You fucking bastard!<eos> What'?<eos> I'm sitting here begging you, and that's all you can say to me'?<eos> - I didn't!
Is that it?<eos> You play the part well.<eos> The other day, my daughter asked me why I didn't like you.<eos> Honestly, at the time, I had no good answer.<eos> But now, I do.
I don't know.<eos> Would you like to count them?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does it look the part?<eos> It does.
Forgive me for the cursory nature of my greeting.<eos> I am Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, owner and proprietor of this great and sincerely profitable hotel.<eos> I'm pleased to meet you...<eos> Of course we have our most luxurious room available.<eos> - We do?
25,000 Rupees...<eos> Done.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That you understood every word he was saying and he should have more respect for his elders.<eos> Well, he does now.
Ha, ha. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not totally giving up.<eos> There is time.<eos> - And things change with time.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
So you and Greg are coworkers?<eos> Naw, we friends.<eos> He just hates calling people his friend.<eos> Dude's got issues.<eos> Yeah, he does.
What bullshit.<eos> It's bullshit and she knows it.<eos> She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.
You don't choose those things.<eos> You can lie in bed all day, crying.<eos> Or you try to make a go of it, one day at a time.<eos> That's what I did, 'cos that's a choice I do have.<eos> You all do.
Don't mess up!<eos> Robert, if he scores, I'll double up your 600.<eos> - I'll go to the bank right now.<eos> - Kid, it's not worth it.<eos> And if he doesn't?
'Cause I've done it before?<eos> You've sucked a cock. Yeah.<eos> When was this, and how come I didn't know about it?<eos> My man days. You know about my man days.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, we'll see who's there. Woah.<eos> So fast.<eos> Sorry I gotta ask you this...<eos> You got money, yeah?<eos> Yes sir, I do, sir.
You piece of shit.<eos> Killing him at Fenway Park wasn't enough for you, huh?<eos> What do you wanna do now?<eos> You don't deserve him, John.<eos> you never did, you never did!
Sorry, my mistake.<eos> I should listen to you more often, Lou.<eos> All right.<eos> You just learned a valuable life lesson.<eos> I did.
Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
- You tell me.<eos> - No games.<eos> - What makes you think this is a game?<eos> The cameras in the Terminal didn't see me.<eos> But the one outside, near the exit, did.
Your note said that you know me, but I don't know you.<eos> But that's not really true, is it, Hathaway?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know you.<eos> Ah, you do?
- You're in great shape, Beck.<eos> - I'm in great shape.<eos> - Yeah. - 6 days a week in the gym<eos> - ought to do it. - Your wife must have love that.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Dig deep.<eos> There you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Huh, you made it.<eos> You did it.
Finn's preparing the feeds now.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
Do you think it could work between us?<eos> We just come from such different worlds.<eos> But I've never felt this way about anybody before.<eos> Not everybody gets that.<eos> You did.
Well... He did help pay for the house, Don, so I guess that makes it partially his lawn.<eos> Does he partially own the kids because he pitches in for their private school?<eos> He just wants what's best for them.<eos> And I don't?<eos> Of course you do.
Don...<eos> Honey, how was your day?<eos> Same old, same old.<eos> Did the new hire make a sale?<eos> Actually, she did.
All right, you ready?<eos> There we go.<eos> - Yeah! - Hey, buddy. Cars don't fly.<eos> Hey, cars don't fly.<eos> This one did, huh?
Absolutely no substitutions.<eos> Aah! Oh, yeah.<eos> Nice on, cabron.<eos> Landed flush.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Bumper, please, just...<eos> That is not even how I talk.<eos> You talk exactly like this. - I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
You can still go to college.<eos> We'll get lifted and you'll tell us about this venture.<eos> Do any of you kids know how to make an apple bong?<eos> No one knows how to make an apple bong.<eos> I do.
Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.<eos> How does my wife?
He wants you to remarry.<eos> Nothing strange about that.<eos> His son needs a father.<eos> His woman needs a man.<eos> She doesn't.
Tilly... I heard she was back.<eos> I had no idea she was so beautiful.<eos> Gertrude knows fruit preservatives.<eos> Female intimate apparel.<eos> She does her own hair too.
Tomorrow.<eos> 8:00.<eos> The hollow in the ferns.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> I do.
I don't want your flyer.<eos> - Please, please.<eos> I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!
I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!
- No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
- No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
I've... actually grown quite attached to you.<eos> All this time together... this is how you say goodbye?<eos> Somehow...<eos> I know that you won't forget me.<eos> Most people don't.
I get connected to a person or a place.<eos> It comes out of nowhere.<eos> It wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.<eos> Did you see something at the house?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
I don't even know what that is.<eos> That's horrifying.<eos> Well, it depends on who the pirate is.<eos> - It didn't work out on the date. - Mm.<eos> It never does.
- For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
The word many people use for wild horses is "mustangs," And that's not a particular breed or a species.<eos> That's just a folksy word for the wild horses we have<eos> Not even to take on the whole, "are they native,<eos> Or are they feral," but the question of, you know, Do these horses have a right to be here?<eos> Yeah, absolutely they do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know the police were here.<eos> This is my colleague, detective.<eos> The one I fucking told you about.<eos> No, you didn't.
I recall one time in the hospital, the third cycle of chemo, very weak, making my way down an endless hallway and a nurse comes up to me with a wheelchair.<eos> She said, "Mr Armstrong, would you care to sit down?"<eos> And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."<eos> "I'm gonna walk."<eos> And I did.
Do you see that, Father?<eos> Those are words of a king.<eos> - I don't want to be king!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not. - Yes, you do!
We need to open now.<eos> Okay. Hey, you.<eos> I can't talk about this anymore right now.<eos> I wish I had time.<eos> But I don't.
I think it's good.<eos> I think we need to keep constantly shocking the viewer.<eos> I mean, if it's too much, we can edit it out later, right?<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> [laughs] How do you do?
That's more expensive than London.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Yes, but it's hundred kilometers from Charkoc, which is the closest we can get.<eos> And as well, he wants half of his money in advance, so he wouldn't come here empty-handed.<eos> Well, of course he does.
Ask him.<eos> Ah, see?<eos> Come on.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Sure it does!
She's just a kid.<eos> Why Would you go after her?<eos> One of them has to die.<eos> We need to decide.<eos> - No, we don't.
- Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
What are you doing?<eos> You're fucking cowards, huh?<eos> Wait, please.<eos> I didn't even say anything wrong.<eos> He did.
Why don't you ask your wife?<eos> It was you?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes, but... why'd you switch?<eos> I didn't.
The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Yes, of course, she does.
- So, make it a good one.<eos> - Make it a good one.<eos> -[screaming]<eos> -[Gale] People always say to us, "Well, you guys must have known you were gonna do sequels "because of the ending of the first movie."<eos> Well, no, we didn't.
Why would you wanna go there?<eos> You gotta take a lot of antibiotics to go there, Joe.<eos> What about Sweden?<eos> You always said swarthy guys fare well in Sweden.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Relax. I can get us a deal.<eos> I know a guy.<eos> You know a guy?<eos> Who are you, fucking Pablo Escobar?<eos> No run... Or do.
I farted.<eos> As if you never fart.<eos> Girls don't fart.<eos> - My auntie farts.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
As if you never fart.<eos> Girls don't fart.<eos> - My auntie farts.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
I did it.<eos> You?<eos> So the little baby brought his nanny.<eos> I thought you told me that a big guy beat you up.<eos> I did.
Well, I came here because, uh, I coach a bunch of the kids at the community center.<eos> But because of the budget cuts, we're having a difficult time supporting them.<eos> So I was wondering if you would have any interest in supporting us.<eos> I assume you have some experience in tournament competitions.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
- Hit me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Yeah. Why are you getting into so many fights?<eos> I don't like to be teased.<eos> Nobody does, Rasheed.
- Yeah?<eos> What does the Bill of Rights mean?<eos> Oh, oh, I know!<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Aren't you too young to make Felix the Cat?<eos> That's not mine, sir.<eos> That's too bad, because he's the biggest star in Hollywood and that's what my theater shows.<eos> Well, I have something much better.<eos> Sure, you do.
I can't keep people working on faith.<eos> I don't blame them for leaving.<eos> They just don't have the vision that you have... they don't see what you see.<eos> I don't even see what I see anymore.<eos> I do.
Here we are.<eos> Oh! Kenny Loggins?<eos> You're still playing?<eos> You guys had guns?<eos> Oh, hell, yeah, we do.
Franny, I was just thinking.<eos> And?<eos> - Why do I just wanna strangle him? - What?<eos> Don't get me wrong, I like him.<eos> I do, but...
It would appear we've had a decrease in population.<eos> Did Mr Healy not come by to take care of the apiary whilst I was gone?<eos> Yes, but he won't be able to do it next time.<eos> - Did Mr Healy say that?<eos> - No, his daughter did.
Didn't do it.<eos> The bees were not to blame.<eos> It was the wasps!<eos> Roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees.<eos> And he did.
Me.<eos> You.<eos> Well, not yet awhile, surely?<eos> Did you finish what you had to do?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why would I do that?<eos> - So Jack could be free.<eos> Now, this is the ultimate sacrifice and I understand that... but did you think about him having a normal childhood?<eos> - But he had me.<eos> - Of course he did.
He's trying to better himself.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> - Minnie...<eos> You don't.
What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.
You make it so obvious.<eos> I'm only human, whether you realize it or not.<eos> And I have feelings, too, you know?<eos> But I know how to keep things in check, not let it go too far.<eos> And you, you don't.
You just saved my life.<eos> I guess I did.<eos> Ironic, considering all the times I've wished you dead.<eos> Kevin wanted to get out.<eos> No, he didn't.
Well, good.<eos> Run it by Doug when he gets there.<eos> Uh, sir, I can assure you there is absolutely no need to send Mr. MacArthur.<eos> We have the situation well in hand.<eos> Do you?
Ha-ha, talk of the devil.<eos> There you are. I missed you at the hotel.<eos> I didn't miss you.<eos> I want my property.<eos> Well, of course you do.
I saw him.<eos> He had on a mask.<eos> He had on a breathing mask.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.
- Bullshit!<eos> Everybody wants to win.<eos> No, you want to win. I want to change things.<eos> - I want to win so that I can change things.<eos> - No, you don't!
I'm not trying to get into your business.<eos> I just think you need to know what's happening.<eos> No.<eos> -You don't know anything about us.<eos> Actually, I do.
Hey, what the hell?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go to Iceland.<eos> - That sounds great.<eos> - It does.
That's interesting.<eos> Is it?<eos> Ah. Here we go.<eos> This smells delicious.<eos> It does.
Best not to dig up the past, Nora.<eos> I thought about Mum dying, how hard that must have been for you, how lonely.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> But I do, Dad.
Visual on them, give me 20 feet.<eos> You two, the second team.<eos> So you're saying you didn't know him at all.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Details, please.<eos> Did Lance notice that I was missing? Um, yeah.<eos> Oh, he's coming.<eos> Listen, tell him there was a wreck on the 405 and you got trapped in that dead zone next to the Getty so you didn't have cell service.<eos> Okay, do it, do it.
♪ Far, far away ♪<eos> ♪ If I could make it right, I'll do just that ♪<eos> Come on, man. That ain't right.<eos> That ain't right.<eos> -Like you never done it.
Sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> You, uh, doing a pentagram?<eos> You want one?<eos> -Maybe I do.
You're telling me this because?<eos> Put 'em in an awful bad spot, if someone were to rob them of that money.<eos> It's not like they're going to go crying to the police about someone stealing their dirty cash.<eos> Well, sounds like you've got this all figured out.<eos> I do, except for one piece.
Yeah.<eos> All right, we need to get IVs, pain meds, bandages, clotting agents.<eos> I can get all that for you.<eos> I just need to deliver it in person.<eos> Of course you do.
I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
Like elsewhere.<eos> Well, you really He has upset someone.<eos> You do not know the half of it.<eos> Userkare to be a King, I do not recognize the name.<eos> A very impressive if you did.
This is wolf country.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Is it keeping us in?<eos> Or something else out?<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Most people want to leave when they first get here, just like you.<eos> But I didn't.
There's only one way out.<eos> But this is the end for me.<eos> you don't have to do this.<eos> You're right.<eos> You do.
Oh, you wanna go out for a walk.<eos> You heard the nice lady they'll throw us back out into the storm!<eos> Dumb dog.<eos> Oh, we don't wanna do that.<eos> Do we?
I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
Do you know what a M1 Abrams is?<eos> It's a type of tank.<eos> I could list like 50 types of tanks right now.<eos> When did I learn about tanks?<eos> I didn't.
- I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Ray is a prick and a narc.<eos> You're gonna tell me that superannuated hippie didn't smoke in his day?<eos> That he still doesn't?
I often tell my students that the mind is a whole universe.<eos> I read an article about this.<eos> Regressive hypnosis has made great progress, gentlemen.<eos> Anyway, I hope you didn't... interrupt my classes, to discuss these topics with me.<eos> Or did you?
Despite everything my Dad put her through.<eos> You don't believe, do you?<eos> In praying.<eos> I believe in you, Angela.<eos> I do.
I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone.<eos> But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
Did you know that Paul Tagliabue, this is the former Commissioner Tagliabue, did you know that Paul was a partner in Covington and Burling?<eos> Which is the same law firm... that represented the big seven tobacco companies.<eos> Of course he was.<eos> But now they're representing the National football League.<eos> Of course they do.
Hello?<eos> Hey, listen, I've had a hell of a day. I just broke out of a hospital.<eos> What the hell you laughing at, it's true!<eos> These fuckin' guys tried to kill me.<eos> They did!
Justice!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Justice!<eos> - Do they ever have mercy?<eos> - Oh, yes. They do.
Oh, I'm sure you think that.<eos> You would.<eos> - Don't presume to know me.<eos> - I can see why she never came here.<eos> She just did.
Come on, Billy.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I still gotta take you back, Billy.<eos> You don't know what goes on in that place.<eos> Sure I do.
Do you know anything about his cousin?<eos> I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file. His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
They've been using us from the beginning.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> I need to know what they used us for.<eos> Doesn't matter what!<eos> Yes, it does!
I mean, that you can, if you sort of face it head on... can help that stagnated individual get beyond... that sort of... I would say immature... stagnation in their development, cognitive development.<eos> Of course, it's not your job to be anyone's clinician.<eos> You know, I'm not saying you have to, you know, put on a lab coat or anything.<eos> Although I think you'd look great in a lab coat.<eos> I do.
Okay, how, when, what changed, what happened?<eos> Who cares!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Yeah, Gilbert's right, does it matter?<eos> Yeah, it does.
A girl who loves her dog...<eos> --..she grew up loving.<eos> And, Your Honour, since it is ultimately your decision, well, I guess every story needs its villain.<eos> Mr Slater does make a valid point.<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, every year, sharks swarm, sometimes 15,000 in an area less than two miles wide.<eos> They define hunting territory, mate, devour everything in sight, then move on.<eos> I'm concerned that what we've got in the front yard is just a scouting party waiting on a thousand of their dearest friends.<eos> No, this doesn't sound good at all.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Um, no.<eos> It's one of the greats.<eos> And Hedy Lamarr is fascinating.<eos> She invented, uh-- She invented frequency hopping.<eos> No, she didn't.
Saw you following us and shit.<eos> You have fun?<eos> What the fuck do you want, man?<eos> I want to know who did the drive-by on one of your corners.<eos> Oh, you do?
Do another one. - Okay, okay.<eos> - Different pose.<eos> - Hold on. Okay.<eos> How do we know if Alonzo's even here?<eos> We don't.
I don't want to lose my son.<eos> - Bedwyr's asthmatic, isn't he? - Yes.<eos> - Does he smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> - Somebody with him does.
Yes.<eos> Just a little bit closer range. I can't let this out.<eos> But it seems to be that I'm going to be delivering the keynote speech tonight at the security officers' convention.<eos> You know, I think they canceled that.<eos> They didn't.
They've already upgraded the lock on Mr. Van Gogh to the dual control.<eos> You said the upgrades weren't scheduled till tomorrow.<eos> Because that is what the security e-mail said.<eos> Now, I do have a guy on the inside who was supposed to alert me if the schedule changed.<eos> Obviously, he didn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Get her.<eos> And yet, when people ask me, "Why do you do it?" I have to laugh.<eos> 'Cause they think I have a choice.<eos> I don't.
Okay, it must be this way.<eos> I walked that direction.<eos> I could not find any trail.<eos> You don't want to leave.<eos> I do.
For sightseeing?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know who the hell you are but I stopped to help you.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
We have one daughter, fuyu.<eos> Sorry I yelled at you, earlier.<eos> Maybe I deserved.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
I'm taking her to the law.<eos> So you're a bounty hunter?<eos> That's right, buster.<eos> Do you have a warrant?<eos> Yeah, course I do.
I take it you're Daisy Domergue? That's her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, it says here 'Dead or Alive. Yeah.<eos> It does.
Mm. Want a little snake bite in your coffee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Five of you?<eos> Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.<eos> Yes, it does.
She still stinking up the place with Old Quail pipe tobacco?<eos> Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe. She rolls her own.<eos> Red Apple Tobacco.<eos> But, mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.
John Ruth says you got a Lincoln letter.<eos> I told you, jackass, go hee-haw someplace else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> You did say that, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, I did.
And on that cold day, with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel I made him strip right down to his bare ass.<eos> Then I told him to start walkin.<eos> I walked his naked ass for two hours 'fore the cold collapsed him.<eos> You never even knew my boy?<eos> No, he didn't!
And Sweet Dave.<eos> Four measly bullets and there goes Senor Bob.<eos> But that still don't get us no closer to which one of y'all poisoned the coffee, though.<eos> Do it, Chris?<eos> No, it sure don't.
That's why.<eos> Now, when he gets here I'm gonna kill that fella and turn my sister loose.<eos> Now, do you have any reason why you would want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> No.<eos> You don't?
Now, when he gets here I'm gonna kill that fella and turn my sister loose.<eos> Now, do you have any reason why you would want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> No.<eos> You don't?<eos> No, I don't.
If you had any brains you would be!<eos> You see<eos> here 's the problem, Daisy.<eos> In order for me to be scared of your threats I got to believe in those 15 extra gang members waiting it out in Red Rock.<eos> And ,boy oh, boy, I sure don't.
Please continue.<eos> Do you want us to perform the same piece or something else?<eos> Something else.<eos> Didn't her parents play beautifully?<eos> Yes, they did.
I think you don't need my dad's help to go into town.<eos> You, when you were a kid, did you know how to add and subtract?<eos> Well, not much.<eos> I tell you what, not much now neither.<eos> Well, I do.
It's just for another week.<eos> What am I gonna do without Hamlet?<eos> He's a cat.<eos> He'll find his way home.<eos> They always do.
That's amazing.<eos> So I'm just manning the stall.<eos> Get away from the chaos at the factory.<eos> Well... Do you still have those Bavarian pickles?<eos> Sure do.
I'll take you and Lily to something else.<eos> Why don't we see what's playing?<eos> Justine, where are the Band-Aids?<eos> - Have you heard from John?<eos> - I did.
Buddhist.<eos> But I think that if you just saw him, you guys just...<eos> You have to let this go, Maggie.<eos> This story has its own momentum, apart from you.<eos> It always did.
- That's dirty.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Rebel!<eos> They look like they're having so much fun.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Yes!<eos> Jesus...<eos> Hallelujah. ALL: Hallelujah.<eos> I got the juice.<eos> Yes, you do.
We go by there tomorrow then.<eos> No, no.<eos> He said to come through tonight. 11:00.<eos> I can't believe that Mom let you borrow the car. (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> She didn't. What?
But how are you doing?<eos> I'm... I'm scared, Father.<eos> Cast thy burden unto the Lord and he shall sustain thee.<eos> I have faith in God's strength, believe me.<eos> I do.
My doctor friend has a price of $20,000 American.<eos> Look... Deacon, I don't have that kind of cash on hand. Do you?<eos> George, what about you?<eos> For God's sakes, no.<eos> I do.
You see that?<eos> I'm limited to one block around my house and my work.<eos> And if I'm caught even near a computer I go straight back to jail to serve out the rest of my sentence.<eos> - You of all people know this.<eos> - I do.
George, I owe you.<eos> So listen to me.<eos> You don't really want the list.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
Well, you were never home.<eos> All your life out saving the world, you forgot about me.<eos> Since I'm going to die, I'll get it off my chest:<eos> Secret agents don't have kids.<eos> James Bond didn't, or Jason Bourne.
Open it.<eos> I find out that she's hurt, or you even so much as fucking touched her, then I'm gonna make you pay. - Understand?<eos> - I didn't touch her, Holmes.<eos> I swear.<eos> Nobody did.
Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
- John.<eos> - John.<eos> Kind of ballsy giving him a breath after that first shot, huh?<eos> He might've knocked one back at you.<eos> He didn't.
Yeah... that's about how long it takes.<eos> I went to watch, at first.<eos> Because that's who I was... a spectator.<eos> And this kid, maybe 20, he had this look on his face... like this was one more thing he was gonna fail at.<eos> And he did.
All right.<eos> Okay, Frankie, okay.<eos> Why are you so upset right now?<eos> I don't want to go to school.<eos> You don't? No.
On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Nikolaou left in tears, the rest are down in their cabins.<eos> An ambulance is on its way.<eos> Christos lost a lot of blood.<eos> You believed it.<eos> No I didn't.
You believed it.<eos> No I didn't.<eos> You did.<eos> No I didn't.<eos> Yes you did.
- Orega-what?<eos> - Oregano.<eos> So....<eos> Something special supposed to happen?<eos> It just did.
What, are you guys ganging up on me now?<eos> You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Who wouldn't want a dick that looks like that?<eos> Do you want to suck it?<eos> Do I wanna suck it? Oh, man.<eos> I'm gonna start putting people's last names on my contacts.<eos> No I don't.
Lindy, whatever he wants to tell you by sending you this picture could help us find Reese.<eos> In the original picture, your sister's wearing a bracelet, but in the replica, she's not.<eos> Why?<eos> - I didn't think anyone noticed.<eos> - I did.
I am trying to throw a party.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Detective Yaeger, can you please escort my dis-invited best friend out?<eos> Really?<eos> So, um, nobody does flowers anymore.
And now she's dead.<eos> For two years, Erika was on the Unos list for a new heart.<eos> Worked her way to the top but got so sick, her doctors put her on a drug trial to bridge the time 'til<eos> - an organ became available.<eos> - And one never did?
Thanks for helping us.<eos> Erika created a perfect virus, but she never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> She just became obsessed.<eos> I don't think I understand that kind of obsession.<eos> I do.
I thought maybe you could see who came in and out of the apartment.<eos> You should go to the police.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I'm this close to getting offered the job of a lifetime with Jake's law firm.<eos> They do thorough background checks.
Bipolar disorder or whatever it may be...<eos> Sophia... But I looked into these drugs, and it's really bad to drink while taking them.<eos> So maybe that's something you need to rethink.<eos> Sophia, it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, so much for never letting anything happen to her, Tommy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So much for staying neutral.<eos> For God's sake, Catherine, if you have information about that girl's sister, you have to let her know.<eos> Do I?
What do you mean?<eos> It was an unnecessary waste of lives.<eos> Our government had already capitulated.<eos> Didn't you know that?<eos> No, I did not.
- Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> Well, why were you her next of kin?<eos> Because they thought we were married.<eos> - Who did?
I suppose it's because they've got children and grandchildren, and...<eos> I guess we didn't see the point of taking pictures of ourselves.<eos> Would have been a bit vain.<eos> You used to say that everybody taking pictures all the time stopped anyone having any fun.<eos> - Did I?
Hope you've got your speech prepared.<eos> I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
I'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I never really thought about it before, but... last night made me realize how... at any day, any point... we could just die.<eos> We didn't.
So...<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you think that we look alike, me and Reggie?<eos> Oh, yes, certainly.<eos> No, you don't.
Plenty.<eos> How many?<eos> Hookers don't count.<eos> - Hookers don't count?<eos> - No, they don't.
We couldn't make it back last night.<eos> And Nikola behaved very well.<eos> Tell him... that Nikola took us to his house in Dukovo.<eos> He asks if boy went into the house.<eos> No, he didn't.
But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
No-one could hide down there.<eos> Ever get the feeling you're being hunted, Tubs?<eos> Stop calling me that.<eos> I ain't even fat.<eos> And, no, I don't.
Of Spanish influenza, after the war.<eos> Who?<eos> My wife Lesley.<eos> After all that, she died of the Spanish flu.<eos> So many did.
The killer and Wargrave having common cause, the same thrill... from handing out death.<eos> You took the piss when I said the Judge.<eos> Yes, well, now I think different.<eos> How many men has he seen dangle?<eos> What does that do to someone?
Oh, no.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Amy broke up with Sheldon.<eos> She did?
It's like destiny that we were meant to meet.<eos> Do you believe in destiny, Evan?<eos> I'm an architect.<eos> So obviously I believe that things happen by your own design.<eos> Well, I do.
More than anything in the world.<eos> So why didn't you think of them when you were inside us?<eos> Yeah, why, Evan?<eos> Last night had nothing to do with my family.<eos> Damn right it didn't, Evan!
They believe hes everywhere.<eos> Everywhere?<eos> But cannot be seen?<eos> How do they know he exists?<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
Anything wondrous.<eos> Make bread fall from the heavens.<eos> Feed us a morning meal.<eos> My preference is lentils and barley.<eos> Do something!
Uh, it's a reality show,<eos> And we're looking for an Eastern European girl...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who can speak a bit of Italian.<eos> Oh, well... I do.
100 if you tell me where Sofia is.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Where is Sofia?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
"I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
She called me a bitch and a whore.<eos> And then she stood on a couch and shushed the entire party and told them I have chlamydia.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which, I don't.
Captain James Flint.<eos> You're Captain Flint?<eos> I am.<eos> And you wish an audience with Lord Ashe?<eos> I do.
I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You'd remind them of things they left behind.<eos> And many of those are painful.<eos> You're doctors.<eos> I'm sure you don't want to cause pain.<eos> No. We don't.
( without accent ) You do?<eos> I just want to confirm.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Someone's got good news.<eos> Someone does.
We didn't exactly exchange niceties.<eos> He got the jump on me.<eos> Got me on my knees.<eos> Thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> Why didn't he?
He's still young.<eos> He's 13.<eos> Boys go to war at 13.<eos> - He has other gifts.<eos> - Does he?
BELL TINKLES<eos> Good morning, madam.<eos> I'm your fiance's daughter. Marlene Dooley, nee Buckle. You remember me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do. ~ Oh, what a lovely surprise. ~ Good.
So, what?<eos> We, either have a high chance of killing 1 person, or low chance of killing 6 people.<eos> How do we make that decision?<eos> We don't have to make it, Bruce.<eos> He does.
If they don't say your name, thank God.<eos> If they do, say a prayer.<eos> He knew his end was near.<eos> - How did he know?<eos> - He just did.
He's still got a lot of support in the army. He's head of the Pakistani Unity Party, ran in the last election, lost, contested the results. I guess he's not bothering to wait around for a recount.<eos> Looks like he's in charge now. There...<eos> Ah, sound.<eos> - Who speaks Urdu?<eos> - I do, sir.
..but I am.<eos> You weren't worried, were you?<eos> Nah.<eos> Can you imagine being told you've got it?<eos> Well, we don't.
That's right!<eos> Tim, the car isn't yours.<eos> No, but I need it.<eos> John told Lois that you had to have a scan.<eos> Did he, now?
Yeah.<eos> Then do not talk to anybody else about your case. Inside of government or outside.<eos> Except to me, to the extent that you trust me.<eos> I have a mandate to serve you.<eos> Nobody else does.
- Yeah.<eos> You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused because one quarter of the jam can't come out.<eos> MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<eos> You have a lovely home.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Cunty. And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while I'm here.<eos> Okay, that one's easy.<eos> No, you cannot. 'Cause, you know, I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch, and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty," then it's like, I'm not going to want to have Cunty over at all, which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, it does not...
Leave me alone for a sec.<eos> What's up?<eos> - Well, okay.<eos> I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it?<eos> Oh, yeah, it does.
Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.<eos> That's it, period. Mmm...<eos> Actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - No, I don't.
A man's dildo.<eos> "Fecal eclipse."<eos> It loses something in translation.<eos> We don't have a word for it.<eos> They do.
What's happening?<eos> Russ Hanneman.<eos> True pleasure to meet you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Yes.<eos> He's a vulgar human being. He's utterly distasteful.<eos> And it would not be inaccurate to say that we at Raviga are now co-investors with Russ Hanneman.<eos> I tried to talk him out of it.<eos> I did, but...
The things I do for you.<eos> For such a little man, Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.<eos> This is as close to your God as I can get you.<eos> I never knew what a martyr was.<eos> I still don't.
As if the gods are protecting me.<eos> Go.<eos> You're alive, aren't you?<eos> Today went badly.<eos> Yes, it did.
- Noah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did he pay it back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
He came home drunk last night talking all sorts of shit, and I don't know.<eos> But don't worry, he ain't going to say nothing.<eos> I think you've had enough.<eos> Don't you think you've fucking had enough?<eos> - No. - I do.
- You grew up in a political family. - Yes, sir.<eos> Your father, Rayne Pryce, was mayor during the Seventies.<eos> He created numerous opportunities for the city's black population.<eos> I'd imagine folk down here still love your daddy, don't they?<eos> Yes, they do. Very much.
Are the guests having fun?<eos> Are the animals enjoying life?<eos> Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.<eos> We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.<eos> Sure you do.
Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
Enough is enough, stop troubling me..<eos> And tell me where's that Singh.<eos> Or you don't know what I can do with you.<eos> Enough is enough, tell me where he is..<eos> Don't do powder of my brain.
"My heart goes..."<eos> I also like cream in my coconut water.<eos> Pompy, did you get cramps too?<eos> Idiot, couldn't you warn me.<eos> I did.
I'll go and tell mom...<eos> Sara...<eos> No matter where a girl hails from, but she does feel shy.<eos> So she told you?<eos> Yes, she did.
I said stop! - Heidi!<eos> Don't go!<eos> How dare you!<eos> Dete said I can leave when I want.<eos> Did she really?
Uh, yes, I understand your skepticism, Mr. Jones.<eos> Trolls are not indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. But with the return of magic to the world, all sorts of odd things are waking up.<eos> And if indeed it is a troll you're facing, we'll it's not been nice knowing you, per Se--<eos> How do we fight a troll?<eos> You don't.
Maybe the Obsidian Blade?<eos> That would be...<eos> Oh, well, that might work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
- Those who performed the Black Hymn may try to reverse it before Aeloth's ascension.<eos> - Can't you destroy it?<eos> - No!<eos> Only those who still have a soul can touch the pages.<eos> I do not.
How is your head?<eos> Fine.<eos> If your wife is coming, let me know and I'll wear a tie.<eos> She'd see right through you.<eos> They always do.
How wonderful.<eos> And you said?<eos> I said we hate boats and we hate people.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I didn't, but we do.
Maybe I don't say that enough.<eos> It's difficult, because it makes me wanna be with you.<eos> And I know how hard it is for you to be with me.<eos> Only, don't begin to think he sees you any differently than I do.<eos> Of course he does.
I've read your books.<eos> - Have you? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I think I like the first one best.<eos> I guess everybody did.<eos> Everyone did.
I'd like to stop at a church.<eos> Okay.<eos> I prayed that God might forgive me for all the horrible things I said when we knew.<eos> And I prayed for the strength to mean it.<eos> Because I don't.
It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
He said that was another vent the devil could creep through.<eos> So, he outlawed the piano.<eos> Put paid to music generally.<eos> Said dividends would accrue in terms of growth of the spirit.<eos> Which they did.
You know, I'm not good with neurotic.<eos> I don't have the patience.<eos> Still, he almost died.<eos> I know that.<eos> But he didn't.
I mean, we've known it's been doing this for at least a century.<eos> Uh, the first confirmed sighting was, uh, 1883, when a woman named Abigail Munson...<eos> I don't need the whole real-estate ad from hell.<eos> Just tell me how to get Katie's friends out of here.<eos> Well, you don't.
Like magic...<eos> A fine, little house in the middle of nowhere.<eos> My family never knew how special it was.<eos> Not one of them heard this house whispering.<eos> But I did.
She disapproves of my disapproval.<eos> What do you disapprove of?<eos> Roman, mainly.<eos> Lydia isn't quite bright enough to see I'm just intimidated.<eos> Roman does, of course.
Gentlemen..<eos> I hope I never see either one of you ever again.<eos> Wait!<eos> Do you know how she died?<eos> Yes, I do.
You have made thing very difficult for me.<eos> What do you want in exchange?<eos> Do you want to know how Angel died?<eos> - You know how Angel died?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
I'm Danny and this is our lovely assistant, Elena.<eos> Okay, so, the scares do not just end tonight.<eos> Tomorrow we'll be having a haunted tour of the Ritz Theater.<eos> Now, you may wonder, hmm, do we have anything else in store?<eos> Yes we do.
Sorry, it's me.<eos> Oh, my God, you scared me!<eos> Um, sorry.<eos> Ty told me that you guys wanted to know a little bit about tomorrow.<eos> He does.
I mean, I took you out to a nice restaurant, I bought you decent food, you know.<eos> I was having a great time, I mean, weren't you?<eos> No, I was just being nice.<eos> Elena I think I love you.<eos> Well, I don't.
What?<eos> Between the divorce and selling the company...<eos> Poor thing, she's having a tough time.<eos> I told her not to sell.<eos> I did.
What do you wanna see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me?<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
Children?<eos> Children.<eos> Gather around.<eos> Who wants to play a game?<eos> -I do.
It seems very healthy.<eos> Michael says the bounty of the earth is ours to master.<eos> You must get tired of the same thing though.<eos> When I was a kid, I loved Red Vines.<eos> I still do.
I asked him one day, I said, "Why do you tie a blanket around your shoulders?"<eos> And he said, "Because I'm Superman, and Superman can fly.<eos> And he'll never get sick because he can fly away from any disease."<eos> Did Arthur get better?<eos> Yeah, he did.
We trusted him.<eos> But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan's eyes, she knew.<eos> We were such fools.<eos> You had no reason not to believe him.<eos> But now I do.
But we'll definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue's my favorite color.<eos> Tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Of course we do.
You did this yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You showed me how.<eos> You said it would save Dr. Kyle.<eos> It did.
You gotta let it go, man.<eos> There's good that came out of this.<eos> Yeah, we used him, then we got him killed.<eos> No, we didn't kill him...<eos> Escobar did.
Good luck, Vice Minister.<eos> Now what?<eos> I'm sorry, Ambassador.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Damn right we do.
Oh, my God.<eos> All right, boys!<eos> Get a ladder over here!<eos> The sicarios weren't the only guys in the prison who worked for Escobar.<eos> The guards did, too.
There's a no-fly zone over the prison, with antiaircraft guns manned by the Colombian army to enforce it.<eos> You're playing with fire if Noonan finds out.<eos> We don't got shit on him without intercepts.<eos> - Don't need 'em. - What?<eos> The hell we don't.
An Alpha cannot show his throat like this.<eos> Is not personal, is politics.<eos> There's nothing more personal than politics.<eos> You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death.<eos> And if I don't?
Train you to work with us?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> I've seen what he's capable of.<eos> You need me.<eos> Of course we do.
Animal mutations.<eos> Stay clear of her.<eos> I don't want to see her taking advantage of another facility.<eos> Dr. Bauer survived.<eos> Yeah, she did.
And they will not remember seeing her.<eos> One will.<eos> One of them was Rachel.<eos> Elena never told me that.<eos> She didn't?
But we started the research at the university. -Serge--<eos> -Exactly.<eos> Started.<eos> You see, after we gave you your grant, in case you didn't read the fine print, you signed over your patent rights.<eos> No, we didn't.
Thanks, Mom.<eos> It's weird, you know.<eos> My whole life,<eos> Like even in kindergarten, everyone had all these... crazy dreams to be like the president or a veterinarian and...<eos> I just never did.
You want me to, I'll find out, but I--<eos> You- - You can't be hanging around with him.<eos> So I can come home, but I can't see my friend?<eos> You know, you wanna be part of the family business... you gotta have responsibility for the family name.<eos> We all do.
Well, I just--<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
What if he finds out about this?<eos> What if he found this?<eos> - How you gonna explain that?<eos> - I don't have to explain anything.<eos> No, you don't.
What the hell is that?<eos> Immunization boosters.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> No, No. No. Nobody said anything about getting shots.<eos> Uh, yeah they did, during training.
She's the only living relative as far as I know.<eos> Okay. All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> No, they don't.
Can I help you?<eos> My name's Ree Osbourne.<eos> I'm here about the two that were shot last night, the two in the forest.<eos> Do you have information about the case?<eos> No, I don't.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Because there is an immovable stain on it, right?<eos> Like red wine or something.<eos> But why do you change the floorboards underneath?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Are you trying to persuade me, governor, Or are you rehearsing for a judge?<eos> Look, if your sheriff Is anywhere near those interviews, All the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer;<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes, I do.
No.<eos> Good. That's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship With sheriff Anderssen.<eos> So, she doesn't.
As were the fingerprints of your lover.<eos> Yes.<eos> But nobody knows which one of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.<eos> Nobody.<eos> You do.
It's a receipt for something he shot on the glacier that he wanted prepared.<eos> It's here somewhere.<eos> Did Pettigrew ever talk about why he was here?<eos> He might've done.<eos> Well, did he or didn't he?
He was a good leader...<eos> I don't think you keep those tags to remind you of your failures. I think you keep them because you can't get away from your past.<eos> The squad, the men... they will do the job when the time comes.<eos> Trust them.<eos> I do...
Be firm with her.<eos> She is willful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you bought.<eos> I do.
How you supposed to help her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she appeared to me for a reason.<eos> Everything have a reason, does it?<eos> This did.
My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
We need to know what these things are.<eos> Yes, they're witches, understood.<eos> Witchcraft has a long history in many cultures, Doctor, as well you know.<eos> As do fairies and sprites, but they don't walk about - Greater London, do they?<eos> - These do.
Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.<eos> The demon did.
They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest.<eos> That's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have a life.<eos> Now she does.
Without Mina.<eos> Without you, even.<eos> But when he settles down, he'll come around.<eos> He won't forget about you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
We were drawing pictures and I made fun of her silly horse.<eos> - It wasn't silly.<eos> - Well, it looks like a hippopotamus. - Doesn't it, Clare?<eos> - I'm sure it doesn't.<eos> No, it really does.
Shall we?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Please.<eos> He really seems taken with us.<eos> He does.
~ On her way.<eos> Took the day off on account of the festival starting.<eos> Some sort of exotic stew?<eos> ~ Do people still eat eels?<eos> ~ Not live ones, they don't.
~ And there's no sign of the laptop.<eos> What about his phone records.<eos> He received a call early yesterday morning, made from a phone box.<eos> Do they still exist?<eos> The one on the Crosby Road does.
I've got to call her.<eos> She doesn't want you kids to know.<eos> Then why are you telling me?<eos> Because there's hope she could have more time.<eos> People do.
I wanna show you something.<eos> This is called a Buchla.<eos> It's a mod synth. There's only a couple of them in the world.<eos> Bowie used one of these in Space Oddity.<eos> Yes, he did.
Rolla got killed doing some "I don't need niggas with me all the time" shit.<eos> I'm not the one.<eos> Streets don't got no idea who pulled the trigger on him.<eos> Cops don't know shit.<eos> But they never do.
You obviously know a lot more about the old chap than I do.<eos> The date is on his grave.<eos> Mr Bainbridge says that you're very interested in paganism.<eos> He thinks you have big plans of your own to mark the day.<eos> I did.
That is R2F!<eos> Come on, Gary.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Mr. Briganza, do you think we have world class fighters?<eos> Of course, we do.
- I know.<eos> Me, too. Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> Ay, Dios.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
We waited for three hours to get hugged, but then Seamus said he felt sick.<eos> He said it was from the sun and the chia pudding, but I'm pretty sure he just got impatient.<eos> I could've used that hug.<eos> I don't know why I didn't stay.<eos> Yes, I do.
Unfortunately.<eos> You know. But if you're depressed, I can write a recommendation for the administration of appropriate medication.<eos> I don't like putting chemicals in my body that aren't found in nature.<eos> Well, do you want to get better or not?<eos> I do.
You're leaving me for Hank.<eos> He's doing really well for himself.<eos> They made a big chunk of change on that Warner's deal.<eos> - He has ambition.<eos> - And I don't?
Well, sure.<eos> You should know.<eos> I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
That's fantastic.<eos> You think so?<eos> I mean, I hoped you'd think so.<eos> I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.
What is wrong with you? I don't know.<eos> I just --<eos> Everything at school is really hard.<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> It doesn't. I just -
We'll run the dna test.<eos> It'll show that he was the father,<eos> And then hopefully, the laptop will prove<eos> That he was on the roof of the sorority house.<eos> What if it doesn't?
A Christmas card for Rudy.<eos> Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?<eos> Why are you obsessing about Rudy?<eos> You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.
Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but when Robert told me we were going in on this place together, I made him promise we would never have to be here at the same time.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because I had Sol actually write that into the contract.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- All right, guys.<eos> Be well.<eos> That's a second body.<eos> But we don't know if they were on the same boat.<eos> - Sure we do.
Well, yeah.<eos> Now then. It's settled.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Sounds kind of perfect.<eos> It does.
Well, yes, it is my problem if I am getting paid out per session, Trevor.<eos> You'll get paid for every session that you do.<eos> It's my problem, okay?<eos> Trevor, you said you were gonna text me the contact info for the walk-in.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'm sure this whole experience has soured you on us, but... you know, and just because Power 4 Life wasn't the right fit for you in helping you achieve your goals doesn't mean you should use that as an excuse to, you know,<eos> to give up on those goals.<eos> Hey, you know, I've been watching your videos on YouTube.<eos> Yeah. And you make it seem like you believe all this shit, you know.<eos> Of course, I do.
I do not remember who said what.<eos> But you know who is located in Compound 6?<eos> I react to a report that the enemy is in there.<eos> Did you also know, that there were women and children?<eos> - No, I did not. - Okay...
There was Little Butcher, Medium Butcher, and Big Butcher.<eos> Okay good.<eos> In this court, we have heard the sound from a video clip, in which you pass on orders from the defendant to bomb Compound 6.<eos> At the time, did you know the reason for that order?<eos> Yes, I did.
You want us to have no food on table?<eos> Mum the fish is getting cold, eat.<eos> Well if your country uses nuclear weapons, half of this world would be dead.<eos> So Israel has no right to defend itself?<eos> Of course it does.
Tony, you should go see her practice tomorrow.<eos> She's really very good.<eos> I'm out of town this week.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> I just did.
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.<eos> I don't even like my sister.<eos> Just be careful, Elizabeth.<eos> You do not want World War III to break out in your home.<eos> No. No, I don't.
- Hey, Danielle!<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> I'll let you all catch up.<eos> You never told me that your son was the city manager!<eos> I didn't?
- I guess you've changed.<eos> - Yes.<eos> People don't change. When I was 16, I watched my father beaten into a coma by two men who looked just like you.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like? To watch your father helpless and bleeding, begging two thugs to spare his only daughter.<eos> They didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> I have an abnormally small dick.<eos> - I have an abnormally small dick! - Okay, uh-huh.<eos> - Sweetheart...<eos> - I do.
Like I knew something was wrong. But I didn't...<eos> Like I asked my parents about it and they were like,<eos> "Well, you'll hit puberty and it will grow."<eos> You know?<eos> But it just... It didn't.
I'm just telling you this because I don't think that you'll firing on all cylinders right now.<eos> I'm not only firing on all cylinders, I am firing on cylinders I didn't even know I had.<eos> Honey, I'm pretty sure that we have moved from, uh, free wheeling, sort of California vibe to more of a swinger vibe.<eos> That's what it feels like to me.<eos> Oh! No, I... I don't...
Honey...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Not that I think you would act on it.<eos> I mean, I trust you, I do,<eos> I really do.
- I'm not gonna stop it.<eos> I want to know.<eos> Do you wanna fuck my wife?<eos> Because I'm telling you, she wants to fuck you.<eos> - Oh! - She does.
I knew your uncle for 30 years.<eos> I first met him when I was quite young.<eos> Yes, you were, sir.<eos> He was a good man, a successful man, one who had the good sense to put you in charge of his quite profitable empire.<eos> That he did.
You need me to take care of him.<eos> Sir, why don't you just arrest him?<eos> Mr. Hancock, I've been quite kind to your family's enterprises, especially in terms of lax enforcement of certain customs duties.<eos> Wait... with all due respect, sir, we pay handsomely for those privileges.<eos> That, you do.
Abigail, my flame-haired beauty.<eos> A little early for the tavern, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I find that alcohol shortens the day considerably.<eos> You Adams men think you're so charming, don't you?<eos> Indeed, we do.
And why should we trust you? How do we know you're not working for Gage now?<eos> I resent that.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> He took my house.<eos> Of course he did.
Have you done anything to convince these men?<eos> - These men... These men are all terrified.<eos> They're all just in it for themselves.<eos> They all want something.<eos> - Yes, they do, But you do not.
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...<eos> - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding... bowing to the king.<eos> Neither of us wanted to be there.<eos> - Sometimes we don't have a choice.<eos> - And sometimes we do.
It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.<eos> I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.<eos> Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.<eos> No, you deserve that.<eos> You do.
Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
That's what it is.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Lizzie: You don't have to.<eos> Not if you don't want to.<eos> You don't.
You have it to signal your people.<eos> How many of them are there?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
What to risk.<eos> When it's safe.<eos> When to let someone in.<eos> The rules keep changing.<eos> They did for me.
Take your pick.<eos> Look, I've been thinking.<eos> Do we really need these?<eos> I mean, things go bad, yeah, sure. We do what we gotta do, but it's like you said. We don't need these for that.<eos> Right now we don't.
You know... I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.<eos> We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I don't know if they can yet.<eos> - They haven't caught up.<eos> - We have to be here.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- We are not... executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, Deanna.<eos> They do.
Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, Rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
Nobody took the Kettlemans.<eos> The Kettlemans took themselves.<eos> You gonna keep playing that line, it's gonna go rough.<eos> You know what?<eos> Do your worst.
- Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving.<eos> How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
He was sort of paralyzed by Frank's beer or something.<eos> I thought he would like it.<eos> I thought all guys did!<eos> - We-- we do.<eos> - Well, Matty didn't.
- Diet?<eos> - Did I say diet?<eos> Sorry. Most girls order diet.<eos> - Okay. That comes to $9.30.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Yeah, well, anyway, I'm helping Coach P with Maggie here.<eos> Coach was saying that she's trying to get a hold of you.<eos> I don't know if...<eos> - Did you just say you graduated?<eos> - I did.
- I didn't see that coming.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we did.<eos> Fuck her, right?<eos> Who needs her?<eos> The gym did.
Bye. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Helena's missing.<eos> No, no. You and I, we have other priorities.<eos> No, we don't!
Another early payment.<eos> Just some judicious scrimping and saving, that's all.<eos> You'll have no problems from me.<eos> You run a good, clean establishment.<eos> Much better than Collier ever did.
Perhaps, but I'm not taking the cap off.<eos> It's one thing to make yourself miserable but you're making everyone around you miserable too.<eos> Now I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What if I don't?
I'm starting to miss that.<eos> He still hasn't responded.<eos> What's taking him so long?<eos> Do you really want him to write back?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I think you broke the dowels.<eos> You won't have time to glue it.<eos> You'll have to nail it. - With what?<eos> - Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?<eos> - She does.
Date night's over.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> We haven't picked a winner.<eos> We both know this one's gonna win.<eos> Well, of course we do.
Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today.<eos> You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.<eos> Hey, I don't even live here.<eos> Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry now?<eos> I do.
Not around then.<eos> Maybe it was a CI, or a case.<eos> Listen I know what you're doing.<eos> You don't think I haven't had those thoughts?<eos> I do.
Fine.<eos> What lawyer?<eos> Ehrmantraut, who's got him and where?<eos> That way.<eos> Hey, fellas, how you doing?
The marriage proposal... It wasn't for you?<eos> No.<eos> Roose Bolton murdered my brother.<eos> He betrayed my family!<eos> He did.
Not unless we make it.<eos> You loved your family.<eos> Avenge them.<eos> How do we get through there?<eos> We don't.
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.<eos> He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.<eos> But first, he has to take Winterfell.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
And yet he did betray you.<eos> Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?<eos> Yes.<eos> Many opportunities.<eos> And did he?
- How?<eos> I put an arrow through his heart.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.<eos> I did.
It's so sensual.<eos> Get your camera.<eos> Why?<eos> I want you to take my picture.<eos> No, you don't.
That's impressive.<eos> I think your dad and my dad would have gotten along really well.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> He has his own way of doing things, John, you know?<eos> Yeah, he certainly does.
I'll be right over.<eos> These are the most recent pictures of Emma.<eos> This her boyfriend, one of these guys here?<eos> Right here, but I've never heard her use that word.<eos> None of them do anymore.
Oh, really.<eos> That's a little hard, Mr. Policeman.<eos> Mr. Tough guy, huh?<eos> I don't want to play that.<eos> How you doing?
Send the old guy out to find a pay phone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I just bought you five minutes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - No, you don't.
Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?
We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?<eos> Why they got to shoot me?<eos> Who did?
It saved me.<eos> So, um... you know, if there's anything that you can tell me about Matt...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It doesn't...
- What? - Did... I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt.<eos> They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
And I had me a pair of insights.<eos> Insight the first: You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second: You believe in the real America.<eos> Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...
Insight the first: You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second: You believe in the real America.<eos> Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...<eos> I really do.
He's moving crates from one place to... (clicks tongue) Will you just listen to me?<eos> Excuse me, sir, uh, do you work here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please, don't stop your work.<eos> They never do on TV.
Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Has he not said it?<eos> Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> He does.
I could call a lawyer.<eos> Lawyers aren't really my thing.<eos> Tell me about your father.<eos> Why did he kill himself?<eos> He didn't.
Tom?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Woodrow Wilson High School. That's where he's hiding.<eos> All due respect, Professor, how you know that?<eos> I just do.
Okay.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, fine.<eos> I thought the ER creeps you out.<eos> Still does.
All night?<eos> Well, it's just the manager is counting on me to have this down.<eos> You're ironing your jeans?<eos> People iron their jeans.<eos> No, they don't.
Call me Big Jake.<eos> All right, well, tax codes can be a bit tricky around here, Big Jake.<eos> See, once a business hits a 250K threshold, municipality and state taxes can run up to 15%.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Yeah, not a lot of people do.
Tell your husband to max out his contribution.<eos> They'll match him dollar for dollar. Wait.<eos> They'll do that?<eos> Nobody ever mentioned that.<eos> They never do.
OK!<eos> This reminded me of the one you were wearing the other night, so I had to buy it for you.<eos> I can't accept that.<eos> You don't like your present.<eos> I do!
I don't know.<eos> A few years.<eos> Years?<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> No, we don't.
What about the time in Puerto Vallarta?<eos> - That was different. - How?<eos> It was before we were engaged, and I screwed up.<eos> Did you screw up again, Evan?<eos> No, I didn't.
It was his idea.<eos> Well, we were gonna have it at the strip club, but that food is terrible.<eos> Yeah, well, congratulations to you.<eos> I hope you'll both be very happy and have a good lawyer.<eos> But we do.
Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Good morning. Come on in.<eos> Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.<eos> - Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.
But it altered my brain permanently.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> History will continue to unravel until All of time is undone.<eos> How do we fix this?<eos> We don't.
Buffie doesn't trust you.<eos> He believes you know what happened to Steiner.<eos> I've been trying to call my son since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.<eos> Do you know where Steiner is?<eos> I do.
I'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here.<eos> - We have to wake her up.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Daniella, I don't think you both were listening to me.<eos> What I'm saying is that he came to the set.<eos> - He came to the fucking set.<eos> - The director says he knows him.<eos> Yes, he did.
You're welcome.<eos> So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder.<eos> Jenny, how about you put some supper on the fire?<eos> You know yer way to the dining room, lads.<eos> I do indeed.
I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
What's going on?<eos> His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him. I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
- Do you believe that?<eos> - Michael... It's called the chain of command.<eos> You obey the person above you without question.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - No, I don't.
To tell you the truth, I'd rather not get into it with them.<eos> We hand her over, it's game over.<eos> Take her in ourselves and they'll roll out the red carpet.<eos> Since when has that ever mattered to you?<eos> It doesn't.
Don't you fucking move.<eos> You just still see the bad we did.<eos> I see the good.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
That happens all the time.<eos> Not this time.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.<eos> Hmm. Most sources do.
Don't forget, she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.<eos> Truth and justice personified.<eos> If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's--<eos> No one with this little experience has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot, and at least he had the money.<eos> So does she.
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.
That argument you won today against the restraining order the judge was never gonna grant that.<eos> Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years. And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
I suppose I'll have no choice but to sell to them.<eos> That's sure to lose me some friends on the Upper East Side.<eos> But what's to become of this place?<eos> I don't want to tell you your business, Henry, but I feel I owe it to your father to provide my wise counsel at this time.<eos> No, you don't.
I set her up.<eos> You set her up?<eos> Told a copper I knew what she was up to and he set a trap for her.<eos> I knew the Church wouldn't look too kindly on it.<eos> And you didn't.
My baby!<eos> Where's my baby? !<eos> It's early, Ryan.<eos> My wife thinks I'm sneaking out of bed to have an affair.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Elijah Mundo.<eos> Daniel Krumitz.<eos> Raven Ramirez.<eos> I wish we had time to chat.<eos> We don't.
- Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
No, I don't mind.<eos> She was...<eos> She'd had a tough life.<eos> She had a lot of baggage.<eos> Which I did, too.
You came all the way from the Forest of Troezen to ask your question, but when you saw that I'd run away, you went after me, risked your life, killed a man, and a cyclops, then dragged me back here, all because the priests said<eos> I had to stand over the mouth of Gaia?<eos> What, is that not true?<eos> Well, the mouth helps, but you could have let me try!<eos> I did.
Okay, I'm assuming that because that is in an evidence bag that you got it legally.<eos> No, it does not.<eos> I had to steal it so as not to blow Valentine's cover as a paid police informant.<eos> Speaking of blowing and of Valentine, did he happen to mention anything about me owing him 200 bucks?<eos> He did not.
Your childhood enemies are thieves.<eos> And arsonists.<eos> No, just thieves.<eos> And Gravely wants to catch this firebug before it kills someone.<eos> We all do.
I told your service, but you never called me back.<eos> There's no time for a shower.<eos> I'll make the bed.<eos> Thought you were having the carpets cleaned.<eos> I did.
- The soap thing?<eos> - No!<eos> The one where I told them they were assholes.<eos> You could have thought of something yourself, you know.<eos> I did.
Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
- 4. 3, 2, 1.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> 365 DAYS REMAINING<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> We do internet dating, blind date 1 minute dating.
Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> - Because I had no choice!<eos> - More games.<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
I wish Dad were here.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, I miss him too.<eos> You miss him?<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> I know, I miss him too.<eos> You miss him?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, so, so much.
It's gone quiet now down there.<eos> That isn't my daughter anymore, is it?<eos> Of course it is, Mrs. Mills, please understand.<eos> I know my girl.<eos> A mother always does.
To make every breath an indignant agony.<eos> But why?<eos> Because we can.<eos> Because she let us in here.<eos> No, no no, I didn't.
Underwater, you prick.<eos> I followed him across the ocean to the New World.<eos> Nearly died helping him.<eos> Think he says "thank you"?<eos> Does he, fuck.
My parents met in New York City.<eos> And I just moved around a lot when I was young.<eos> Then my father decided I should come back here and go to school.<eos> I wish I was born somewhere else.<eos> Yeah, everyone does.
You should stay the night with us.<eos> We're actually married men.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> To me, it does. It does!<eos> To me, it does.
He was an absolute mess.<eos> His father was in jail.<eos> I wanted to tell him.<eos> I really wanted to tell him, but I had to wait for a better time.<eos> But you never did, did you?
How about you?<eos> Forgive me, my hands are cold, but my heart is yours, hmm?<eos> Hop up on the table, dear.<eos> I think we have everything under control. And they need their privacy.<eos> Don't we all.
Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"? Hmm?<eos> Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.<eos> I do.
- Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry.<eos> As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
But can you be sure it won't take my life instead?<eos> No. I can't.<eos> My father... tended to Secretary of State Seward on the night Lincoln was shot.<eos> Did you know he was attacked, too?<eos> I didn't.
I should try and get her in on the ward at the Knick.<eos> They'll certainly be eager to hear from you.<eos> I thought I had baby troubles just last month.<eos> I told you girls don't let the fella finish inside you.<eos> I didn't.
I'm sure that must have been a surprise.<eos> A pleasant one.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I know I felt more than you at one point, but I won't pretend my treatment towards you after our falling out wasn't intended to hurt you.<eos> It did.
The X-ray room.<eos> I want to see what bones and organs they might share.<eos> If you want them to take their clothes off, that'll cost more if that's what you want them for.<eos> No, that is not what I want them for.<eos> Many men do.
So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
I can't stay here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do your fucking job.<eos> I got things to do.<eos> Don't we all?
She's pretty.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - She gets that from her mother, obviously.<eos> Didn't tell me you guys had a suspect.<eos> We don't.
Guy say she's Nicholas Trent's lawyer. He refuses to talk to anyone but you.<eos> This is Detective Bosch.<eos> How can I help you? Do you have Nicholas Trent?<eos> Sir, we do not have your client in custody.<eos> No, sir, we do not.
We'll be outside.<eos> She's got a bottle of Tequila and something to prove.<eos> I predict live girl-on-girl action by 10:00 P.M.<eos> I can't believe she just showed up.<eos> She didn't.
I need a real smoke.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> I think I hurt this guy and he's gonna come here looking for me.<eos> He already did.
This is different.<eos> We don't take cases like this. Maybe, but I believe a man who can convince Harvey to hire someone who never went to law school could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Well, I do.
No.<eos> So it was around dinner time that they took off, right?<eos> Yeah. Left all their stuff.<eos> Didn't even pack anything for the baby.<eos> Well, of course they didn't.
Weeds are free in Colorado?<eos> Uh-huh. That's right, sweetie.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, did you think about that other thing?<eos> Cutting Danny back in?<eos> Did you?
Um, if it wasn't a hate crime, lieutenant, what would it be?<eos> A robbery.<eos> There's a key broken off in the glove box.<eos> Where did you find the car keys?<eos> We didn't.
You didn't kill Jason for inappropriately appropriating your husband, did you?<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Are you insane?<eos> I would never do that, and I liked Jason.<eos> No, you didn't.
You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.
The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.<eos> And I'd appreciate you not using my sacred calling in this way in the future.<eos> What, god doesn't want you solving crimes?<eos> Well, of course he does.
You gotta believe me.<eos> I've heard that you shot and killed five cops in cold blood.<eos> You know me.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> No, I don't.
I didn't talk to him.<eos> Dave, I can get your phone records.<eos> I can see who called here and for how long. I thought you said you weren't a cop, right...<eos> Did he say where he was going?<eos> - Mr. Hodiak, I don't...
You brought that woman into my house.<eos> Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He did.
- You'd better not be from the bank.<eos> - I told y'all that...<eos> - No, we're from a charity devoted to helping wounded veterans. I...<eos> You know, I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am, I think my friend has the wrong house.<eos> - No, we don't.
- And you go with them.<eos> - What?<eos> I see them approaching.<eos> They've got a white flag.<eos> So they do.
Oh, shit.<eos> You'll never have outside privilege if you continue teaching me.<eos> I rarely get to go out.<eos> But today looks beautiful.<eos> It does.
At that age, I was really uncomfortable with my body.<eos> I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it... it worked for a while.<eos> And then one day it didn't.
"commanded by an ancient order of parascientists known only as<eos> "the Dread Doctors."<eos> Sounds vaguely familiar.<eos> How does it end?<eos> It doesn't.
This place is a maze.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's, uh, here.<eos> You don't remember which unit?<eos> Of course I do.
That sounds very important.<eos> [Knock on door] That guy will fill you in.<eos> L-lieutenant, the Chinese government runs a psychic training program to hone the skills of gifted young children, and I believe that he is one of those gifted children.<eos> I'm... I'm surprised your government let you out.<eos> They didn't.
Buried under a stack of ious made out to Dominic Chan.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be out of that uniform tomorrow.<eos> Still have to write the exam.<eos> I never would have taken you as someone that believed in psychics.<eos> I don't.
- That's right.<eos> - How you been?<eos> My sister got all the paperwork over, right?<eos> Everything's okay?<eos> - Yes, she did.
You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Well, in fact, we are just shopping for dinner now.<eos> Tina, would you like to join us?<eos> That's so nice of you, but I really can't.<eos> My little one's waiting for me at home, and he gets anxious if I'm gone too long.<eos> Of course he does.
I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something! - Sir!
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I like Germany.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Um, I get to see a bit of Europe on my time off. - Yeah.<eos> - You doing all right?
- Let's have it.<eos> - Let's have it.<eos> Let's have that conversation, Barb, because the things Gwen's told me...<eos> - Oh, the things she's said.<eos> - What? What did she...
Bad things happen.<eos> But you're forgiven.<eos> That's all the plant is trying to tell you.<eos> It wants to help you, James.<eos> It does.
All is forgiven.<eos> Get the fuck out of here, man.<eos> Little souvenir for you.<eos> The kid got his head right, after all.<eos> That he did.
Get the fuck out of here, man.<eos> Little souvenir for you.<eos> The kid got his head right, after all.<eos> That he did.<eos> That he did.
No justice, no peace.<eos> The best thing is, he has to rely on the districts that never vote.<eos> He had everything to the east where no one ever misses an election there.<eos> - 'Cause they give a shit, right?<eos> - This year they do, for sure, Hank.
And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> You know Vinni is looking for any excuse to fire me, and you know that.<eos> I need you to snap out of it.<eos> - Do it for me, please? - Okay.
I don't know.<eos> Just forget.<eos> Can we circle back?<eos> When trey came by your house that morning... Did you know that Hanna was dead?<eos> I did not.
But he's not coming back, Tawney...<eos> To Paulie.<eos> That's probably best.<eos> I wonder if he ever finished his kitchen project.<eos> He didn't.
Because it is.<eos> Take it from the guy who can see the future.<eos> The future isn't always certain, and you know that. Look, guys,<eos> - we have to fight.<eos> - We did.
Your daddy's got Hakeem performing at Laviticus on Saturday.<eos> I'm gonna get you up on the stage, too.<eos> He don't want me there.<eos> I don't care what he wants.<eos> Well, we do.
I think me too.<eos> So your profile says you're into gardening.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's just something I used to do with my mom.<eos> I should probably know what these are, but I have no clue.<eos> I definitely don't.
Yeah.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good. I'm good.<eos> I'm gay now. In case my mom didn't tell everybody.<eos> She did.
Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
Vanessa told me.<eos> Malcolm wasn't taken, Ben.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish I could tell you that the pain of losing a child goes away...<eos> But it doesn't.
The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
No, man, she definitely has wood for you, but...<eos> I got your back, okay?<eos> Remember that.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why do you say that?<eos> Oh, it's a badge of defiance.<eos> Against everything she's supposed to be.<eos> She tell you that herself?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah.<eos> But you did.
You dropped your cards and were halfway there before anyone else realized what was happening.<eos> I've never seen your father more proud.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.<eos> And now I do.
Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
Without help from other Powers, you're fucked.<eos> Wow. You're kind of a...<eos> I caught Wolfe.<eos> You didn't catch Wolfe.<eos> That old Power did.
Who can go out the farthest on the gantry.<eos> I was out there pretty far one night, and the wind gusted and I slipped.<eos> I fell.<eos> I was falling, and all I wanted was to miss the ground, but I was gonna hit it no matter what.<eos> And then, I didn't.
They told me he knew exactly how to cut me.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted us to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
I first prepared this dish in honour of my sister when I was very young.<eos> I'm sure you've perfected the recipe over the years.<eos> The meat...<eos> - You have a very good butcher.<eos> - I do indeed.
Counselor Kane and Clarke Griffin, please report to the south airlock immediately.<eos> We'll finish this later.<eos> Did he say something?<eos> No...<eos> But his blood did.
I know how hard that is for you.<eos> You think our ways are harsh, but that's how we survive.<eos> Maybe life should be about more than just surviving.<eos> Don't we deserve better than that?<eos> Maybe we do.
Dad...<eos> I'll take care of our people.<eos> None of us has a choice here, Clarke.<eos> I didn't want this.<eos> Neither did I.
- Bridal magazines?<eos> - What?<eos> You can't wait five minutes before you start planning this thing?<eos> Someone left this in Bungalow 4, and I'm just looking at it.<eos> They did not.
Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
Be gentle!<eos> Carol, Carol! Watch out for my Jenga tower, okay?<eos> I spent a lot of time on that.<eos> Oh, and you think that's time well spent, Phil?<eos> Yes, I do.
You know what?<eos> Screw the Mark, let's just kill him.<eos> Boy, he really is a mess.<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Well, actually, I did.
Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates.<eos> Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you.<eos> Against me?<eos> Well, you signed a non-disclosure agreement the day you were hired, Miss Page.<eos> Everybody did.
Something he doesn't tell people, where he can do his business?<eos> - You mean nail girls?<eos> - Girls, drugs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with El Jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I do.
The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I, too, am a firstborn, so I was the only one to help save Freya from herself, just as I'm the only one who can save your daughter.<eos> You've seen it, Klaus. You need me.<eos> Miss him already?<eos> Niklaus didn't kill Aiden.<eos> So... who the hell did it, then?
You cannot stop me from getting that baby. You begin this spell.<eos> Prepare the battlefield.<eos> I'll bring hope to you.<eos> Your daughter will need my guidance...<eos> Just as Freya did.
It's not convenient, it's planned.<eos> Those are the affects of his vertigo.<eos> Zytle was in a full set of restraints.<eos> How did he even manage to dose a federal agent?<eos> He didn't.
But right now, he is a necessary evil.<eos> We can take care of ourselves--<eos> Not against Ra's al Ghul.<eos> You have to trust me on this.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Danny, that cop it was a mistake.<eos> What we're planning here requires two things.<eos> No mistakes and the cops not knowing anything.<eos> They still don't.
And it was either that or the two of you, my friends being killed, so I made my choice.<eos> I chose not to let anyone else I care about die.<eos> We've been in tough spots. We've always managed to come out.<eos> No.<eos> Oliver did.
Something awful has happened. And I need a favor. A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> I don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does. But both of us.
Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The only thing I can know for sure is that everything that I've done everything that happened it led me right here to this moment.<eos> And, Felicity, if that's true then I don't know what it was all for.<eos> I do.
I love you, Thea.<eos> Don't ever forget that, okay?<eos> Oliver...<eos> Oliver, I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
But I am angry.<eos> Oliver.<eos> He was my best friend and he kidnapped my wife.<eos> You think that justifies hospitalizing people?<eos> No, Felicity. It doesn't.
And to think I once wore that title with pride.<eos> Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.<eos> After your betrothal to Al Sah-him you will extend my lineage by having a child.<eos> - If you think I will bear his child...<eos> - Yes! I do.
She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
I told you to back off, and you didn't listen!<eos> So kill me, go ahead.<eos> Show Felicity the kind of man you really are.<eos> I have nothing to prove to her.<eos> But you do.
Oh!<eos> Ow!<eos> Ow!<eos> If you meant what you said in there, then you have to trust me.<eos> I do.
There's a lot of stuff in there, But it mostly focuses on transmutation, Which is the process of altering the structure of an element<eos> By unzipping the atoms... - And rebuilding it to create an entirely new element.<eos> - Well, the article was co-written by jason rush, Who's a grad student here at hudson university.<eos> So if anybody knows what happened to ronnie...<eos> - Maybe he does.
I-I-it looks like something?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Dmitri.<eos> It looks like I paid to have sex with her.<eos> It does?
I never heard such a load of crap in all my life.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't hear anything.<eos> There was static on the microphone.<eos> I just wish that Fleck had offered up a list of Larissa's clients.<eos> - Well, he didn't.
Some people say follow the money.<eos> I say follow the roses.<eos> When asked about his knowledge of the crime Dmitri green replied that it wasn't what it looked like.<eos> McGrail then replied, "it looks like something?"<eos> Well, it did.
What?<eos> There's no record of anything going wrong. Coaster ran every required pre-ride check.<eos> Proper functionality across the board.<eos> Yeah, it's like it never happened.<eos> But it did.
What good did it do?<eos> Ken, she's 16.<eos> Drag her back home, watch her day and night, she'll... find another window to climb out of.<eos> What does Manson want with you?<eos> He doesn't...
No. (stuttering) you've been a slug for months,<eos> And this... This is the thing That gets you off of your ass?<eos> Not your family, not your fiance, Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!
And this... This is the thing That gets you off of your ass?<eos> Not your family, not your fiance, Proving me wrong!<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!<eos> It does!
You'll see how much it'll be worth then!<eos> Why do you like it so much?<eos> Because it's all mine.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> You don't?
He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.<eos> I think he got Number 8 to get rid of a witness.<eos> He didn't call Number 8.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
I would think, "I get it. You're upset, but don't be crazy.<eos> Don't act crazy."<eos> There's nothing crazy about believing no one cares as much about my son and what happened to him as I do.<eos> The police don't.<eos> The lawyers don't.
Where?<eos> ( singsongy ) It's a surprise.<eos> ( singsongy ) I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> No, everyone does not.
Maybe your boyfriend here can help.<eos> Wow, I... hey.<eos> Everything I have is yours, you know this.<eos> I know, but you don't have a job, Eddie.<eos> Yeah, well, you barely do either.
Actually, your liver and kidneys would be suitable for dinner right away.<eos> Tonight, even.<eos> But the rest of the meat should hang at least a week in the current cool conditions.<eos> I didn't see the forecast.<eos> Did you?
Back in his home country of tandooristan, He is the sultan of surgery, But here he just works for the police union.<eos> I'm here visiting a patient who needed surgery, Just like I'll visit you when you're here For your quadruple bypass.<eos> Okay. You've missed three appointments.<eos> Do you have a good reason?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes.<eos> She did it. She rented the car.<eos> Check her computer.<eos> Do I have your permission to search this computer?<eos> No, you do not.
Hi.<eos> Surprised I could get a ZoGo at this crazy hour.<eos> You guys still taking the online coupon?<eos> Hey, what'd you say your name was again?<eos> I didn't.
Freyja.<eos> Thanks, Trick.<eos> What are you two up to, anyway?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just doing a little Intel.
You can't fix me?<eos> It's just that with other diseases, I know what I'm dealing with.<eos> But with this...<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, I do!
Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
Guy.<eos> What?<eos> This is it.<eos> This is, er... This must be just after Maurice left.<eos> GUY: No, don't do that!
- Yes.<eos> It's an elected position, meaning you probably voted for me.<eos> Or not.<eos> I think I voted for that nurse with the baby arm.<eos> Of course you did.
The entire ER nursing staff of a major city hospital walked out and nobody cared, so it's a tragedy.<eos> - Do you want some help?<eos> - From you?<eos> Just 'cause I'm not standing out here with you guys doesn't mean that I don't agree with what you're doing.<eos> Actually, it does.
I probably just bumped into something Without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until We figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance Transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab If you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
He's a person, not some object for you to have your scientist experiments on. They're your scientists, too, Claire.<eos> They work for all of us.<eos> This isn't some underground, mercenary operation.<eos> This is the sovereign, federal government of the United States of America trying to protect our children from a threat that we don't fully understand.<eos> But Sean does, Wes.
Uh, okay.<eos> There is a small chance that, uh, I might have some drugs in my system.<eos> I have not used.<eos> I had a pill in my mouth less than an hour ago for... all right, this sounds terrible.<eos> Yes, it does.
I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Aria, I was here all night.<eos> Holbrook didn't come to the party.<eos> There's no way he could have left you that bookmark.<eos> All right, well, somebody did.
Guy.<eos> What?<eos> This is it, this is, er...<eos> This must be just after Morris left.<eos> No, don't do that!
You.<eos> I produced this voice.<eos> But it's a huge step forward.<eos> We have a name now.<eos> We do?
Yes, dear.<eos> Good thinking.<eos> Breakfast in five.<eos> - My mom shot you.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Before Yevgeny, I was selfish.<eos> Now I would die before I let him die.<eos> It's simple, complete.<eos> I never made that change.<eos> Kev did.
It's simple, complete.<eos> I never made that change.<eos> Kev did.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Some do, some don't.
It affected me so deeply, so profoundly, it could only have come from the Holy Spirit.<eos> The question I was asked was:<eos> "Do you believe in the cross of Christ?"<eos> I mean, that's a simple one for me to answer.<eos> Of course I do.
Nah, I ain't staying.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I think you should.<eos> Man, you don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is not a room, sweetheart, it's a museum.<eos> We're not honoring her memory, we're living in the past.<eos> What else are we supposed to do?<eos> Teri, the world didn't end when she died.<eos> Ours did.
We're not honoring her memory, we're living in the past.<eos> What else are we supposed to do?<eos> Teri, the world didn't end when she died.<eos> Ours did.<eos> No, it didn't.
No, no, hardly.<eos> My sister gave me this.<eos> Her husband got saved a couple years back, and so Elena, she-- that's my sister-- she, I don't know, think she's, like, half saved, or five-eighths.<eos> I don't really think it works that way.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Show it to me.<eos> Now what would Jesus think about you trying to take my money?<eos> I think he would know I didn't want it in the first place.<eos> So you believe in Jesus?<eos> I do.
I think he would know I didn't want it in the first place.<eos> So you believe in Jesus?<eos> I do.<eos> Then you believe that when I pull this trigger, you're gonna see him.<eos> I do.
Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> But eventually it will be.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Hey, my little butterfly.<eos> You're looking better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I brought your angel back to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
Oh, we're blessed to have them.<eos> We're one big family now.<eos> See, Mommy?<eos> God really does love us.<eos> He does, baby.
Take it to another hotel, all right?<eos> I just don't know how to be... out in the world, man.<eos> Hey, look out that window.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Nobody does.
Oh, God.<eos> Hey, look, I don't think...<eos> This wouldn't help you.<eos> It might.<eos> It usually does.
Forget this.<eos> Maybe it can blow over for you.<eos> This is never gonna blow over.<eos> My life ended that day.<eos> Except it didn't.
I don't know, boy.<eos> I don't think them other kids like you.<eos> I don't think anybody does.<eos> Who the fuck wants some lanky loudmouth pissing in their ear, huh?<eos> Your mother sure didn't.
This is going to hurt.<eos> That bullet is still inside you.<eos> Chiyoh has always been very protective of me.<eos> Did she kill her tenant? Or did you?<eos> She did.
A Verger baby.<eos> Yours, mine...<eos> - Mostly yours.<eos> - Do you know what happens if we stimulate your prostate gland with a cattle prod?<eos> Hannibal does.
Or you didn't want the MPs to find you.<eos> So brave when they're watching.<eos> People like you, buddy, have no idea.<eos> In World War II, guys saw 40 days in combat the whole war.<eos> In Iraq, I did 310 my first tour alone.
Look! There's...<eos> there's ventilation!<eos> Six inch ducts. Good luck.<eos> Shouldn't we look around more?<eos> We just did!
Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
My theory is our missing musician Is a material witness in your case against the doctor.<eos> Rehab was a last-ditch effort to get him clean Before propping him up in front of a grand jury.<eos> Great. We understand one another.<eos> What if the doctor killed him?<eos> He didn't.
Duly sworn statement. Dr. Kobrine.<eos> I don't do drugs.<eos> Take my blood. And take my urine and my bone marrow, And then do the same with mindi,<eos> And then see who uses drugs.<eos> All drummers do drugs.
We recently got some much-needed closure On -- on the death of our son.<eos> So no more of the constant fighting.<eos> How does that make you feel, adrian?<eos> Well, nobody enjoys fighting all the time.<eos> Some people do.
We didn't have a lot in common.<eos> I'm delightful, and he's a slimy, little weasel.<eos> May he rest in peace.<eos> Sounds like you didn't like him very much.<eos> I didn't.
What is that?<eos> Something to put a little extra... Spark into our sessions.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> That looks painful.<eos> It really does.
Maybe you just move in here with me, be my wife.<eos> What about money?<eos> I'll worry about that.<eos> You just worry about miguel, huh? Doesn't that sound nice? No.<eos> It doesn't.
You know, maybe we can make this a regular thing.<eos> [ chuckles ] maybe.<eos> So, doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> Well -- you don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, i do.
She always gave me her brutally honest opinion.<eos> You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street. You can tell me my dress is ugly, And i can tell you that i don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?
And i contacted the diabetes foundation And made a donation in honor of your mother.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> They planted a tree in her memory.<eos> ♪♪ She raised a lovely daughter.<eos> No, she didn't.
♪♪ Mrs. Taylor's old sofa.<eos> I bought it back from kivnik's.<eos> Very sneaky.<eos> Now we can test the stain.<eos> I already did.
I actually think you and I are more alike than I originally thought.<eos> I think so, too.<eos> You know, it was nice of you to go see Tommy's girl.<eos> She belongs with Tommy. She's family.<eos> How you doing?
You really think he's our guy?<eos> - He's a child molester.<eos> - Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> They all start somewhere.<eos> Yeah, they do.
DNA comparison with the sister should confirm it.<eos> You asked me before if I had faith.<eos> I remember.<eos> I told you I didn't. That wasn't the truth.<eos> I do.
- You don't remember the yo-yo, or you don't remember what color it was?<eos> I'm sorry. I...<eos> I... I don't remember the yo-yo.<eos> You didn't kill Arthur Delacroix.<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't buy it.<eos> I don't know his angle, but I'm not buying it.<eos> He didn't kill that Delacroix child.<eos> Okay.<eos> But what if he did?
- Chancellor, I can explain.<eos> We'll be back in a minute.<eos> I just have to reset.<eos> You know how vital the neural connections are to us.<eos> I do.
You made a bet?<eos> !<eos> It was claro.<eos> Carmen said you were just chubby, And marisol said you were too old.<eos> I did not.
I'll take anything.<eos> Just find me work.<eos> I'll try.<eos> No, don't try, marisol.<eos> Just do it.
So, i just need your address -- hell no!<eos> [ beep ] sir?<eos> Hello?<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> I do.
You know, it's as if no one's ever said "No" to you, and you can't stand it.<eos> Now, you wait until your target's vulnerable, - then you pounce.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Tell me what you're here for, Fiona.<eos> - I just did.
Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, you know, and also a lot of the other classes were already full, so it was between this and environmental studies.<eos> And hippies don't use deodorant, so...<eos> Do you even know what critical theory is?<eos> Is that a trick question?<eos> You don't, do you?
Nobody gives that woman perspective.<eos> - Barb has a heart. She does.<eos> - After all this, you think that... that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
It's the only way I can lay eyes on you... When you're locked down in jail.<eos> What the... is wrong with you, Hector?<eos> You lie and lie.<eos> Cincos años and nothing from you.<eos> Well, I don't...
Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
This wasn't the gun that was used to kill Matt Skokie.<eos> This also is not the gun that was in Carter Nix's possession when he was arrested.<eos> Do you understand what the problem is, Hector?<eos> I mean, um, it looked like the gun.<eos> No, it didn't.
What else you bring to the party?<eos> Just ask Roy.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I like you.<eos> I do.
But thank you.<eos> Yeah, it's Gregory Mitchell.<eos> Any grade.<eos> I don't know how old he is.<eos> You do?
It's all gonna work out.<eos> Come on, papi.<eos> Eat it.<eos> I came here because you and I actually have a lot in common.<eos> We do?
Vargas!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where is Rochefort?<eos> He didn't send you the letter.<eos> I did.
I'm sorry.<eos> This is not what I intended.<eos> He can hear you.<eos> - He doesn't understand.<eos> - Yes, he does.
- Yeah.<eos> Monster, do you know where babies come from?<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> He does.<eos> He does.
Trust a black hat once, shame on them.<eos> Trust a black hat twice...<eos> How long do you think you can deny the thirst, Nelson?<eos> You have no idea how much money can be made selling the secrets at your fingertips.<eos> But I do.
I was wrong about Tobin.<eos> I will be wrong again.<eos> But I am not wrong about Nelson.<eos> I want you to be right, okay?<eos> I really do.
I'm not the sheriff.<eos> What do you want, an apology?<eos> I would have done the same thing.<eos> You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.<eos> No, it didn't.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?<eos> It appears quite black.<eos> You've come to wag your finger?<eos> I love a good finger-wagging.<eos> Yes, you do.
Sure.<eos> If I'm keeping you from working, I can go.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to be here.<eos> I do.
I had to justify myself to an eleven-year-old.<eos> Resentment's raising a blister in you, Will.<eos> You think you might lose me after this, Jack?<eos> You think I might go back to my family?<eos> - For a minute, I did.
The most important thing that you will ever hear.<eos> "Sermon-on-the-Mount" important.<eos> "Ten-Commandments" important.<eos> Got it?<eos> - Yes, D. I don't...
He knew what he wanted from the world and he made it happen.<eos> I would have done anything for that man.<eos> There's nothing to do, but wait until the dawn.<eos> If he survives he will be with us.<eos> And if he does not?
It's a relief to know.<eos> Well, for you to know, because I already know.<eos> Anything else, just call.<eos> Well, you're still here, so I have to assume you have a new understanding of the world we live in.<eos> I do, sir.
Like hell you are.<eos> We've got to find Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> There!<eos> Did anybody get away?<eos> Because Riken sure didn't.
I wouldn't try to run.<eos> Might give you a shock.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> But you were there.<eos> Who did?
Might give you a shock.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> But you were there.<eos> Who did?<eos> Who did?
You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> I do!
- I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Ketchup. - Oh!<eos> I put ketchup on my ketchup.<eos> - Those shoes look like they would hurt a lot.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
Still trying to get ahold of her.<eos> Find her.<eos> Was that Frank again?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it kind of does.
And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.<eos> And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.<eos> I mean, where's the facts?<eos> An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank?<eos> She didn't.
I am that girl.<eos> The one that tried to slap you, from the backwater bayou, that Southern ghetto trash.<eos> I just spent a long time trying to hide her away so I could claim the prince.<eos> Your shining, black, perfect son of a prince.<eos> And I did.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Who let her go?<eos> Who let her go, damn it? !<eos> I didn't let her go.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
And when I met you... I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again.<eos> It's you, Lila.<eos> I love you.<eos> Because what matters now is that... Sam killed Lila.<eos> He did.
So stop trying to change my mind. I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?<eos> You love her.<eos> No. I don't.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Tell me. Who let her go?<eos> Who let her go, damn it?<eos> I didn't let her go.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
- Still got it after all these years?<eos> - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
You and Keisha are single.<eos> If y'all wanna do it, be my guest.<eos> I don't want to keep playing these games.<eos> I like you. You like me, too.<eos> And what if I do?
I don't fucking need you alienating our right fucking hand over some bitch.<eos> Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust. - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
You're just a thug.<eos> Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO goes through and I die, Anika will become a billionaire in her own right.<eos> But it will not happen if I can't get... A key man policy.<eos> Does Anika know about this?<eos> No, she does not.
Agent Fitz, we're on the move.<eos> I'd like to formally voice my doubts About bringing him on this mission.<eos> I understand your concerns, May, But Cal's lived with the Inhumans.<eos> He knows what we're getting ourselves into.<eos> We do not.
You don't think I noticed that press conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?<eos> No, no, no, I've played with you too many times to let you get away with that.<eos> This is between you, me and the Flash.<eos> You don't wanna play for those kind of stakes with me, Hartley.<eos> Actually, I really do.
I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option, but I know what you really want.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.
- What?<eos> I woke to your text this morning asking us to get you, with the address.<eos> Even said you'd leave the door open. - See?<eos> - No, I never sent that.<eos> Well, someone did.
Hey, you Tony? - Yeah.<eos> - That's for Edgar.<eos> Tell him I put a little sweetness on top so he can shut up.<eos> He good to you in juvie?<eos> Yeah, he did some good looking out.
I know how much you hate parting with good booze.<eos> Oh, come on now, what am I, a rookie?<eos> I got the good stuff in the wheel well.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course I do.
You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
This murder case -- this is just a thin edge of the wedge.<eos> Now the hope here is to use Kelvin's conviction to take the whole family down.<eos> Kelvin might be looking at the needle, which might make him more pliable.<eos> Now how said the hope is, not was, from which I surmise that you have another witness to the murder?<eos> We do.
You got the bad guy.<eos> I'm sorry you got dragged into it.<eos> Don't be.<eos> Felt good.<eos> Did, didn't it?
... a clown in the next room!<eos> You know?<eos> Long night, huh?<eos> Guess it got kind of ugly.<eos> Yes, it did.
"Kleg's Auto."<eos> Idiot.<eos> "The Red Hood Gang"!<eos> It's got a ring to it.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Did... Did my father send you?<eos> Miss Kringle.<eos> Oh, Mr. Nygma.<eos> Miss Kringle, I was wondering if you had dinner plans this evening.<eos> Actually, I... I do.
Well, I'm not.<eos> And I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> And if a bus hit me tomorrow, huh, no one would care.<eos> That change things?<eos> Yes, actually it does.
And losing Trip brought back a lot of hard memories. For all of us.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't blow my chance to work on Lola one day.<eos> After that little RC version you built for me, I'm genuinely considering it.<eos> Although, I couldn't figure out how to make it fly.<eos> It doesn't.
Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean HYDRA has them?<eos> And if HYDRA doesn't, who does?
We'll figure this out.<eos> I promise.<eos> Captain Anderson, I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy.<eos> I don't have a daughter, sir.<eos> No, you do not.
Weaver thinks it made you into some kind of a messenger for an alien race.<eos> Can you say with certainty that that's not true?<eos> And we haven't even begun to talk about your protégé, Skye.<eos> You two have a lot in common.<eos> At least, you once did.
She was scared and defending herself.<eos> I don't care if she was chasing butterflies.<eos> We can't wear kid gloves around something with powers of that magnitude.<eos> - She could've killed everyone.<eos> - But she didn't.
It's not ideal, but we go in now, we lose our window.<eos> Local military's not used to standing down.<eos> Welcome to Bahrain.<eos> Let's hope Belyakov cooperates.<eos> And if she doesn't?
Nasty stuff... Flesh-eating.<eos> Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians.<eos> Give my team time to assess.<eos> Did you say, "Biological Weapon"?<eos> Yes, I did.
I've never had that before.<eos> That was possible because of you.<eos> That's all I really wanted for you.<eos> Cal, uh, Skye doesn't know when her birthday is.<eos> I do. July 2nd.
The safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> We don't.
Yeah, we both know that's not true, Coulson.<eos> You wanna tell me what this call's really about?<eos> I always knew the team wasn't going to forgive me.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> But Kara, she does.
- Fitz? Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm delightful.<eos> Strucker wants powered people.<eos> Bakshi alone doesn't get you to him.<eos> Deathlok does.
- Why should I trust you?<eos> - Because we all have our secrets.<eos> You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> - Kara? - She does.
I thought that that might belong to her.<eos> A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn't it?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to her.<eos> I kept hoping that if she was alive, evil would never find her.<eos> Not like it did me.
Torturing me after I willingly turned myself in?<eos> Torture isn't my thing, Cal, and surrender doesn't really seem like yours.<eos> Why did Jiaying send you?<eos> - Do you have children, Phil?<eos> - I do not.
Legend has it, the husband's ghost roams here at night, mourning his soul mate, unable to pass on, while their killer, having never been found, walks free.<eos> No justice, no peace indeed.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna say that?<eos> He just did.
His whole life, all I ever did was rag on him.<eos> I... I know it feels that way now, but you gotta give yourself a break, Bunchy.<eos> Families are... all the same.<eos> They don't work.<eos> But they do.
12 minutes.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> Maybe we could talk him down.<eos> You think he'd listen?<eos> Chief did.
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.
He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> My dad did.
With a pervasive lack of interest in anything that doesn't directly affect us, we, in the here and now.<eos> Or maybe it's just the shadow of weariness.<eos> Of how tired we are, struggling to claw our way back to a middle class that no longer exist, because of those who take more than they deserve.<eos> And they keep taking, until all that's left for the rest of us is a memory of how it used to be before the corporations and the bottom line decided we didn't matter anymore.<eos> But we do.
What did you get?<eos> Tully really is on an island that he bought with the money that Confed Global is paying him for all his real estate holdings in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Then, that's the link!<eos> I mean, it ties Fisk directly to what's happening in the tenement case.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Hey, Matt.<eos> Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us... Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
I'll tell you who snatched it...<eos> Listen, I've hurt a lot of people tonight to get what I need to know.<eos> The asshole that killed Mrs. Cardenas shoots up at this address, likes cheap menthols.<eos> Thinks it covers the stench of his rotting teeth.<eos> It doesn't.
You think what happened in there today was right?<eos> No, Matt, I don't think it was right.<eos> But according to the law, if he did disclose trade secrets<eos> - to a third party other than his doctor...<eos> - He didn't.
Yes, of course.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> I didn't vote for Senator Cherryh last election.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Few people did.
You want coffee?<eos> Yeah, please.<eos> You know, he thinks he got her killed...<eos> Elena.<eos> He didn't.
- When I was over at his place.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> And don't... don't tell me that it was a car accident.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - I did.
Detective Hoffman?<eos> He's alive?<eos> From what I could tell, Owlsley has him holed up somewhere.<eos> Fisk wants him found, bad.<eos> Hell yeah, he does.
Just getting a court date on a case this big could take a year.<eos> - That long?<eos> - He's where he belongs, that's all that matters.<eos> And we put him there.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I recognize your face from somewhere.<eos> I am Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles.<eos> The one who's always on TV.<eos> You took out your stitches already?<eos> Yeah. I already did.
What's the situation with your hair?<eos> Did I call your number?<eos> Are we in a deli?<eos> We are not.<eos> And I did not.
Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
- Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes. Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well, Francis and I are only halfway there, but I bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Wow. You must really want to be president.<eos> I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.<eos> The way you choose to raise them is your business.<eos> Do I want the best for my kids?<eos> Yes, I do.
She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Jackie...<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
I live, um, over the hill...<eos> South face.<eos> You know, we're neighbors.<eos> I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors over the hill on the South face.<eos> Well, you do.
Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
That's not your fault.<eos> _ _ _<eos> I get that, ma.<eos> But do you think that that's what he'd want?<eos> Because I don't.
I don't want to hurt his daughter, but can you tell me, Jennifer, where to find the Night Room?<eos> The man... he smelled of lavender and jasmine.<eos> Then it was my turn, but he said, "not today."<eos> Those men died because of me. No.<eos> No, they didn't.
How many?<eos> I'm alone, OK? I swear.<eos> - I left the 7.<eos> - Nobody leaves the West 7.<eos> - You and Cole did.
That was you outside the tents that night.<eos> The lights...<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
Just a sec.<eos> H9)'-<eos> - Hey, I know you're on a date but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.<eos> Sir, please, you have everything to live for.<eos> No, I don't.
Wells was right about balance and accepting.<eos> Behind you!<eos> Ronald, there's more of them.<eos> Eiling, this ends now.<eos> Yes, it does...
I think our Burning Man used to work there.<eos> So why'd you bring me here?<eos> I don't know how and I don't know when, but one day soon, I'm gonna be in this house again, 15 years ago.<eos> And I'm gonna fail...<eos> Unless this time, I don't.
You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys gonna protect me? They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I'll take care of that.<eos> What do you think he meant by that?<eos> That's what he meant.<eos> I think we lost them.<eos> Oh, no, you didn't.
So those doctors in there, they're good enough?<eos> The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them. They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
I can only imagine how angry you are.<eos> I'm not angry, Barry.<eos> I'm just disappointed.<eos> Okay. Does Eddie know?<eos> Yes, he does.
What could he have shown you that would make you change your mind?<eos> The future.<eos> He showed me the future, Iris.<eos> We don't get married.<eos> You and Barry do.
Uh-oh. I think I broke Warren.<eos> Guess you're gonna have to do everything.<eos> We're looking for a friend of yours, likes to put people in boxes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> No, you don't.
Did you have sex with a man called Ricky Gillespie that night?<eos> Wow, you don't mess about!<eos> You mean Ricky whose girl was killed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I didn't.
Chin up.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?<eos> It's not my husband in the dock.<eos> ~ I suppose you knew all along.<eos> Of course you did.
He told you? There are no secrets between a barrister and her client. Like the Seal of the Confessional.<eos> I went to see him because I believe in forgiveness and redemption.<eos> I hoped to find a repentant man, but since you showed up that seems to have gone out the window.<eos> You gave the service at Danny's funeral.<eos> I did.
~ No-one regular.<eos> Did you fancy her, Ricky?<eos> She was my niece.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> No, you didn't.
You're here because of Lee.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> We bring Lee in, he gets a fright seeing that and then, instead of betraying you you're banking on him realising he needs to stay close to you because of what you know.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I don't.
The same light oak boards you bought Saturday morning and again Monday morning.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No, something did.
We were halfway there when...<eos> I realized... we were going to my parents' house.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, then he tied them up to a chair... and, uh..., he told me to talk to them... about my childhood issues.<eos> So I did.
May went missing around age 15.<eos> Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.<eos> She just ran away.<eos> And, Brother Larson, I think you know where she ran to.<eos> Hmm. I do not.
Unless you protect her.<eos> As, apparently, I no longer can.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is.<eos> You already do.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
You've seen 'Deer Hunter', right?<eos> It's a classic.<eos> -Pick a hand.<eos> -Please.<eos> Do it.
I-I know we haven't had a chance to talk much, but I just wanted to take some time to tell you how happy I am that you're here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a big night for you.<eos> Yeah, if you'd have told me a month ago I was going to be performing again... I wouldn't have believed you.<eos> She did.
Then there's Cooper.<eos> A psycho ex- compadre who likes burning and blowing shit up.<eos> Doesn't mean Cooper's part of this.<eos> You wanna bet your life on that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Place your bets!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's cool.<eos> I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?
- Damn it, boy.<eos> - Goddamn.<eos> We're gonna have to let this vent for a few hours.<eos> Now after that '90 collapse over in Joseph's Valley, didn't I hear you swear up and down on your mama's grave that you'd never go in without a good sounding?<eos> I did, indeed.
Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
Nina.<eos> Nina discovered his secret and blackmailed him into planting the malware.<eos> Then anyone she trolled could have motive.<eos> The guys she slept with...<eos> The guys she didn't.
You mean how it looks like premeditated murder?<eos> I mean it. I need, like, a Men in Black brain wipe.<eos> She was so angry.<eos> Noah, we both know Audrey.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I wasn't sure she'd let me see you.<eos> In your last letter, you said you were doing good.<eos> My last letter out of the dozens that you've ignored?<eos> I wanted to answer them, Emma.<eos> I did.
But she kept insisting that she was gonna drive herself.<eos> So I drove her home.<eos> When we got there, she wanted me to come in.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't.
He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's up to you.<eos> But I can promise you one thing, it's gonna be gut-wrenching.<eos> The killer called.<eos> He said that tonight's the big finale.<eos> Of course he did.
Yes. I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Miss Borden, you might not remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
Her throat was cut.<eos> What was her name? The papers didn't say.<eos> It's Adele.<eos> Lizzie said that she thought that this Adele might have run off with Spencer.<eos> Of course she did.
It's not unusual for someone to skip out on a bill.<eos> You think he skipped out?<eos> Don't think that every time a sparrow dies, Lizzie Borden is to blame.<eos> You said that you grew up with her.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
You know, it's really about professionalism.<eos> You are erratic and you are volatile.<eos> Effective.<eos> You've brought me eight jobs no one could deliver on.<eos> I did.
Suit yourself.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer...<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay, why did I try to kill myself?<eos> Or why did I try and kill...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I killed...<eos> No. No, you didn't.
I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.<eos> Do you want to kill her now?<eos> - No.<eos> God, no.<eos> - No, because you never did.
I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
None.<eos> But you could potentially change the world.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yearning.<eos> I actually missed you.<eos> Well, I'm here now.<eos> You've got me.<eos> No, I don't.
I need you to witness something.<eos> I don't like what I see when you're around.<eos> Oh, you mean that room full of cops that put their own Glocks to their heads?<eos> I don't know what that was about.<eos> I do.
Come on, I... I gotta tell them something.<eos> We're meeting tonight.<eos> Tell them to forget it ever happened.<eos> You asked them to lie, to let you handle it.<eos> They did.
Just great.<eos> Get in the sodding car.<eos> Go on.<eos> I didn't kill your silly wife.<eos> Jessica did.
Ugh! It's not like you're interrupting some romantic interlude.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause people are dying.<eos> Look, he obviously has feelings for you, and you definitely have feelings for him.<eos> I do not.
There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
- What?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I mean, I had the hugest crush on you.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did. I did.
It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Two...<eos> - What choice do we have?<eos> - Three...<eos> - How do we know this isn't just a lie? - Four...<eos> - We don't.
Uh, thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, Smart Rain's been in development for... for seven years, so... It's by far the biggest project we've ever done.<eos> And the company... It started as a-a family business, is that right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it did.
Sometimes I... miss the family part of it.<eos> You know... enough about me.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you... do you have any, uh, any family?<eos> I do.
I mean, I was... I was the good student.<eos> I was the straight As, the valedictorian, and Vincent, he just has this charisma, so then my dad pays all this attention to him.<eos> It's always the same, you know?<eos> I'd come up with the ideas for the farm and then Vincent takes credit for it.<eos> Still does.
Like Smart Rain?<eos> Yeah, exactly like Smart Rain.<eos> And when it destroys farms after Vincent launches it, he'll make sure I get all the blame.<eos> I get it.<eos> Really, I do.
My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
I did... say that.<eos> It had been a while.<eos> Too long, obviously.<eos> Look, we hunkered in, and we kicked back a couple of beers, waited for George to mosey on home.<eos> But he never did.
It had been a while.<eos> Too long, obviously.<eos> Look, we hunkered in, and we kicked back a couple of beers, waited for George to mosey on home.<eos> But he never did.<eos> No, he never did.
I didn't do anything.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together what occurred... What you saw, what you were thinking, that kind of thing.<eos> I understand.<eos> It just gets a little confusing sometimes.<eos> Of course. These things always do.
What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who is controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
Then that is what you'll do.<eos> Who knows why they chose 15 years? But things have gotten a whole lot better.<eos> I got a place at MIT, graduated. I got a job in astrophysics.<eos> Mom got clean and looked younger than ever before.<eos> In fact, everyone did.
So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
- Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.
Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
Or in construction. - Yes.<eos> You have to stay Hitler?<eos> - Yes, so I can get things done.<eos> So you don't have any Hitler-free moments?<eos> No, no, I do not.
He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
I have my own bedroom.<eos> Well, this is all very beautiful, but when do we get serious?<eos> Don't make the mistake of thinking we're not.<eos> We did not come all this way again to go back empty-handed.<eos> No, we did not.
Looks like our vics were living pretty much off the grid:<eos> no bank accounts, no tax returns.<eos> Can't find a vehicle registration or driver's license for either one.<eos> Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.
Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.<eos> I need to see you both.<eos> We got a problem?<eos> We do.
The dog's tag says Mr. Bojangles?<eos> Like the song? Yeah.<eos> But he responds to Jangles.<eos> So they knew him.<eos> Well, the husband did, Mr. Ryan.
It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, doesn't the hospital have supercomputers?<eos> Yeah, they do.
No, he's still following us.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah, till death do us part.
DHS knew about your experiments long before we did.<eos> We were just helping them.<eos> - DHS hired a beast?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yes, they did.
No, I know.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realised that I might want one.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, I'll tell you then.<eos> I don't think Mr Molesley meant to be unkind about Miss Marigold.<eos> I'm sure he didn't.<eos> Only, it seemed to put you in a strange mood.<eos> Did it?
Is that what she's offering?<eos> Warm friendship?<eos> She has to know what you expect.<eos> Ever think of a time when we're told the whole Mr Green business is over?<eos> - Of course I do.
Then why did you say no?<eos> Because, when it came to it, he wasn't right.<eos> At least, not for me.<eos> And you didn't think of George?<eos> Of course I did.
But not your life.<eos> Not any more.<eos> I'm sorry for what we've put you through, Mrs Bates.<eos> I probably shouldn't say it, but I am.<eos> You did no more than your duty, Sergeant Willis.
- You. - You.<eos> Come on. Open it. Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> You really didn't need to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
That's why he said he was an expert.<eos> It's hard to believe that Adam is capable of a kind gesture, but I believe that ledger is his way of apologizing.<eos> But that doesn't change what he did to me.<eos> And God knows what he's done to others. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
I know that hero doctor.<eos> [ sighs ] this really wasn't necessary.<eos> Henry, you saved the life of a little boy.<eos> I thought it was heroic.<eos> And clearly, the newspaper did, too.
Duly noted.<eos> Here's to fate bringing us back together and justice served.<eos> I'm not quite sure that's the case.<eos> What do you mean? I thought you had a confession.<eos> We do, but...
Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
-We move out at 2200 hours.<eos> I suggest you grab some chow and get some rack time.<eos> -Wait.<eos> Are you giving me a curfew?<eos> I don't do curfews, Pops.
Oh, and to think Lyman chose mental health funding as his platform.<eos> Oh, no, but we don't know he's involved.<eos> - Even the simplest implication would derail his career.<eos> This could've killed you, Louise.<eos> But it didn't.
Yeah, but... But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
I know all about Jess Murphy.<eos> I know you didn't have the jacket.<eos> And I know you didn't kill Tom.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Hey, Stan.<eos> I need to see Sandra.<eos> Of course.<eos> I thought he was gonna pull the trigger.<eos> And when he didn't...
The footage kept skipping back and forth as if someone was manipulating time.<eos> I only know one person who can do that.<eos> Hiro Nakamura.<eos> Guess you don't remember talking to him either?<eos> No, I don't.
It'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC.<eos> No, these are our customers, and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera.<eos> We spoil their fun, it goes viral in an instant.<eos> You do want the girl, though.<eos> I do.
Okay, what... what... what friend, honey?<eos> Did he... did he say who it is?<eos> No. You said not to talk to him anymore.<eos> - Good.<eos> - So I didn't.
Okay.<eos> Black veins.<eos> That's her.<eos> We need to get closer.<eos> Of course you do.
I think I'm gonna get hit no matter what I do.<eos> I got some tough decisions to make.<eos> You once told me that winning solves everything.<eos> I don't know if I believe that anymore.<eos> They do.
Mom, Dad, Uncle Keith's ghost, tonight is graduation night.<eos> I can't believe it's really her.<eos> She's getting ready for the graduation party.<eos> Anthony, we need to talk.<eos> Shh. No, we don't.
- Uncle Keith?<eos> - We have to go now!<eos> You are never going to find your video.<eos> It is no wonder that Ian does not value your friendship.<eos> Of course he does. Oh, really?
That was really early.<eos> Who's gonna watch me enslave all these cute, adorable, fuzzy creaters?<eos> I said "creaters." What's a creater?<eos> Cut.<eos> Just do the other guy's line... do Ian's line?
I still love you.<eos> What happened? What did I do?<eos> [Sadie] Nothing.<eos> It doesn't have to be this way with us, with any of us.<eos> - Yes, it does.
[quietly] Why?<eos> Everything I know we're doing over there, that we're not supposed to be doing, that they're lying about, you have no idea.<eos> Even Shafe.<eos> Soldiers need to know the war we're fighting.<eos> We all do.
He's the most cheerful person I've ever heard quote Hitler.<eos> So Hooli's entire intellectual property claim boils down to three simple questions.<eos> Did your work on Pied Piper at any time overlap with your scope of work or Hooli business?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Did you ever do work on Pied Piper on Hooli time?
Lieutenant Cottrell interviewed all the people that, you know, I had known that were involved.<eos> In my opinion, I had a conspiracy of not only the suspect that was involved in... in raping the victim, but I also had friends of his that helped convince her that there was a party that she was going to.<eos> The university had their judicial hearing.<eos> I had this idealistic view that if I was telling the truth that they would support me.<eos> And, um... they didn't.
I mean, think about it.<eos> Any Evo who turns on his own, can you ever really trust them?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> And I liked you, Noah.<eos> I still do.
Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.

My wife and I, we used to love taking our son, Dennis, to the movies.<eos> Popcorn, candy, the whole shebang, just to help him feel like a regular kid.<eos> And did he?<eos> Feel like a regular kid?<eos> He did.
-He loves the crown. -But...<eos> -And his hair.<eos> -But... -Not in that order.<eos> -But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else!<eos> No, there doesn't.
Want to go back?<eos> You have to walk.<eos> I can't take you back. I have to go home.<eos> If you want to come; welcome.<eos> If you don't; God speed.
- Why did you do this, son?<eos> - Is it my fault now, mother?<eos> Father told me to bring him.<eos> Don't you know father?<eos> I sure do.
You saying we take out their ship?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Well, I like the idea in theory, but it begs the question... how do we get it down here?<eos> We don't.
Up above the clouds, sun shining.<eos> Like being in heaven.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> The papers practically accuse the mechanics union of sabotaging that plane.<eos> Well, somebody did.
Two days ago, just before Ned disappeared.<eos> Dot, I think you need to take Paddy outside.<eos> Sorry, Dr Harcourt, all the excitement's got to Lady Granville.<eos> She's had one of her turns and needs your attention.<eos> Course she does.
Men like Archie, they need skin from other donors, and I paid the boys, I paid them well.<eos> They knew what they were doing.<eos> It was perfectly safe!<eos> But Jimmy didn't take the sulphur like I told him.<eos> No, he didn't.
Three jacks.<eos> Shall we keep playing?<eos> I, um... .. I seem to be low on funds.<eos> But you hold an IOU signed by my father.<eos> Yes, I do.
Please, for once in your life, will you tell me the truth?<eos> Yes, it could be him.<eos> But he was crazy, shell-shocked.<eos> Turned up out of the blue and claimed I owed him money from a card game.<eos> ~ And did you?
Oooh, is this a private party?<eos> I'm missing all the fun.<eos> I might go and find myself a drink.<eos> Say, did I mention that Jack and me had a swell talk this afternoon?<eos> No, you didn't.
The killer didn't succeed the first time and they're trying again.<eos> If that's the case, why the payments to Belinda?<eos> That was a red herring.<eos> Constance swears she didn't pay her.<eos> Somebody did.
My condolences.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes?<eos> We have a school magazine.<eos> Maybe you do.
- I'm... she-she...<eos> - Oh-oh, ah-ah, she-she, buh-buh-buh-buh.<eos> Oh, now you can't speak English?<eos> Yes, she did, Lucious. And she tried to take Porsha.<eos> Sho' did.
No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.
You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.<eos> Of course he does.
Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.<eos> Okay, that's great, but I said loudly enough so that he can hear you.<eos> 20 times.<eos> Let's go. Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.<eos> Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

RESSLER: My money's on the fact these two have a history.<eos> Reddington, Braxton, they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you'll find out.<eos> - Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> - You do now.
What?<eos> Our asset is tracking the extent of the breach.<eos> It appears that Braxton's team has penetrated your country's network.<eos> We have confirmation on what they're looking for?<eos> Yes, we do.
We take them on?<eos> If we get into trouble, we go behind the building into the woods and we draw them away.<eos> Hey, you've been out on runs since he got here.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> Me and Aiden, we didn't.
Plain and simple, we kill him before he kills us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Carter.<eos> - He heard.<eos> - I didn't.
Will you do that for me?<eos> I'll take care of that one.<eos> Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.
Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, too.
I don't care about that! I just want to do my job!<eos> Wow, you really do love the river.<eos> Yes! Are you deaf?<eos> But Trippi knew the sommelier didn't want an extra case of wine, so why did he order another one from the brothers?<eos> He didn't.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Well, wait, you've known each other, like, a week, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wow. Yeah.<eos> You guys don't mess around.<eos> Yes, we do.
Wait, you used to have a VW Bug?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I used to have a VW Bug!<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
With my parents.<eos> My mum needs help looking after my dad.<eos> They like what you do?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, I do.
We counsel hope, not fire and brimstone.<eos> I have a new message.<eos> What you're saying could bring us down.<eos> -This has nothing to do with you.<eos> -The hell it doesn't.
Someone filming us from the window.<eos> - Police!<eos> - You can not be here!<eos> - Why shoot us?<eos> - I did not.
He asked for her.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The cops took me in.<eos> They showed photos of Sofia.<eos> - What did you do?
We must draw the Ottoman forces here.<eos> As many as we can.<eos> And then pray that those remaining will surrender once they see the power of our weapon.<eos> Did you just say "pray", Da Vinci?<eos> Indeed I did.
Did you just say "pray", Da Vinci?<eos> Indeed I did.<eos> The greatest fighting force the world has yet to see brought to its knees by a man who likes to paint.<eos> You see the hand of Da Vinci in this?<eos> And you do not?
Do you really need to be so aggressive?<eos> Can't you have some compassion?<eos> You get the hell out of here.<eos> You don't give a shit about these girls.<eos> And you do?
The Department of Public Health has not issued any updates in the past week, though rumors have been swirling that a vaccine might be ready in the next few days.<eos> Eternal God, God of our mothers and our fathers, our God, we come before you today not in sadness or despair, but in joy and in confirmation. We come affirming...<eos> Stop it!<eos> We need to pray.<eos> No, we don't, Melissa.
Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
No! - Okay?<eos> - I know you want to.<eos> - No! - I know you do.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Do it.
Rough day?<eos> Yeah, you can say that.<eos> Well, if it helps, I spoke to Ronnie.<eos> He's truly sorry.<eos> It doesn't.
Chuck's my brother.<eos> He says he's my father and mother, too, because they died.<eos> He makes me hamburgers whenever I want. I can't make them anymore.<eos> Do you have a brother?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- We're less than ten minutes away.<eos> Then we'll get you out.<eos> What about you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
That Angelina?<eos> She killed Orson's brothers?<eos> It was one of my first cases as a grimm.<eos> What the hell was I supposed to know?<eos> Well, more than I did.
- Me? You killed them.<eos> You hired me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Now.<eos> No, we don't.
Fuck.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought you said that you were considering it.<eos> I did.
- Hey, Mom.<eos> Mom, I can write my college essay on anything I want, right?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> Is that what it says?<eos> Yes, it does.
If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
His leg was on evelyn's lawn.<eos> Yeah. I can't see taylor chopping up a body And throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> Katy does.
Derek wouldn't just leave his patients.<eos> Pickups.<eos> Or his wife or his kids.<eos> I mean, it's... it's just hard to believe.<eos> Well, he did.
Toby!<eos> Hey, Caroline.<eos> No-one knew if you were coming or not! Do you want a drink?<eos> I've got some ciders hidden in the washing machine.<eos> Course he does.
Do you want to go outside and talk?<eos> I can hear OK.<eos> I mean, do you want to go somewhere? Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.
To collect his share of the take.<eos> Who passes up on that much money?<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> They know where Lomis is, they have to.<eos> No, they don't, Krumitz.
At the time Everett was shot, your paintball team had just split up.<eos> Was there anyone who could account for you, just before the body was discovered?<eos> Make no mistake, Harris.<eos> We're gonna catch whoever did this.<eos> Not if I do first.
Do you even know what division he's in?<eos> Agriculture.<eos> It's so boring.<eos> He must know a lot about soil.<eos> Yeah, no, really, he does.
- What are you doing?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> - You don't want to hear the truth.<eos> - Please, I do.
That lovely soul is one of pastor Tom's congregation.<eos> Poor fella.<eos> But she told me I could stay at his old church.<eos> She ask you to bring Tom back from the dead?<eos> She did, actually.
He was protecting you.<eos> Just like you protected him.<eos> It seems we don't have much time.<eos> If you stay they'll never believe you.<eos> They never do.
Still on the machine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, uh...<eos> You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
- State your business.<eos> - Your encounter with Setrakian.<eos> He was able to get way too close.<eos> That could've ended very badly for us.<eos> - But it didn't.
But you'll never win with your son when it comes to his mother.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> Is he gonna die on us?<eos> There's less swelling, but he's fully infected.<eos> - In other words... we did it.
I should have at least warned you before you got here.<eos> All that would have done was antagonize him even more, because he would have known you did it.<eos> You did everything you could have done.<eos> We have to tell Mike.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm guessing he wasn't supposed to tell me that. But he did.<eos> And Louis Litt is not name partner material, which means he must have something on you.<eos> So, unless you want me going around town flapping my big mouth that something isn't right in your kitchen, you're going to make good on that favor.<eos> Sylvia didn't slip up at all, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
I can't stand... Now, let me show you how a lawyer cooks.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I just thought you'd want this.<eos> The associates saved it for you.<eos> No, they didn't.
He don't want no interruptions.<eos> But I hear you've been poaching.<eos> Spencer, baby.<eos> Miss Littlefield.<eos> - How you doing?
Well, I guess you won't be climbing any 30-foot walls anytime soon.<eos> But the fact that you're alive and not paralyzed is a hell of a lot more than okay.<eos> I've never gone behind your back, 'cause I trust you.<eos> And I thought you trusted me, too.<eos> I do. I...
I asked Daniel.<eos> About Teddy's part?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He didn't, really.
But not enough?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure what enough is.<eos> I thought I loved someone once.<eos> Maybe you did.
Not so much.<eos> Come in, Melvin.<eos> You want some coffee, or...?<eos> They want him to leave.<eos> Who does?
What?<eos> The paint.<eos> The can... Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
Guess not.<eos> Sheriff Daggett doesn't think I killed George.<eos> Well, that's encouraging.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Especially since I didn't.
I don't get the pole out as much as I used to.<eos> But I hear you do.<eos> I heard you pulled Katherine Hale into your boat.<eos> Why would you care about my relationship with Katherine Hale?<eos> Well, I don't.
- This the shitbag? - It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
And you know we need the credits.<eos> Right.<eos> Do it.<eos> So, do we have a bet?<eos> We do.
That's fine.<eos> It just costs more.<eos> Kanan and I already settled on a price.<eos> But I assume he requires your approval.<eos> - He doesn't.
What was in that crate?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Calrissian said not to open it.<eos> Yes. He did.
Just like your master.<eos> Tell me, Jedi, how did you survive Order 66?<eos> It was your Master Billaba who laid down her life for yours.<eos> Do you remember her last word to you, her last and final breath before she died?<eos> You do, don't you?
I don't see Alvis.<eos> - Alvis couldn't make it.<eos> He's... - I know where he is, Auntie.<eos> It still doesn't explain why I should trust you.<eos> Because Alvis does.
But cute townies always get screwed.<eos> Literally.<eos> Wait, I was gonna ask you something. Oh!<eos> There's a reporter at The Observer you talked to, Rebecca Hinton.<eos> No, I didn't.
Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
And that's how we differentiate them from Drill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Drill is not a child.<eos> He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt and fool the parents, but they didn't know what to look for.<eos> I do.
The safe house intel in the game was stolen in a hack of the CIA mainframe three weeks ago.<eos> Details from six other unknown operations and safe houses were taken.<eos> Ralph had nothing to do with hacking the CIA.<eos> I know.<eos> But they don't.
Now, you take as much time as you need to think about it.<eos> But I'll leave you with this...<eos> Do you want... our babies... to have sex... with each other?<eos> I vote no.<eos> And Melissa does, too.
I mean, you're trying to play God.<eos> That's enough nudges.<eos> This one wasn't me.<eos> Melissa asked Todd.<eos> She did?
Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well. - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes! I do!
- Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!
It's one of those freak happenings, you know?<eos> Here, I'll tell you exactly how it went down.<eos> I couldn't sleep. So I went downstairs, and I got myself a snack.<eos> And then I went to the living room, and I reread a Twilight.<eos> Then I did some knitting.
Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
If we're the only ones who know about it, then we can't just walk away, right?<eos> I know, I'm on your side, I get it.<eos> The only thing I don't get is... what changed for Cat.<eos> I mean, I didn't buy into this whole destiny spiel of hers at first, but...<eos> I do now.
Why should you?<eos> Why should I...<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, we do.
Did Vincent put you up to this?<eos> No.<eos> JT did, actually.<eos> He cares about you, too, Cat.<eos> Everybody does.
But he does have a brother named Curtis.<eos> A firefighter who lives on Staten Island?<eos> You probably don't want to waste your time with this.<eos> I think you may be onto something.<eos> You do?
So, you're gonna go knocking on doors looking for sick vampires? Hmm?<eos> After dark?<eos> If the professor suggested that, you'd lock him away in here.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah. I do.
I'm listening.<eos> My clients wish to purchase the Occido Lumen.<eos> The Lumen is an exceedingly valuable artifact.<eos> And forgive me for saying so, but you two do not appear to have the resources to enter the game.<eos> We don't, but our clients do.
- This is important.<eos> Councilwoman Faraldo, I worked with Nora Martinez at the CDC!<eos> Hey! Get his ass out of here!<eos> I believe you know my son, Zack?<eos> Yes, I do.
Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
I hated lying to you.<eos> But now you have experienced - His power for yourself.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Coco, I helped Him because I wanted Him to save my life.<eos> And He did.
Oh, that's cute, window man.<eos> But, let's talk with our voices now.<eos> We can talk with our hands later.<eos> You know I'm deaf, right?<eos> No. No, I did not.
It's no wonder you're a detective.<eos> Could you possibly look up death records for a particular body?<eos> Think I can manage that.<eos> You got a name?<eos> I do.
What hospital was it?<eos> - New York General.<eos> - Big place.<eos> Easy to see how someone could secretly administer a lethal dose of... what did you say?<eos> I didn't, actually.
- I should go check on David.<eos> - [grunts] So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> - I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> - Oh, but girls like you never do.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
You're with him!<eos> I knew that you were back then.<eos> But it ended.<eos> You told me it ended.<eos> - It did.
So now let's talk about this name, Abbiejean.<eos> Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a... Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.
Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a... Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.<eos> I much very do.
Ha! Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
You got what I came for?<eos> Oh, straight to the point, I like that.<eos> She doesn't often ask for my help, so you must have scared her half to death.<eos> Trust me, she deserved it.<eos> Maybe she did.
Ah, what a blessing you are.<eos> - What up?<eos> - These guys have snorted every grain of coke.<eos> We got to wind it down.<eos> No, we don't. We good.
I could use some more help with those proofs.<eos> Do you still want to get that cup of coffee?<eos> Um... listen, I shouldn't have texted you back.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> So why did you?
I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.
The other owners would not approve. You know that.<eos> You got a dead body in your office.<eos> You're thinking about a fucking deal?<eos> - I can't go to prison.<eos> - People like you rarely do.
Why don't you take a minute in here?<eos> I ain't staying.<eos> It'd be nice to have someone around the house to talk to.<eos> You got Ray.<eos> No, I don't.
I think he should move in here with us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice to have someone around the house to talk to.<eos> You got Ray.<eos> No, I don't.
You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
You're a good man, Terry.<eos> Yeah. Good night.<eos> Hello.<eos> I thought you covered your tracks.<eos> - I did.
I'm sorry?<eos> Were you gonna ask how the hearing went, or would you like to talk about your hairdo some more? I was.<eos> Of course I was going to ask.<eos> I just assumed it went smoothly.<eos> Well, it didn't.
He's taking steps to correct it.<eos> In fact, he's taken a loan and is going to look at apartments later today. Two or three bedrooms in Brooklyn and should have a signed lease by August 1st at the latest.<eos> - A question. - Yes, Your Honor?<eos> Does Mr. Solloway plan to live alone in this two- or three-bedroom?<eos> - Yes, he does.
- And then later...<eos> I didn't know how sick he was, and I didn't take him to the hospital.<eos> He died in his sleep.<eos> And so you carry that with you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
No, of course I don't.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.
Uh, well, not... not an entirely inappropriate sequitur actually.<eos> I-I think of God the same way as I think of love.<eos> I think if you think that God exists, then He does, because your faith and your actions bring His presence into the world, and the same is true of love.<eos> If you believe in its power and you conduct your life with respect of its... of its sanctity, then it'll always be there to serve you.<eos> But if you don't, then...
Yeah. That's her.<eos> Hmm.<eos> She is never gonna stay in this room.<eos> No, I know.<eos> But Noah doesn't.
He got me pregnant.<eos> I know he did.<eos> I really care about him.<eos> I think he really cares about me.<eos> He doesn't.
Yeah, if I eat something that I shouldn't.<eos> Bitch of a disease, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Well, did your GI recommend Humira injections?<eos> Yeah. Uh, he did.
_<eos> _<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.<eos> But it didn't.
Simple stuff.<eos> You might have picked the wrong day to lose that compass.<eos> Guess who wrote it.<eos> Peter.<eos> Of course he did.
You worked on her?<eos> He owes me money.<eos> Yeah, yeah. He mentioned that.<eos> He mention it was 15 grand?<eos> No, he didn't.
No.<eos> I...<eos> We've got a grandma?<eos> ! - She doesn't want to know, Mats.<eos> - She does. Bollocks!
Leo, we don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.<eos> Niska.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> I do.
I'm leaving, Waldo, with Veil.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> So what?<eos> I imagine I've got a dozen pups pissing on posts around here.<eos> Every Clipper does.
I can't do this anymore.<eos> You can't keep pulling me from the path of oncoming trains.<eos> There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.
There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> That is for us.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do?
For that, we need a coroner's report, so let's get on it.<eos> Okay, right away.<eos> Hey, did Abbott give you the news? Hey.<eos> We're having a real wedding at his house.<eos> He did.
Stacey, Mr. Peterson and I go way back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How was your little trip down to Rio Bravo?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Of course I do.
Then why did you wear Kevlar?<eos> A shot to the heart would have been too messy.<eos> That's not the way I wanted to go out.<eos> You wanted a head shot.<eos> I still do.
- What does it look like?<eos> - I don't know! It's a bug!<eos> - I mean seriously, his mother hates me.<eos> She thinks I'm ruining his life.<eos> - Well, of course she does.
But, Burgess...<eos> What?<eos> Uneasy lieth the head that weareth the crown upon the top of thine head.<eos> - What does that mean? - She knows.<eos> I don't, actually.
I need to speak with your high priest.<eos> And the lesson is, don't play politics unless you're good at it.<eos> This coin...<eos> It has two heads.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
Why take the chance?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> We served together.<eos> You don't win wars with sentimentality, Marcellus.<eos> No, you don't.
I have to go.<eos> Find any way of doing it?<eos> You know the first thing Kellogg's skeeze corp will look for is a virus.<eos> Send in a virus, who catches a cold?<eos> Emily does.
Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR so your suit only has it's minimal functions.<eos> Body armour, electro-taser, active camouflage.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Alec, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
There's work here I believe in.<eos> You took a hit.<eos> You took it to heart.<eos> You have other choices.<eos> We all do.
Do it slowly.<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
Time's up.<eos> This place is a write-off.<eos> Like my dream of going home.<eos> You can't give up now. We don't have Brad.<eos> Well, apparently we never did.
Which is ideal, you know?<eos> Not too hot, no crowds. The sand doesn't get everywhere 'cause it's basically frozen.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Who brought their beach boots?<eos> [Raspy] "I did."
See, I told you, Sage, that this would clear my head.<eos> Okay, $65.<eos> I'm borrowing from the kitty, for the kitty.<eos> - Every little bit adds up, right?<eos> - It does. It really does.
Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
Todd Spanna had an apartment across from Lucas Reem.<eos> One night, he sees Reem hosing blood off his hands, so he calls the cops, turns him in, ends Lucas Reem's run.<eos> Well, it looks like he's turned that into a little celebrity for himself.<eos> Did a couple of talk shows. I think he even wrote a book?<eos> Yes, he did.
Henry...<eos> People weren't willing to give us a chance.<eos> How can we assume the worst of this child?<eos> Still, we don't know what's really going on.<eos> Nobody does.
-What about--?<eos> -Dark Charlie?<eos> She's, uh... quiet.<eos> Just gotta keep moving forward.<eos> We all do.
Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia? Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
I'll call you back.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Diane, this is Eli.<eos> Eli, I don't have time right now.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
This is completely unnecessary, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Prima stated on the record he never received an e-mail from Toronto.<eos> Then he shouldn't mind us taking a look at the backup.<eos> You know you only have four hours left, Counselor?<eos> I do, Your Honor.
That's CPD's server.<eos> Okay, good. Now, can you access the individual e-mail archives?<eos> I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
- Really?<eos> - You sound surprised.<eos> Well, you've been Peter Florrick's man for years, and Peter Florrick wouldn't cross the street to stop me from choking, so yeah, I guess I am surprised.<eos> - Things change.<eos> - No, they don't.
- on the suspect vehicle? - Copy that, One-David-Ten.<eos> All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.<eos> It's probably best if we don't talk.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Yes.<eos> Careful with the gloating.<eos> You're going to get more wrinkles.<eos> I love alcohol!<eos> Yes, we all do.
Good.<eos> You and I have a... problem closer to home.<eos> How's Rachel progressing?<eos> Well, her mobility is not looking good, but her aphasia's improving, and she still has value.<eos> Does she?
I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
Okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - I did.
How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us until we know more about it.<eos> - How do we know it'll work on the Espheni?<eos> - We don't. Not yet.
You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula back into its capsule, it suddenly became nonlethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient lethal to the Espheni?<eos> We don't.
Ncgobo's going to set another meeting with Todd.<eos> We're hoping Venter shows up to kill Ncgobo.<eos> That's when we grab him.<eos> How do you know he'll go for it?<eos> We don't.
What?<eos> I felt for him and his kids, fighting this brutal, horrendous war.<eos> I mean, it's horrible, but it's... admirable in a way. It's brave. They don't have a lot of choices.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Uh, what did he do?<eos> Bad things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Did he kill people?<eos> He did.
Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
I wasn't looking for a solution.<eos> - I was looking for an answer.<eos> - To what? Whether or not it could be done...<eos> Whether I could do it-- we could do it.<eos> And we did.
This is Nora Everett.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't seem to find your file, Miss Everett.<eos> Do you... do you remember what year you participated in the study?<eos> I didn't.
Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him?<eos> Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
We see it all the time in the clinic.<eos> Somebody is suffering from a sexual dysfunction and they feel like there's no hope.<eos> But then they hear about us, and all of a sudden, there's a way forward, a path toward a cure.<eos> So, we continue with the study, but tell the women the thing they're smelling contains pheromones.<eos> Because it does.
It's a conversation between Mrs. Al Fayeed and the lead delegate, Anwar Awad.<eos> The ICC is refusing to extend immunity to Colonel Al-Ghazi.<eos> I gave Mahmoud my word, and you gave me yours.<eos> I said I would try.<eos> And I did.
We've got six threats all armed with Steyr machine pistols.<eos> Three at the north watching the hostages, the other three with the artwork.<eos> All right, I'll have SWAT ready as soon as we can make entry.<eos> - Tell me you got the schematics.<eos> - I did.
You are looking at the number one girl in her age group on the entire island.<eos> What did I tell you, huh?<eos> No thanks to Marathon Man here, though, right?<eos> Listen, I helped with everything except the running part, okay?<eos> - He did, Uncle Steve, really. - Yes.
- Are you okay?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> Hook, what's wrong?<eos> You gave Ursula everything she wanted.<eos> But I almost didn't, love.
Well, did you really think he'd stay away? The dagger...<eos> you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
- Does it really matter?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> You screwed me over before we were even born.<eos> I had no more say in what happened than you did.<eos> But your parents did.
You need not be in the middle of this, My Lord.<eos> That is exactly where I need to be.<eos> Go on.<eos> The men are ready. - Do you have doubts?<eos> - I do.
And i am the queen of egypt.<eos> You will address me in the proper manner.<eos> I-i apologize, my queen.<eos> Where did he find you?<eos> He didn't.
Do I make myself clear?<eos> Give him a list of everything you're gonna need.<eos> Sebastian, brother.<eos> I didn't think you made it out.<eos> He didn't.
- Because of you.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> - You told her.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
Get the fuck out! - Whoa. Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Come here! Come here! - What are you...?<eos> Okay! Listen up!<eos> My partner and I, having been assaulted, have legal grounds to use deadly fucking force!<eos> We do. We do.
There is no trap.<eos> And... it's this way.<eos> The system upgrade should be completed about the same time we finish repairs on level 8 and 9.<eos> Do you still have blind spots down there from Wolfe's escape?<eos> We do.
One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.<eos> And so, for five years after that, I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.<eos> I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.<eos> And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.<eos> Well, it really did.
I was always tired.<eos> I could never sleep.<eos> You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.<eos> I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.<eos> He never did.
I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.<eos> What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.<eos> People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.<eos> Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.<eos> So what does that do to a household and a family?
So this little doohickey erased Margaux's entire computer?<eos> Worked like a charm.<eos> Uh, now let's put that away before you do the same to mine.<eos> Well, thank you for trusting me.<eos> I don't. Seriously.
From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.<eos> That's a crime, Agent Keen.<eos> Going back to the Cold War the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders internal CIA policy and promises made by every president since Ford.<eos> - You know who kidnapped this agent?<eos> - I do.
Um, that's not the only thing that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Jackie did review my application.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Well, I wrote a letter to the admission's board hoping that it would land on her desk.<eos> And it did.
They tend to overcharge for labor, so you got to watch out for that.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> Quit because of what happened the other night.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> I'm Eric, Talia's husband.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right. Um, Talia talks about you all the time.<eos> She does?
It's okay.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> It's quite a ways for you to come for an interview.<eos> You must really have your heart set on Oxford.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I can't be sitting in Spanish conjugating verbs.<eos> I really need to talk to Cyrus.<eos> You think we're going to find "A" through Cyrus?<eos> You're lucky if you can even find Cyrus.<eos> I already did.
Caleb, if i tell tanner, everything unravels.<eos> All of our secrets, all the lies we've told.<eos> The time we were in new york, shana, aria.<eos> Okay, well, your friends will understand.<eos> And if they don't?
I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> Jason...<eos> We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, and I made it.<eos> - I wanna go back.<eos> - Mike, stop.<eos> Do not be reckless with this. You have a target on your back, and I know you wanna do the right thing.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No jury is going to be swayed by a witness who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand, and was picking up NPR through her cavity fillings.<eos> We are not that desperate.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We don't have anybody else.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Get over yourself.<eos> - Stop, this is already stressful enough as it is.<eos> - Spencer, don't start...<eos> - I didn't start anything.<eos> The quitter did.
This was a good idea, Hunt... a master class in neurosurgery.<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm.<eos> Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
Davros is the child of war.<eos> A war that wouldn't end... a thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember why.<eos> So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior... one that wouldn't bother with THAT question.<eos> A mutant in a tank that would never, ever stop.<eos> And they never did.
What are your New Year's resolutions, huh?<eos> You got to see mine.<eos> Show me yours.<eos> He stopped drinking coffee.<eos> No, I did not.
Be careful: your milk's all spilled...<eos> Milk! Milk!<eos> Your milk's getting spilled!<eos> -You want some too?<eos> -Yeah, I do!
-You don't love me at all!<eos> What, don't I love you?<eos> Don't laugh, you son of a bitch!<eos> You don't love me!<eos> I do...
I've waited for you for two days.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You still thinking about suicide?<eos> Not really, I don't think about that anymore.<eos> Well, I do.
Well, it turns out we're not the only ones looking into the Zapata cartel.<eos> The FBI has been building a case against them longer than us, so he got pulled to Washington,<eos> I guess to hash it out with his bosses.<eos> And no one told me?<eos> I just did.
Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Did you want to do a little dance there, Jason? You want me to be sad?<eos> He shot my sister.<eos> He didn't.
Move!<eos> - Rockwell!<eos> - He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
"The pathogen doesn't affect human beings exposed to it."<eos> It's abundantly clear that Spivak's development of the LoPS pathogen was and is the primary catalyst for the extermination of all upir.<eos> - Does Roman have it?<eos> - Not to my knowledge, no.<eos> Of course he doesn't.
Hey.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Where'd you find this?<eos> I didn't.
Do you know why they closed down the warehouse?<eos> - All of them dead because of Andreas.<eos> - Lies.<eos> Lies. I didn't have anything to do with his death.<eos> - Peter did.
She's not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She didn't come home last night.<eos> I thought maybe she crashed at your place.<eos> Well, she didn't.
You might want to hire some protection.<eos> What are you guys doing over there?<eos> Air quality sensors.<eos> So, got any veggie burgers?<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
You don't have to answer.<eos> How do you admit to someone you've never been in a relationship?<eos> Who wants to hear?<eos> And when they do, who wants to stay?<eos> I do.
So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
Yeah, I get it Juan.<eos> System failed to deliver justice, so you took justice into your own hands.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that lady's fiancee.<eos> We don't wish that on anyone.<eos> Jack: But you did, Juan.
They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her.<eos> Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
Because that's what we laughed about.<eos> After his surgery and months long rehab.<eos> It was a terrible ordeal for both Martin and Heather Ormankupp. Mm.<eos> So you think we can laugh about me poisoning you?<eos> Yes, I do.
In 10 hours.<eos> The longest documented surviving type II case that I could find lived for all of 18 months.<eos> In an ICU his entire life, hooked up to feeding tubes and a ventilator.<eos> That's not a life. That's not a life I want for my son.<eos> (STAMMERS) Neither do I. I...
And maybe we were given this baby for a reason.<eos> KAREN:<eos> (SIGHS) You called your mom.<eos> Yeah. People need their mom in a crisis.<eos> No, not everybody does.
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.<eos> Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time...<eos> Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.<eos> Manny, you don't want to do this right?<eos> No, I really don't.
I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow. I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
Stop it!<eos> How the hell did you get video of that?<eos> That was a mistake. Which I stopped.<eos> I know that.<eos> But Julie doesn't.
And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
Seems awfully coincidental, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I don't believe in coincidences.<eos> But you do believe he was murdered.<eos> Yes, I do.
What are you saying, Julie?<eos> I'm saying I don't care what happens, I'm not making the wrong decision again.<eos> Shut the program down, Charlie.<eos> You realize we could go to jail for this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
Watch.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
I don't know.<eos> Am I gonna change?<eos> Am I gonna... turn into...<eos> Into what I am?<eos> What if you did?
Which way, Molly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This room was supposed to only have one doorway, not three.<eos> I thought you said you had this place memorized.<eos> I did.
She was talking in riddles.<eos> She was upset.<eos> She called me that day and I said...<eos> "We'll talk in the morning", and I didn't think anything of it.<eos> I didn't, River.
I was in a bind. Now I'm not.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
Jesus.<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> And what is the nature of your sin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
I grew up in Missouri in a cold-water tenement.<eos> Red blood, not blue.<eos> My mother used to scrub it out of my school clothes.<eos> See, I had to learn to hit above my weight.<eos> We all do.
I'm really tired.<eos> Pretty much been... been harvesting nonstop, you know, and Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant.<eos> That's not going so well, plus the Rams have had a terrible start to their season, so this whole utopia thing's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now.<eos> You obviously didn't come here to talk about football.<eos> No, I didn't.
You imagine this place?<eos> No, I go there.<eos> They take me there.<eos> Who do you think takes you there?<eos> They do.
Physician said he was dying, nothing to be done.<eos> I even went to the convent to ask the nuns to pray for him.<eos> But he just got weaker.<eos> Then this woman came, said she could help.<eos> And did she?
But what... what's happening here?<eos> Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.<eos> We do things together.<eos> You think 20 years just happens?<eos> No, it does not.
I suppose I could've OD'd, would have been a hell of a meet-cute, but what does it matter?<eos> Because here we are.<eos> Zombies together.<eos> It matters.<eos> It doesn't.
I didn't mean to suggest...<eos> Lenore's progress is slow, it's true.<eos> But it's steady, which is more important.<eos> Do you think she even knows I'm here?<eos> Of course she does.
What's the point?<eos> I stink, like Bronko Kowalski's helmet.<eos> You heard what Hank said.<eos> The team needs you.<eos> No, they don't.
Well, actually, you could've had some serious problems...<eos> Exposed wires, electrical fires. No.<eos> I mean being here with me.<eos> You know, if you have someplace else - you'd rather be...<eos> - I don't.
"like the horribly inappropriate present to get to the bottom of that."<eos> I could list the categories if you like.<eos> Caroline, I, um...<eos> I-I want to talk to you about all this,<eos> I do, but...
Jake, there's something I want to talk to you about.<eos> So, my boss hasn't been assigning me any of the good cases, and I found out it's because I'm dating a cop.<eos> What?<eos> Did he actually say that?<eos> No, but my colleagues did.
Shut up!<eos> I swear to you we'll find a replacement.<eos> Now, kill him!<eos> Yes, Grandmaster.<eos> Do it!
This is a crime scene.<eos> I won't touch a thing.<eos> Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.<eos> He's not my boyfriend.<eos> And yes, he does.
With her very, very much alive and cussing at me the whole time.<eos> Dr. Fuentes!<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'm glad Dr. Saroyan was able to find you so quickly.<eos> She didn't.
At the prospect of watching someone burn to death?<eos> I really missed that feeling.<eos> Just kill me, Kai.<eos> You already killed my best friend.<eos> So just do it.
We tried! For years! We saw doctors.<eos> All of them said we couldn't.<eos> And Brenda was so... Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.
All right, let's get out of here.<eos> He licked the blood off the floor?<eos> Yeah, the soda jockey back there seemed pretty shook up by it.<eos> Now, the description he gave -- medium build, brown hair -- that sound like the Kit you know?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.
We would lay low and try not to attract someone's attention.<eos> Now you have the police after you!<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I certainly hope so.<eos> You did something to me.
That's not that good, is it?<eos> "Mon" as in... You have a monster case.<eos> How about "mont" as in... You have a case the size of Montana.<eos> These medical bills are going to be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Keep trying.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Do it now!<eos> Breathe!<eos> Do it!
Do it now!<eos> Breathe!<eos> Do it!<eos> Cough, breathe and cough.<eos> Do it!
It looks like they have rolled out the red carpet for you, Agent Hackett.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> The admiral nixed secondary entry.<eos> He insists we go through the front.<eos> Of course he did.
- I do. The favor.<eos> The one you owe me.<eos> Yeah, uh, look, if this has anything to do with Florrick-Agos, we could always just bill it<eos> - through the firm. - No.<eos> It doesn't.
I am outraged, Your Honor.<eos> Well, you're welcome to your outrage, Ms. Krause, but I am inclined to decide that the plaintiff has proved likeness.<eos> I believe that this episode, though fictionalized, does defame Mr. Sweeney.<eos> Unless you have something else.<eos> I do.
Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.
What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Are you...<eos> What, superhuman?<eos> I wish.<eos> How much do you know about Liam?<eos> Only as much as Julianna did and for the same reason:
So this gives us the advantage, okay?<eos> Liam thinks that he is playing me, but in reality, I will be playing him.<eos> Look, just trust me, okay?<eos> Trust us.<eos> I do.
You used beast vision.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, your eyes glowed.<eos> I saw 'em.<eos> No, they did not.
Liam is not her relative and I am going to prove it.<eos> We'll have two minutes before they circle back.<eos> You did your homework.<eos> Got a lot at stake.<eos> We both do.
I didn't want to worry you.<eos> Bull.<eos> Go on, tell me why.<eos> I guess I just don't want to be weak around you, okay?<eos> I don't.
Really.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
You all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It was, uh... messy.<eos> It didn't go exactly as planned.<eos> It seldom does.
You need to get back in the game for your own good.<eos> You can beat this, Dean.<eos> Do you really believe that? Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.<eos> You know, you also believed in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.<eos> No, I didn't.
We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Now, it's time to get creative and look beyond Oxford and Cambridge.<eos> We need people like him.<eos> - Failed basic training.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it bloody does!
Do you remember?<eos> Creole Hot July.<eos> But I can't hit that note no more.<eos> Most people never touch greatness.<eos> You did.
What do I do?<eos> You're bleeding!<eos> You're bleeding too fast!<eos> I didn't... I didn't ask for any of this, you know.<eos> You lot never do.
_<eos> - Count of three, we fire.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't need him alive.<eos> - Yes, we do.
There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
I can't.<eos> She booby-trapped it.<eos> We open this, an alarm will notify her.<eos> We have no other way in.<eos> Actually, we do.
Stop being so strong, so perfect. Worrying about me when you...<eos> When we...<eos> I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> But every moment matters.<eos> It always did, I just didn't...
- We made a promise.<eos> To do what?<eos> Charge out there, guns blazing?<eos> We don't even know how to kill them.<eos> She does.
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?<eos> We've been searching for other meta-humans, like yourself. Don't be afraid, Cisco.<eos> You were affected, too.<eos> Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Yeah, that's her.<eos> Bella turner.<eos> What was zack's relationship with bella?<eos> I don't think he had one.<eos> Nobody does with her.
Please, keep coming in.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> Just this way, folks.<eos> That's right, right in here. Do you think Chaz would find this odd?<eos> Not sure, but I certainly do.
Sounds like a motive to me.<eos> You don't own a rifle, do you, Mr. Scruggs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Everyone around here does.
But grounding me for a month on top of taking my phone away is ok?<eos> Since when did this house turn into some sort of a gulag?<eos> Ahem. I know that this is a huge adjustment.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
It's carbon monoxide poisoning.<eos> I bet that you thought that you have to be in, like, oh, a small, enclosed space, like a... a car, right, for it to kill you.<eos> No, it just takes a little bit in the air, and you're dead.<eos> You think, because you outweigh me, it ensures that I'll die before you?<eos> But what if I don't?
So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?<eos> Okay, Erin...<eos> Is this about Teddy?<eos> Teddy?<eos> No, no, no. Nothing to do with Teddy.
Yay! That cat's back.<eos> See, Max?<eos> I am excited.<eos> [baby talk] Oh, I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
She's got some serious postpartum.<eos> When I left the room, she was lighting a Menthol 100 with a shaky paw.<eos> Hi.<eos> Crazy we live walking distance from each other.<eos> We don't.
Best case ever!<eos> This way?<eos> What can you tell us about the victim?<eos> Well, Tom Richwood was the mission pilot.<eos> Former Navy top gun, did a tour with NASA.
That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
Angela?<eos> I didn't say who it was in my letter.<eos> Maybe he thought it was Tom.<eos> Did he have reason to?<eos> Yeah, he did.
It was all for the greater good.<eos> Oh, says who, you?<eos> Every one of these cases were handled outside the law, which makes them against the law.<eos> Liam doesn't give a damn about the law.<eos> But I do!
What, that you hear dead people, that something bad is gonna happen?<eos> How is that gonna work?<eos> They'll think I'm crazy.<eos> No one will believe me.<eos> I do.
- I-I need to talk to a cop.<eos> - About what, sir?<eos> Just... I need to tell them something about some things I know, about some... about some crimes.<eos> All right, well, you go and sit down, and as soon as one of our police officers is available...<eos> No, no, I don't...
Want to bet?<eos> Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.<eos> Whatever that means.<eos> So, you really believe that people rise from the dead?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I'm not afraid of Enos.<eos> - If you knew him, you would be!<eos> -Sowe 'reclear, David'smine.<eos> - I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> - Girls like you never do.
Just- To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all.<eos> I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.
That's all.<eos> I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.<eos> Sure he did.
You didn't quit.<eos> You were fired.<eos> Oh, there's things I can do.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have any legal moves left.<eos> I don't.
Don't worry about a thing. You knew.<eos> You knew Ogden would go off.<eos> What a devious mind you have. I had no idea.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> We do.
You knew Ogden would go off.<eos> What a devious mind you have. I had no idea.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> We do.<eos> We do.
It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Been here before, then, have you?<eos> It's my regular spot.<eos> Oh, right, you're a local.<eos> Don't I know you?<eos> Do you?
Your parents were both patrons to the Children's Hospital.<eos> Therefore, it makes you a patron.<eos> Besides... there's gonna be a magician.<eos> And you like magicians, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us.<eos> - We have a deal?<eos> - We do.
Bodega owner called this in.<eos> His security camera caught it.<eos> She's our firefly.<eos> We don't know who the other one is.<eos> I do.
I want to know why you did this.<eos> When Dr. Thompkins walked in the room, how did it feel?<eos> I was terrified.<eos> She could have discovered the body.<eos> But she didn't.
I don't mind making house calls.<eos> I like my work.<eos> You like your work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
What do you want from me?<eos> Remember I had mentioned fate?<eos> Recently, I've been going through a sort of change.<eos> "What kind of change?" you ask.<eos> - I didn't.
Then he'll convince you to sell your company.<eos> I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I don't!
"Or die."<eos> It's option B, baby.<eos> Your fondest wish come true.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Hey. Sure you do.
Lay off my body, dude.<eos> I clearly got some stuff to work through.<eos> Chief Garmin, thanks for meeting with me. So I have a guy in custody on an attempted B and E.<eos> You scheduled a meeting with the chief of detectives to tell me that?<eos> I did.
Who cares about one broken window?<eos> I do!<eos> I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.<eos> But... Terry loves paperwork?<eos> - No, Jake, I do not.
- Russian?<eos> Mm-mm. - North Korean? - Mm-mm.<eos> Greek?<eos> I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.<eos> No one does.
- Who is Liam?<eos> Is that who you're talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Hey, actually, can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why'd you and J.T. break up?<eos> - He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> - He didn't.
You lay a hand on her again, and I don't care who you are, I will put you in the ground.<eos> That hardware always been there?<eos> No, it's new.<eos> Thought you said no one was home at the mines.<eos> I did.
So let's go find her.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you need a doctor?<eos> She needs a doctor!<eos> No, she doesn't!
Let's meet in the airlock in twenty minutes.<eos> Don't forget your comms.<eos> You find anything worth selling?<eos> No.<eos> Okay well-if you do...
You remember when you made this for me, that time we went to the beach?<eos> I couldn't have been more than six or seven years old.<eos> I remember. It's funny to think that I kept it all these years.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> You can turn around now.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship.<eos> Do we?
Ohhhh! No drinking.<eos> Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast this momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
God knows what they're talking about, basic bitches.<eos> What fresh hell is this?<eos> Chanel, I'd like to introduce you to Jennifer.<eos> I'm sorry, Kappa doesn't participate in the Make-a-Wish Foundation.<eos> Oh, but you do now.
I love you so much.<eos> ♪ You are a star... ♪<eos> ♪ Bright... ♪<eos> So you didn't see anyone in a Red Devil costume entering or leaving the house?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
Truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
I nominate Chad.<eos> Screw that, Evil Harrington.<eos> We're locking you upstairs in my closet until we can find a way out of here.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Yeah, it does.
What the hell are you talking about? !<eos> How? !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work!<eos> Yes, they do.
No salami and certainly no bologna!<eos> Really!<eos> It's a lawsuit!<eos> So do we have an agreement?<eos> We do.
You scheduled this meeting;<eos> that means you talk first and I do my best to try to pretend to listen.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You told me if I helped you get out of that asylum, you'd tell me what happened to the baby in the bathtub.<eos> Did I?
But if you pick the blue roll, he will strangle you until you turn blue.<eos> And it'll look like you're wearing a blue cloak.<eos> The... end.<eos> I know y'all feel better now.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm not wrong.<eos> You didn't pull the trigger.<eos> I put her in the crosshairs.<eos> He wanted to make it personal!<eos> Still does.
Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I went to Walgreens, got the Plan B pill, so...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that. Didn't they?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they did. Yeah.
I can grab 'em...<eos> I wanted to get the fuck out of there.<eos> It pisses me off because everyone knows that you were getting almost punish-fucked for money.<eos> It's like you're supposed to have respect for yourself, too.<eos> I do.
-It's, like, it was a bad choice in life. -Okay.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Her dad doesn't know.<eos> -Doesn't?<eos> -No, he doesn't.
Eyes down range.<eos> Acquire and fire.<eos> Go!<eos> Too slow.<eos> Do it again.
Two pair, queens over sixes.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You said before that the man next to you folded with two queens up, and now this guy has two queens, and you had a queen-high flush?<eos> I said that the man next to me folded with two kings.<eos> No, you didn't.
You will live.<eos> Find your way home, Aminata.<eos> I remember you from last year.<eos> You had letters for abolitionists.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
I would like to say that.<eos> I would.<eos> I wanted catherine to suffer.<eos> I wanted henry to suffer.<eos> They did.
Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
There are no blind spots.<eos> Cameras cover everything.<eos> What gives?<eos> Well, last week at the reception when Yussef Khalid allegedly entered the building...<eos> But didn't.
I am, if you'd shut up.<eos> Oh, gross!<eos> This phone is all sticky.<eos> Yeah, mine at home gets bad sticky.<eos> Ew. Of course it does.
Would you just...<eos> One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.
What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.<eos> Or I didn't when I started talking.<eos> I do now.
Oh, my God. They hate me.<eos> No. Lots of people like you.<eos> Like who?<eos> Uh, well, me.<eos> I do. - Yeah?
Hey, Claire, check out my new shirt.<eos> I have you to thank.<eos> Oh, no, that's all you.<eos> You were supposed to talk to her - about storing those zeppelins in a hangar.<eos> - I did!
I have you to thank.<eos> Oh, no, that's all you.<eos> You were supposed to talk to her - about storing those zeppelins in a hangar.<eos> - I did!<eos> Well, do it again. Louder.
Not a quarry to pursue.<eos> She's married.<eos> Forgive me, I appear to have lost my hearing.<eos> Since when did you acquire the moral high ground When it came to married women?<eos> I didn't.
My wife has come under some bad influences recently.<eos> I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your husband doesn't know about your faith?<eos> He does.
From the beginning.<eos> It was like I'd always been blind, but now I saw for the very first time.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> - You wanted me dead.<eos> - I did.
I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.
This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.<eos> Of course I do.
Eva was your friend.<eos> She came here to this very office and asked for your help, and now she's dead, and you feel responsible, and that can make you see ghosts.<eos> Wait, we're looking into Scott Galloway now?<eos> Why? I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being the killer.<eos> It does.
It's just a foreign baby.<eos> It's not a foreign baby.<eos> It's my baby. Your grandson.<eos> I'm a dad, so I can, at the very least, give it a shot.<eos> Your father didn't.
We're gonna fight it.<eos> But I need to know... Were you drinking?<eos> I didn't have a drop.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
Oh, Milly, where's my mint julep?<eos> Every year, on the first day of camp, the counselors perform a Broadway musicale.<eos> And this year, we're presenting the explosive Broadway hit, Electro-City!<eos> Electro-City is the story of a young man who moves from the country to the city to become a Broadway star and is immediately sent to the electric chair for a crime he did not commit.<eos> Or did he?
Like strength and joy.<eos> Love.<eos> Coop, it feels really good to speak my truth with you.<eos> You have really great arms.<eos> - I do?
I enjoyed the speech, Jim... and if you're ever on the lecture circuit,<eos> I'll be sure to get some tickets for me and my friends, but as for tonight, I'm getting kind of hungry.<eos> We have a deal or not?<eos> Nah.<eos> We do not.
Well played, Jim.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You did it.
Those were Andy's lips. Those were my lips.<eos> And don't even try and tell me that those were hard-nosed Electro-City DA,<eos> Pamela Needlehoffer's lips kissing my lips, those were Katie's lips, A.K.A. your lips.<eos> The only reason that I said that I was acting was because you said you were acting first!<eos> - No, I didn't!
Deadwood?<eos> Norwest is a person of interest In a homicide investigation in portland, your honor.<eos> You got a warrant?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
It's not adding up.<eos> Benjy, can't we borrow against your campaign fund? No.<eos> No, that's illegal.<eos> I... i don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.
It's my fault.<eos> Calvin must have gone looking for him.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy.<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
You'll download the details to our next case while in transit to RAC.<eos> Rocketry Aeronautics Center.<eos> Yes. Your team is uniquely qualified because as reacquired government assets, you can be held to strict confidentiality, whereas private RAC contractors cannot.<eos> Further, you have intimate knowledge of Russian aerospace engineering.<eos> No, we don't.
It's very kind of you.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin? Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
He hasn't been himself for ages.<eos> Should we go down now and see what it's all about?<eos> There is no treatment, there is no cure.<eos> But I'm sorry if Lady Mary saw fit to trouble you with it, my lord.<eos> She didn't.
You should know, sir... I've given everything for my country... to serve a mission I didn't ask for.<eos> And I'd be sitting safely in a cabin in the woods in Virginia with my family right now if I hadn't stayed with this ship. Instead...<eos> I lost my wife... to the virus.<eos> Didn't even get a chance to hold her hand... Or say goodbye.<eos> My children did.
- Karate boards.<eos> Spaghetti when you have a small pot.<eos> Rules.<eos> Look, someone's messing with my life here. I thought you guys had my back.<eos> We do.
- Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
And that's so not cool.<eos> Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly. I did.
You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a... A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Good.<eos> She's warm.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, things got a little intense.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Do I look like I need anybody's help?<eos> No, Juliette!<eos> It's all we've got!<eos> When are you all gonna learn that I like who I am?<eos> Well, we don't.
So you kept the money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And kept my mouth shut. It wouldn't have looked too good after he died.<eos> Yeah, no, you're right.<eos> And it still doesn't.
Hey, I try not to look at her like that.<eos> That must be difficult.<eos> It is.<eos> She haunts my dreams... just kidding.<eos> She does though.
It's official business.<eos> So what?<eos> It's a rave.<eos> The agency doesn't control the entire L.A. dance scene.<eos> Do they?
No, you're not, Paige.<eos> Paige, come on.<eos> They're right.<eos> We thought they knew.<eos> They didn't.
Nice and easy. Yeah?<eos> And just remember that the lens is right there, so...<eos> They won't think it's strange to see a woman carrying a purse onto the plant floor?<eos> I take it every time I leave the office.<eos> Every girl does.
She did her job.<eos> This wasn't the arrangement.<eos> I'm dealing with this side of things now.<eos> Got a problem with that?<eos> I do.
We need a break. - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
It's not impossible. With my own eyes, I saw you.<eos> Thierry saw you on the video. So we have proof.<eos> You know how this works.<eos> You know the word for what you did.<eos> Don't you?
Siddharth?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Supriya...<eos> - Siddhadh you have to trust me.<eos> Honestly? Right now I don't!
I was on duty.<eos> I, uh, heard over the radio that a kid had just shoplifted a cellphone from a store on Ambrose Street I'm driving on.<eos> About 10 seconds later, I see him walking.<eos> How do you know it's the same kid?<eos> I don't, of course, not at first.
You were up there a long time.<eos> He's got boyfriend trouble, and he wanted to talk about it.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I really do.
! I-I think you got a flat.<eos> Great.<eos> Way to go!<eos> Please tell me you have a spare.<eos> Course I do.
I just didn't know if you were coming in.<eos> You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again.<eos> You wouldn't be the first person to leave a job for personal reasons.<eos> It sounds to me like you have an agenda.<eos> - I don't.
Harvey is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything.<eos> No, Donna. He doesn't give a shit about this case, and he never did.<eos> Then why did he send me here to tell you to do everything you can to stick it to Evan Smith?<eos> She didn't take the deal, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
Wow, Africa.<eos> I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.<eos> So, uh, you speak English there?<eos> I speak five languages.<eos> (sputters) Nobody does.
Well, I mean, we spend pretty much every night together, and, obviously, every day together.<eos> Are you crazy? Maybe.<eos> Who moves that fast?<eos> Last time I was here, I advised you, be patient. You think we're moving too fast?<eos> Most new couples do.
And i did absolutely nothing, and what does it say about me?<eos> Squad, hold us down on a personal at 4215 roosevelt.<eos> (dispatcher) copy that.<eos> 4215 roosevelt. You really want my honest answer?<eos> Yeah, i do.
Squad, hold us down on a personal at 4215 roosevelt.<eos> (dispatcher) copy that.<eos> 4215 roosevelt. You really want my honest answer?<eos> Yeah, i do.<eos> I do.
Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, man, it's nasty.<eos> Okay, i don't know what else to do.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I do.
And you are so Big.<eos> [light chuckle] this is going to be all, dan'l boone.<eos> Alrighty, I think that's got it.<eos> Nurse, would you close for me?<eos> You already did that, doctor.
Well, then she needed to relax, I guess.<eos> I don't know, she was high-strung.<eos> Why did you post her photo?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
You don't have to talk.<eos> You can just listen.<eos> Yeah, we know that...<eos> you're not the shooter.<eos> Of course you do.
Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
All I'm getting from you is colors.<eos> But the hippie over here? I'm seeing some creep-ass hobbit-lookin' fella, a prison cell?<eos> That's heaven's jail.<eos> Heaven's got a freakin' jail?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
No, but we weren't fine.<eos> We weren't okay.<eos> I... I don't even know why we went our separate ways.<eos> It just happens to people.<eos> No, it doesn't.
And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
I wonder if thinking your small liberal arts school can beat Michigan is magical delusion or just regular delusion.<eos> Appareat! Diabolus! Ignis!<eos> Do I even want to know what they're cheering?<eos> No.<eos> You do not.
Okay, so, divide and conquer?<eos> Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.<eos> Stone and I will go talk to the professor. Admit it...<eos> You just don't want to go to a frat party.<eos> I really don't.
Some sort of blocking spell.<eos> It's not Hittite.<eos> It's not Ashanti twi.<eos> Oh, it's Druid. We got this.<eos> We do?
Spells, witches, ghosts.<eos> I fought a tentacle monster.<eos> It's a weird gig.<eos> How do you use it? This magic?<eos> We don't.
I need you to...<eos> - Plan "B"!<eos> Plan "B"!<eos> I thought they were only supposed to do that - if it all goes pear-shaped.<eos> - Apparently, it did.
Nothing. Nothing.<eos> It's just, a temporal loop implies a complicated interplay of cause and effect, and you're more of a... wing-it kinda guy.<eos> I'm just touched by your trust, really.<eos> Now, Cassandra said if we shut the quantum computer down, this all ends.<eos> I did?
- Wow. And you teach there?<eos> - I do. - In 11 departments at once.<eos> - Yeah. I don't... well, when I'm not saving the World Heritage Sites from tomb raiders, but, you know... shall we?<eos> - Oh, Egyptology!<eos> - I didn't...
Not visible until this very moment.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> "Jenkins, the key is in your Guardian's name."<eos> You don't have a Guardian.<eos> Of course I do.

Your student?<eos> The smart ones are always curious.<eos> I'll return her to check in with the rest of her classmates.<eos> I didn't know Twilight had a twin sister!<eos> She doesn't!
I don't know.<eos> Spying feels kind of wrong.<eos> Well, it's your decision, Twilight.<eos> It's not as if your application hangs in the balance.<eos> On second thought, yes it does.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> I just wanted to learn about the strange energy coming from your school.<eos> I didn't know that it was magic or how it works!<eos> That's okay.<eos> Neither do we.
Like how to get our magic hack, or how to fix the portal to Equestria?<eos> Equestria?<eos> You're supposed to be so smart, but did you ever think that you shouldn't be messing around with things you don't understand?<eos> But I want to understand!<eos> But you don't!
But I don't.<eos> I let everyone down.<eos> And now Principal Cinch thinks we're cheating!<eos> It doesn't matter what Principal Cinch thinks.<eos> But it does.
He wasn't on the job, I can tell you that.<eos> We didn't have any pickups out that way, so I don't know what he was doing there.<eos> Well, who would?<eos> Did he have any family?<eos> He doesn't.
'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
You're famous.<eos> Rosie Webb, out of Vedra Beach, Florida star witness in the ongoing Barry Madden trial.<eos> Says here you helped him bilk billions from innocent investors.<eos> Just 'cause I work with the guy, doesn't mean I helped him steal.<eos> So you didn't?
If you promise to stop talking, okay?<eos> Come on, get up there!<eos> No! You guys, are we gonna pull over soon?<eos> 'Cause Doc says I got to move every couple hours, or the fluid builds up, and that's when the gastro esophageal reflex kicks in, and you do not want to smell it.<eos> No, we do not.
Relief?<eos> Well, that means Barry's not after me.<eos> See, I knew he wouldn't betray me.<eos> Oh, you and Madden had a thing.<eos> Yes, you did.
Got it.<eos> Guy Rosie's been chatting with is Mike Van Loon out of Woodbine.<eos> Got an address too.<eos> This guy owns a brown pickup?<eos> Uh, sure does.
Don't turn around, we're being watched.<eos> I have a clue.<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> You don't dance.<eos> - I do now.
All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
And I will not be responsible for one more friend's death.<eos> Shaw's not your fault.<eos> Even if she does turn up dead, it's not your fault.<eos> I asked her to help us that day.<eos> I did, Harold.
Two whiskeys, please, Chantelle.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Say, I'm looking for an old sky pal of mine.<eos> Do you know Roger Peralta?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
All I could get out of my buddy at the 3-5 was that some new witness came forward.<eos> Someone who said they saw Sherlock kill Maria?<eos> No, someone who says they heard him threaten her life a few days before she disappeared.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.
On the same day as her talent show?<eos> Okay, are you accusing me of overscheduling Our tone-deaf daughter so she's so tired She misses the talent show and doesn't humiliate herself?<eos> Lily has no talent.<eos> Because she's 7. No one has talent at 7.<eos> I did.
Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.<eos> And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.<eos> No, I don't.
Yes.<eos> I told you that man was trouble.<eos> And I told you I wouldn't abandon Marcus and you were wrong about him.<eos> So this has something to do with Marcus.<eos> Yes, it does.
Love you, Harvey.<eos> I love you too.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Listen, I was thinking about what you said, about me pitying you.<eos> And I don't.
It's good that we don't share everything in common.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> G, I love you like a brother, but we basically have nothing in common.<eos> Of course we do.
I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
He doesn't know.<eos> Or maybe I... abandoned him.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> I lived most of my life here, Nina, but I never knew anyone who would do something like this.<eos> I did.
Tim from engineering never liked me.<eos> The more probable scenario is Mr. Peterson was involved with some bad people.<eos> It seems like he hardly left his apartment.<eos> You never know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> I do.
Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't.
- It is?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> - You didn't know this?<eos> - I didn't.
Sit.<eos> He is in breach of contract.<eos> I want that whore out of my house.<eos> The contract says I can have a life as long as I'm discreet.<eos> Yes, it does.
That's your job.<eos> You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that? - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...<eos> I do not.
Well, it's good you know what you want -- before anyone got hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course I have the receipt. Ow!<eos> ... Kay, what if I didn't?
Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
Thanks for your help.<eos> Well, it's cozy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Something seems very wrong here.<eos> It always does.
Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
Too easy?<eos> You listen to me.<eos> A jealous man destroyed me. I'm done with that!<eos> You don't order me about.<eos> No one does!
I, Srikant Mathur.<eos> Disgraced Officer.<eos> - Who gives a damn about it, dad.<eos> - I care a damn!<eos> I do.
But people usually just call me Ellie.<eos> And you are?<eos> I just graduated from the Met Police Service with a degree in forensics psychology.<eos> I... hope you don't mind if I observe.<eos> And if I do?
Call me back when you've narrowed it down to one.<eos> Well, we know that whoever abducted Sophie, did it to get to her source, to silence him.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You said when you got here that you didn't think it was Wombosi.<eos> - And I still don't.
There's nothing for me to work with here.<eos> We better head back.<eos> There's one more thing we could try.<eos> Sir, do you still have the ID card for WN453?<eos> Er, yes I do.
So? Did it seem to you like she was having second thoughts?<eos> Not that I was aware of.<eos> Then don't you think --<eos> That it's none of our business?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Bishop, go get your BLUESTAR kit.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> McGee, find out everything you can on a Miranda Flemming.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Just do it, huh?
- I had no idea what he expected.<eos> I'm a criminal. Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must've known how strange all of this was.<eos> - Of course I did.
We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
Should I obtain the Gauntlet, Tony?<eos> I'm thinking that's a good idea.<eos> Well, that certainly brought you down to Earth, Thanos.<eos> No one challenges...<eos> We do.
It's just--<eos> It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something.<eos> No.<eos> Caroline thinks you have great taste.<eos> She does?
If I could teach healthy lungs to hold and reproduce the cure the same way yours do with the virus, well, then I could...<eos> You could make the cure contagious.<eos> Of course, the trick would be understanding just how your body does it, to be able to compare the D.N.A. sequence change between yours and the primordial.<eos> You have my blood samples.<eos> I do. ‭
So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.<eos> We both did.
That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.
And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Mostly.<eos> Tristan?<eos> Isn't that the name of the Countess' new squeeze?<eos> She doesn't love him.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
So much potential on the day of birth.<eos> Should be a cause to celebrate.<eos> Not a day to mourn.<eos> Didn't work out that way.<eos> Maybe it did.
Mama... smells appetizers.<eos> Why do I feel like a teenager that's about to get caught?<eos> We're not supposed to be sleeping together.<eos> Who says we have to go through with it?<eos> I do.
John... you can't tell me that this isn't what you want.<eos> - Come on. - No.<eos> Alex is not the answer.<eos> She doesn't know about you.<eos> Not the way I do.
You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
Kanima.<eos> Hey, Deaton, how the hell did she get through the Mountain Ash?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a barrier no supernatural creature should be able to cross.<eos> Scott did it.
Oh, boy.<eos> Zoe, we're gonna have to reschedule the bread.<eos> Yeah, Senior was so broken up over Linda, he forgot his cell phone at home.<eos> So he didn't tell Tony he was coming?<eos> No, he did not.
Most likely 'cause she doesn't want to give up a key asset in her investigation into Everyone.<eos> We were hoping you could call someone at the Bureau, put pressure on Branch.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> You're asking me to accuse a federal agent of covering up a murder.<eos> 'Cause she did.
That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
UNIT will cut out the Faraday Cage with them inside and take it away.<eos> Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
To teach him about responsibility?<eos> But here you are, shrugging off your own.<eos> By blaming the FBI, the-the U.S. government.<eos> The thing is... we didn't turn your nephew into a terrorist.<eos> You did.
We haven't heard from them in almost two hours.<eos> Do you think that Callen would try to take them?<eos> Did you hear gunshots?<eos> No.<eos> Then he didn't.
I'd shake your hand, but, uh...<eos> Well, I have to say I am impressed the way you charged in here all guns blazin'.<eos> I'd buy tickets to that show.<eos> You didn't think that was really gonna work, did you?<eos> Usually does.
Let's talk about what I'll take.<eos> My freedom, guaranteed... and the Codex.<eos> -Sam, you can't be--<eos> -Do you know which spell?<eos> I do.
Do you want to learn?<eos> I can show you.<eos> You're showing me plenty right now.<eos> I've got nothing to hide.<eos> And I do?
Die Entrechteten.<eos> Really, Aram.<eos> These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.<eos> - The FBI must have some kind of file. - No.<eos> We do.
Interpol estimates a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade is walking into that?<eos> - How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
And you were always a paranoid, self-righteous prick.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> - And if I don't?
Still in the OR. - Okay.<eos> I just need something good to come out of this day.<eos> Abdominal injuries are under control.<eos> I'm ready to close.<eos> You about done, Kepner? Almost.
But ethically, you have to.<eos> Ethically, I'm looking out for the best interest of my patient and his family.<eos> Hey, thanks for walking us out.<eos> You know, you didn't have to do that.<eos> With your sense of direction, I kind of did.
It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.
If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.
Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
OK, er... no problem.<eos> Er, could I just ask, then, if you recognise this phone number, Sir Phillip?<eos> 01 946 09 27.<eos> Well, 01 is obviously an old London number.<eos> Aside from that, no, I don't.
- 'Oh, sorry to hear that, Rob.'<eos> - No, no, it's all right.<eos> Just er...<eos> She just probably needs a good holiday, really.<eos> (CHUCKLES) We both do.
He knew that Dover would get out.<eos> Why wasn't anything done?<eos> He didn't say anything.<eos> It's up to the individual to ask for protection.<eos> - And he didn't do that.
Suppose we can use one of mine.<eos> I'm sure The Telegraph will reimburse me.<eos> Right?<eos> This trip has nothing to do with The Telegraph, does it?<eos> It did.
Abraham Kenyatta,<eos> Dr. Mitch Morgan and Jamie Campbell.<eos> I know you all have many questions, but if you'll please take a seat.<eos> I know this was difficult, but I'd like to think at least it brought you some small measure of closure.<eos> It didn't.
She said it was a routine procedure.<eos> Uh, hey, Otis.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I don't know if Joe said what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he did.
2.<eos> Where is she?<eos> You did what?<eos> You did what?<eos> You did what?
who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love.<eos> You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Let's just say your reputation precedes you.<eos> My reputation?<eos> Have we had a bad date I don't recall?<eos> No, but a friend of mine did.
MIKE: Where the hell have you been all morning?<eos> What are you, my mother?<eos> I was in a meeting.<eos> Why? Remember when you said Katzen was going to wait until the last second to hold us over a barrel?<eos> Well, they didn't.
That you have another contract that doesn't care about the name of your company.<eos> They only care about the name of the owner.<eos> How the hell did Katzen even know to sell their debt?<eos> Because I made a mistake.<eos> You sure as hell did!
Yo, Nash!<eos> So...<eos> Marie.<eos> Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?<eos> Of course she did.
[Both laugh] Come on, let's get you into bed.<eos> Oh, go get in bed.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> 48 hours to shut down the case.<eos> And if we don't?
All right Marcus tell us what happend.<eos> We were here in the bed, and we heard someone come in the back door.<eos> Figured it was her husband.<eos> - You said he went in early.<eos> - He did.
Do I?<eos> Yes. You do.<eos> Why would I... because you know that you would make a better senate candidate than Mrs. Grant.<eos> - Did I say that?<eos> - You did... with your eyes.
What about emergency medical leave?<eos> Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative? One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.
Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.<eos> What do you have on tap?<eos> A long summer of fun.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do...
He's home.<eos> He was a really good friend.<eos> You two belong together.<eos> And deep down, she knows it.<eos> Does she?
That was dirty.<eos> So... so how are you guys celebrating tomorrow?<eos> Well, it's kind of still up in the air, but we're gonna start out with a nice long hike, and then have a little breakfast picnic.<eos> Aw. That sounds nice.<eos> What you gonna do after that?
All right, Max, what do you got?<eos> Well, as I suspected, the C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head and torso caused by the fall.<eos> But I didn't find evidence of foul play.<eos> Well, yeah, but you didn't find anything that proves that she wasn't pushed, right?<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> God, it feels so good to just sit here and do the wrong thing with you.<eos> Well, I don't want to keep you.<eos> I'm sure you got better things to do than sit in the back of a truck and just listen to me babble on.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
What?<eos> Sure he'll come back.<eos> Oh, he's definitely coming back.<eos> Print matched?<eos> Indeed it did.
But she was crying so loud.<eos> So I turned the water on and I drowned her out.<eos> Until she could pretend she was okay.<eos> Nobody disappeared from here on October 14th four years ago.<eos> But they did before.
This better be important, man.<eos> Julie would kill me if she find out I was back over here.<eos> Relax, all right?<eos> Me and the boys cooked up something special for you.<eos> Or this guy did.
They'll be our guests for now.<eos> How are we looking with those prisoners?<eos> Still not talking yet, but they will.<eos> Meantime, something came up while you were gone.<eos> Usually does.
Tell me again, when did you first notice Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And? Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
We should have started there.<eos> She would be better off.<eos> That is not true. Her defect...<eos> My approach made things worse.<eos> No, it didn't.
I need you to tell me, 'cause...<eos> You say one thing, and I think you mean something else entirely, and I want to understand.<eos> I am trying to.<eos> Because I want what we started here.<eos> I do.
You tried to kill me, you lunatic.<eos> Okay, whatever did or did not happen was due to the fact that my family was drugging me.<eos> Former family.<eos> Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.<eos> Oh, the hell she doesn't.
She loves you, Jack.<eos> I can't hear that right now.<eos> And I certainly didn't hear it from her.<eos> We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels are two very different things.<eos> Yes, we do.
And Abraham... he has his dark places,<eos> Oui.<eos> Yeah. Perhaps someday he'll tell you about it.<eos> - So did you find Leo Butler?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
But... do you think - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby. - ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine. - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
You-you got what you came for.<eos> Leo, I'm forever grateful for what you did.<eos> And I 100% want to go for a sail with you when this is all over.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Why?<eos> Did Bones call you or something?<eos> No, we're just all concerned because for some crazy reason we care about you.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should be more concerned that we don't have a motive or a suspect.<eos> Well, we do now.
What I would do for just a sip of human blood.<eos> You know when you're feeding on someone's neck and their artery's still pulsing?<eos> I really love that.<eos> I thought your veins felt like sandpaper.<eos> They do.
Ok.<eos> A lot of Tequila.<eos> And there's only one of you.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I didn't do anything.
Find him!<eos> Did you...?<eos> A physician is coming to bind his wound.<eos> When you left last night, you had all this in mind.<eos> Didn't you?
Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
If we don't show up, they'll come looking.<eos> Is it possible I'm pregnant?<eos> I don't think so, hon.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> It still does.
The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here, in the flesh.<eos> Of course I have questions.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I love you.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.
The problem is, is not everyone respects your initiative.<eos> Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling, that you're responsible for the deaths<eos> - of those two people.<eos> - What? I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did.
To find Julia.<eos> That damn meteor probably took out half the country.<eos> We don't know if what happened outside happened everywhere.<eos> We need to contact the outside world.<eos> Oh, do we?
Falling for the dark, mysterious guy and... then get all bent out of shape when he turns out to be dark and mysterious.<eos> two former enemies drinking at the end of the world. "Former"?<eos> Oh, come on, Jim.<eos> You must have regrets.<eos> Yeah, course I do.
Remember...<eos> Remember what?<eos> The Great Destruction.<eos> It's happening all over again.<eos> Like it did on our home world.
I gave Sam a choice:<eos> He can either live among us, or... die with the Resistance.<eos> Christine?<eos> I thought the cocoon healed you.<eos> It did.
No one said you could stay.<eos> This is my safe house.<eos> That's a hell of a way to thank the man that just saved your life.<eos> I don't owe you squat.<eos> Actually, you do.
If I wasn't certain she was one of us now.<eos> She's here to help us find my daughter.<eos> Is Dr. Bloom still working on the umbilical cord?<eos> When Hektor went after Joe, it wasn't just me who tried to stop him.<eos> Dr. Bloom did, too.
This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true.<eos> Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
- This is someone...<eos> I'm sorry. I know I'm supposed to keep it down, but...<eos> We had sandwiches.<eos> Wait... you did?<eos> We did.
Classic Empire for you, baby. Right here.<eos> He dropped that from prison?<eos> How?<eos> Your daddy, he has his ways.<eos> He always did.
What the hell is going on?<eos> FBI.<eos> We have a warrant.<eos> Your warrant does not give you the right to ransack my father's office.<eos> In fact, it does.
And he's a spoiled brat, but I feel horrible.<eos> Don't. Don't feel horrible.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not okay, he ruined your work.<eos> No, he-he didn't.
Uh, Lucious asked me to look into, uh, Anita Calhoun.<eos> Anika Calhoun.<eos> Anika, yeah.<eos> She doesn't work for Lyon Dynasty, right?<eos> Never did.
Good.<eos> Look, man, I know I've been hard on you.<eos> My label is my life.<eos> My mom, she deserves the best.<eos> She does. As do you.
I mean, obviously, I'm the OG super fan. I mean, obviously.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> It's 'cause you're so much more.<eos> You know, like, you got all this amazingness that you think that you got to keep hidden.<eos> You don't.
You don't remember?<eos> Mm, I think it was before my time.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing in the world.<eos> I wanted to wear it to prom, But mom said I'd lose it.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
But there are men outside, Really bad men, Who want to hurt us.<eos> The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR. (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.
Ok, well, run another rape kit.<eos> No rope burns on your arms or legs.<eos> No evidence of a break-in at all.<eos> What you guys trying to tell me, that this didn't happen to me?<eos> 'Cause it did!
The hell you aren't.<eos> You're mad because I've never forgiven you for what happened.<eos> And now this is payback.<eos> Roy, this has nothing to do with the past.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
I wish you didn't feel that way.<eos> Oh, don't be so understanding.<eos> For once, take the low road and tell me to take a hike.<eos> I think about what Haley would want for this family.<eos> Well, I do, too.
And bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.<eos> He does. Now text her back Before she starts worrying.<eos> She's totally gonna know I'm lying.<eos> She always does.
You a sniper like him?<eos> Female Engagement Team, yeah.<eos> Connor used to talk about it.<eos> Killing somebody from a distance... didn't feel real.<eos> Until... it did.
He said he was a reporter. He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
Evans, you're on door breach.<eos> Patterson... flashbang.<eos> Boyle, stop squatting like that.<eos> Sorry, I thought it looked cool.<eos> - It didn't.
Justin was former C.I.A. You know how you guys are.<eos> Conditioned not to crack.<eos> He had our algorithms.<eos> He was going to post them for the world to see.<eos> And if he did?
We were sleeping together.<eos> She had access to everything my phone, computer, passwords.<eos> If you don't believe me--<eos> We want to believe you.<eos> We do.
Okay, fine.<eos> Fine. I was gonna leave Todd in the desert.<eos> Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> But I-I didn't do it!
And, you know, it's actually a very easy storyline to follow.<eos> You become buddy-buddy with Marla Finch from group and, you know, yes, that was a terrible, terrible thing that happened to her.<eos> Then the boyfriend walks and you snap.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I honestly do.
Those, however, are the only ones where he appears to be in heated altercation with a man two days before he was murdered.<eos> This guy was murdered?<eos> Last night.<eos> Do you want to tell us how you knew him?<eos> I didn't.
So, I checked Arn's records to see if he did any time with Czech inmates.<eos> David and Aleksandr Brosnek.<eos> Cocaine traffickers operating from Prague.<eos> Cocaine traffickers?<eos> Anything to do with narcoterrorism?
Let me ask you this.<eos> Is there any chance that the file on his brother's death, the one Martel requested, is on the flash drive that Armstrong smuggled in?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Didn't have any access.<eos> But we do.
Nate.<eos> Little Nate with the... bright eyes and the... crazy smile.<eos> A smile I will never see again.<eos> We understand, Marcus.<eos> You don't.
- Where are you?<eos> - Headed back to the office.<eos> Arabela and Marco interviewed Lucarelli,<eos> - he claims he's innocent.<eos> - Well, of course he does.
That is some evidence Marco gave me.<eos> Pertaining to what?<eos> The man who abducted his sister.<eos> Does Carine know about this?<eos> Yeah, she does.
Yeah, but that's just it.<eos> I don't want to know everything in my life.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
King...you're looking really smart<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you would look smarter with your father's favorite car.<eos> Did you find the car?<eos> You didn't, right?
You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people!<eos> You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
Apparently he had cultivated Lolita as an asset.<eos> She has relatives in Colombia who claim to know where our target got his hair cut.<eos> You know, we get a report like this twice a week.<eos> It never pans out.<eos> This one did.
These numbers are real.<eos> That's the same acquisition offer tendered to Cameron and the senior staff.<eos> The only new piece of accounting here is what you would personally stand to make.<eos> - A bribe, you mean.<eos> - I just did the math for you.
Okay, how long did these guys stick around?<eos> I closed their tab around 11:00.<eos> They were pretty wasted, so I called them a cab.<eos> Do you know how hard it is to get the smell of vomit out of pleather?<eos> Thankfully, I do not.
There's a snake on the mother-flyin' plane.<eos> You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls we had to ship last week.<eos> Look at this luggage.<eos> Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?<eos> They don't, not usually.
Um, no.<eos> You're...<eos> you're not going anywhere.<eos> You have no cause to hold me.<eos> Actually, we do.
You guys, it makes perfect sense.<eos> 'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.' 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.
'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.' 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - We don't?
Good.<eos> Yeah, she seems okay.<eos> You know, physically.<eos> They went through a lot.<eos> We all did.
You know who did kill her?<eos> She killed herself, but I was...<eos> So she killed herself?<eos> Yes, but I was responsible for...<eos> Yes, she did.
Do you believe me now?<eos> Why don't you tell me.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be abducted.<eos> To be taken against your will. You don't know.<eos> Well... maybe you do.
He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I spent the first weeks after the Departure just waiting.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> We all are.<eos> I had a patient who said she could feel that something terrible was gonna happen.<eos> And it did.
It means, "Stronger together."<eos> You say people will see me the way they see Superman one day, but...<eos> I don't want to be a hero like him.<eos> My cousin, he's so used to going it alone, he doesn't know any other way.<eos> But I do.
On Krypton, I remember Aunt Astra and my mother always arguing.<eos> Like sisters do.<eos> And when I asked my mother why they could never get along, she said that it was because Astra didn't have faith in people.<eos> You wanted to know if I have faith in you.<eos> I do.
I'm scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of what?<eos> You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.<eos> She didn't?
Okay.<eos> She locked me out.<eos> Looks like you're locked out, too.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's pointless.<eos> I'm Evie.<eos> Meg.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't find whatever you were looking for here.<eos> No one ever does.
You're insane.<eos> Michael.<eos> You think I'm just gonna stand by and watch you kill yourself?<eos> I have to.<eos> One of us does.
And if it were Father, I promise He would have something to say to me!<eos> I'm one of his children too.<eos> Michael, I have a responsibility.<eos> That mean anything to you?<eos> It did... once.
We've got to get going.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip.<eos> You've had a rough year.<eos> - We all did.
And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would. You know?<eos> Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
Please.<eos> He doesn't believe it's true.<eos> Just tell him you have it.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I do.
I'd... Very well, m'lady.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> I'm not sure when I'll wear it again.<eos> - But you never know.<eos> - You never do.
- Julian.<eos> - Hey, General.<eos> Or is it Edward now?<eos> 'Cause when you left your post, you left your rank.<eos> I did.
I dug a little deeper into this guy and contacted the medical board.<eos> 3230 Kettering Drive.<eos> How'd it go with Reddington?<eos> He have any insights?<eos> No, but I did.
Leonard Caul.<eos> - Reddington has the Fulcrum.<eos> He has a blueprint outlining our entire infrastructure.<eos> If you leaked operational details, we're done.<eos> I didn't.
You need to talk to them now.<eos> Rockwell?<eos> He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
- Try the house. - Yeah.<eos> There's been a massive spike in the officer-related shootings in the last 48 hours.<eos> Nick, stop, please.<eos> Andpeopleactlikethis doesn't change everything.<eos> It does.
And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
Well, you got to take that up with lady doctor Exner.<eos> It's her show.<eos> - Fine.<eos> How do I talk to her?<eos> - You don't.
I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
They're forming a blockade... Trying to force us toward the sub.<eos> How do you know where they are?<eos> I accessed the Deadman Network and plotted the position of all the phones.<eos> I thought only the immunes had the deadman game.<eos> They do.
Forgive me, but have we met?<eos> I don't think we've met exactly.<eos> Tell us more about Hillcroft.<eos> Well, you see, I never had any higher education - and so...<eos> - Who did?
_<eos> I don't know how to say this, so, I'm just... going to be direct.<eos> Are you aware that your husband kept secrets from you?<eos> You mean... did I know that he slept with men?<eos> For a long time I didn't.
They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
And I just... I... I lost it.<eos> I...<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
Yeah, come in.<eos> Well, how's that for a day?<eos> Just pulled it out of our ass again.<eos> Never gets old.<eos> Yeah. But we do.
Director Vance, I had no idea Rivers was in the DC area.<eos> Keep yourself available, Agent Caffey.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You still trust this guy?<eos> I do.
I went into hiding.<eos> Why help the Marines?<eos> I could not sit back any longer while people like Rasheed tore my country apart.<eos> I needed to fight back.<eos> You did, Qasim.
No need.<eos> Director.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I hope you like Scotch.<eos> Oh! Tonight I do.
I'm a businesswoman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
That which does not kill me.<eos> Plus, with Lasalle at the mermaid's funeral, you could use a wingman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, you want to see everything that's come in in the last week.<eos> Yes, we do.
Ll, it would be nice to g pedicure, so I could wear sandals.<eos> That's what your soul needs... sandals?<eos> It is what Jesus wore.<eos> We need to pray.<eos> - Do we really?
And the only way I could deal with it was by blaming you.<eos> I get it.<eos> My kid looked me in the eye and he said he didn't want to live with me.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that hurts?<eos> Actually, I do.
- I'd like to see it.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - I'll be in London on Wednesday.<eos> - Edith has a date.<eos> - No, I don't.
I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you.<eos> - He did.<eos> - Whoa, wait.<eos> - Who did?
People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
Yeah, right. You wouldn't, uh...<eos> You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry. I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
Hell is a very lonely hole in A's dollhouse and maybe I deserved to be there.<eos> What you did was incredibly stupid.<eos> And yeah, I'm pissed as hell at you.<eos> - But that doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Yeah, but there's nothing going on here tonight.<eos> Those guys could use our help anyway.<eos> Hey, come on. The car's over here.<eos> Yeah, and we gotta let Command know we're going.<eos> No, we don't.
I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
No, I think she got what she needed.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> Alison's never had anyone like you in her whole life.<eos> Somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable and genuine.<eos> I did..
- It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What doesn't?<eos> Barmal designed her serum to block the virus from entering human blood cells.<eos> - So where did she go wrong?<eos> - She didn't.
And how fragile my parents thought I was.<eos> Well, I think that you have proven them wrong several times over.<eos> Dr. Barmal killed herself to stop the virus spreading, right?<eos> She assumed the virus would die with her.<eos> Yeah, and it did.
Doctors, teachers, lawyers.<eos> Very impressive what you have achieved.<eos> Mr. Dorn, that's not why you wanted to speak to me.<eos> To tell me you admire my work.<eos> No, no, I did, actually.
Now, let my wife go.<eos> Who's this?<eos> My sister Tiffany.<eos> Tiffany lives in Denver.<eos> I did until last month.
Isabella, I will find her.<eos> I will get her back.<eos> You said the plan was to wait, that it was impossible to cross the perimeter.<eos> Waiting was an option when we had somewhere to wait.<eos> Now we don't.
He's an illusionist essential to criminals such as myself, and I am giving him to you.<eos> Where's Keen?<eos> You said you got past the perimeter.<eos> You wouldn't be calling unless she didn't.<eos> No, she didn't.
What's your hurry?<eos> Last time we saw you, you were begging for our protection.<eos> And now you want nothing to do with us.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> Or do.
Good job. Keep Callen and Sam in the loop.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, guys. You asked if we could find out anything on the hit man that tried to take the Berkeleys out.<eos> Nikolai Brantov?<eos> Unfortunately, we did.
You better start knowing, otherwise we're gonna jump-start your memory for you.<eos> Arkady paid me to get some information from an inmate.<eos> Patrick Berkeley.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I didn't.
They've sacked the Captain.<eos> You can see their point.<eos> How could they have someone in the management of the new system who thinks the whole idea is a horrible mistake?<eos> - And you support this notion?<eos> - Of course he does.
Just tell Cora I do not wish to see her face until I'm used to having a traitor in the family!<eos> Why is she in such a tizzy?<eos> Well, you know mothers.<eos> They get terribly wrought up about things.<eos> - My mum does.
Well, you know mothers.<eos> They get terribly wrought up about things.<eos> - My mum does.<eos> - There you are.<eos> Mine does too.
No need to sound gloomy.<eos> I can rustle up something.<eos> Whatever you do rustle up, I won't cook it right or the plates will be cold, or the dressing will be wrong.<eos> - Does he appreciate all you do?<eos> - Does any man?
- And Andy.<eos> I think that'll turn out well.<eos> - I suppose so.<eos> Even if he only wants to read to learn more about farming from Mr Mason.<eos> And if he does?
Probably because I didn't want to make a big deal of it.<eos> But it is a big deal.<eos> You lost two months of your life. And you're dreaming about it now?<eos> - I don't think you should ignore this.<eos> - I do.
That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
So in my darkest moments, I wonder if I... did something terrible.<eos> I know you.<eos> You would never do anything bad.<eos> I could never leave the love of my life, desert her and you for two months.<eos> And somehow I did.
Allahu Akbar.<eos> How long will you stay with us?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> You like living here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We tried to run away together, like in the movies.<eos> To leave Abuddin for good.<eos> I bribed a merchant marine from Mumbai to let us stow away.<eos> We were supposed to meet him at a café, but he never showed up.<eos> My father did, though.
Listen, Victoria was raped, so whoever set that fire was trying to kill her.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear, I swear...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So do the police.<eos> They do?
I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!
- Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!<eos> Stop telling me the opposite of what I am telling you.<eos> I am too tired for this!<eos> I don't!
Guys, I gotta focus here.<eos> Can I talk to you outside? Sure.<eos> Yeah. Anywhere that's less than 6 feet from the door.<eos> Who knew Victoria had it in her?<eos> Well, I did.
I'm saying that it looks like she was set up.<eos> Margaux... If you happen to know something about Victoria's death, now is the time to speak up.<eos> This is a knee-jerk reaction with you to defend Emily no matter what, even when she kills.<eos> Victoria set her up.<eos> She didn't do it alone.
And that is what makes you dangerous.<eos> Ben, please, listen to me. She is out there.<eos> This one time, I need you to believe me.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But... I don't.
You have been using me this whole time.<eos> I am nothing but a pawn to you.<eos> No, poppet, I love you.<eos> I never wanted to hurt you.<eos> But you did.
No.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you obviously got closer than people knew.<eos> Actually, we didn't.
No, sir.<eos> Uh, understood.<eos> I will, sir.<eos> If you guys work for the USDA, why didn't you just say so?<eos> We don't.
Why?<eos> Why, 'cause he's your buddy now, huh?<eos> He's your pal?<eos> No, because he has... nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he does, Sherlock.
Ow. Yeah. Right there.<eos> I'm ordering a head C.T.<eos> We don't know the extent of his head injury.<eos> She's right.<eos> You don't.
- You ha... you have to.<eos> If you don't, that bag of oxy's not gonna be your last.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna survive this, okay?<eos> Everybody does.
- The Department of Defense said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> They called him a terrorist in order to kill him.<eos> SOC controls the Department of Defense?<eos> Politicians do.
Data centers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's like warehouses, stuck in the middle of nowhere, filled with computers.<eos> And you know where SOC's data center is?<eos> For the right price, I do.
Wondering what they were doing right at that moment.<eos> And that was my dream, Bob.<eos> I wanted to see the world.<eos> Every square inch of it.<eos> But I never did.
- I'm free to go?<eos> I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough. And I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes. I do.
Turn around.<eos> Mommy!<eos> I'm sorry I called you a cunt.<eos> Oh, don't be. It brought us together.<eos> Yeah... it did!
And when I saw the way you looked at me today...<eos> So, if I could just borrow a pen...<eos> I know we haven't known each other very long, but you've already been there for me in ways that no man in my life ever has.<eos> And I find that incredibly sexy.<eos> You do?
All right. I have three rules.<eos> One, listen to the nurses. Respect the nurses.<eos> Do whatever the nurses say.<eos> You may think you know more than the nurses.<eos> You do not.
Stitching requires finesse.<eos> A feel.<eos> And you don't think I have that?<eos> No.<eos> But Camille does?
Tell me where the attack - is going to happen.<eos> - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please. - Sir, please.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
- Yeah, they got the guys.<eos> There was a big shootout at a house in Prenzlauer Berg.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Feels like it's been forever.<eos> Yeah, it does.
It's all a game.<eos> I tell you that I can prove the Nazis are using our science, you-- you don't even blink.<eos> Either one of you.<eos> The Germans-- Germans didn't write any of this, did they?<eos> You did.
Too forgiving.<eos> But she knows that we're here together and she wants to mend fences.<eos> She wants a life with you.<eos> I never had a son, Paul.<eos> But you do.
I should have walked her home, Jim.<eos> She said she was feeling off and I just let her go and...<eos> You know, no one in her family even knew what state she was in.<eos> The Army is probably just gonna tell them that she died a hero.<eos> She did.
What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
That's good enough, Paul.<eos> I hereby declare you a citizen of the United States of America.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> How long did it take him to figure it out?<eos> He didn't.
Are you all right?<eos> Does everyone have to sign in and out here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Fire regulation. We got pulled up on it last year.<eos> - You done it? - Yep.
Sorry, I sound like a bitch but...<eos> Is that why he wanted someone else?<eos> What?<eos> That she's arrogant.<eos> Well, he didn't.
- No. Hell, no.<eos> The sketches never have any endings.<eos> It's a big waste of time, just like searching this alley is.<eos> You know, Javi, I think that you need to find a way to be more positive.<eos> No, I don't.
And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
- Where are you going?<eos> So is it a boy or a girl?<eos> God. Do you know how broken you are?<eos> I know exactly who I am, doctor.<eos> Most people don't.
He needs some sex from a woman.<eos> I don't suppose one of those would be for me.<eos> I don't think you'd want it if it was.<eos> Louis likes six sugars.<eos> Of course he does.
Stanley never complained.<eos> Two days later, they released him.<eos> Stanley went to sleep in our bed that night.<eos> And he never woke up.<eos> (swans) No, he didn't.
She said she had a headache so i gave her a couple aspirin.<eos> Can i see what you gave her, sir?<eos> Course, yeah.<eos> Do you have high blood pressure, sir?<eos> Yeah, i do.
No one from 51 dropped off a regulator, Kelly.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I went to Air Mask and spoke to Jerry.<eos> You never took your regulator in.<eos> - Sure I did. - No. You didn't.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.<eos> If you feel you've reached this number in error... Please. No!<eos> Getaway is such a silly concept, isn't it, Carlito?<eos> Nobody ever asked you to help me, Kate.<eos> Dad did.
The rule here is, it's done here and only here.<eos> It ends when you walk out that door and begins when you walk in.<eos> Our encryption, is the real world.<eos> How do you talk to each other, then?<eos> We don't.
Developed Z-67.<eos> It's a nerve gas.<eos> Unravels their DNA. Basically, turns them inside out.<eos> Where do you keep it?<eos> We don't.
Everything's just going nuts.<eos> You're middle-aged, that's what it is.<eos> No offence.<eos> Everybody middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end.<eos> Never does.
No.<eos> It's not how I was.<eos> My father's dead now, so I've had to... you know.<eos> Can you tell my uncle that I'm here, please, Aunt Leila?<eos> I already did.
- to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
It's OK.<eos> We just want to talk to you.<eos> Seems I have their attention.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Secretaries, accountants, the cleaning staff.<eos> The good people.<eos> Just like your friends.<eos> They don't deserve this.<eos> Just like you didn't.
_<eos> _<eos> - You read Polish, Berger?<eos> - I, uh... just wanted to make sure you heard about the body they found in the woods, Alonso Caro.<eos> I did.
Does anything you see out here, match what you saw in the stitch?<eos> No.<eos> Um, there's someone in the house.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> I did.
T.M.I.<eos> - We're not.<eos> - Let's just do this.<eos> - Look familiar?<eos> - Yeah, this kind of does.
- Kelli is in...<eos> - a small room with cement walls.<eos> - Yes, but did you notice...<eos> - the walls are covered with plastic.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Why don't you email it to me?<eos> No one on the board doubts your commitment to being the face of the company.<eos> Since the article detailing how Max Rager consumers have experienced manic, violent episodes, sales have dropped 30%.<eos> And, of course, there are the lawsuits.<eos> Last year, we did sales of...
I identified the car as that POSSIBLY seen on the night of Stev...<eos> Of Detective Sergeant<eos> Jackie Stevenson's murder... and I pursued the vehicle.<eos> Why didn't you call for backup?<eos> We did.
You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.
How come you're no longer manager of Legia?<eos> How come...<eos> I left because of a... let's just say because of a difference of opinion.<eos> And was this difference of opinion with Victor Arshad?<eos> To do with your connection, to the right-wing followers of the club?
No causes, no activism,<eos> - he's low level.<eos> - Anything to connect him with Arshad?<eos> - Arshad's a ghost. We got nothing on him.<eos> - Yes, we do.
You know me.<eos> I am a gambling man too, Berger.<eos> I am betting on you.<eos> - I believe you can.<eos> - No, you don't.
Cause of death?<eos> - As yet unknown.<eos> - The Hague police are investigating.<eos> But given her message, you would figure the worst.<eos> I do.
That tells us the victim was an alcoholic.<eos> Yeah, it also tells us that Dr. Brennan was right-- it wasn't Booth.<eos> Good catch.<eos> I didn't find it.<eos> Dr. Brennan did.
Bye, Grandma.<eos> Yes, darling.<eos> I love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> What the hell does Rachel do for a living?
Uh, white, white, white, white, half-Asian, then you.<eos> Whoa, so that half-Asian guy, he was kind of a gateway drug to me?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Who knows what will be next?<eos> I do.
Yes<eos> But we can't wait for long<eos> Well, Captain, I'm afraid you'll have to stay as long as you have to stay.<eos> I don't have the authority to make a decision like that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
With Race out of the picture, who will save Dr. Quest?<eos> We can save 'em, if we only knew where they went.<eos> Perhaps those robot creatures left some sort of energy trail.<eos> Ah, I doubt it.<eos> But the Q-sphere does.
We'll bring in Callen.<eos> Good.<eos> I have to tell you-- this feels wrong.<eos> I mean, why doesn't Hetty just trust Callen knows what he's doing?<eos> She does...
- Open the door, Eric!<eos> All right?<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> I looked.<eos> I did.
He signed first.<eos> The news got out pretty fast.<eos> Did you commence the publicity campaign before or after he signed?<eos> - I didn't tell them.<eos> - Then who did?
You always care.<eos> Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> I do.
Betty, where's Phil?<eos> I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired. We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
At first I thought he was drinking again, but then he started, tearing people apart.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> His eyes were all white and crazy.<eos> Looked like a fuckin' monster.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
No.<eos> Haven't seen a guy since we started this dumb hike.<eos> Might be nice to have someone to keep me warm for a night or two.<eos> He's got a girlfriend, though.<eos> Oh, of course he does.
Yeah, yeah, don't shoot the wrong guy, dummies.<eos> Oh, you buyin' this shiny turd?<eos> This is the guy who killed Fisher.<eos> Come on, take him out!<eos> I did not!
You're not allowed to fail, Captain.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command.<eos> The Semite I brought in, the one who shot at me, did you manage to locate any members of his family?<eos> Yes. Yes, we did.
Yet you seem of better spirit.<eos> I am.<eos> When you see your healer again, will you share my gratitude for her kindness?<eos> Her remedy served you, then?<eos> Yes, it did.
Yea.<eos> Gawain Maddox.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know your name.<eos> This is true.<eos> You do not.
Glad to see you're still with us.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do you have any idea who shot you?<eos> Did you see their face?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
Whoever framed me staged my apartment to look like I built a bomb, but they left that behind.<eos> I'll never forget how you handled that bomb at Quantico.<eos> Ultimately, it didn't matter, did it?<eos> Everybody got to see the real me... and didn't really like what they saw, did they?<eos> I did.
What's the file in your... none of your business.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
When the FBI loses, it's different than a loss for other people.<eos> It means more when the stakes are so high, so we don't like to call it a loss.<eos> We just don't want to look at it that way.<eos> You don't think it's wrong to not admit defeat, not accept your weaknesses?<eos> Oh, yeah. I do.
I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
Well, this is highly irregular.<eos> But within the rules.<eos> Mr. Kane, my name is Mr. Johnson.<eos> The next thing I'm about to say to you you're not going to believe.<eos> Most people don't.
Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
Hey.<eos> What was your name again?<eos> Anwar.<eos> I didn't know you came to places like this.<eos> I don't.
It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
You're nothing to anyone, to everyone.<eos> Think about it, Bill.<eos> 'Cause if you do, if you let yourself... You'll know I'm telling you the truth.<eos> So instead of wasting any more of my time, I need you to go call someone that matters, because, Bill...<eos> You don't.
That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
You should be helping him, not hunting him.<eos> Help him kill people...<eos> 'cause, sure, that makes sense.<eos> Do you think he likes doing what he's doing?<eos> He doesn't.
The court is in need of service.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He said thank you, maiden.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Scouts, trackers.<eos> We will leave with the sunrise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Does Maddox know about the boy?<eos> He does not.
We'll be heroes.<eos> I never cared to be a hero.<eos> I just wanted a... quiet, simple life.<eos> Which is what we had.<eos> Yes, we did.
That Mr Blake defended the girl, told him to leave her alone because he was using her.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I thought she was the courier you had told me about, sir.<eos> And did Major Klemm tell you how important it is not to leave anything out of this account, Joe?<eos> Yes, sir, he did.
One where we get in and out without security even knowing we're there.<eos> - And how do you propose that?<eos> - We have a secret weapon.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - We do.
You could have buried them right there in your yard.<eos> Tell us, Mr. Murillo, when the New Jersey police search your home, will they find two graves?<eos> Say they do.<eos> It was self-defense, you said it yourself.<eos> I did, I did.
- Does it hurt?<eos> Phantom pain.<eos> The thing that's missing is the thing that you feel the most.<eos> - Makes it hard to forget.<eos> - So maybe you don't.
I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
- What, a trip to Hawaii?<eos> - No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.
Hi.<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> I don't know quite how to say this--<eos> I'm fired.<eos> But clearly you do.
- And the only were we can do that...<eos> - You seriously think that it was me?<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Nobody does!
At this stage, only suspicion.<eos> Do you have any idea how or why Colonel Wegener fled from his hotel?<eos> I'm sure that there's an innocent explanation.<eos> Yesterday you issued a diplomatic visa.<eos> Yes, I did.
But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh... I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did, Frank.
The whole world saw that message.<eos> The mighty Thor bound and captive.<eos> The humans will now fall into line.<eos> I can't believe we pulled it off.<eos> Of course we did.
Falcon!<eos> Off me, beasts!<eos> This alien atmosphere must be playing tricks on my hearing.<eos> - Sounded like Falcon said "Thanos."<eos> - I did.
Good?<eos> What's it matter?<eos> What's the point? Come on, man.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> I do.
Good for you.<eos> Were they authorized or not?<eos> I swear to God I didn't do one thing they don't know about.<eos> And let me guess, you don't have any proof?<eos> No, I don't.
HARVEY: Here's the problem, Sam.<eos> Why should I believe you, when the last time we met you were the one who was willing to put an innocent person away?<eos> Because I didn't know she was innocent.<eos> And the truth is I didn't care.<eos> But you did.
Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.<eos> Does it have something to do with the fact that you've been having panic attacks and that she's your therapist?<eos> Because if it does...
Oh, God damn it, you're not doing me a favor.<eos> You're helping your patient, the one you said you went to see three different lawyers to keep from betraying.<eos> And if you hadn't betrayed me, you wouldn't be in this position right now.<eos> What do you want me to say'? I'm sorry?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I scheduled an appointment to give you these.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> They're from Sam Tull.<eos> Did you get me anything?<eos> I did.
They've been sending people over for centuries.<eos> - Sacrifices.<eos> - Their real agenda is to find the creature and bring it back.<eos> Ward found a way to bring it back?<eos> No. I did.
You just called me by my name!<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!
What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!<eos> Now you're just being silly.<eos> Of course you do.
"Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did. The ancients. The poets.
You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?<eos> Uh, no, thanks.<eos> Um, I will have...<eos> I'll have a burger, please.<eos> Oh, we don't...
I don't think Darren realizes this, and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.<eos> So, what do you want from me?<eos> Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
He's baiting you.<eos> We have to call it off.<eos> We're all taking risks.<eos> What if he saw me here?<eos> He didn't.
It's about damn time.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> This would have been a lot easier a week ago.<eos> - If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.<eos> Even if he did...
Except...<eos> Except we'd have a general with no army.<eos> Jamal controls the treasury.<eos> I have no way to pay Solomon's soldiers.<eos> I do.
You have nothing to feel guilty for.<eos> But the guilt that you hadn't made you paranoid.<eos> It blinded you and turned you against your own family.<eos> Rami didn't kill your mother.<eos> The Caliphate did.
Infidels are on their way.<eos> Call up the reserves. Get every man on the parapet, and patrol every hall.<eos> And, you, give me your helm.<eos> The ladle and the caldron have special protection spells.<eos> This helmet and our friends do not.
No.<eos> You will hand it over now, or I unleash Merlin.<eos> Emma, please.<eos> I don't want to fight you.<eos> No, but I do.
It's a good thing I happen to have some then.<eos> What?<eos> You've got magic?<eos> No.<eos> My hook does.
There's one lesson I didn't teach you the last time we were here.<eos> A true warrior doesn't let anything hurt them.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Next lesson, you never leave your flank open.<eos> I didn't.
I need to see for myself what they will or won't do.<eos> And you still want to counter.<eos> I want to at least try.<eos> Except you don't want to go by yourself, you want me to go with you.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm talking about you going behind my back to Arcadian. - I didn't do that.<eos> - Oh, you expect me to believe that after all the shit you told me the last time I saw you?<eos> You can believe it or not, but I'm telling you I didn't do anything.<eos> Then who did?<eos> - I did.
Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.<eos> Cait, come on, I mean,<eos> Jax could be our last chance at saving Professor Stein.<eos> He said no to being a superhero.<eos> Who does that?
He said he knew my dad?<eos> Yeah, they used to run in the same circle.<eos> - What was that thing you gave him?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
I'm going across. Doc.<eos> You won't make it.<eos> We have to get him.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
But I also know that no matter what... we're gonna be fine.<eos> No fight is ever gonna keep us apart again.<eos> So, what do you want to do?<eos> You want to talk to him?<eos> I do.
None yet.<eos> This dragon is more than strong. It's fast, it's smart and it's elusive.<eos> We've never even gotten a good look at it.<eos> This does seem like quite the challenge, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
I lied to you because to get them to believe they were illegal, I had to get them to believe they were real. (CHUCKLES)<eos> And you needed me to be pissed to help you do that.<eos> Told you to trust me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
Now, these are your options.<eos> Medical issues, family emergency, you're just not ready.<eos> Whatever it is, you simply cannot accept a junior partnership at this time.<eos> Jessica, no one turns down partner.<eos> Well, they do now.
You're right, Johann.<eos> But it's worse than that. Oh, ho-ho, you're full of good news, aren't you?<eos> Gimme that.<eos> So, this means we get to go rescue him, I suppose.<eos> It does.
Oh!<eos> I mean, uh [clears throat] i-if i --<eos> If i stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh...<eos> Oh, no. It doesn't.
But they may also come through you, Marcellus.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hoped I was wrong, Lucien...<eos> I really did...
Pants!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Thanks, kids.<eos> You figured it out.<eos> Well, summer did.
- Then he'd come for me.<eos> Confirm the kill and bring me home.<eos> - Why do you want to know?<eos> - Because I want to find him.<eos> You really don't.
He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.<eos> The next time, that could be you or Iris.<eos> I'm just wondering if going after him now is premature.<eos> I mean, we barely know anything about his abilities.<eos> Wells does.
Took away my whole life.<eos> And I can't do anything.<eos> I got you a coffee and a tea this morning.<eos> Which would you prefer?<eos> - I don't...
Better than me, certainly. Ah.<eos> I seem to recall.<eos> Still, it hasn't inhibited your advancement, has it?<eos> The Führer places great faith in you, John, to collect these films of his.<eos> Yes, he does.
Juliana.<eos> Frank's a lucky guy.<eos> What's that cop doing out there?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> Nothing to do with me.
Lenya!<eos> Well, she seems fine.<eos> She is, I'm the one that's a basket case.<eos> Did you talk to my sister?<eos> Yeah, I did.
No!<eos> I know exactly what you're doing.<eos> I just want you to take your pills like we agreed.<eos> - "Like we agreed."<eos> - Yeah, we did.
They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
They've been looking for you anyway...<eos> I imagine to discuss your recent adventures in Lebanon.<eos> I don't know who I can trust there.<eos> But you trust me.<eos> Peter Quinn does.
I thought I'd go in and get a head start on the OpSec review.<eos> Don't forget your bag.<eos> What if he doesn't get better?<eos> He will.<eos> What if he doesn't?
How the hell do you think I am?<eos> Oh, I think you should be satisfied.<eos> Look. All went as planned.<eos> Ticktock... all is good.<eos> It did not.
Another coincidence, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm sure you can see how this looks from where I'm standing.<eos> We didn't do it, Saul.<eos> We didn't murder the general you never met to discuss the coup that you weren't planning.<eos> Well, somebody did.
- Me, too.<eos> Je suis Gabe H. Coud. Je suis Gabe H. Coud!<eos> Je suis Gabe H. Coud!<eos> Do you guys speak English?<eos> I do.
You sure it was him?<eos> Up so close I could smell his cologne.<eos> Imagine my surprise learning you were here in Berlin.<eos> I assumed you knew.<eos> I didn't.
That everyone had to live by.<eos> Rich and poor.<eos> Even the king.<eos> You said yesterday that you had something urgent to tell us.<eos> I do.
Everyone's furious at you.<eos> Including you?<eos> Including me.<eos> I take it you never heard from Carrie.<eos> No, I never did.
You will never be fully trusted. And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
That was Ray's. I mean... Mr. Palmer's.<eos> I mean, this has code that's like identical to what you have on the phone.<eos> I mean, the question is, why is Mr. Palmer's prototype OS sending you texts on your phone?<eos> Ray must have connected the prototype's computer to the company's local area network.<eos> It did!
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?<eos> You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug?<eos> That's right.<eos> - You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
But you said to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.<eos> Well, now I'm saying something different, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> We don't want a generation of entitled, pudgy kids, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
What was the search for?<eos> The document it uncovered was a just-declassified electronic memo, heavily redacted.<eos> From what I could tell, it detailed a meeting between a federal official of some kind and senator William Bracken.<eos> When I started at the A.G.'S office, I ran a keyword search, hunting for criminality connected to Bracken, and I never got a hit.<eos> Well, yesterday, you did.
Then why didn't you tell me about Thea seven months ago?<eos> Because you don't see me as an equal.<eos> What? Oh, come on.<eos> Laurel, of course I see you as an equal.<eos> No, you don't!
Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him, Mr. Allen.<eos> No one does.
You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know that you're being reckless.<eos> And I'm sure the people in your life care enough about you to not want to see you get hurt.<eos> Except Mardon didn't kill my father.<eos> I did.
And I'm the only one who knows where she is.<eos> She has Caroline, she has Elena.<eos> This is her plan.<eos> Then we don't let her fracture us.<eos> Or we do.
He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
I'm just saying, when a guy's willing to let another guy die so his girl can live, there's usually something, chk, cooking in the kitchen.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I am not willing to let Matt die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you just did, brother.
You and I fight...<eos> While her and her family of freaks live in our house, getting closer and closer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then we don't let her fracture us.<eos> Or we do.
Come on.<eos> Do it, Lily.<eos> You're wrong about so many things.<eos> I never had the courage to tell you before...<eos> But I do now.
Staked your ex, drowned by Nik's. You two need a lesson in women.<eos> Could the lesson not be yours to learn, Rebekah?<eos> Didn't you damn one of them to eternity, viciously antagonize the other?<eos> Those lunatics actually believe the prophecy.<eos> You don't, do you?
Is she right?<eos> Do you see me as this fragile thing that needs to be kept behind glass to protect me from Aurora...<eos> Please.<eos> When I think of all the ways she could have hurt you...<eos> She didn't. Klaus, she didn't...
Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.<eos> She did?<eos> But that's my thing.<eos> I always do my "are you a leg man or a breast man" joke.<eos> Aunt Karen did that, too.
More often, they are not.<eos> But they happen because Father is an influence peddler par excellence.<eos> And if he says he can restore us, he means it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I did not.
No!<eos> No!<eos> You gambled.<eos> If it had worked, you'd be a hero.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
Figure his old man should have it.<eos> I'll bring it to him.<eos> Nah. This one's on me.<eos> You can't think that's a good idea.<eos> - I don't.
He's been through a lot.<eos> Yes.<eos> We all have.<eos> You still have me, Favi.<eos> That I do, Andina.
Yes.<eos> We all have.<eos> You still have me, Favi.<eos> That I do, Andina.<eos> That I do.
Chavez is dead.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, man, Nick, you didn't...<eos> No, I didn't kill her.<eos> Well, who did?
Thanks, uh, but I need a little bit of help.<eos> Can you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Got anything on Wemlinger?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
You didn't know, did you?<eos> How smart he was?<eos> I knew.<eos> But not really.<eos> Not in the way you did, no.
I can't believe that sentence makes sense.<eos> Okay, you got to go.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I believe in you;<eos> the whole team does.
Well, we are right and they are mistaken.<eos> Osbert, we are blessed.<eos> I should make you swear on St. Cuthbert's comb never to mention the likes of wooden again.<eos> But what if I had a hound called wooden?<eos> - What if I did?
Father Beocca.<eos> My goodness.<eos> You know this assling, Father?<eos> I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
But that... that guy, there... that is something you don't have to worry about.<eos> - You're right. - Yeah.<eos> - You're always right.<eos> - You always know how to make me feel better.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Am I not perky enough for you?<eos> You've been looking at me like I'm some sort of psycho!<eos> Oh, do you think she might try something?<eos> - I didn't think you could hear me.<eos> - Well, sweetheart, I did.
- That's not necessary.<eos> - Look, I want to. I want to.<eos> I lost my dad when I was 12... and I know what it was like to me and for my mother.<eos> I wanna help you.<eos> I do.
That is great.<eos> Awesome, Nicole.<eos> It's gonna be a lot of work, but it'll really raise our profile.<eos> And, Ryan, they loved your work And they want you to do the photography.<eos> Of course they did, terrific.
I'm fine.<eos> Ok.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ryan wants to take you and me out tonight to Lombardi's for a special dinner.<eos> - He does?
Wait a minute.<eos> Slow, slow.<eos> Do you use the regular alphabet here?<eos> A-B-C-D-E-F-G?<eos> Yes, we do.
Uh, thank you for letting me get Michelle today.<eos> Family comes first.<eos> Yeah, I-I... thought I had it all under control.<eos> I, um...<eos> I don't.
I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself. But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine. You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
And we would have done the same thing. We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
They just were looking into each other's eyes, into each other's soul.<eos> I have never seen such courage.<eos> I was watching people and wondering, "When will they run?"<eos> And I'd understand, if they did.<eos> But they didn't.
No! What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No, she didn't!
And these traits manifested very early.<eos> I think his parents knew by the time he was four or five that he was very special.<eos> His mother gave him a telescope when he was young, and he looked at the moon and said, "I want to go there.<eos> I want to build the machine that will go to the moon."<eos> And of course he did half a century later.
Where is he?<eos> - Nice trick.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're a hit at parties.<eos> - So... you think you're ready.<eos> - I do.
How about we were supposed to be layin' low, Les.<eos> How about-- who the hell died and made you the boss, man?<eos> As I remember, you were out making a Booty call. Hey!<eos> She ain't got nothin' to do with this.<eos> The hell she don't.
Mama, can I play on your phone?<eos> Oh, baby, mama forgot it.<eos> We're gonna get you something to eat soon, I promise.<eos> He needs to eat.<eos> We all do.
I can't seem to figure out what these two people have in common.<eos> They're both my patients.<eos> But oddly enough, neither one of them got the meds that you ordered for them three days ago. Then maybe you should talking to the nursing staff.<eos> They never got the order because the patients didn't need the meds.<eos> Sarah Lippman did.
So, what are we gonna do?<eos> I'll let you know. But I'll tell you this.<eos> If they want a war, they got a war.<eos> Hey, Rach, do you have that Neilson brief for Louis from last month?<eos> No, I don't.
I won't lie for them.<eos> Lie?<eos> No.<eos> We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed. No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now?<eos> Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
What do you think?<eos> Shall we try this one together?<eos> Make your point, Ms. Rothlo.<eos> You killed your husband on your own, didn't you, Ms. Keating?<eos> - No, I did not.
Excuse me.<eos> Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Reade and Zapata are en route.<eos> MWA?<eos> Municipal Workers Association.<eos> So, what, two gunmen five minutes ago, NYPD called us already?<eos> No, they didn't.
Maybe, but it might lead a reasonable person to think that you supplied her with the passport.<eos> If I was going to get her out of the country, she'd be out of the country.<eos> That's what I told them.<eos> And they still insist on an interview.<eos> Yes, they do.
Her husband was having an affair with a Chinese man, and I suspect that they're trying to recruit him and turned the screws by threatening to arrest his wife, which they've now fucking done.<eos> All of which you should know from your own fucking assets, but don't!<eos> Who took the snaps?<eos> I think that's it for tonight.<eos> Do you really?
Can I help you?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan Scully.<eos> And I bet you don't believe any of this alien exodus crap either do you?<eos> No, we don't.
Feeling no pain, doc.<eos> In fact, I'm gonna refer all my patients to you.<eos> Hey, you wanna see something over here?<eos> Are they talking to you too?<eos> They always do.
I see.<eos> Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
A therapist is probably the only one who knows.<eos> She sees some, uh... uh, Doctor Linda in... in Beverly Hills.<eos> Saw her like five times a week on the DL.<eos> Used a fake name, everything.<eos> Oh, did she now?
Please. Come on. I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
Come on, honey.<eos> Bye Lucifer, it was nice meeting you.<eos> Hmph!<eos> Think she likes you.<eos> Course she does.
L-low come'?<eos> Because they weren't professional killers.<eos> Sir, it's simple if a father sees his daughter's dead body will he cry standing outside the room or run to hug her?<eos> Has your daughter died? Do you know what it feels like to lose a child?<eos> And you do?
If something happens to me, I want you to have my adorable sweaters.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Chin up, guys!<eos> - We don't have chins.<eos> - Sure we do.
How could you not wake me up?<eos> What are you doing up so early?<eos> Oh, nothing, just going through this old box of stuff.<eos> Does that have something to do with you seeing Trevor last night?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Scottie.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out the long distance thing.<eos> All I can tell you there is, if she's the one, you'll know, just like with me and your mother.<eos> So you didn't tell him?<eos> No, I didn't.
That would have completely screwed up my life.<eos> Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.<eos> You want to know what kind of man I am?<eos> You wanted to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, I did.
Her only request was that we use some of it to buy this bookcase to keep these books together.<eos> They're my father's books.<eos> And your mother's.<eos> I never knew why she did it.<eos> And now I do.
All these details are posted to my blog, and I'll continue posting updates.<eos> It's Brukner.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I thought you fixed this guy's wagon months ago.<eos> I did.
Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Does he?
Have a seat.<eos> I'll start with the obvious.<eos> Do you know Morpheus' identity?<eos> No.<eos> Nobody does.
The mother and child died in the overheated car.<eos> And that was Morpheus' first piece of art in Detroit, the one that she used her half of the blanket in.<eos> Garcia. Yes, sir.<eos> Of all the women on your list, did any lose a child?<eos> Uh, 3 did.
William, please listen to me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> No. I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
When were these taken?<eos> Six months ago.<eos> Bannerman deleted them after he met Chloe Robertson.<eos> I take it Agent Miller didn't tell you about this relationship?<eos> No, she did not.
You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones.<eos> - Whatever those are.<eos> - One, two, three, four!<eos> - He bought it.<eos> - Yes, he did.
If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might have gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.<eos> Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear. - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Evidence room.<eos> Yeah, this is Captain Beckett.<eos> Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case? Hang on.<eos> Let me check. Yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Yes, we do.
I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't?
- Um, how you doing?<eos> - Handling.<eos> Digital called, sounds like you are, too.<eos> - That guy knows Superman, right?<eos> - Yes, he does.
I read your file.<eos> Your parents were doctors who developed vaccines against bio-weapons.<eos> They worked for the government.<eos> They didn't see it as the enemy.<eos> No, they didn't.
But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
It was fun hanging out with you.<eos> - Bye, Kara.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Mom, Kara and I had an epic Nerf gun battle...<eos> Yeah, we did.
Like I told you-- Penn's a guy who's written about the NSA, the FBI, the IRS and all other alphabet agencies that make men tremble.<eos> So you can't get in.<eos> Dude, his encryptions got encryptions.<eos> But once that agave and this saturated fat lubricates the thinkanator-- oh, I'll get there.<eos> I always do.
Just a little bit.<eos> I haven't had a first date since...<eos> Watergate.<eos> Do you have an opening line?<eos> I do. Um...
Nothing, just...<eos> a T-shirt.<eos> You are not part of Scorpion.<eos> But I live here.<eos> So does a possum in the rafters.
They're basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat.<eos> Let's hope the lug nut expands.<eos> What if that burning food attracts animals?<eos> We have plenty of food for the animals.<eos> We do? WOLOWITZ:
I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
Bring the generals, and I'll bring Ukraine.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Well, Mike B's furious.<eos> He saw the picture, too?<eos> Of course he did.
And if you have orange in your skin, you have to stay away from anything in the pink family.<eos> Okay.<eos> You don't have boxy shoulders or orange skin, so.<eos> Did you know that our daughter knows all this stuff?<eos> I didn't.
I am.<eos> Heard a lot about you, Cayman.<eos> Can't say it's nice to meet you though. What do you want?<eos> I want you to tell the truth.<eos> Just like Matt Hildebrandt did. Security breach!
I know what it's like. To obsess. You don't know the first thing.<eos> I know everything.<eos> My whole life, all I've seen are people making the same decisions that you're about to make.<eos> And it doesn't help.<eos> It never does.
That's not gonna happen, Agent Ryan.<eos> Department policy.<eos> We don't release any information, to anyone, until we complete our internal review.<eos> Uh, Chief Richards, look, we-we all want the same thing here, the truth.<eos> Do we?
El Murfi isn't worth a damn if he's dead.<eos> Now back off!<eos> Just want to make sure he's the real Murphy.<eos> You wanna see the scars?<eos> I do.
Kurian.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> So this is where the Zeros took you.<eos> I thought they were gonna kill you.<eos> Glad they didn't.
Take them where, do you think?<eos> Somewhere without zombies.<eos> And where's that?<eos> You have zombies here.<eos> Sure, we do.
Well congratulations.<eos> All those Zeros out there, all the ones I just vaccinated, they're under your control now.<eos> They're your new army.<eos> Well then the plan worked.<eos> No, it didn't.
(Laughs) I never thought about that.<eos> It was hectic, man, or I did, I had to--<eos> (Rolls tongue, imitates peeing)<eos> Did you ever wash your hands though between?<eos> I still don't.
I lived it up every night at bars and clubs.<eos> I lost everything gambling and got into debt.<eos> I had you pay my debts.<eos> But now I wonder... If I did the right thing.<eos> I did, though.
How can you not remember?<eos> Your cousins came over once.<eos> You wouldn't let them play with your toys.<eos> - I told you then, remember?<eos> - No, you didn't, Mom.
I told him my troubles.<eos> He took me on and trained me.<eos> I began to perform every night.<eos> I hoped she might turn up and see me.<eos> But she never did.
The only thing I had... The only place I didn't feel alone was my car...<eos> Midnight Minx.<eos> And they took her from me because of you.<eos> So don't come with me, pal.<eos> Just don't.
702 is a Vegas number.<eos> I think someone wants you to call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought we had no more business together.<eos> We don't.
Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
I heard a whip-poor-will.<eos> It's a local bird that makes its call - just around sunset.<eos> - That gives us until tomorrow night, at least.<eos> - Or it already happened.<eos> - It didn't.
I'd keep it. Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
I hope the two of you haven't been waiting long.<eos> We were well attended to.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was worried something happened when you left so suddenly the other night.<eos> Something did.
New partner?<eos> Oh, I'm jealous.<eos> We're here on business.<eos> Well, I thought you just missed me.<eos> I do.
Like Binetex.<eos> Exactly like Binetex, actually.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I just don't understand why Sam would protect some guy that may have killed three people.<eos> I don't.
Exactly like Binetex, actually.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I just don't understand why Sam would protect some guy that may have killed three people.<eos> I don't.<eos> I do.
Well, if that information came from inside NCIS, it's more than just troubling.<eos> - Oh, of course, I agree.<eos> - There's a good chance the mole we apprehended last year gave up this information before we got him.<eos> And we still don't know who he was working for?<eos> We don't.
We found equipment that ties you to four different bombings.<eos> That's just at a glance.<eos> You're Taurus, and you're going to jail for the rest of your life.<eos> The only choice you have left is whether or not you want to cooperate with us.<eos> And if I do?
So, I guess you know Meisner.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be alive.<eos> Did he tell you anything about me?<eos> He didn't, no.
How was that?<eos> Was that all right?<eos> It was great. Just what we need.<eos> You don't need me to do another one?<eos> Actually, I do.
My life is over after Sunny left.<eos> I have cut off from everyone.<eos> Just from home to shop, shop to home.<eos> You have a picture of Nicky?<eos> Yes, I do.
The aggregation of dust particles And general preservation of space Suggests our killer is somehow stuck in time.<eos> Steve: Yeah, it's like he's dedicated this room As a memorial of some kind.<eos> Perhaps for a woman who once lived here with him.<eos> Max: She looks like one of our victims.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Turns out that you grew up down the road from the fish farm where Nesbit's body was dumped.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So I threw his body in the pond, but after his organs were properly distributed.<eos> Are you still claiming that you didn't kill him?<eos> Of course I didn't.
Thank you.<eos> So should I say it now or later?<eos> Fine.<eos> You told me so.<eos> I did, didn't I?
I don't want the kids to wake up.<eos> You want to take the box?<eos> No, I tell you what, why don't we just leave it here so she can visit her brother in the morning.<eos> Girl really loves her brother, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
Who wouldn't get excited seeing that bella faccia?<eos> I think he wants to see you.<eos> You know, studies have shown that babies begin exhibiting cognizable nonverbal communication within days of birth.<eos> And some things never change. Yeah.<eos> And some things do,
Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
Because you can't legally marry your own reflection?<eos> Burn.<eos> Your real estate agent caught the man who killed Taylor going through your drawers at your open house.<eos> Seems weird, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Because he's in advertising.<eos> Yeah, well, I hope the second thing I need to know is something I need to know.<eos> Yeah, Fozzie asked me to remind you to read the sketch he wrote for the show.<eos> I already read it.<eos> I did, too.
I got her slippers with headlights so she can have her midnight snack in safety.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, raise your hand if you have Yolanda.<eos> I did.
Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that..<eos> She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
Chip, just close the laptop.<eos> But then I don't know what to do with my eyes.<eos> Well, what about a bag of socks?<eos> They're cheap, and if she hates them and throws them at you, it's not gonna hurt...<eos> - Like that scale did.
Faster!<eos> - [Chuckles] - Oh, I love it!<eos> Oh, Kermit!<eos> Oh, and this jewelry box even smells like home.<eos> Oh, well, of course it does.
Great.<eos> O-okay, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye.<eos> She said yes.<eos> Of course she did.
He initiated it.<eos> We meet him later today.<eos> In the meantime, Aram gave me a name, a gunsmith who makes Wendigo's weapons.<eos> The feds don't know how to find him.<eos> But I do.
Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.<eos> My mom was innocent.<eos> I lost my mom when I was a little girl.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> You don't.
You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.
You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.<eos> Tonight he does.
You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
Well, not personally.<eos> That's the question.<eos> Did you leak a video of Ms. Locke?<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
I would make a terrible president.<eos> Which is precisely why you shouldn't quit.<eos> The people in this town who worry me sick, who make me fear for the survival of this democracy, are the ones who think they'd be great presidents.<eos> They are so loaded up on megadoses of hubris that they don't recognize that it's the most humbling job in the world.<eos> But you do.
That bastard.<eos> What's all this?<eos> I've got it.<eos> -I'll do it.<eos> -I'll do it.
They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
I'll meet you three on the command deck.<eos> Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> Did you know there was more than one?<eos> No, I didn't.
Can't say, henry.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, We all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
Don't you think we should turn this over to another team?<eos> What for?<eos> Because if things get sticky, you and I both know that you're gonna do whatever it takes to protect him.<eos> You think you know everything, DiNozzo.<eos> You don't.
It's called "The Octopus"...<eos> Dominic's favorite position...<eos> mine, too... except Dominic also liked to get slapped in the face during it.<eos> Uh, how does this help Tanya's case?<eos> It doesn't.
Why?<eos> So you could kill him.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - You think the prosecution doesn't have evidence against you?<eos> Neither did I until now.
"Rita Applegate."<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Well, I should, uh, I should probably get back to work.<eos> Oh, so I see you got your problem with your Internet fixed?<eos> Yeah, I did.
It's almost too easy.<eos> I'm pushing the DA to extradite, but it's a long shot.<eos> I'm sure they were guns for hire.<eos> Enjoying some classic Calvin?<eos> Doing some homework.
I mean, really?<eos> You ever hear of privacy?<eos> Hey, you want privacy, close your door.<eos> Thought we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did, Dean.
You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
No.<eos> I mean, from here.<eos> All this.<eos> The hunting life.<eos> Do you?
Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
Well, let's just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.
If this kid is a monster and we set him...<eos> Deputy, can I please just get back to doing my job?<eos> Please.<eos> Just tell me you have a handle on this.<eos> I don't, actually.
Okay?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man. She does.
It's fine, and... it's kind of true.<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> That's how people get in your head.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Actually, uh, I do.
It felt like some horrible dream.<eos> These are children.<eos> It is my job to be an adult, and I take that job very seriously.<eos> Did you tell the school what happened?<eos> I did.
I need you to stall.<eos> See, that right there, that's where I get lost.<eos> I've got zero, zippo, nada to do with these negotiations other than cheering them on from the sideline...<eos> If you were to let it slip that you had reservations about the treaty...<eos> But I don't.
I've got zero, zippo, nada to do with these negotiations other than cheering them on from the sideline...<eos> If you were to let it slip that you had reservations about the treaty...<eos> But I don't.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President...<eos> But if you did.
I certainly wouldn't voice them publicly.<eos> But if you did voice them publicly, that might slow things down, give us time to verify the Intel.<eos> You want me to put my foot in my mouth?<eos> Yes, Susan.<eos> I do.
Have you ever looked someone in the eye and made them think you loved them?<eos> Really truly loved them so you could take whatever it is you needed from them?<eos> I believe him.<eos> My gut says he's telling the truth.<eos> Of course it does.
But by making that money discretionary, You give the people in this room the power to say,<eos> "you know what?<eos> We're a little over budget this year.<eos> How about we don't give that little ladies' organization The full amount they're asking for?"<eos> So you don't.
Mellie -- that's what she said.<eos> I hate that you're always right.<eos> Me too.<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
And that's why I'm here?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> I got this job a month after my father died.<eos> You must've made the connection.<eos> Sure, I did.
What's the trickiest part of a partial nephrectomy?<eos> Well, I think it's essential that... not you...<eos> Blake. Mobilizing the colon quickly to get adequate exposure of the kidney.<eos> By your third year, you should know this surgery inside and out.<eos> I do.
Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have to believe that.<eos> They say he doesn't give you more than you can handle. [ Chuckles ]<eos> You say that, actually. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Yes, I do.
That is what we needed.<eos> Under there, that's... That is a hand!<eos> We got a hand, people!<eos> I can't friggin' believe it.<eos> I did.
She protected me, and I'm ashamed of that.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> I made a mess.<eos> And for as much pain as I caused and felt, I would have never believed that anything good would have come of it.<eos> But it did.
It was a mess.<eos> I made a mess.<eos> And for as much pain as I caused and felt, I would have never believed that anything good would have come of it.<eos> But it did.<eos> She did.
Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at.<eos> The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
Oh, it looks like Angela got us access to Ross's league.<eos> That's gonna be tons of information we're gonna have to go through.<eos> Lots of transaction logs, e-mails; not to mention, all the trash talking on the message boards.<eos> Oh, I love a good trash talking.<eos> Of course you do.
- Dad, just listen to me.<eos> - No, you just admitted that you knowingly withheld material evidence in an ongoing murder investigation.<eos> - Please, let me explain. - Shh!<eos> Quiet, quiet.<eos> Who did it, Asher?
And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
Frank called me that night, but only to use my storage locker, so I gave him the key.<eos> I don't see a way out of this.<eos> It's going to work.<eos> Asher's not going to testify.<eos> But what if he does?
Eli matchett.<eos> - He's gone.<eos> - Gone where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.
A seed immune to the devastating scourge, and available, of course, at a much higher price.<eos> You can't prove that.<eos> Oh, but I can.<eos> I know about the Genesis project.<eos> By now, so do the FBI.
You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Why stage the crime scene?<eos> - I exaggerated it.<eos> - Why? Because I knew no one would believe me.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do.
Sinclair leaked this.<eos> She leaked a name to scare you.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> But you said you'd handle her.<eos> I did.
- You mean kill her?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> So Catherine ran over Sinclair here. That's our story.<eos> Our story doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
I called him because I was worried about her.<eos> - He decided to cover it up.<eos> - And you let him.<eos> And now she thinks about it every day, what you didn't do, while you get to live your life without even thinking about her.<eos> I do.
You'd be disbarred, or, worse, be sent to prison?<eos> I take the fifth.<eos> Mr. Nelson, I want to be sure<eos> - that you know what you're doing.<eos> - I do, your honor.
Elijah, I returned your card to you.<eos> Why would I do that if I was gonna steal your money?<eos> Did you find any evidence that I made those purchases?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't do it, Elijah.
Let's eat at home, alright?<eos> Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.
Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> She definitely does!
He was always very active, very active kid.<eos> Probably had a touch of ADHD, but, uh,<eos> Just had to channel that. He was always in sports.<eos> So he was always very structured. Kept him busy doing things around the house... either that,<eos> Or doing sports.
I checked out this former employee,<eos> Bobby Boles, Bobby being short for Robert,<eos> Robert maybe being our mad scientist.<eos> Did Robert Boles ever go to medical school?<eos> Yeah, he totally did.
About time someone does.<eos> This was not an accident.<eos> Somebody cut the gate over there.<eos> Saw that.<eos> Did a hatchet job on the cables.
Yeah, this would have happened during his transplant surgery.<eos> Mm-hmm. Karev chose the right twin.<eos> Another clamp.<eos> Got it. You did it?<eos> You did it.
- Yes.<eos> He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.<eos> I'd rather go with you.<eos> I wouldn't know where to go.<eos> Tom does.
I can try to hack the elevator, get in electronically.<eos> No, we don't have time for that.<eos> We're gonna get to Tristan the same way he got to Isabel-- over the Internet.<eos> Please, you don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Isabel would not want this for you.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You don't know what she would have wanted!<eos> You didn't know her like I did!<eos> No one did. RYAN:
Hey.<eos> Oh, we had sex?<eos> We had sex.<eos> Yeah, we had so much sex.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Blomfeld showed up at Wally's.<eos> Dash was there.<eos> How?<eos> - How did he find him?<eos> - He didn't.
Then deeper tissues.<eos> Her immune system will do the rest.<eos> Biology is so deliciously messy.<eos> How do we stop it?<eos> You don't.
Oh, yes.<eos> The withered knob of that sad old man.<eos> Uh, if memory serves, the last time you tried to use it, you weren't powerful enough to make it work.<eos> If my memory serves... last time, I didn't believe in myself.<eos> But now I do, as does everyone in this town.
Come on, Detective.<eos> We both know you got nothing.<eos> Monica didn't talk.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> She didn't.
If we're gonna give this any kind of a shot, we can't stay here.<eos> We leave everything behind, make a clean break.<eos> I want to.<eos> And I want to believe you.<eos> Please do.
Can you account for them?<eos> You're wasting your time. Look, nobody on my team would let some thin-skinned ex-con or his wide-eyed little brother get in the way of a $50 million payout against Manny Garcia next year.<eos> We're way too smart for that.<eos> You're acting like the kid doesn't stand a chance.<eos> He doesn't.
And you know the rest.<eos> They were married for 60 years, had five children, plenty of grandchildren.<eos> I want the same for us, Kono.<eos> You just have to believe.<eos> I do.
- with his version of the hula dance.<eos> - Five! It's this type of brazen behavior that fans here were hoping Luke Nakano would put to an end tonight. Six!<eos> Nakano is back up on his feet!<eos> The referee checks him to see if he wants to continue.<eos> He does.
Said he... promised to make things right.<eos> Things can't ever be made right.<eos> That's when you hit him.<eos> I thought it would make me feel better.<eos> But it didn't.
What happened to the money?<eos> Three days later, the money was wired to a law firm called Whitford and Roe.<eos> They're, like, bigwigs out of Norfolk.<eos> I thought Meyers had a JAG attorney handle his case.<eos> He did.
Not really.<eos> To be honest, most of them down here are total cunts.<eos> The place attracts them.<eos> Then why'd he lend you the boat?<eos> He didn't.
Why do you keep bringing her up?<eos> I don't need to listen to this, and thank you for including me, but I don't want any part of your villa.<eos> - You don't want it? - No.<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
No work.<eos> So, just to get small talk out of the way:<eos> let's see, your dad is, uh, on a low salt diet, your aunt's become a lesbian, and the dog is eating his own poop. Hello.<eos> I have baggage.<eos> Yes, we do.
So?<eos> You guys going to arrest this dude or what?<eos> Hey, we'll talk to RJ's dad.<eos> Does Washington have the death penalty?<eos> - It does.
- Your tire's on my lawn, man.<eos> - Bill me.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I know my alibi checked out.<eos> - Yeah, it did.
We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this. Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
But I couldn't agree with you more.<eos> I need to get to my apartment.<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> Blomfeld has the weight and reach of D.I.A. behind him.<eos> Unless he doesn't.
How is she?<eos> I, uh... think she's still in shock.<eos> Well, she's been through a lot.<eos> She needs time to process everything.<eos> You both do.
The one with the bee-stung lips, or the one with the unfortunate side bang?<eos> This is just a misunderstanding.<eos> Max's Homemade Cupcakes is pro-gay.<eos> - I love gay people.<eos> - She does.
That... and we found a partial print, which confirms that you're part of the ring.<eos> There's no way you have a print.<eos> I-I've never seen that book before.<eos> I didn't think we had a print for Olivia.<eos> We don't.
Play the part and go find that device.<eos> Hello. My name is Sam Paley.<eos> I am a transfer student looking to try out for the wrestling team.<eos> My JC coach should've called you to let you know that I'd be coming by.<eos> Yeah, he totally did, bro.
I feel like I'm gonna be sick out of both ends.<eos> I mean, you can have a baby with a guy that you've known for, like, three days, but you can't have a baby with the man you love?<eos> Look, I came to my senses.<eos> I changed my mind. You don't just change your mind about having a baby.<eos> I did.
At first Johnson's just gonna assume he lost it, so let's see what we can find out before he shuts it down.<eos> Fine, but not here.<eos> You need to lie low.<eos> You know, Naz told me to go to the safe house.<eos> - She did?
We need you to talk to Johnson.<eos> We need proof that someone in the FBI signed off on abducting Brian for that black op.<eos> Consider this your carrot.<eos> Tell Johnson it contains Brian's complete medical file.<eos> - Does it?
- [LAUGHS] We have a ship! - It's a start<eos> [KNOCKING]<eos> Agent Boyle, what have you got?<eos> Found anything worth reporting?<eos> Sir, I did, actually.
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!<eos> Reaper, don't do this.<eos> Yo, you better stay out the way.<eos> They killed Imani! No.<eos> No, they didn't.
Reaper, don't do this.<eos> Yo, you better stay out the way.<eos> They killed Imani! No.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> He did.
Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> - What if he didn't?
"Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> - What if he didn't?<eos> - Didn't what?
Hey, Wally!<eos> You guys are on the TV.<eos> Well, kind of.<eos> They didn't mention you.<eos> They rarely do.
He's got a few walls that may never come down... and is maybe the most introverted person I've ever met, but aside from that, you won't find a better man.<eos> We should probably take those rings off.<eos> Right, heh.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes... I do.
This is bad.<eos> NSA thinks I'm some kind of rogue agent.<eos> Like I've got an agenda to embarrass the government.<eos> - So, do you have an agenda i need to know about?<eos> - No, I don't.
How and when I'm trained to use lethal force, that I was gonna shoot Casey?<eos> You texted me.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I didn't think you'd shoot him.<eos> But I did.
Oh, you think you can handle it?<eos> - What age did you win the coding Olympics?<eos> - Okay, enough!<eos> Walter, you told me to trust you.<eos> I do.
He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
She decided it was time to take those training wheels off her bike.<eos> So the training wheels came off.<eos> Yeah, Ell barely made it down the driveway before she toppled over.<eos> Thought for sure she was gonna cry.<eos> But she didn't.
If he's hiding from Mr. Boss, he can't go home to retrieve his medication.<eos> I found a cousin who's a registered nurse.<eos> I sent a car to his house in case Carlos tries to get his insulin there.<eos> I'm afraid we have more dangerous fish to fry.<eos> We do?
Anything.<eos> If this doesn't work...<eos> If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
So, where are we going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry, char.<eos> I wish i had a plan.<eos> I don't.
They're gonna hurt me if you don't.<eos> You like getting hurt, jilly.<eos> You wouldn't be here with them if you didn't.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
Mrs. Glenn, I know you've got reason to doubt him, but...<eos> Today, your husband has pulled a calf muscle, done time, picked up out-of-the-way dry cleaning, put together a four, may be a five serviceable romantic speeches, babysat a self-entitled karate champ.<eos> My mother's waiting.<eos> He-he bounced off a bus for you.<eos> - No, he didn't.
'Cause what you already have has been fighting for you all day.<eos> And if you have someone in your life that knows you're worth fighting for, then you're right, that's not a spark.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, that's a fire.<eos> H- how do I know he'll change?<eos> You don't.
I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
We want Ryan found, but right now, you're in no condition.<eos> You forget about South Sudan, mister.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Abby...<eos> Don't "Abby" me.
Ensign Ryan sends her undying gratitude.<eos> And I put a replacement steak in your fridge.<eos> Nice New York strip, actually.<eos> Didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I kind of did.
Kitchen, courtyard, traffic?<eos> He was with you at the crime scene, right?<eos> I know, but I don't know.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I really don't.
Hey, I just got off the phone with Sebastian Kohl, who said he left some stuff on my porch because he was in the area.<eos> Who's Sebastian?<eos> Uh, shouldn't you be working?<eos> He's a gorgeous, smart, very successful photographer who does not live anywhere near me.<eos> However, Cam does.
This is Boyle's former partner, Detective Bruce Steadman.<eos> He's still on the force.<eos> His docket isn't much better.<eos> The police department split them up, hoping it would reduce the problem.<eos> It didn't.
That's because I am a lawyer.<eos> I'm sure that's also in my file.<eos> Do you want to know what I think?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Of course you do.
Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't. Then who did?
Help the ladies get the stair chair up there.<eos> This cable's not letting his lungs expand.<eos> - Capp!<eos> Cut it off him.<eos> - Done.
- Where did you hear that?<eos> - Officer Lopez.<eos> Old cop friend of mine.<eos> He said that you two met.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Right.<eos> This is why I don't ask people for help.<eos> Ben, I'm sorry, I...<eos> It's okay, I can figure it out.<eos> I always do.
Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
She was an endless seminar on the Sino-Soviet split and its effect on the end of the Cold War, which is ironic given the day's headlines.<eos> Might be a spring roll or two left.<eos> You could have that.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we really don't.
I don't want to upset anyone.<eos> It's just an offer, sweetheart. - I know.<eos> - You can take it or leave it.<eos> Right, and we really appreciate it.<eos> Yes, we do.
- No.<eos> Not in the condition that he's in.<eos> And he's completely full of shit.<eos> He has nowhere near that kind of money.<eos> And we do?
If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do.
We have a child together.<eos> I know.<eos> You could always go back to Helen.<eos> She still loves you. I'm certain of that.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No?<eos> You don't?
The DNA on the needle does belong to Joy Vanatter.<eos> And then I ran the residue from inside the barrel through Major Mass Spec, and it's black tar heroin.<eos> It's a very cheap low-grade form of the narcotic.<eos> That's weird, 'cause Cheech said that Vanatter was using, um, high-grade heroin.<eos> He did.
McGarrett brought the concept of rendition over from the military.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our interrogation tactics, however unorthodox, do yield immediate results.<eos> Huh, where's the interrogator sit?<eos> We don't.
What?<eos> Max just said the pawn shop owner died four hours before Katie Dawson.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> If Kaelani already had the camera, why would he go back and kill Katie?<eos> He didn't. He didn't.
Nice.<eos> It's a package deal.<eos> Champagne brunch, couple's massage in the room.<eos> Don't care, Baxter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
His field office did confirm that he had gone dark.<eos> Which means, for the time being, we're left with Wayne Morris.<eos> And Sam said that Morris is the one that is financially and logistically responsible for kidnapping Jada and getting her to Sudan.<eos> Do we know where Morris is now?<eos> Yes, we do.
We're gonna use it to see if Maddox will plea.<eos> - Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> I'll update you as soon as I know anything.<eos> Some people may have doubted Chief Boden.<eos> None of us did.
Serena Holmes.<eos> Serena Holmes is singing like a bird.<eos> She's telling us how you paid her to frame Wallace Boden, how you stowed her away at a fancy inn at Lake Carlyle, how you told her to stay hidden until you can get her out of the country.<eos> That sounds like the delusions of a woman with an axe to grind.<eos> No, sir, it doesn't.
Oh, this frickin' reeks!<eos> Take a shower, dude.<eos> Gail.<eos> Todd and I have something that Todd wants to tell you.<eos> - I do?
Murder?<eos> A-As in... murder?<eos> Pavel Ostrov<eos> - had an embolism.<eos> - He did.
Okay.<eos> So someone else left the backpack in your car.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Do I have to close my bar? !<eos> What about my market?<eos> Yeah, what about my BB? (all clamoring)<eos> Y'all know me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
What about my market?<eos> Yeah, what about my BB? (all clamoring)<eos> Y'all know me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.<eos> Okay, you don't.
(Man) No, we don't.<eos> Okay, you don't.<eos> Just got to town this morning.<eos> But y'all know how I earn a living.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
I'm just not ready to see you two...<eos> Yes. I gathered that when you didn't come to the wedding.<eos> I understand, but... she misses you.<eos> For the life of me, I can't figure out why.<eos> But she does.
Bones were found on Steven Avery's property.<eos> Which is a horrible fact.<eos> But what they don't know is that there's evidence those bones were moved.<eos> And so...<eos> And neither does the media.
And I said, "I think I found the vehicle."<eos> [Kratz] How long from when you entered that property did it take you to find Teresa's vehicle?<eos> I believed we entered at ten to ten... and by 10:20 to 10:25, we had found the vehicle.<eos> Ms. Sturm, do you know how many vehicles are on this property?<eos> I didn't at the time.
Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty whether Teresa Halbach is the source of the DNA on item FL, the bullet?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she is the source of the DNA on the bullet.<eos> let me ask you, did this match differ in any way from the previous matches that you culled?<eos> Yes, it did.
The deviation that I requested was appropriate for this situation.<eos> - It was OK'd and it was reported.<eos> - But, ma'am... you did not disclose in that report, that official report, that courts and juries and judges and lawyers and everybody else relies on, you did not disclose that in order to make that call,<eos> you had to do something so rare, you've never done it before, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
- No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.
- No, I did not.<eos> Not one shred, right?<eos> - No, I did not find his DNA.<eos> - And you had his profile.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Yes, I did.<eos> I saw Bobby Dassey on highway 147.<eos> I was going west and he was going east.<eos> Later that night, did you return to the Janda property?<eos> - Yes, I did.
And did you get a chance to look into the bookcase - when it was empty of its contents? - I may...<eos> I've glanced in there.<eos> I didn't really take a hard look in there, no, sir.<eos> You didn't see a blue lanyard and a black clasp and the Toyota key in that back of that bookcase, did you?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
Is there anyplace earlier in your report where you mention that you ever took any notes anywhere else about who was coming and going, other than this entry right here that it says it's 2:45 p.m.?<eos> No.<eos> My rough field notes, that's when I started previously.<eos> - Do you still have those?<eos> - No, I do not.
[Strang] There's nowhere that Steven Avery will be able to go to get his reputation back if he wins this trial.<eos> He didn't commit the rape he did 18 years for.<eos> We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't. He never did.
Avery's co-defendant and nephew Brendan Dassey goes to trial on April 16th in Manitowoc County, that trial expected to last two weeks.<eos> So a victory for you with the change of venue, bringing the jury in from another county?<eos> I don't know if you want to call it a victory, but I think it's important that the jury be a fair jury, and I think this is a way to ensure that.<eos> When's the last time you talked to Brendan?<eos> Uh, we just did. No, I...
-Yes.<eos> Mr. Dassey, didn't you tell your mother in a phone call on May 13th that you had gone over to your uncle Steven's after school -and before she came home?<eos> -Yes.<eos> And on May 15th, she's asking you why you didn't tell her.<eos> Why didn't you?
To recognize on the one hand that a lawyer is ineffective and then allow the fruits of that ineffectiveness to be used to the admission of another confession, I mean, it's a problem.<eos> It's a serious problem.<eos> Brendan tells me they treat him OK.<eos> I mean, he plays games with the other inmates.<eos> And he does his schooling.
You'll need the chalk.<eos> But I... I hadn't completed that proof.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
1+1+1+1, 3+1,<eos> 2+1+1, 2 + 2, and 4.<eos> Seems simple enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So it does.
How dare you judge me?<eos> But it is you who does of me!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> No.<eos> Quite frankly, I don't.
Everything will work out for us.<eos> Really.<eos> I know it.<eos> You just have to trust me.<eos> I do.
Five.<eos> What am I, Julie Andrews?<eos> I'm gonna sew matching outfits and sing to escape the Nazis?<eos> He asked me if I wanted to be "part of the team."<eos> - No, I don't!
23.<eos> We're looking for 23.<eos> There it is.<eos> 'Hi!<eos> How you doing?
Well, thank you.<eos> You showered.<eos> Am I really known as the non-shower guy?<eos> I shower all the time, guys.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Yeah, well, his dad's not really into working with him, you know because to do that, he'd have to show up, which he's just not good at.<eos> You gotta show up for your kids.<eos> It should be boring how reliable a parent is.<eos> It's funny to me that some people don't get that.<eos> You do!
Jim!<eos> The cool guy from the safari.<eos> Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?<eos> I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I was a jerk.<eos> Lauren, you were the best thing in my life.<eos> You and the boys.<eos> And boys need their fathers.<eos> They do.
How is it looking with your brother Dave?<eos> Dave?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> You said you were going to talk to him again.<eos> I did.
Not at all.<eos> - Oh, yes, that is good.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Hmm? - Do bears even have names?<eos> - Of course we do.
Sure I'm sure.<eos> It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on the stool in the kitchen.<eos> No, sweetie, you're confused.<eos> I painted that.<eos> No, Mother did.
Killer party.<eos> It's a happening.<eos> So where's your stuff?<eos> We decided that this would just be Walter's show.<eos> Oh, "we" did?
To stop them from talking.<eos> And then Doris went missing?<eos> Missing.<eos> She never left the house, did she? No.<eos> No, she didn't.
Get your head down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Don't make me tell you again!<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> Don't do it!
- That's what I'm telling you.<eos> I don't mean to laugh, but is there anything else we should know about them?<eos> - They're ninjas.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - And they do karate.
I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy. That's...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - You did!<eos> - No, I didn't!
Nothing.<eos> - You did!<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> - I didn't.
I understand.<eos> This is my patient, Henry Altmann.<eos> - He needs brain surgery.<eos> - Do you have a license?<eos> No, I don't.
For eight days, Henry Altmann never got angry even once.<eos> Except at the very end, when he told death to go fuck himself.<eos> And then he turned his thoughts to things that pleased him... and sailed away.<eos> No one expected Sharon Gill to go back to her old life.<eos> And, indeed, she did not.
It's a secret. I can't show you.<eos> It's a secret?<eos> You're gonna keep a secret from your dad?<eos> Ryan said he's teaching me to be his partner in crime.<eos> He did, huh?
For us.<eos> They were never gonna let us be together.<eos> You know that.<eos> And I thought it was gonna make it easier.<eos> I really did.
Way to go.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Yeah, well, I won't get in.<eos> But it's kind of a big deal that I even got an audition.<eos> Most people don't.
Judd.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> But I do.
- Stop.<eos> Stop it.<eos> What's going on? - He kissed my wife.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - No, he didn't.
- The man who used to live here 20 years ago.<eos> - What about him?<eos> - I just want to know his name.<eos> - No.<eos> No you don't.
- I'm sorry?<eos> - We don't get many tourists, being up here in the hills and all.<eos> - It's too bad.<eos> Seems like a nice town.<eos> - Sure does.
- Listen, the others might be too afraid to say it, but you have to haul ass on out of town, kid, or you're gonna get us all killed.<eos> - I think you think I'm somebody else.<eos> - No, you think you're somebody else.<eos> And, listen, he doesn't know who you are yet.<eos> Only a few of us do.
- And then what?<eos> Then we just give him Angelina?<eos> - That was the deal we made.<eos> - The deal I made.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Items in the vault are sacred.<eos> You cannot remove or replace anything.<eos> Then I shall accept full responsibility.<eos> You have not the authority to do this.<eos> None of us do.
Kill most, enslave the rest.<eos> Your world will end.<eos> And what will you do?<eos> It has nothing to do with me.<eos> Of course, it does.
Just interesting.<eos> I've never known where I fit.<eos> Does it need to be a place?<eos> Well, I don't know what to say to the pair of you!<eos> No, really, I don't!
That belongs to another life.<eos> I've been thinking and, erm...<eos> I want to look after you.<eos> We belong together now.<eos> Don't we?
All right.<eos> How did you guess that? You're good.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> She's doesn't know exactly what.<eos> Yes, she does.
How did you guess that? You're good.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> She's doesn't know exactly what.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why?<eos> This many people?<eos> You have to ask?<eos> But we all have the same goal.<eos> We do now.
Stop, this is finished.<eos> Leave.<eos> My days draw to an end, my son.<eos> - No, father!<eos> - They do... child.
It was lost a long time.<eos> But it said that in a battle between man and Jinn One shall emerged more powerful than both.<eos> And will lead the world into a golden age.<eos> You think it talks about me?<eos> I do.
It's voluntary, off-the-clock.<eos> There will be others, too.<eos> Someone from sales, a guy from design, that cute English chick in accounting, Fiona.<eos> - You wanna do it?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Scuba diving lessons.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Doesn't that sound like fun?<eos> Yeah, if you like scuba diving, yeah.<eos> I do.
How'd he beat you, Bob?<eos> Would you understand if I answered that?<eos> He was playing to draw.<eos> Bobby, no one expected you to beat Spassky.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Right?<eos> You know, they don't tell us everything.<eos> Yeah, no, they don't, that's true.<eos> And the KGB, they kill people.<eos> They do.
Don't forget to stitch her up when she stabs herself, all right?<eos> Tossing the missing piece of the One-Armed Man around like a ham... and the front door's open!<eos> - He didn't see anything.<eos> - But he could've.<eos> But he didn't.
You bought her free drinks and don't think I don't know that you did it on purpose?<eos> That was my stool and nobody sat on that stool because it was Cousin Marv's stool.<eos> And that meant something.<eos> That meant something!<eos> But it didn't.
So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off.<eos> So that's what we did.<eos> - So you...<eos> - Yeah. - ...killed him.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
People like this, they take something from you and you let them... and they just act like they keep coming back.<eos> And you still owe them something and they never, never change.<eos> You can never change their mind.<eos> You just... I mean, you just fucking shot him.<eos> Yes, I did. Absolutely.
I'm not lying.<eos> It's true.<eos> Deeds always took credit for the Whelan hit 'cause nobody else wanted to.<eos> He thought it would help his street cred... - but he didn't kill Whelan.<eos> - He didn't?
That was incredible.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm gonna go make pizza bagels.<eos> Victory tasted sweet.<eos> The hangover from his recent drug binge did not.
Are you married?<eos> Why? Are you trying to pick me up?<eos> - Well, marriage is hard goddamn work.<eos> - Yeah, they don't tell you that when you're registering at Crate and Barrel, huh?<eos> No, they do not.
And may I say this pharmacy has the most impressive collection of douches I have ever seen.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> High blood pressure, acid reflux, chlamydia.<eos> Never would have guessed.<eos> No one ever does.
I'm a diplomat.<eos> I have immunity!<eos> - I have a wife!<eos> Children!<eos> - So did I.
Go!<eos> Bet you'd like to stick your dick in that, huh?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> I bet that kid doesn't even know what a pussy looks like.<eos> I do.
What kind of meeting?<eos> I get to City Hall.<eos> Hiram keeps me waiting forever, and finally the commissioner comes out and he says that Hiram doesn't want to see me anymore.<eos> I wanted to scream, "I haven't slept in two days, you dumb fuck!"<eos> But I didn't.
A horrible day!<eos> A no-good... Very bad day!<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this day sucks!<eos> Yes! It does.
Please, Lara.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, Lara, let's leave this place.<eos> You don't want this.<eos> You don't!
-I'm calling him back.<eos> -Please!<eos> He calls you all the... It's like its father's day with you every day!<eos> I mean, the guy calls you all the time!<eos> -No, he doesn't.
Yeah, you don't come across that name too often.<eos> No, but in therapy you do.<eos> It's kinda common in therapy.<eos> You know a Glo stick?<eos> Yes, I do.
And it's...<eos> Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
A bullet can kill, but a punch can change things for the living.<eos> I'll give you spoilers.<eos> John Wayne and Randolph Scott tore apart a bar fighting for Marlene Dietrich.<eos> John Wayne won, of course, and they lived happily ever after.<eos> We never did it.
They looked much bigger than him.<eos> Every time he entered the ring, then I get scared.<eos> "Can he do this? Can he handle this guy?"<eos> And, he did.<eos> Amazingly, he did.
I think looking like an idiot and fainting would rank right up there.<eos> Okay, so don't do that.<eos> You know, your advice sucks.<eos> Does it?<eos> Yes, yes it does.
All right, well, first listen.<eos> Don't go to hit on them.<eos> Go over to talk to them.<eos> I just wanna drink my beer.<eos> - No, you don't.
Wilco, Death Cab, radio promos.<eos> Do you know what this could mean, dude?<eos> This could be the first step.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna think about the audience.<eos> Yes, I do.
What would you say if I told you that my son wrote all the songs the band plays?<eos> Damn.<eos> I'd say, "I didn't see that comin'."<eos> Wait, does Quentin know?<eos> He does now.
It is what it is.<eos> "It is what it is"? That's what you say when you get a parking ticket.<eos> I know.<eos> It looks to me like the guy here wants to escape.<eos> Does he?
Or you keep going the way you're going and you end up as a bum in the streets.<eos> You can do this, Lou.<eos> Just gotta believe you can.<eos> I don't believe.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> So, which of you geniuses found this place?<eos> I did.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> I did.
- You hired me to win.<eos> You're gonna win. - Put this on.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm already dressed.<eos> - How you doing?
- l know.<eos> She said that you're a very good singer.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> "She's a really good singer."<eos> No, she didn't do any of that.
I had to break up with him because I'm not Jewish.<eos> What kind of weak-ass man...<eos> Hold up, hold up, hold up.<eos> I thought you said he broke up with you.<eos> He did.
Hug Mommy!<eos> Hug me.<eos> Baby.<eos> He needs a good home, and we have that now.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I have some savings. - Yeah.<eos> I can get Bernie to help out on the supply side.<eos> But why not take out a second mortgage on this place, put some real money in here?<eos> Now you're talking like you're gonna stick around for a while.<eos> And if I did?
He wants to do this.<eos> Baby, that's not true.<eos> Okay, I don't want to do it.<eos> I'm doing it because we agreed that I'm better at it. - No.<eos> We didn't.
Baby, that's not true.<eos> Okay, I don't want to do it.<eos> I'm doing it because we agreed that I'm better at it. - No.<eos> We didn't.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Snake the upper levels. Work down to me.<eos> - Kiss me.<eos> - What?<eos> Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.<eos> Yes, they do.
It's not what you think.<eos> Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Does everyone still have a key?<eos> - Course we do.
Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this, "fake tits" that? I mean, listen.<eos> Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares.<eos> My mom, she's got... false teeth. Okay?<eos> When she smiles, do people give her shit and say, "Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"<eos> No, they don't.
Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee, Do-la-mon...<eos> There's a bus.<eos> Quick, Saoirse.<eos> I just saw real fairies.<eos> Course you did.
so this is my breakthrough.<eos> taking a human life is easy for me because i'm different.<eos> -i'm not even human.<eos> i'm better than that.<eos> -william, i didn't do anything to you!
you've been kind of an oddball lately.<eos> That's not winning you any popularity contests!<eos> Get the hell out of my house!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!<eos> The hell it does!
- Couldn't make it.<eos> School. Oh.<eos> I didn't know kids in Chicago go to school in the summer.<eos> There isn't.<eos> They just do...
I'm gonna say this as professionally and gently as I possibly can.<eos> You're a civil servant in a corn-belt, Bible-banging backwater.<eos> Nobody, nobody, gives a rat's ass about your legacy.<eos> But I do, you see.<eos> I do.
Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> You see a man that you hate, and minutes later... you've altered your route... and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time... only you're in your car with his blood on it... and he's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken... and you don't remember hitting him?<eos> I do not.
What about that thing?<eos> We don't know what that thing is, sir.<eos> Actually, we really don't know what any of them are.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
And no one has asked for forgiveness, not even me.<eos> No one has asked for forgiveness.<eos> So what happened?<eos> It's so horrible I don't dare telling.<eos> Then don't, you stubborn fool.
But I can't lead you this time.<eos> But... we're a team.<eos> And you're our skipper, Skipper.<eos> We don't need these guys.<eos> No, Kowalski, but Private does.
Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!<eos> Kevin, bake on!<eos> We're still gonna need that victory cake!<eos> We're only gonna get one shot at this, boys.<eos> How we doing on those snow globes?
It's sad what you're trying to do.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> All right.<eos> I hate Mossi.<eos> Everybody does.
Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
Honey, no, we can't afford it.<eos> That charity auction last year, dinner for two.<eos> Maple Grove restaurant, your favorite place.<eos> We used that already.<eos> No, we did not.
That charity auction last year, dinner for two.<eos> Maple Grove restaurant, your favorite place.<eos> We used that already.<eos> No, we did not.<eos> We did.
We used that already.<eos> No, we did not.<eos> We did.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No, we did not.
We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
You killed her.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> Let's begin with your pretty face.<eos> But by the end... I will make it a masterpiece.<eos> Do it.
Many of them were developed by Russian.<eos> You know about... the technology, biogenetic stuff?<eos> Sorry.<eos> biogenic oil, decomposition technology?<eos> No, I don't not really.
You're too old for her, Tommy.<eos> We both are.<eos> See her, love her, but you'll never get her, not even with all that black money you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.<eos> As far as I am aware, Miss Richter represents a client with a legitimate financial interest with my bank.<eos> Your bank does business with the Russians, right?

I hope you like them.<eos> - Can I ask you a couple questions?<eos> - OK.<eos> - Do you have an onion?<eos> - I do.
But you never can.<eos> I can't imagine how difficult that must have been for your family.<eos> We both started drinking too much.<eos> I quit.<eos> He never did.
I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> And well, I just...<eos> I want to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.<eos> I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> I wanted to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
However we do recommend when seated to keep your seat belt securely fastened in case of any unexpected turbulence.<eos> See?<eos> Urban myth.<eos> What if you killed us all?<eos> But I didn't.
No.<eos> She walks all over you.<eos> You--you--you-- you're just too blind to see it because you're in shock that she talks to you, let alone actually dates you.<eos> Okay, n--news flash, uh, Desmond and Rafe love her.<eos> No they don't.
! You're the one who's hurt?<eos> First of all, I am not crying.<eos> Barry, I'm not crying, but my feelings were hurt because your lifelong best friends said some not very nice things about me.<eos> That hurt you?<eos> Yes, it did.
- Just go, you answer it.<eos> - You answer it. You answer!<eos> You are gonna answer.<eos> You do it. You do it.<eos> You do it.
We did it.<eos> We fucking did it. We did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> Come on. We fucking did that shit.<eos> We totally did it.
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?<eos> Carina.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Your people do have elbows, do they not?<eos> We do, Master.
Thank God for you.<eos> Girl doesn't show up and leaves me to handle two cabins.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> If I pass out, just promise to catch me before I hit the floor.<eos> Not if I do first.
Believe me, please!<eos> Get off of him.<eos> I said get off of him!<eos> Get off him!<eos> Do it now.
So out came the eyeliner?<eos> It's better than being like everyone else.<eos> Yeah, you got that right.<eos> You know my pathetic father always wanted to be an architect?<eos> Yeah, he still does.
I need you to know that I fucked up, too.<eos> So I'm in no position to judge you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can totally judge me.<eos> I did something really stupid.
What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, the lady told me to wait.<eos> - In my office?<eos> She tell you to help yourself to tea while you were here?<eos> No, she didn't.
- What?<eos> You're mediocre linguists, and positively poor code-breakers.<eos> Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.<eos> - Well, he just said I could.<eos> - No, I did no such thing.
You're mediocre linguists, and positively poor code-breakers.<eos> Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.<eos> - Well, he just said I could.<eos> - No, I did no such thing.<eos> But Churchill did.
How's that different from talking?<eos> - Talking?<eos> - When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.<eos> They say something else, and you're expected to just know what they mean.<eos> Only I never do.
I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to see this day.<eos> Was I God?<eos> No. Because...<eos> God didn't win the war.<eos> We did.
Zoom in.<eos> Jesus Christ. It's the President.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Anyone here got an ID?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Figures what?<eos> Sorry?<eos> I thought you had spoken.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Maybe I did.
How's my wife?<eos> Does she know i'm here?<eos> She knows about her son?<eos> Does she know that he melted in my arms?<eos> Does she?
Shit.<eos> Hey, can I use your cell?<eos> My son's out there. I got no signal.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I don't either.
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.<eos> I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Mom, it's so hard to get taken seriously as an artist... without a backer.<eos> Didn't Sebastian say you could do a show whenever you wanted?<eos> Yeah, and soon as I show up to ask him, he says to me, "you're welcome, - as long as you cough up the cash."<eos> - Well, how much does he want?<eos> A lot, and they only do exhibitions with other artists.
Oh, he wouldn't be interested in this, honey.<eos> Children screaming all over the place and junk food and balloons and vomit everywhere.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You've got better things to do.<eos> - Well, actually, I don't.
So are you, love.<eos> Who's ready for a boat race?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Faster!<eos> Do it!
What?<eos> Look.<eos> Go to hell, you filthy traitor.<eos> I mean, no one talks like that in real life, do they?<eos> Heroes do, son. Heroes.
We end up in the middle of nowhere.<eos> - This is good. - Stannum.<eos> I think I've heard that name somewhere.<eos> I think it's...<eos> Probably something boring to do with Vikings.
- I didn't.<eos> - I feel like you did. - I'm sure I did.<eos> You said "kidnapping." I was like, "What a weird word."<eos> - Should be more "kidnabbing."<eos> - No, I did not.
Did I say that?<eos> - I think you might have, sir.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Well, I got a little lost with all their yammering, but pretty sure.<eos> All right, maybe I did. - Hey.
You're our bodyguard.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> Pretty sweet. All right, so I'm guessing we saved the business.<eos> - Nope.<eos> We did not.
Ha, ha.<eos> Pretty sweet. All right, so I'm guessing we saved the business.<eos> - Nope.<eos> We did not.<eos> - We did not.
You HATE me.<eos> That yet you are desperate to be me?<eos> You want that role that you're not gonna get.<eos> You don't even have the chops.<eos> I did.
That's a big thing in your book.<eos> Trying your best.<eos> It's supposed to give people major points.<eos> I don't know that girl anymore so...<eos> Not that I ever did.
- Zooey!<eos> - What?<eos> In the bathroom, do you remember what happened?<eos> Look, Karina and I aced the practice test, okay?<eos> - No, you didn't.
- What?<eos> In the bathroom, do you remember what happened?<eos> Look, Karina and I aced the practice test, okay?<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Sit down.<eos> Do you know why I'm here?<eos> - You have a brother.<eos> Peter, yes?<eos> Yes, you do.
Jesus.<eos> - We gotta get out of here.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - He just said that.<eos> I did.
Handsome!<eos> Handsome!<eos> No, but look at him!<eos> He doesn't understand!<eos> Really, he doesn't!
I never even reached home.<eos> I've been looking for her all night.<eos> How could you?<eos> Well, she might just as easily have run away from you.<eos> - Yeah, but she didn't.
How could you?<eos> Well, she might just as easily have run away from you.<eos> - Yeah, but she didn't.<eos> - Yeah, but she might have done.<eos> - But she didn't.
- Yeah, but she didn't.<eos> - Yeah, but she might have done.<eos> - But she didn't.<eos> - But she might have done!<eos> But she didn't!
She has to be.<eos> This cow has been covered with flour!<eos> You didn't get a real white cow?<eos> We had a cow as white as milk.<eos> Honestly, we did!
This is ridiculous What am I doing here?<eos> I'm in the wrong story<eos> Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this!<eos> You have a princess!<eos> - Well, yes, I do.
My parents have created something very rare.<eos> A good marriage.<eos> We love you guys.<eos> - Well, got the house to ourselves. - Yes.<eos> We do.
Here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> - Oh, I see you do know my name.<eos> - Indeed I do.
Can I confess something to you?<eos> You don't have a dead wife or anything, do you?<eos> - 'Cause I can't take that again today.<eos> I don't really have a test tomorrow.<eos> - You don't?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - You did not just see that.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
You're really keeping this?<eos> Er, yeah.<eos> Sure?<eos> Mary likes it.<eos> Hmm, no, she doesn't.
Er, yeah.<eos> Sure?<eos> Mary likes it.<eos> Hmm, no, she doesn't.<eos> She does. She doesn't.
I was thinking maybe...<eos> Maybe Mana could come, too.<eos> Maybe he'd enjoy it.<eos> Pretty hard if he doesn't know how to play, eh?<eos> He does.
Very funny.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> We love school!<eos> - Yes, we do.
Let's go.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> We love school!<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - No, we don't.
What the hell am I doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I mean...<eos> I think we both know the answer to that one.<eos> Yeah, do we?
Yeah, do we?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yeah, we...<eos> We know the answer?<eos> Yeah, we do.
He changed the rules on me.<eos> He wasn't supposed to do that.<eos> He changed the rules?<eos> Okay.<eos> We both did.
Mr. Smith.<eos> What do you want?<eos> 'Cause if you have a woman in there with you, I have to charge you $20 extra for double occupancy.<eos> I don't have a woman in here. I'm just saying, if you do have a woman in there with you...<eos> Well, I don't.
- No, I didn't. - Mmm.<eos> We're looking for the girl.<eos> She's tall, attractive, in her 20's.<eos> Didn't happen to see her around here tonight, did you?<eos> No, I didn't.
He didn't know about the $100 bill, Sonny.<eos> He lied.<eos> He never read the whole playbook.<eos> So?<eos> A lot of guys don't.
I checked all the Seahawk fan blogs and chat rooms.<eos> They're all calling for your head.<eos> Ever since you traded away Callahan, the barbarians are at the gate.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You want me to confess to adultery?<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Somebody beat her up.<eos> - Did she tell you I beat her up?<eos> - No, she didn't.
Not even one of Mum?<eos> Don't need a photograph to remember your mother.<eos> Memories fade.<eos> That's what's so terrible about them.<eos> No, they don't.
Why?<eos> I heard you had a gun.<eos> I have to say I'm surprised. Thought I'd have to go looking for you.<eos> Just 'cause I'm here doesn't mean you have to go through with it.<eos> Yes it does!
I need you settled in New York by the first of the month.<eos> Wait, New York?<eos> That is where our headquarters are located, Lauren.<eos> I got a good feeling about this.<eos> I did, too.
That don't make no sense.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Over there, who you are in the world don't matter.<eos> Fighting for your country don't matter.<eos> What does?
How do you know my name, Lewis?<eos> You told me.<eos> Yeah, you did. You told me... you said, "Jack Daniel, like the drink."<eos> And I said, "a damn good one at that."<eos> - No, I didn't.
Wait here.<eos> Hello?<eos> I've seen many a man fall before they should.<eos> They could have lasted a little longer had they known when to stop.<eos> But they don't.
But "best friend"?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me, one sec.<eos> He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.<eos> Of course he did.
I don't know, why?<eos> We came back...<eos> Hmm... Men!<eos> They said they're friends of yours.<eos> Did they, now? !
He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.<eos> - You're supposed to also.<eos> - I'll do that later.<eos> - He suspects you're innocent.<eos> - Of course he does.
Oh, God.<eos> What have I done?<eos> Fish.<eos> You... you don't have power over me.<eos> You don't.
"You're dead You are dead<eos> "You're dead"<eos> That's for Cynthia, who's dead.<eos> I don't have a single lead.<eos> I do.
I've been running those bills through the Embassy.<eos> How long you think that's gonna last?<eos> However, if she were a dependent of a government agent, well... That's a whole different ball game.<eos> So, you're sayin', if I take the job, you'll make sure Cindy's taken care of?<eos> But, what if I don't?
It seems that Clinton Davis was not the only good samaritan in this trial.<eos> Mr. Davis?<eos> I just wanted to wish you all the best.<eos> Yeah, it's like you said-- if I was innocent, everything would work out.<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, Ackerman was a child molester.<eos> None of the others were.<eos> Well, they do all have criminal records.<eos> So you think this behavior started - with the death of his family, right?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I actually have plans.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does he know that this thing is gonna be ending in a couple of weeks?<eos> 'Cause the kid at dinner last night didn't really seem to know.<eos> Of course he does.
You can just get to the point where you ask me about last night.<eos> Last night?<eos> You and that woman you work with.<eos> I don't know what you think you saw.<eos> I do.
What's that smile for?<eos> I'm thinking of asking Sabine to marry me.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Yeah. Does Jade know?<eos> No one does.
Oh, great.<eos> You invited Jenny.<eos> How big do you think our houseboat is?<eos> She still cares about you, okay?<eos> We all do.
- Then you die.<eos> And you'll never get the money.<eos> I think I'll liked the bite better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I did.
That's all you'll have together.<eos> Do I get to talk to him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does my Dad get to talk to me?<eos> Yes, Cass he does.
There's been a series of burglaries in the area all over the last six months.<eos> All still open.<eos> Now you don't talk to me, it's all on you, boy.<eos> Well, you know, I ain't got nothing to do with that.<eos> - Well, any idea who does?
Oh, you are so funny.<eos> No, darling.<eos> Jay will have his room and you can stay in the guest room.<eos> I thought you quit.<eos> I did.
Okay?<eos> My mother said that this is how you earn love.<eos> Huh?<eos> I thought you didn't have any family.<eos> I don't.
Daisy, Jay wouldn't be working at a hospital unless there was a catch.<eos> Catch?<eos> Yes, a catch.<eos> And you know the catch.<eos> I do?
No.<eos> No, the voices -- they didn't tell me things.<eos> They told my mother things.<eos> So, you don't hear voices.<eos> Your mother did.
That's just pretend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I mean, you didn't know.<eos> No, I didn't.
It would be so much less of a headache... if we could ship her in her storage unit with our stuff.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> You know, if it helps, my grandmother was in hibernation for five years.<eos> It doesn't.
He used to cry saying his parents were murdered.<eos> After inquiring, nothing like that.<eos> He is first boy to run away from our orphanage home.<eos> That's why I remembered him.<eos> But I didn't any proof.
Oh, did it hurt, Ray?<eos> - Just get on with it, will you.<eos> Will you be needing a tissue?<eos> Are you done?<eos> Yeah, done.
He will come for us.<eos> Him and his friends.<eos> Then you'll be in trouble.<eos> - You're going to regret this.<eos> - I already do.
Why are you messing around with Mooney Marks? I'm not messing around with Jamie...<eos> Call it what you want.<eos> I need to get away for a few days.<eos> You can't give him what he needs. How do you know what he needs?<eos> Oh, and you do?
'Cause I don't.<eos> You just say you don't, but you don't have a reason.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - What's the reason?<eos> I don't.
Nice to meet you.<eos> I own all of your movies.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yeah, Chicago says, uh, great things about you.<eos> He does? Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.<eos> So, what are you going to do?<eos> About what?<eos> Monica, I like you.<eos> I really do.
See what happens. - Put him on the machine.<eos> - Plug him in. - Do it. See what happens.<eos> Push the button and kill us all.<eos> - Hook the dog up.<eos> - Do it.
Cops were here.<eos> Wanted to talk to you.<eos> What am I gonna tell them?<eos> I don't know where I've been.<eos> I do.
Suki is just a puppet imitating human behavior.<eos> - I know who I am, Hogan.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of us do.
O Mercy!<eos> Well...it's time to meet them.<eos> I'm not sure I'm ready.<eos> You must have had an awful winter.<eos> We did, ma'am.
I don't know what we're gonna do with all the food.<eos> So...<eos> Honey, do you mind?<eos> I want to know.<eos> No, really, you don't.
I decided to tell you everything I know about Arkady Federov.<eos> Come in.<eos> You know he's in town right now, the European Energy Conference.<eos> Staying at the Imperia Hotel.<eos> No, I didn't.
Hey. Sorry to take so long, but Jason had another meltdown.<eos> He's a mess of a human.<eos> I hope he's okay.<eos> Oh, he'll bounce back.<eos> He always does.
What are you trying to say?<eos> Like I said, he really loves you.<eos> But you tried to kill him.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Will you shut the fuck up.<eos> - You know, you need to...<eos> - You gotta shut the fuck up. Okay?<eos> I don't wanna do this.<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> Mark, my... my first husband... he tried to... kill me more than once.<eos> And I have a restraining order against him.<eos> I mean, I still...<eos> I still do.
No, I do that sometimes when I'm overwhelmed.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I prayed about it... and... I really enjoyed myself... in the mountains with you. Good.<eos> I did too for the most part.
- And I...<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you... that I'm going to talk to my lawyer about the joint custody.<eos> I am. I...<eos> I never thought that you were this kind of man.<eos> I didn't.
Why?<eos> Stuart and I... we've tried everything.<eos> Therapy, counseling, together, separately<eos> He wants it to work.<eos> He really does.
- Some guy offed his ex.<eos> - Allegedly<eos> Right.<eos> Allegedly<eos> - He didn't do her in the car, did he?
That's what happened<eos> It was not my father<eos> We haven't heard his side of the story<eos> They can't know that can they?<eos> I do.
And if you have to shoot, shoot their legs, OK?<eos> Yo?<eos> Someone called a faulty monitor?<eos> - It wasn't me, mate.<eos> - Well, someone did, mate.
Bear rides are for babies.<eos> Scout can't believe what he is seeing.<eos> "Other bears?"<eos> "There are other bears in the world?" "Did everybody know that?"<eos> Sky did.
Maybe it's some other white chick in a yellow dress.<eos> Whoa. You saw this lady?<eos> You've got to go talk to the Lieutenant.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
En vivo.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> It's a Iong story.<eos> You don't have $5, do you?<eos> In the store, I do.

Because I was thinking I might want Quiznos for lunch today.<eos> How much?<eos> $500.<eos> Quiznos does not cost $500.<eos> It does for me.
There's too much to do.<eos> DAN: Move. Come on, get on the chair.<eos> Hurry up. WOMAN:<eos> Triage.<eos> Just do the upper line.
- Okay, okay. Can we not talk about Eugene.<eos> - I'm sorry I brought it up.<eos> I don't understand why I have to talk in-between songs.<eos> - Because people want to get to know you.<eos> - People don't really...
I know...<eos> look, I know that this past year, has been something of an adjustment, but...<eos> She is your mother, and I think it'd be good if you, no, if we both... Could be a little more supportive.<eos> - You missed her...<eos> - Yes, I do.
Maybe, the world is better off without me.<eos> You need to listen to me now, do not do this.<eos> You can't just give up on her.<eos> Do you have children, Mr. Williams?<eos> No, I don't.
Bobby, we in there.<eos> All them little grooves.<eos> That's us.<eos> That's all the money we got.<eos> And some we don't.
- Well, you'll have to cancel it.<eos> - 'Tis painless.<eos> Oh, I care not.<eos> You don't want my old face in one of these.<eos> I do, the two of us together.
Now you're in.<eos> Frankie, that's 37 for you, baby, that's 37.<eos> Why did the locals attack the base?<eos> I thought the inter-human conflict ended in this region after the Heavies invaded.<eos> It did.
But he still deserved a proper burial.<eos> How did you know how to give him an Islamic burial?<eos> Know your enemy.<eos> If you believe in God, now's the time to pray.<eos> And if you don't...
That would be martyrdom.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a room.<eos> You told me she had a private room.<eos> She did, at first.
How would your daughter feel if she had no father and she was all alone?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - John.<eos> - I know about you.<eos> - You do?
Take that!<eos> Blast it.<eos> The second star!<eos> They turned the ship around!<eos> Yup, we sure did.
Please forgive any hot dog related moisture.<eos> Only if you will forgive my intrusion.<eos> I... I thought we should meet.<eos> Arielle speaks very highly of you.<eos> She does?
He hates everything.<eos> He just wants to meet you for one minute first and make sure that you're not a lunatic...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She brought Valery.<eos> Of course, she did.
Even a daddy longlegs once.<eos> In junior high I stopped taking showers.<eos> My mom would say, Why do you want to treat your body with such disrespect?"<eos> I had no idea why.<eos> But now I do.
Ten minutes ago.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It could be said that we got off to a poor start at the wine and cheese event.<eos> "We" did?
Nice to see you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It could be said that we got off to a poor start at the wine and cheese event.<eos> "We" did?<eos> I did.

She wants me.<eos> Me!<eos> Because she doesn't know you, Jed.<eos> - She does.<eos> - No, she doesn't!
Hi honey... heard a noise and woke and now I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> I will.<eos> Pa '... Are you afraid of the dark?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> Why, do you?
Went down 25,000.<eos> So I tried to be scarce.<eos> Fall off the radar a minute.<eos> I tried to avoid these pricks.<eos> Honest to God, I did. I did.
What do we do then?<eos> How?<eos> I want to continue with you.<eos> I want to make sure that it works.<eos> Of course you do!
Just one.<eos> Jesus Christ, ask the fucking question before our pensions run out, for Christ's sake.<eos> What if I win?<eos> Listen. Ten years of playing poker night, rookie's never won, never will.<eos> Okay, but if I do.
What's going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Albert, you look terrible!<eos> Oh, wow, there's that confidence boost I need. Thanks a lot.<eos> How you doing, buddy?
James, I found the friendly locals.<eos> So he said, "Why don't you go blow your own horse?"<eos> Hey, watch it, pal.<eos> I think you owe me a drink, fella.<eos> The hell I do.
Our well's been long dry.<eos> And we had a good store of water until they ran it into the ground.<eos> We held on a week before moving on.<eos> Every well we've come to in this valley's been dry.<eos> You done?
Help!<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember.<eos> I think I need to tell someone.<eos> Well, you just did.
She said a young man used to visit him.<eos> His son, they thought. What if it's him?<eos> That the passing of his father set him off and he came back here to finish his father's work?<eos> Benjamin Sewell did have a son, Ms. Lerner, but he died in a bar fight two years ago.<eos> He did?
"...right there."<eos> Can I sit down for this?<eos> Yeah, sit. Good idea.<eos> So just give it to me as a "Fuck you." Lay it on me.<eos> Just do it.
It's weird, you know, sometimes it feels like you have so many friends one minute, and then you leave home and you're basically all alone.<eos> - It's hard to picture you as not popular.<eos> - I mean, I have friends...<eos> - And now you have me.<eos> - I do, do I?
So foolish.<eos> Eating Jell-O.<eos> Oh, we used to eat Jell-O all the time when Beth was little.<eos> We ate a lot of Jell-O.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Professor Kaman, I don't mean to come off so direct or with any disrespect, but I'm concerned about what you're teaching in your class.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Can you give me an example?<eos> Well, it seems your class deals quite a bit with the subject of evolution.<eos> Yes it does.
Can you explain to me why you teach only evolution?<eos> Sure, but first let me ask you Mr. Whitaker, are you a religious man?<eos> A religious man?<eos> Well you believe in God and the Bible.<eos> Yes sir I do.
Yes sir I do.<eos> And does that help you?<eos> Help me?<eos> Does that help you to be at peace with yourself?<eos> Yes it does.
What?<eos> Professor Kaman was in the news yesterday.<eos> Front page story.<eos> We didn't run a story on Kaman yesterday.<eos> Yeah, well we did twelve years ago.
You seem pretty serious about this.<eos> Maybe you should be the one debating Kaman.<eos> God didn't give me the opportunity sir.<eos> He gave it to you and I think what you're doing is great.<eos> Rachel sure doesn't.
Evan.<eos> Just answer the question, please?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going to answer that.<eos> You just did.
Uh, excuse me, your Dad's the guy that's gonna debate Kaman, right?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm in your Bio class.<eos> Why would anybody wanna debate Kaman?<eos> He doesn't.
Our real focus of concern needs To be the 1.6 million people who Are living in nursing homes and<eos> I thought this was just Going to be... pshew!<eos> Just like that.<eos> People would just take the idea And run with it.<eos> They didn't.

So they let me out.<eos> They wouldn't have liked my cooking anyway.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I didn't know how to cook.<eos> I still don't.

How Cohle worked it, especially.<eos> Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?
Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.

And then, uh, you and Barb can split the rest.<eos> Uh, my roommate is on a diet.<eos> He'd kill me if I bring home cake.<eos> You had a good couple of months.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You shouldn't have scared them so they'd vote against me.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> You told some of them if I wasn't laid off, they would be.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.
He got out.<eos> There was no way he was getting through that roadblock.<eos> And where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.

Okay?<eos> Then we have two and a half hours of flex time.<eos> You could have at least brought me something to wear.<eos> I did.
Okay?<eos> I guess I didn't because part of me thought that Jason might've been right about you.<eos> But things are different now.<eos> I never knew how much Nardo loved you.<eos> But I do now.
So the BE is considered an illegal trespass, a misdemeanor... leaving the charges entirely in the hands of the victim, I.e., Ruby, I.e., my BFF.<eos> What she said.<eos> So, girlfriend, what are you up to?<eos> Where I come from, they just say "thank you."<eos> No, they don't.

Come on, I'll take you home.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> What else am I gonna do?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
He's away at the war.<eos> Then I want to go too.<eos> Really?<eos> But then who will look after me?<eos> I will, Mummy.
Evasiveness.<eos> - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his résumé.<eos> How did he explain it?<eos> He won't.
- Yes, sorry.<eos> The friend.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Dad, don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
- It's cheese on cheese.<eos> See?<eos> You know, sometimes you gotta play to your strengths.<eos> - You should stitch that on a pillow.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Okay?<eos> Hey...<eos> If I don't make it...<eos> Stop.<eos> You will.
My sister's different. Yes.<eos> She is.<eos> I'm glad you had a chance to meet Clarissa, spend some time with her.<eos> So you're... you're acting like I'll never see her again.<eos> Of course you will.
He made a deal with the Seelie Queen.<eos> Luke's warned all the other Downworld leaders.<eos> Damn Valentine.<eos> If Valentine gets to that lake...<eos> He won't.
We're not going sightseeing.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Well, damn.<eos> All right, Jesse, Wally, you make sure this city's safe while I'm gone, all right?<eos> We will.
Iris, hey. Come on.<eos> Hey, hey, I love you, okay?<eos> I love you more than anything.<eos> That part has never changed.<eos> It never will.
They're using their powers at the same time.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - Can't he phase or something?<eos> - That doesn't work on these guys.<eos> - Well, what will?
How you feeling? Fine.<eos> Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.<eos> How am I supposed to find the antidote if I'm laying here...<eos> We'll take it from here. Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
Yeah, I don't like it, but it... makes sense, I guess. And it clears Megan.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Megan!<eos> I won't have you disgrace Mark's memory by saying he abandoned his family.<eos> I won't.
No fucking way.<eos> Megan!<eos> I won't have you disgrace Mark's memory by saying he abandoned his family.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
She's running you.<eos> She wants Broussard.<eos> - So give him to her.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You won't.
Sign 'em, Handsome.<eos> You're not fooling anybody.<eos> And by the way, my tubes are tied.<eos> You gotta fix this door.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Feel that, though. - Ow.<eos> Man. - Ooh.<eos> My bad.<eos> Billy, don't leave me again.<eos> I won't.
Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe. Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.<eos> And it will.
We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions." The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> - He might.<eos> - No, He won't.
If I had known what was going to happen on Eros, I would have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre mao along with it and you know that!<eos> Eros nearly destroyed this planet.<eos> You will have to answer for your part in that.<eos> I know...<eos> And I will.
- I said I don't talk about that.<eos> - But there was a statue...<eos> - Klaus, I said I don't talk about that.<eos> You don't talk about that?<eos> Or you won't?
Because I don't, I don't want there to be any secrets.<eos> Bad stuff happens.<eos> In our line of work, it happens all the time.<eos> How do I know you're not gonna run next time it does?<eos> I won't.
Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.<eos> We will never fight for you.<eos> You will.
Maybe.<eos> Just us girls next time.<eos> We can braid each other's hair.<eos> We can still catch her.<eos> I will.
And if Hope should ever find out?<eos> She worships you, Niklaus.<eos> She must not see the monster.<eos> I do not wish for her to see me as a monster, but I cannot sit idly by while threats to our family to go unanswered.<eos> They won't.
I won't fail again.<eos> - Who do you think's gonna pay for this Zurich Polytechnic, huh?<eos> The same people who pay for you to keep plundering your businesses into the ground.<eos> Mother's family. - That's who. - Oh.<eos> Like hell they will.
I'll see you at home.<eos> Bye, Mommy!<eos> Bye, other lady!<eos> They don't know about me.<eos> They will.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
- The best smack talk?<eos> No talk at all.<eos> I wish restaurants still had smoking sections, you know?<eos> You should run for office on that platform, Ma.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself.<eos> You can't see a thing outside, man.<eos> Right up against the front door.<eos> When is the police coming?<eos> They will.
- No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?<eos> - They won't.
5 shillings?<eos> That is handbound in kid leather.<eos> You won't find another in London.<eos> - If you could give me credit...<eos> - I will not.
Unlock the 49 gates of wisdom...<eos> I wanted to see what a believer like yourself made of Dee's angels and demons.<eos> and make your plan for us known!<eos> Are there others amongst you who dare to look into the flame?<eos> I will.
Your mom wanted you to find her.<eos> And maybe next year, we'll all go together once you do.<eos> - If I do.<eos> If I do.<eos> - You will.
- to obtain sufficient heat.<eos> - We'll all put our hand to it.<eos> I didn't say I'd take on the task.<eos> Well, of course you will, James Read.<eos> Of course he will, Henry.
This city.<eos> This does not exist, does it?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
♪ You'll never know, dear ♪ ♪ How much I love you ♪<eos> ♪ So please don't take ♪ ♪ My sunshine away. ♪<eos> All right, old man.<eos> I let you sleep 'cause we had a late night, but those ducks ain't gonna wait all day.<eos> Well, actually they probably will, but I won't.
I just wanna honor her, you know, and her memory.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think the only way to really honor her is to catch this killer who took her life.<eos> And we will.
Preset coordinates engaged.<eos> We should be getting our first look at the ring right about... now.<eos> The ring is dark.<eos> She didn't get it done.<eos> She will.
- I want to continue my climb.<eos> Here.<eos> - What'd your mom say about it?<eos> - She gets it.<eos> Or... or she will.
Actually, I'm not sorry.<eos> I care and I'm not going to apologize for that.<eos> - The boy's woke.<eos> Come find me later.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll...
I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.<eos> But they will now.
Go to thermal, go to thermal.<eos> Targets acquired.<eos> Behind the umbrella.<eos> That didn't buy us much time.<eos> No, but this will.
It's irreversible brain damage after six minutes.<eos> It matters to this guy.<eos> If I come up there, I lose my guy!<eos> If you stay there, we lose two people!<eos> No, we won't, all right?
Miss, please, help me.<eos> Just try to stay still.<eos> Let me see what we're dealing with.<eos> I don't want to die alone.<eos> You won't.
No contact.<eos> You have protocols in place for when she does make contact.<eos> And an understanding that she'd reach out day one.<eos> She didn't.<eos> She will.
I...<eos> I guess I was a little aggressive about this thing with my boss.<eos> I may have said a little too much.<eos> It'll work out.<eos> Yeah, it will.
What are you thinking, Christopher?<eos> Well, there's no time to explain, all right, trust me.<eos> Get the name of the horse Garcia's betting on, and then get back to me ASAP.<eos> Hey, just for the record, I have no idea what's going on.<eos> Oh, you will.
Oh, well, I think I can handle you, Uncle Albert.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> Oh. Yes, you will.
Let's go!<eos> - I see you!<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Stay there.<eos> - No, I won't.
- Mother's waiting in the truck... - Mm-hmm. ... and she's patient until she isn't.<eos> Oh, and I've got to get to work, too, before all the single gals show up.<eos> It's pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom crying and the half-eaten chocolates getting hurled at the wall.<eos> - Have a good one.<eos> - I will.
- Well... since you've asked for my advice, Marilla, I would humour her a little while longer.<eos> You really think it's better she continue to stay at home?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is, I wouldn't say "school" again until she's said it herself.<eos> And she will.
Homeland is streaming me video feed from the traffic camera closest to the diner.<eos> Bishop... why are you looking at Kai Chen's file?<eos> I was deleting it.<eos> Please, for your own sanity, leave tracking Chen to the others.<eos> I will.
Just going over that Norfolk case.<eos> We did pretty good work in there.<eos> That's a pretty long report.<eos> Maybe you want to take a load off.<eos> I will.
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.<eos> The things we miss, the rituals...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - She doesn't like me.<eos> - She will.
- Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
I've never felt this bad in my life, Gibbs.<eos> Just wait until it's 3:00 in the morning and your kid's running 104.<eos> You're just getting started.<eos> That's the point, I'm not starting. You know?<eos> maybe I never will.
I'm going.<eos> I'm not... Well, without me.<eos> All right.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Who is really good at windsurfing?<eos> Me.<eos> Good thing these guys are having their reunion, too. Yeah.<eos> - I hope this works.<eos> - It will.
Aren't you going, Minami?<eos> The main guest arrives last.<eos> Get going and get ready for when I arrive.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
Well, thank you.<eos> We will.<eos> Good, that's great. I'll see you up there.<eos> Good. Well, you say we'll be there and on time. - Sweet.<eos> I will. - Yeah.
Dreamed I got myself skewered.<eos> I couldn't do nothing.<eos> Rifle's just there.<eos> It won't bite.<eos> Yeah, it will.
- Hi, Diane, can you hear me?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I can.<eos> Lee has read the talking points, right?<eos> Because I'm in a tough position here, and I just want to make sure that he sticks to the script.<eos> He will.
We never had any problems with him.<eos> I know Albert White.<eos> I thought you would rather deal with someone who treats you as human beings.<eos> This may cause bloodshed.<eos> It sure will.
Queen to rook five.<eos> Checkmate in three.<eos> Learn from loss, Freya, and your day will come.<eos> Your possibilities will be endless once the magic awakens in your heart.<eos> It won't.
We're mighty far from children, Bitch Queen.<eos> Adorable.<eos> Bring me the Mirror.<eos> You'll have to kill me first!<eos> No, I won't.
- What'll you be doing tonight?<eos> - Singing... At a little club off MacDougal... Called "Molly's."<eos> You should come along sometime.<eos> I'm there almost every night.<eos> Maybe one day I will.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - My meal!<eos> - Oh, you want your food?<eos> - Yes I want to!<eos> - Will the Ape Man his banana?
I've failed him, in life.<eos> I won't fail him in death.<eos> Help me find the others like you.<eos> Perhaps they don't want to be found.<eos> They will.
What do you mean?<eos> I'm bringing you to the man village.<eos> What?<eos> Bagheera, I don't know man.<eos> You will.
Whereas he was just talking about boxing.<eos> No, he meant it metaphorically in the movie, so...<eos> - Yeah. Still, though, innit?<eos> - Don't tell anyone about this phone call.<eos> All right then, I won't.
It's always fun to get something from the airport.<eos> Feels like you've travelled, too.<eos> Ma, he's turning one.<eos> Don't think he'll be discerning what gift came from where.<eos> But I will.
Well, I'm sorry, my friend... the Emperor took her soul last night.<eos> Run, Warrior, while you have the chance.<eos> Go in peace.<eos> Running won't give me peace.<eos> Then what will?
Some dark power inside and it's growing.<eos> Like a fire.<eos> I thought I was getting better.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.
One with fancy whores and fine whiskey and a chink with a pot of opium that's just begging for a man like you to come into his life.<eos> You do what you need to do.<eos> I expect you earned it.<eos> But don't you ever, if I ever hear a whispering of you or that dog being even near these parts again, you'll be begging for the army to come get ya.<eos> But they won't.
I expect you earned it.<eos> But don't you ever, if I ever hear a whispering of you or that dog being even near these parts again, you'll be begging for the army to come get ya.<eos> But they won't.<eos> They won't ever find you.<eos> Nobody will.
Quick, quick, quick!<eos> I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.
I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Oh, he Will!
The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
She's alive.<eos> Oh, my God, Lauren.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How long do you think it will take for them to send another team?<eos> Maybe a day or a week, but they will.
I hardly know you.<eos> But you seem the solid type.<eos> But she...<eos> Has she seen me?<eos> She will.
One of them must have the camera.<eos> Ok, if you turn anything up or you're in any trouble, you call me straight away.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Please, be careful.<eos> Yeah, I will.
That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
Like that?<eos> Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line. If you get a strike, it's going to slice it right open. You know what happens then.<eos> What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.
What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Dad, will they?
Okay, talk soon.<eos> She asked if you'd like to join her to an American Embassy reception this evening.<eos> - Was that her?<eos> - Yes, she's still in the meeting.<eos> When she will.
I think you've done enough, Reverend Ackers.<eos> My officers and the forensics team will be finished here soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr Lancaster, I assume you will remain in Little Malton for the time being?<eos> Well, of course he will.
"Its loveliness increases..."<eos> Arthur, this is not the time.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> No, I won't!

How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
- Yes, you are.<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> Oh, you will.
I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
Michael Connelly.<eos> - You ever read Harry Bosch?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Well, you'll have some time to read now.<eos> No, I won't.
Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will.<eos> They will.
You're gonna get her killed.<eos> Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday.<eos> Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there.<eos> What if Erica Kravid sees it too?<eos> She probably will.
I'd treat ya right.<eos> Protect ya with my life.<eos> If you'd have me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Hey!<eos> Listen. You need to run from this place, fast and as far as you can<eos> before death catches up with you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> It Will.
Get out of it!<eos> - Go on, take the photograph! -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)<eos> Tommy.<eos> Arthur, get the bastards in the house.<eos> I will. I will. john!
Wait, you're leaving us?<eos> What is this, a party?<eos> Yeah, and I want you to do the honors.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Oh, you will in a second.
ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know, it slows down production.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Night work will have to end.<eos> It will.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Night work will have to end.<eos> It will.<eos> It will.
Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
Alfred, please.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Hey, buddy, move your car!<eos> Just... just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
So... you're really doing this?<eos> Not my call.<eos> Prepare the patients for transport to the upstate facility.<eos> If even one of your patients were to escape...<eos> They won't.
I've not seen you for three weeks, not properly.<eos> And then nothing.<eos> Jack shit for five days.<eos> You're overreacting, you're reading too much into stuff.<eos> - Well, people will.
Listen.<eos> Will you promise me something?<eos> In fact, let's make a promise to each other.<eos> I don't know if this child will ruin our lives.<eos> He probably will.
Like with Kelly.<eos> When she died, I was devastated.<eos> But... now that she's gone,<eos> I mean, I-I love Kelly.<eos> I always will.
- Okay? I'm not leaving 'cause of Leah.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Dude, this party is fucking weird as hell anyway.<eos> All right. Tell Mom and Dad I said hi.<eos> - Okay, I will.
Oh, one more thing, stop calling them motherfuckers and talking about how hot my mom is.<eos> Well, she's sneaky sexy, took me by surprise.<eos> Dude, she is a MILF, like a genuine MILF.<eos> And if it wasn't your MILF, she'd be a MIWF... a mother I would fuck.<eos> Mmm-mmm. But I won't.
Yeah, but nobody thinks I should have it.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I'm looking at your right now, and you're a natural. You know, but it's not going to be easy.<eos> You know, with everything that you did. You got to really prove yourself to the rest of the family.<eos> I will.
Lewis, what happened?<eos> Who did this? I don't know.<eos> We kept filming like you said.<eos> -I did?<eos> -You will.
- Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and... everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> I'm good.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
There's a girl...<eos> Dolores.<eos> Better than I deserve.<eos> But maybe someday soon we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of.<eos> No, you never will.
What should we prioritize?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand.<eos> It's all in the document. You take that severance package, and you leave Hooli immediately.<eos> But the most important aspect is the non-disclosure, non-disparagement clause, in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press, in public, or in private about Hooli or Gavin Belson.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Are you sure about the identification?<eos> Hospital ID card, and I saw her face.<eos> It's Charlotte DiLaurentis.<eos> Stay with her until she falls asleep.<eos> I will.
To what?<eos> - Well, to the welfare people.<eos> - No.<eos> - They'll look after you.<eos> - No, they won't.
Don't rush me, I'm trying.<eos> And I'm nervous, what do you expect?<eos> You won't understand and you'll take it all the wrong way.<eos> I'll understand, no matter...<eos> No, you won't.
What happened?<eos> I thought we agreed.<eos> We rationalized, but we can't trust him.<eos> We sold our souls, and we may never get anything in return.<eos> Yes, we will.
All I've ever wanted is for my boys to be something in life and in racing.<eos> So just...<eos> Just think again, yeah?<eos> For me.<eos> No, I won't.
You were right, it erm...<eos> has always been about me.<eos> I have... tried to live my life through my kids, which I shouldn't have.<eos> I just wanted you to have the shot at success I never got.<eos> And I will.
I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
Our home.<eos> We need you, and everyone back there needs us right now.<eos> It's... it's gonna go wrong out here.<eos> We'll square it.<eos> I will.
Who's talking that shit?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Look, Lar, we just want to make a plan.<eos> This is Bobby's mess. He has to clean it up.<eos> We will.
- I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.<eos> And they never will.
Tall, strong, commanding.<eos> And I bet he's like that day and night.<eos> Mary, it's Sunday.<eos> Please have some shame.<eos> I will not.
When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.
Out there in the open, taunting their prey.<eos> There's no need to hide when you've got the numbers.<eos> Ah, but do they?<eos> He's dying of thirst.<eos> We will, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. What are you talking about?<eos> The world is going to end in two hours.<eos> I need you to take my mother there.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
- To stop Hive.<eos> You think that she can do it?<eos> Get us some rope in case she can't.<eos> You know killing me won't make the pain go away.<eos> Or will it?
During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it.<eos> Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
I'm all right.<eos> I'm just getting my second wind.<eos> There's nothing to be ashamed of, Alec.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You will.
I don't know why we thought we could do this again.<eos> Do you think we're selfish?<eos> To have a family?<eos> Because when Savage finds us--<eos> He won't.
- One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
Are you comfortable with the kids coming back here?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> You made a mistake, Ange.<eos> I mean, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
You'll be given food, shelter, and a letter of manumission.<eos> What is "a letter of manumission"?<eos> It's the piece of paper that states you're free.<eos> And slave masters will believe this paper?<eos> They will in England. Hyah!
Listen.<eos> There's some stuff going on by your place, possible outbreak, and it's got everybody worried.<eos> I think you should stay with me in Edgewood, just until this gets sorted out.<eos> I haven't heard anything about it.<eos> You will.
This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
You said always blackmail for something good, so I made a deal.<eos> I seduce Mrs. Powell's husband and she introduces me to a music producer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mrs. Powell knows a music producer?<eos> Yep, and now I will, too.
Yeah.<eos> Work is work.<eos> They're talking about me on Powers That Be.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> They will.
Well, you should probably worry about yourself.<eos> All right.<eos> We have a midsize.<eos> Who will be paying for this?<eos> He will.
You'll find all the knowledge and supplies that you'll need for your journey.<eos> Pull this off and you're homeward bound.<eos> Look, you said it was a day's hike.<eos> Why would we need all this shit?<eos> Maybe you won't.
And setting you up to take the fall.<eos> You think you have enough proof to build a case against him?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But DHS isn't gonna believe anything I found.<eos> Yeah, but maybe he will.
Gil!<eos> Hey, Jessie... hey, you want to do this, all right, he's got a point...<eos> you have to be careful.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
The new government of Pakistan has put a stay on death penalty.<eos> Sister... they've put an indefinite stay.<eos> It means Sarbjit's death sentenced has been postponed for now.<eos> This means... papa's coming home?<eos> Not yet... but he definitely will.
Hey, be safe today, ok?<eos> I finally got you back to reality.<eos> I want to keep you in one piece.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I will.
Come on in.<eos> Drive!<eos> Max, will you please tell me whatjust happened?<eos> You wouldn't believe me anyway.<eos> I will now.
So, I'm thinking... moo shu pork for life?<eos> What are we even looking for?<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> It will, biscuit.
Travelers' training wheels.<eos> Your body stays here; your mind travels.<eos> It's like being a ghost.<eos> Meditating won't stop you from having a wet dream and waking up in the Marianas Trench.<eos> This will.
Seth.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They have no idea what's coming, do they?<eos> They will.
You have no proof of anything.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> Because while she may be in Argentina now, she's not gonna stay there forever, which means when she gets back,<eos> I get you for witness tampering. Do me a favor and leave me the hell alone.<eos> I will.
I'm just saying that if for some reason I was responsible for taking away your dream...<eos> That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.
I guess you found one.<eos> I guess it's time to get busy living and get busy dying.<eos> Well, that's goddamn right.<eos> Watch your back in there, Mike.<eos> I will.
But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Who the hell are these guys?<eos> We can't be late.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> ARAM:<eos> Yeah, and we will.
We need to find out what Krystal knows about Van Lier.<eos> You're with me, yeah?<eos> Keep trying Cosima, S. Let's get to the bottom of this.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - We will.
10 more minutes, and I might start to regret all the times I tried to shoot and stab you.<eos> I think you're my favorite person I ever knocked out.<eos> Definitely top two or three.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
So who told you Malick's here?<eos> Not at liberty to discuss.<eos> So it's your friend Henry?<eos> One of these days I'm gonna have - to meet this guy, right?<eos> - One of these days you will.
- Thank you for visiting. - Westworld.<eos> The train will be departing in 15 minutes.<eos> You think you'll never lose control of this place.<eos> Of us.<eos> But you will.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, this is a good start.<eos> We got a lot to go on.<eos> You got to bring him in, Ruzek. You got to get this guy.<eos> We will, all right?
The counter-raids are a resounding success.<eos> Jingim does us proud once again.<eos> My son.<eos> Kaidu will think twice about further treason.<eos> No, he won't.
And I love it.<eos> Hey, you know, this place isn't what I expected.<eos> Oh, life here is great.<eos> I'd just like to enjoy it a little more.<eos> And you will.
I don't know, it's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Well, supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off, and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> What if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
Don't rush, darling.<eos> It'll take him an hour to get to the front door.<eos> And then an hour to get through the bloody thing!<eos> Now, don't forget the two things we discussed.<eos> - I won't.
Get back!<eos> Clear back!<eos> Come on!<eos> Woman: Somebody call 911!<eos> Man: I will!
I'm willing to take the heat, sir.<eos> - There are no other options, sir, not if we want to rescue the hostages by Takehaya's deadline.<eos> This way, we get the fuel we need and we get answers from Peng about what's going on.<eos> I need to hear from you before the 36-hour deadline, either way.<eos> You will, sir.
They're letting me say good-bye before I go.<eos> You should run.<eos> She should not, Luca.<eos> Thank you for believing in me.<eos> I always will.
Clarke, come on!<eos> We can't hold them off.<eos> It's now or never, Clarke.<eos> Once A.L.I.E.'s upgraded, I won't be able to help you anymore.<eos> But I will... in the City of Light.
Great job.<eos> You're almost done.<eos> Just take the sterilized end of the tube, and slide that in next to the nail.<eos> Ah, nothing much is coming out!<eos> It will.
The day the police arrested Phil.<eos> He knew I liked cats, so he thought I might like poems about them, too.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You don't have to tell him that.<eos> I won't.
Captain, nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're a bit of a legend around these parts.<eos> Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago.<eos> So far, no one's gotten close.<eos> Yeah, well, they will.
Your fellow Powers need you.<eos> I can't. I...<eos> I can't.<eos> Calista, I would give anything to have my powers back and get out there and stop this, but I don't have them.<eos> I never will.
And if this is how it ends...<eos> It was meant to be.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Promise me you'll look after Savannah and my baby.<eos> Of course we will, but so will you.
Of course we will, but so will you.<eos> Derek?<eos> Derek?<eos> Promise me you'll look after Savannah and my baby.<eos> Of course we will, but so will you.
And remind him we killed the last group of soldiers we couldn't pay?<eos> No.<eos> First we pay the army, then we crush the Red Knights.<eos> But we don't have the money.<eos> We will.
They'll beat any price.<eos> And you heard about this item where?<eos> Antiquities market is small.<eos> People talk.<eos> And so will you.
I am close.<eos> Okay.<eos> And may the best detective win.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
We actually became good friends.<eos> And the fact that he did all of this, you know, to... to help... it... he's just very nice, and... and I think that you should thank him.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, he really is.<eos> Uh... and I will.
April, what if I can't?<eos> What if I make her worse?<eos> This woman's counting on me, and I promised that I could help.<eos> Then you will.<eos> You will.
Answers you want--<eos> I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing. And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
It's New York.<eos> It's a six-hour flight.<eos> It's weekends and phone calls.<eos> You can figure it out.<eos> You will.
No.<eos> You were perfect.<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Should I find Gayle?<eos> - No, I will.
Well, so far we've had arguments from Marcel and from Carlos.<eos> Carlos has proposed Luis, and Marcel has proposed Carlos.<eos> We're just missing you two.<eos> Would you start, Veronica?<eos> Yes, I will.
All clear.<eos> I'll be right outside if you need anything.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> You should really call this woman.<eos> Okay, I will.
Want to be a tax lawyer now?<eos> Hadn't thought of that.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
- Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
- Just that it was important.<eos> You seem stressed.<eos> Well, I am stressed.<eos> We will be curtailing Emma's privileges for the next few weeks and we would like you to talk with her so she understands the gravity of the situation.<eos> We will.
Let's have a chat, shall we? Are you a cop?<eos> The other detective said I was free to go!<eos> Not quite.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
You should be persuading me but you're doing the opposite.<eos> It's because I'm black?<eos> They've never seen a black person in Marly-Gomont.<eos> So what?<eos> Now they will!
Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Mitch will.
Emma, you're not.<eos> You don't always have to rescue me.<eos> - It's not like I do it on purpose. - ‭<eos> - Get home safe, okay?<eos> - Yeah, I will.
He was young and stupid.<eos> [Dion] I learned a ton from you.<eos> So we'd love it if you would swing by the restaurant and give us a chance to-- well, give me a chance, to...show you... that I think my cooking can meet your standards.<eos> And if it doesn't?<eos> It Will.
Who actually voted for that guy, anyway?<eos> Eh, folks who like to party.<eos> Which, for better or worse, is more than half of New Orleans.<eos> Well, I don't trust the guy.<eos> Never will.
Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
No, check that, she's gonna insist on helping, and by helping, I mean she's gonna go in there like a fully strapped mama bear that makes<eos> We could use a secret weapon.<eos> Think I should have left my family in protective custody?<eos> I think you still need to call your wife.<eos> I will.
And maybe have some fun.<eos> You're about to step into some very dangerous territory, Zho.<eos> You're already there.<eos> You just don't know it yet.<eos> But you will, very soon.
You know, I feel if you had found a witness, we wouldn't be having this nice of a conversation.<eos> I'm done talking.<eos> But feel free to stay and watch me eat my steak.<eos> We have to find that kid before the Turk does or he's dead.<eos> We will.
One, dog just pooped in the hallway.<eos> And two, Santa Monica PD just called.<eos> We got another hit on the marked bills. Let's go.<eos> Just stay out of trouble.<eos> I absolutely will.
Did you see the cranberry muffins in the breakroom?<eos> I got them at the girls' bake sale.<eos> I'm not hungry, thanks.<eos> Well, Bonnie, you need to eat something.<eos> I will...
I was thinking about joining, so...<eos> Oh, you should. We could use all the talented singers we can get.<eos> You should come to rehearsals tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.
You should come to rehearsals tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> I mean, I'm probably busy, but, you know...<eos> -So maybe I won't, so...
I didn't bring it up.<eos> You did.<eos> How come you never wrote about it in any of your books?<eos> Mummification.<eos> Maybe I will one day.
But it is, dear sister.<eos> For in death, Cade was triumphant.<eos> From that moment onward, evil men would be forever punished for their wicked deeds.<eos> Cade had his revenge.<eos> And someday, so will we.
He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
Okay, maybe... we should start with our words.<eos> Perhaps as Lucifer's friend, you can talk to him.<eos> Express how you feel.<eos> He won't listen.<eos> But maybe someone else will.
It was everything.<eos> You were everything.<eos> And even when people made fun of me... younger girls at work, shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos and saying you're a joke...<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> And I never will.
Onwards and upwards.<eos> He's gone big.<eos> And he'll go bigger.<eos> And we will stop him.<eos> We will.
- protecting her feelings.<eos> - Just tell me.<eos> Calvin Hastings' wife moved heaven and earth to get their child put on a wait list for the Circle of Friends preschool, which is the finger paint feeder for all the best prep schools in DC.<eos> Hastings doesn't even have a preschool-aged child.<eos> He will soon enough.
I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
Lord, though I want,<eos> I've already put you in danger.<eos> I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
Oh! He's alive.<eos> He's moving!<eos> - What?<eos> - Be careful.<eos> I will.
But ever since you got here...<eos> What?<eos> Well, if you got something to say, say it.<eos> OK.<eos> I will, father.
These Europeans are not going to be deterred by words alone.<eos> Then they must learn to show respect.<eos> Three kneelings and nine knockings of the head upon the ground.<eos> They don't understand our rituals.<eos> But they will.
Yo, I got to head to Canelo's.<eos> This late?<eos> Why? With all the power out, there's gonna be looting.<eos> Gabe doesn't know about the night job.<eos> And he never will.
Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
You should've used the shears.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But I'm still the Savior, and I don't care what price I pay for it.<eos> Spoken like a thief who's never had to pay a price for anything.<eos> But you will.
Who are we without our principles?<eos> Alex, it was an impossible choice.<eos> I know, and you had to make it and you will again, a-and the choices will always be impossible.<eos> That's not gonna change.<eos> But y-you will, and I will, and... this will.
My name, actually, to buy it.<eos> Well, maybe he did the same thing with Carl Brubaker.<eos> It could give us another location Scratch is hiding at.<eos> Garcia, can you run financials?<eos> Yes, I will.
If you post it, Hermie, they will come, baby.<eos> Hey, Sylvie.<eos> Hey, you leaving?<eos> Yeah, I have an early Zumba class, but, um, give Louie a hug for me, okay?<eos> Yeah, damn straight I will.
I'm sorry. I just haven't gotten around to it.<eos> - Um, I'll do it right after class.<eos> - See that you do.<eos> Look, I know it sucks, but you really should get that done.<eos> I will.
Maybe I should postpone the mission, stay here with him.<eos> Ezra will be fine.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> (SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.<eos> We will.
In return?<eos> I will tell my son ivar to tell his brothers that you did everything you could to save me.<eos> That you and I, we are sworn friends and that king aelle was solely responsible for my death.<eos> That way, when my sons come back...<eos> And they will...
You can't... you can't blame yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you still don't have anything?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we will soon.
If you want to speak to an operator, press seven.<eos> We've never really gotten along with machines that talk and try to understand us.<eos> Who saw you?<eos> She saw me.<eos> - And maybe we never will.
needs to be saved.<eos> Clancy doesn't want you to respond, Agent Cowles.<eos> Sloman.<eos> He doesn't want you there when it happens.<eos> But you will.
They used a sharpie.<eos> You're gonna go to church with that on your face.<eos> Why don't you walk right up to the pastor and say,<eos> - "Hey, I've got a penis on my face"? - I will.<eos> Oh, you will?
Mr Prince!<eos> It seems that you've finally done something...<eos> Let go.<eos> You'll tell the Businessman? How essential I've been?<eos> Yes, I most certainly will.
No, I'm not. That was a lie.<eos> So, then I...<eos> You will come to the party and I cannot stop trailing off.<eos> - All right.<eos> - But I will now.
Ladies and gentlemen, the program will be starting momentarily.<eos> But then, Apple stopped innovating, and I saw something better.<eos> Joanna, I know schools aren't going to buy a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.<eos> You know I know that.<eos> But Apple will.
You promised to help me find my mom!<eos> Then I un-promise!<eos> That's not how it works!<eos> You have to help me get to Paris.<eos> I will not!

You want to see and hear<eos> The most marvelous,<eos> Fabulous, spectacular...<eos> Thrilling show ever.<eos> And you will.

I know this is the last day of school... But first, before we leave, we need to finish picking our partners for this year's summer pen-pal project.<eos> When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The next name is... Pigpen!<eos> I will.
- Schroeder.<eos> - I do!<eos> I mean, I will.<eos> Charlie Brown.<eos> I will.
Your choice.<eos> Four babies, my choice.<eos> That'd be all?<eos> We'll fight a good deal.<eos> We will, will we?
It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> We all will.
- I can't watch this.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Here we go!<eos> - He's still not flying.<eos> - He will.
- It would mean a lot of traveling.<eos> - Yes, I expect so.<eos> You'll love that.<eos> She hasn't said "yes" yet.<eos> Well, she will.
I can't go to jail. I'll die in there.<eos> That's not gonna happen, James, because I'm gonna put my investigators on this twenty-four-seven until we find out who really did this.<eos> Just stay in county lines with that thing on. Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals will be down there pronto.<eos> Son, I want you to stay strong. Do you hear me?<eos> I will.
Katia.<eos> Katia.<eos> Do you know why you're still alive?<eos> Because I chose not to kill you.<eos> But they will.
Yeah, but Anatoli, you're guiding for Scott this year.<eos> You have people's lives in your hands.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Never used it.<eos> Never will.
Five years ago, you were demoted to traffic<eos> - because of your health.<eos> - That's just an excuse.<eos> Please. Share the truth with me.<eos> Okay, I will.
It's like goodbye.<eos> Say something else.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kiss Jack for me.<eos> I will.
We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
I wish I could do more.<eos> I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.<eos> It's time we fight back.<eos> We don't have the numbers.<eos> We will.
Frank said we can fix this.<eos> - We just need more time.<eos> - Oh, no. It's too late for that.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> But you will.
My...<eos> My dear friend Bobby, the best gift he ever gave me... was his friendship.<eos> And now he's giving his legacy to me to share... with this young man.<eos> You're not going to let us down, are you?<eos> No, you won't.
Right, L.B.?<eos> I hate to make the wooing too easy for you, but where do I sign?<eos> Just one thing.<eos> If you're gonna work for me, I never, ever want to see anything like this again.<eos> You won't.
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Surely, as an avid reader you know that the husband of a princess can only be discovered through a tournament.<eos> So I won't choose him myself.<eos> What if I don't love him?<eos> You will love him, Violet.<eos> You will.
It is too far.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> We'll just, we'll sit tight, we'll be okay.<eos> Someone will come.<eos> No they won't.
I've gotta be honest, kid, this is not my proudest day as a grandfather.<eos> Oh!<eos> Livvie.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I Will.
- I know.<eos> I know.<eos> - Right, Dad?<eos> - I know.<eos> - They will.
She doesna understand what she nearly cost us.<eos> Aye.<eos> And she needs to.<eos> Do you think they'll ever speak to me again?<eos> They will.
When I leave here, you think I'll be walking?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're nuts.<eos> You'll never walk in 5 weeks.<eos> She will.
I got you.<eos> And five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Well? What happened?<eos> Why aren't we jumping?<eos> We will, we will.
Lack of experience.<eos> Nepotism.<eos> That's right.<eos> - And you think I'm a dilettante.<eos> But plenty of people will.
- Yes, yes.<eos> We were just driving into town and saw your light and wanted to stop by.<eos> Well, feel free to stop by anytime.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you.<eos> We will.
Oh yeah.<eos> Okay, I can't wait.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> I have to get off the phone.<eos> I will.
You have regular custom with the men of Captain Flint's crew, yes?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Just one. He won't let the others near me.<eos> Has he paid you a visit yet since his recent arrival?<eos> No, but he will.
- I do.<eos> In fact, I gotta go take my son to school.<eos> Come on, I gotta get Will.<eos> - All right, tell him I say hi.<eos> - I will.
Wonderful!<eos> What a great son Mr. Bhalla has.<eos> Super!<eos> But the problem is that the bakery.. ...Is on your ancestral land.<eos> And your grandfather willed this land.. ...to you and your father.
Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.
Units on standby, ready for go.<eos> Good. Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
He isn't scared of me, just respects me.<eos> He loves his mother.<eos> And a son that loves his mother... has a beautiful heart.<eos> You don't understand, do you?<eos> You will one day.
I need more time.<eos> You go write, I'll be fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> I won't.
Let him go!<eos> - Put the gun down.<eos> - You put yours down.<eos> I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> I will.
They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
Okay, the last thing we need is an investigation into what happened here.<eos> Jeremy and Nick will arrive in an hour.<eos> They'll figure out how to get these people far away.<eos> Just as long as they don't remember any of this.<eos> No, they won't.
Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
When all the witches are dead, it will just be you and me.<eos> What are they planning?<eos> Clara wants to possess a new body.<eos> Who survives the Undoing?<eos> Clara will.
That the curse is lifting?<eos> That we won't be werewolves anymore?<eos> Jeremy wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it.<eos> Look, I know what it means for us not be a wolves anymore, but if it happens, our lives become easier.<eos> They will.
The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will.
Anything else?<eos> I know you said not to worry, But she's snooping around everywhere.<eos> It's making the kids freak out a bit.<eos> Well, tell them not to do that.<eos> I will.
Well, if it's your favorite, I'd like to try it.<eos> Here you are, sir.<eos> Hope you both have a wonderful evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
We're ifferent.<eos> I can't let myself...<eos> But you... I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
Well, tonight at the meeting... if it looks like it's going ba, I whistle.<eos> Carol grabs eanna, I take Spencer, you grab Reg,<eos> Glenn an Abraham cover us, watch the crow.<eos> - We can talk to them.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
You barbaric filth!<eos> There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.<eos> Please, please, I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will!
As I said...<eos> I live to serve.<eos> I'm going to ask him tomorrow.<eos> - What if he says no?<eos> - He won't.
And it's what I want.<eos> It's what we want.<eos> To end things on our terms.<eos> I told you that if you made it here you'd see Anne again.<eos> God willing, we will.
Please, you must take me to Sir Fletcher.<eos> He needs to be made aware of what's going on in here.<eos> Please.<eos> Will the Captain allow us to take the woman into custody?<eos> No. No, he will not.
Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
So... You had the ambassador kill the general of your country.<eos> You need to clear that up for me before we die.<eos> I follow orders, as you do.<eos> Well, in that case... I want to meet your boss.<eos> You will.
I promise to be gentle.<eos> Are you all right, Lydia?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I'll have to... try again.<eos> I'll...
Never will be.<eos> - But Dad said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> It's a Gallagher rite of passage, realizing he let you down.<eos> He always will.
Without family, we're nothing.<eos> But I can only lead you to the water, I cannot force you to drink.<eos> And we're back to horse metaphors.<eos> But you're right, you can't force me to drink,<eos> And I never will.
That's good, but it's not just that.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey - I'm happier now.<eos> I like the guy I am now.<eos> What happens when everything goes back to normal and you fall back into old habits?<eos> It won't.
She deserves, you all deserve, a fair share.<eos> I want to make sure you're all comfortable.<eos> Fuck off, Henry.<eos> Walt... ..I understand that you're angry at me, but Hedvig shouldn't have to suffer because of that.<eos> She won't.
- No, no.<eos> 60 enough?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Yeah, I sure will.
Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
Coming for a swim?<eos> Easy!<eos> You'll end up a fat cow at your wedding!<eos> Some will understand, others won't.<eos> Feminists won't.
Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin.<eos> We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.
I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
Your army is already there locked in cages.<eos> We just need someone on the inside to let them out. Bellamy.<eos> You have faith in him? I do.<eos> I hope your faith is well-placed because if he can't get inside, we can't win.<eos> He will.
Eng Sub by streamonline.ml<eos> Jasper, where do you want this?<eos> Put it here, no weak spots.<eos> We need to make sure they don't get in.<eos> They won't.
We have not, Your Honor.<eos> Allen charge.<eos> She's sending them back in.<eos> Still split, DA will retry.<eos> No, they won't.
It's weird, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I know Sara used to smile and laugh, but...<eos> But when I close my eyes and I try and picture it all I see is the way that I found her.<eos> Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the thought of one day finding her killer.<eos> We Will.
- Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> - If he gets to the fortress, we're dead.<eos> - He won't.
What have you found out?<eos> We're in the process.<eos> I assume that's code for nothing.<eos> - You promised me you'd have answers.<eos> - And I will.
Is Emma here?<eos> You said that you would keep her safe.<eos> Is there anything that you don't screw up?<eos> - I will find her.<eos> - No, you won't.
- I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> - Don't go. Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then crash and that was over there.<eos> I was only doing it, so you'll believe me.<eos> And now, you never will.
You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Don't leave me alone with it.<eos> What, with that?<eos> Lt.<eos> I won't.
I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go! Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Don't leave me alone with it.<eos> What, with that?<eos> It.<eos> I won't.
If he doesn't want to take them, call me.<eos> - I'll come help.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And he'll probably just sleep today, but keep a close eye, okay?<eos> I will.
What?<eos> I thought I killed you.<eos> Eleven years ago.<eos> Thereabouts.<eos> Maybe I still will.
- No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now, we'll... drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.

Learn to fight from me!<eos> - More jalebis.<eos> - Thanks, Samsher.<eos> - Please talk to Pari about our wedding.<eos> - Yes I will.
I happen to believe true paradise lies in his father's arms, to be here with you<eos> in this moment<eos> and that is not our choice.<eos> God has made his plans and we cannot question his design, just as my people cannot question mine,<eos> but they will.
He knows, Asher.<eos> You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students. But don't worry...<eos> I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
All right, it's...<eos> it's gonna be over soon.<eos> And these people are gonna help us. And we're all grateful, Ben.<eos> But somebody's gonna have to tell that girl.<eos> I will.
- You think I wanted this?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> To save yourself from hell, you acted without considering the consequences.<eos> It's not that I can't help you, John.<eos> I won't.
Joe, I want to thank you for giving my wings.<eos> You got your wings?<eos> I did. Well, I'm going to get them now.<eos> - Am I supposed to hear a clang?<eos> - You will.
America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.<eos> You name me one Republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every American who wants one and I will eat my hat.<eos> This isn't about dismantling government.<eos> It is about-- Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Told myself here's a man who looks like someone I met a long time ago.<eos> And then I realized... he is that man.<eos> I didn't meet you in 1987.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you will.
They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.

I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
So i did what all good hackers do --<eos> I dug into your records, Which appear to be fake.<eos> [ beeping quickens ] [ grunting ] She's going into shock.<eos> Why aren't the alarms sounding?<eos> They won't.
I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
Well, so much for being king.<eos> You think I can't be king?<eos> King Roland!<eos> Wouldn't he have to marry Marianne?<eos> Yes, and he will.
Whether or not your letter gets sent will be based on your behavior.<eos> Are there any questions?<eos> I have a question, Mr. Chief Correctional Officer.<eos> Uh, will we be allowed one phone call?<eos> No, you will not.
He's taking a drink after she does.<eos> That's called mirroring.<eos> It means that, whether he knows it or not, he has accepted her as the alpha.<eos> If she votes "not guilty,"<eos> he will, too.
He's free to take as many wives as he wants.<eos> Don't pretend it doesn't hurt, Mother.<eos> I know it does.<eos> He needs me, Ryder.<eos> And he always will.
Nothing happened.<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, i believe you.<eos> - So can we talk?<eos> - We will.
Was really hoping that shuttle'd still be here.<eos> And that's not the ride we're looking for.<eos> Agent Kallus, they must not escape!<eos> They haven't, Minister.<eos> They won't.
You do that well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've learned from a great Jedi too. Kanan.<eos> Mmm. You know, I don't think he likes me.<eos> Or ever will.
In short, inexperience is not a value. It is something to be...<eos> Mrs. Florrick, your time is up.<eos> Mr. Prady, in about ten minutes we'll have a verdict in the Cole Willis manslaughter case.<eos> Do you have a comment on that trial?<eos> Well, Chris, uh, I will in about ten minutes.
Your private time is poisoning the neighborhood, okay?<eos> This is Stink City, Phil.<eos> You know what, Carol, just...<eos> Do I go into your house and tell you what to do with your little lady turds?<eos> No, and you never will.
- Increase even further?<eos> Is everything OK over there?<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> No, I'll get it.<eos> - No, I will.
No, we should stay here.<eos> Eichorst will come for me.<eos> I know it.<eos> We have a chance to finish him.<eos> And we will.
And I'm not gonna let you or Anna Mueller or anyone else destroy what I've worked so hard to build.<eos> Calvin, you can't just kill innocent people.<eos> You'd be amazed what a private security corporation will do for the right price.<eos> Luckily, I can pay.<eos> You will.
I got to do it again!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on?<eos> They won't give me a second chance.<eos> Oh, the hell they won't.
I must show you something.<eos> Guns?<eos> For what purpose, Brother?<eos> Some in Salt Lake City will accept this revelation.<eos> Some... will not.
A pretty dress?<eos> Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wouldst thou like to see the world?<eos> What will you from me?
I still have some work to do.<eos> Ok.<eos> If you manage to make it back to 2077, give this to my father.<eos> There are some things I needed to say to him, to you, that I never had the chance to before I left.<eos> I will.
And those fires in tokyo.<eos> The world's not perfect.<eos> It never was.<eos> Tolerance is not gonna come overnight.<eos> No, it will not.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
I'm afraid I'm not the one whose forgiveness you really need.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She was an innocent.<eos> It's her you need to apologize to.<eos> We will.
You speak of General Horemheb.<eos> His ambitions are not consistent with my own.<eos> Once it is done, he too can be removed.<eos> You have the general's ear?<eos> I will.
You are the reason I was not there to raise my son.<eos> I never should have saved your life when the Horseman cut you down.<eos> I never should have put you to sleep.<eos> I should've let you die!<eos> And this time, I will.
Fine. Then what?<eos> Are you gonna be there for him in the fallout?<eos> Or is it only Hanna you care about?<eos> The kid is ready to put on his big-boy pants, and offer up a little insight.<eos> Otherwise, I will.
"Life will out."<eos> The origins and lessons of life and evolution are long and complex, but what they basically boil down to is, life will out.<eos> Life will always find a way to continue.<eos> Always.<eos> Life... will... out.
Which was packed with explosives.<eos> Eh, bad for him.<eos> Well, there was a "danger" sign.<eos> Guy's not gonna stop to read the sign if he's being chased by someone.<eos> Well, maybe next time he will.
Do you mind if I check your knives for blood?<eos> These men are gonna think that you suspect them.<eos> Well, at this point, I suspect everyone. Even you.<eos> All right, look, a lot of these guys are gonna make it because of the work that you've done, all right?<eos> And some of them won't.
I can be inscrutable.<eos> Did you look through my clothes?<eos> See you.<eos> Has he rung?<eos> He will.
Too much has passed between us.<eos> Too much you blame me for.<eos> While condA© remains untarnished.<eos> And now you want to go to him, Thinking it will erase your pain.<eos> It won't, mary.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> Me either.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I'm serious. - Don't do that.<eos> - I won't. I won't.
All right, here you go.<eos> It's all the cash we got.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> You stay safe out there, you hear?<eos> I will.
Who was that woman?<eos> She saw us together.<eos> She could tell anyone...<eos> it would mean our heads.<eos> She won't.
I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Man, some of these pieces are bent.<eos> Or rusted.<eos> They don't fit together;<eos> the escapement wheel doesn't seem to fit right.<eos> It will.
"The blind old fool really loved his son.<eos> What a wonderful father." Oh.<eos> There won't be a dry eye in the house.<eos> They'll never believe it.<eos> Ah, sure, they will.
Miss Kringle. Dinner, tonight.<eos> Chez Moi. 8:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You will.
- Who is this?<eos> - This is Eduardo Flamingo.<eos> Is that name supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But it will.
I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.<eos> I'm going to feast on your friends first.<eos> Save you for dessert.<eos> You try to run, I will find you.<eos> I won't.
If you bring me the name, I'll know it's real.<eos> Do you mean that?<eos> I'll call you after I talk to him.<eos> Still got to get the name.<eos> I will.
I knew it.<eos> I knew you still had feelings for me.<eos> Of course I have feelings.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I will.
- It won't be easy to keep this from her.<eos> - Frankly I'm not even sure we should.<eos> - If we tell her Julianna escaped, - she'll call off the wedding.<eos> - Tess is right.<eos> She will.
Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.<eos> Well, it sounds like you guys have a lot to talk about on the ride home, so good luck with that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Exactly.<eos> We're only a few hours away.<eos> Same state, same time zone.<eos> Won't have to miss me that much.<eos> But I will.
Okay.<eos> It was, uh, simple curiosity and, uh, gathering of the facts.<eos> Okay.<eos> If we're done with the film festival, do we have a plan "B"?<eos> Yeah, we will.
You're in big trouble, buddy.<eos> Your e-coupon for Big Mike's Calzones expires today.<eos> You're damn right. And if I don't redeem that, Big Mike is gonna get real suspicious.<eos> Big Mike is a cartoon with pizzas for eyes.<eos> All right, fine. Maybe not Big Mike, but someone will.
Now, the... the police are gonna take you to the airport.<eos> I have friends waiting for you on the other side.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad, please be safe.<eos> I will.
- Yeah.<eos> - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
Well, I should say my goodbyes.<eos> Nice day, huh?<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry I have to leave you so soon.<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> And now, you never will.
Just don't remember what that tree was.<eos> I think it was important.<eos> Yeah, it looks important.<eos> Let's not tell Jenkins.<eos> We won't.
I know what'll do you good.<eos> This is so good for me.<eos> I could slit my wrists any second.<eos> - Will you have raki?<eos> - She will.
What's that for?<eos> That's for my boss, Henrietta Lange.<eos> You've probably heard of her.<eos> No?<eos> Oh, well, you soon will.
Are they aware...?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
All the other evidence had closed?<eos> My sister was abducted when I was 12 years old, Inspector.<eos> The trail has gone very, very cold.<eos> You never stopped looking for her.<eos> I never will.
Whatever connection he thought we had whatever history he was implying we shared, I didn't care.<eos> You've discovered something curious about your husband...<eos> - He wanted me for a reason and I wanted to know why.<eos> He has diplomatic immunity. If anyone finds out--<eos> They won't.
Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> - You will.
Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> Um, kids, let's go see the babies.<eos> - It's nice and peaceful up there. - Excuse me.<eos> Dr. Edwards will take you.<eos> - I will?
I should go.<eos> We'll take care of the charges and the damages.<eos> - We'll spare no expense. - No, we will not.<eos> No, we will not. - We will spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.
I'm vegan.<eos> Hey, a girl's allowed to be complex, isn't she?<eos> You should eat, though.<eos> You heard from Baitfish?<eos> I will.
But if they give the OK, they don't give funds.<eos> - So?<eos> - So we have to find a sponsor.<eos> - Who'd give money like that nowadays?<eos> - Somone will!
Stay here.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Your dad's.<eos> I thought I told you not to go over there anymore.<eos> I won't.
We talk to Christine McNeil.<eos> Maybe she can tell us where the foster home was.<eos> Flag on the play there.<eos> She's not talking to anyone.<eos> Maybe she will.
That explains the nasty looks we received from people who wanted our table.<eos> Yeah. Can't eat pie fast, or you'll cramp.<eos> That is a science.<eos> Some day I would love to live in a world governed by your rules of physics.<eos> You will.
Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too.
You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.<eos> It's almost funny, really, given the service I once performed for you.<eos> You know, Mr Bates and I have always wanted children?<eos> And you'll have some now, I'm sure.<eos> No, I won't.
Our Father is here.<eos> Faith is useless in this world.<eos> That's not our truth.<eos> It's clear you don't believe in our faith.<eos> Perhaps you never will.
Left side!<eos> Michael, when you came to us, you were a stranger.<eos> Now you belong to us.<eos> Will you take the secrets and sins of our town into your heart?<eos> Yes, I will.
We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
He tried to make us believe he was dead because he had to.<eos> I mean, the only reason he gave his name up was because he thought we'd never get out of that hellhole.<eos> Okay, so what was Lesli?<eos> A speed bump. On the way to finding Charles.<eos> But we will.
- I'm proud of you.<eos> - You are?<eos> You're getting better.<eos> Just keep taking your meds.<eos> I will, Ali.
Come on.<eos> Mona?<eos> I have to know how the story ends.<eos> Hanna, be careful.<eos> We will.
I know that I'm no war hero or even brave, and I have sciatica, and--<eos> I do!<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean, um--<eos> - I will.
Come here.<eos> This is hard.<eos> I'm good at keeping my head together, but today...<eos> - Talk to Simon.<eos> - I will.
I think he's off having sex with Kate Parks again.<eos> You split with your husband. So, you can imagine something of what I'm feeling.<eos> I've known for a while.<eos> They have no idea.<eos> Well, they will now.
You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
- But we can't prove that.<eos> - So let's do something about it.<eos> Let's prove that not-really-FBI-Agent Ben Shafer was working for Reiden.<eos> - Instead of...<eos> - We will.
- I can't tell you.<eos> A member of my team.<eos> The good news is... I've been tracking channels, and there hasn't been any chatter. None.<eos> It's almost as if they haven't discovered his body yet.<eos> But they will.
I said I'd dropped off for a drink at the pub.<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> "He's been a real shit today."<eos> "He's talking through the sat nav now."<eos> But I will.
That's all I got.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I should have let someone know.<eos> Don't let this happen again.<eos> It won't.
- You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.
I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Of... by jingo, you will, yes, of course.
You can talk to me outside of class, you know. This isn't high school.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Have you found anything on my father yet? I mean, was he even in the FBI?<eos> I told you I'd let you know if I found something.<eos> And I will.
So, what the hell do we do now?<eos> Up.<eos> You're gonna tell me how this wire from your family business ended up as a part of those bombs.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> Oh, you will, eventually.
There's been a turn upstairs.<eos> We decided not to cooperate with your exercise.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> I'll have to cut 10.<eos> No, you won't.
I want him to find his place in the world.<eos> I just don't believe for a second it's here.<eos> And if you're honest with yourself, you'd agree.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will.
Calo, no!<eos> He got up to piss.<eos> I didn't hear a thing.<eos> The yard boss doesn't remember killing Calo.<eos> And he never will.
We won't do that now.<eos> I think she was very embarrassed.<eos> If it happens today so you will have to whisper.<eos> Do it then...<eos> -Now they will.
What does it mean when you put a bird on a tombstone?<eos> The desire to give the dead peace.<eos> I want a bird on mine.<eos> But you won't die.<eos> -Someday I will.
Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
I can... come to your hotel later this morning.<eos> That'd be great. Thank you.<eos> I'm looking forward to seeing you.<eos> We have to stop meeting like this.<eos> We will, actually.
And every fast food joint around the corner delivers diabetes to millions of people.<eos> Phillip Morris hands out lung cancer on the hour, every hour.<eos> I mean, hell, everyone's destroying the planet beyond the point of no return.<eos> Are you really gonna start taking all of these things so personally?<eos> Maybe I will.
And you robbed me of the greatest golf game of my life.<eos> How do you feel about that?<eos> It's disappointing.<eos> Will you be acting as your own counsel?<eos> I will, your honor.
We understand genocide.<eos> We do it sometimes.<eos> Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles might live?<eos> - Stop asking!<eos> - Yes, I will!
Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, And I tell him I'll give him a piece, He'll know it's worth a fortune to him<eos> And he'll overturn the vote. And what are you gonna do when he finds out The whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
Should I tell him about your situation?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?<eos> And you-- you be careful.<eos> I will.
Every one of Ivan Krupin's active agents here in Europe and Britain.<eos> Ask him yourself.<eos> He's in the next room, isn't he?<eos> I hardly think he'll talk to me.<eos> Of course he will.
You seem anxious.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> You're talking as if the attack is certain.<eos> These governments might give in.<eos> But they won't.
But I died with Lily's blood in my system...<eos> And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am...<eos> About everything.<eos> Maybe you never will.
What do you say?<eos> Why do they stare?<eos> They think you're pretty.<eos> Or they've never seen a Dane so close.<eos> But they will.
If you could be brief with the ceremony, Father Beocca,<eos> I'd be grateful.<eos> I have business with the king.<eos> The bride has been given her price?<eos> She Will.
My plea is for a fight to the death, lord.<eos> Me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the victor, and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he wins this fight to the death, what then?<eos> He will not.
eating oranges freshly plucked from the trees in Nice, dancing under the stars at the Louvre.<eos> Well, we were married there.<eos> Ah. So many ceremonies, so many nobles, and we barely got to dance.<eos> We will do all those things.<eos> We will.
So disappointing after the wrongs they've done to your noble family.<eos> You have a counteroffer?<eos> Don't sign away your claim to the French throne and England will make it worth your while with gold and military support.<eos> And if France retaliates against my country?<eos> They won't.
The only way to take him off the streets for good is to catch him red-handed. With his victim.<eos> By using her as bait.<eos> And what if you mess up?<eos> - What if you can't stop it?<eos> - I will.
I love her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
So fate's decided: it's you and me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No! - Let me come.<eos> - No. I don't know you.<eos> - You soon will.
Wow, three weeks, Andrew?<eos> Not too classy. Beverly Wilshire would've been nice.<eos> Obviously, you guys have a lot to discuss so I will, uh, let you carry on.<eos> You tell him what's up.<eos> I will.
Hopkins, I thought you were with us!<eos> And Bradford thought you were with him!<eos> You do as your governor says.<eos> If you will not give up Squanto...<eos> I will not.
There's a decoupling lever-- you flip it, it sends a signal.<eos> I accept the signal and then I have ten seconds to get onto your side before both cars separate.<eos> Okay, we have more than enough time, but you have to hurry.<eos> Okay, be careful.<eos> I will.
Oh, hang on, I'm getting another call.<eos> What's going on, Baxter?<eos> Quick Santa-related question.<eos> Candace and I were talking about getting Roscoe the new Xbox, but we won't if you think it might make you look bad.<eos> Well, actually, it will.
Which is the wrong approach.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.
That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that.<eos> _<eos> Okay.<eos> If the wrong people find it...<eos> The right people will.
The fat guy ate the bacon.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself because I lied to all of you, and I lied to the woman that I love.<eos> And I'll take whatever punishment you guys think is fair.<eos> I will.
He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
But still.<eos> Hey! Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
-Yes. - Take your seat.<eos> -Have some kimchi.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Zin-mi, you have to eat lots of kimchi.<eos> I will.
-Have some soup.<eos> -Zin-mi.<eos> -What?<eos> -You have to eat lots of kimchi.<eos> -I will.
Wow, you look way too relieved.<eos> Come on, we haven't really talked about this yet.<eos> But you know I've always wanted a big family.<eos> I think we need to think about this.<eos> Okay. I will.
- Yeah. Hey, you hear from Riddle?<eos> Yeah, I have it on good authority he's gonna be transferred to District 6. - Ooh.<eos> - That's airport duty?<eos> That's what I heard, but guys like him, they tend to have nine lives - at CFD, so keep one eye open.<eos> - I will.
Get in!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Sir, need you to stand back.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Like bloody hell I will!
You fail on primes, then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions?<eos> Can't be done, I'm telling you.<eos> Especially not by you.<eos> It can.<eos> And I will.
I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.<eos> Okay.<eos> But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.<eos> She'd kill me.<eos> I won't.
Get out of my big house!<eos> Go back to selling your coat hanger sculptures in Fisherman's Wharf!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I don't want her ever invited here again.<eos> I won't.
Hercules, the gods have offered us a gift.<eos> We must not squander it.<eos> Are your gods going to be fighting with us?<eos> No.<eos> The son of Zeus will.
No, John, I'm a realist.<eos> Connor is getting paranoid.<eos> If he thinks this kid has come here to... interfere with Angelina, then he and his pack are gonna come down from those hills and they'll kill him.<eos> And then they're gonna kill us for trying to hide him.<eos> - Maybe they won't.
I don't need to be puttin' up sex tapes from people who don't want their sex tapes up there.<eos> There's no shortage of sex tapes.<eos> Okay? You didn't have to break my fuckin' door!<eos> We're just incredibly sorry, sir, and we will pay for all the damages.<eos> Yes, you will.
Tortured me.<eos> You freed me.<eos> I would do anything you ask.<eos> But we must show strength!<eos> We will, Koba.
And you were the only one who didn't laugh at me.<eos> I was too scared to laugh.<eos> You were enormous.<eos> No matter where we end up next year, we have to watch the spelling bee together.<eos> Of course we will.
Otherwise, his brain would have... his head would have exploded.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> The skull was holding his brain... which was swelling, and his head would have just exploded.<eos> Just think of that next time you eat pig bacon.<eos> I will.
I will fight it... as hard as I can.<eos> Or...<eos> I can end this for you now.<eos> Before it gets... Messy... and painful.<eos> Because it will.
She may never think that I am good enough for her son but, what mother does?<eos> She has her flaws, Michael, yes.<eos> But she is the reason that you have become the man that you are and the man that I love so much.<eos> But she should still be apologizing to you.<eos> She won't, Michael.
Take advantage of it.<eos> But let me remind you that one bad choice, even a little one,<eos> I'm going to put you back inside for those remaining three years.<eos> I hope you won't make me do that.<eos> I won't.
I've tried to ignore it, but it didn't work.<eos> I know Uco has that fire.<eos> I had to lose a lot in my life before I could truly see that that was important.<eos> I don't want the same to happen to my boy.<eos> He won't, sir.
Happens all the time to... sod-buster banks in the territory. I've lost more than my fair share of this wild cat paper.<eos> D'you have any greenbacks?<eos> I spent it all.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. I cannot accept these banknotes.<eos> Nobody around here, will.
Will you pray with me?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Still can't get signal. Keep trying.<eos> I will.
I wanted to see you about... the vote on the bonus and me being laid off.<eos> Juliette and I saw Dumont. He'II let us hold another ballot Monday because...

Sir, she doesn't know.<eos> It is an art film from Italy.<eos> What is this?<eos> Next time you see my face, show some respect.<eos> I will.

We'll find it.<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> When I do, I'll email it to you.<eos> I hope you find it.<eos> We Will.
Sailor would never go for it, nor would I.<eos> But I would appreciate it if you and Max would be in my boy's corner.<eos> You gonna be at the fight?<eos> No. I've never seen one of Sailor's fights.<eos> Never will.
I got them for you.<eos> All of them.<eos> I told you I was gonna pamper you.<eos> Shall I sell the beach house on the Jersey Shore?<eos> Then, I won't.
One line, one line, one line.<eos> Just going to take a big, stinky shit while we wait. Perfect.<eos> Cool timing.<eos> Don't stare at that stick. Okay.<eos> I'll just...
All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> Christ, he's a big one.<eos> Stay alert, huh?<eos> We will.
I can't seem to get them on their cells or on the radio.<eos> You know what?<eos> They still got another half an hour.<eos> - Keep trying. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Live your life.<eos> 112,000, all in.<eos> - Don't want to count it?<eos> - Just make sure you keep your end.<eos> I will.
I told you, this is how a man makes a living.<eos> We'll talk business when I'm done.<eos> Well, how long's that gonna be?<eos> As long as it takes for me to beat these dozy bastards.<eos> And I will.
Stephen must live.<eos> I will see he gets everything he needs.<eos> I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.<eos> He may not survive the journey.<eos> Yes, he will.
The entitlements.<eos> Raising the age of eligibility to 67.<eos> Your people will never go for it.<eos> They will if the leadership does.<eos> And the leadership will.
Don't you feel him in the dark?<eos> On the back of your neck, his breath.<eos> Now one finger reaching out.<eos> Do you not feel it?<eos> Well, you soon will.
I might have fallen in love with you.<eos> You don't mind me saying that?<eos> You still might.<eos> Don't let me hurt anyone.<eos> I won't.
Everything will be OK.<eos> Sure ...<eos> No...<eos> Mommy, I want to leave here!<eos> We will, baby.
A little present for the future.<eos> Sister Monica Joan, come in out of the rain.<eos> I have no need of shelter.<eos> But you, you, Dr Turner, if you wish to solve a mystery, you must read this book.<eos> I will.

The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
Would you mind waiting while I... while I...<eos> Please.<eos> Deliver this to the spaniard.<eos> Nobody must know.<eos> Nobody will.
I don't know.<eos> I convinced him to take me there later tonight.<eos> But if I leave to stop the attack at the carnival, I won't be here to prevent him from mobilizing his army.<eos> Castor, if you want to prove to me that you've changed, you have got to stop Hadar.<eos> Of course I will.
Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
Honour?<eos> I have not earned a damn thing for two years.<eos> - Do you know about the transport center...<eos> - It will not happen.<eos> Yes, it will.
I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.
Rabbi,<eos> I will not fall away.<eos> I will lay down my life for you..<eos> Will you?<eos> I will.
He doesn't take a moment to catch his breath.<eos> He's got a million things on his mind at one time.<eos> I don't know that retirement is really in his vocabulary.<eos> And there are people here that are listening today who will see humans walk on mars.<eos> I won't, but they will.
The Chechens have already accessed the GLONASS.<eos> They've gone in and locked the door behind them.<eos> Allahu Akbar. Will your tribe come get you?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, well, mine will... eventually.
What's wrong?<eos> I forgot a doctor's appointment.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> We need to finish talking about this.<eos> Oh, we will.
My brother told me to leave and not come back.<eos> I'm not calling him.<eos> So my life is not worth your pride?<eos> They won't come.<eos> Or they will.
He was happy.<eos> He should be here.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Even if I wanted to apologize... you couldn't hear me.<eos> So I won't.
- What do you need?<eos> Know what I really miss about being home?<eos> My bed.<eos> I don't know if I even remember what a bed feels like anymore.<eos> And you probably never will.
The hospital is now running at a deficit of nearly $30,000 a year.<eos> Now, in light of this, I've taken the liberty of postponing the much-needed repairs in the courtyard.<eos> Now, Dr. Thackery, as you were Dr. Christiansen's Deputy Chief of Surgery, the board would like you to step into his position as Chief.<eos> We'd be grateful if you'd accept.<eos> I will, though with great regret.
All right, if... if you say so.<eos> Come on, Jacob.<eos> We'll meet them back at the house.<eos> Tell Jenny not to forget her possum.<eos> I will.
I don't even know what you mean.<eos> Well, I mean that he wasn't nearly as clever as you, but he was determined.<eos> His persistence really paid off for him, didn't it?<eos> Well, you tell me.<eos> I will.
I got to meet this lawyer. - So I'll call you after.<eos> - All right, cool.<eos> I'll buy the coffee, but I want you to do all the talking.<eos> I want to know what's going on.<eos> You will.
And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
Captain, I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> Even though I'm desperate to remain free.<eos> I shouldn't have manipulated your crewman.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No it won't.
His hands were soft...<eos> For a robot.<eos> Thanks, Mikey.<eos> Do you think you'll try building another Metalhead?<eos> Maybe I will...
There's lots of books out there, but... this story, it hasn't been written yet.<eos> Caleb.<eos> Looks like Olivia's audio file is a dead end.<eos> I hope she gets some answers.<eos> She will.
Understood.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rem, you have to get some rest, okay?<eos> We can't have you sleepwalking again.<eos> I will.
It seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did.<eos> Eventually.<eos> Sara will too.
Of course, the same thing can never happen twice, so let the wine be poured.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Here, here!<eos> Now who will be the first to drink in celebration?<eos> I will.
Or I fail them.<eos> That they'll just... that they'll look at me and they'll say, "You're not my real mom."<eos> And walk away.<eos> Honey, to be honest, every mother's afraid that our children won't love us the way we love them.<eos> And they won't.
That is not my business.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> I have a study, a practise, and I haven't cured one single case of sexual dysfunction.<eos> Yet, yet.<eos> But you will.
I bet my head and money that you have a 10 pair.<eos> I bet my head and money there's a card in her panty.<eos> Show your ass and take it all if you can.<eos> What will you bet?<eos> What if I won't?
- Kelly. - Kelly.<eos> From what I hear, you humiliated him.<eos> He's not gonna forget that, and he's not gonna fight fair, so if you see him again, I want you to call me, or Antonio or any of us.<eos> - I mean it.<eos> - I will.
For kate, you can stand it.<eos> He knows.<eos> He can endure anything except betrayal, charlie.<eos> If he knew, we'd be already dead. So he does not know.<eos> He never will.
So cut my throat.<eos> Leave me here to rot.<eos> I've been close to worse deaths.<eos> But do think he'll love you for it?<eos> In time, he will.
Commander on deck.<eos> Are you familiar with how william Jagger interrogates women?<eos> If he does to Kate Balfour what he so delights in doing to unruly women, she'll submit and she'll send him here directly with his men and his guns.<eos> - If they arrive in force--<eos> - They will.
Are you certain about using the real thing?<eos> Trust me, first thing Carlito's gonna do is check.<eos> The plan's gonna work.<eos> You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.<eos> They will.
All right, back to this plate.<eos> I think you could use it for a variety of things.<eos> New item up there.<eos> How much you guys wanna pay for me to stick my socks in this moron's mouth?<eos> I will.
It's, uh, some of Liam's old stuff.<eos> You'll make sure he's bundled up?<eos> How's Lip?<eos> Don't tell Mickey's wife where you got this, okay?<eos> I won't. Hey.
No, someone went to far too much trouble to try and get it for it to be ornamental.<eos> It's gotta do something, or be something.<eos> The question is what?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
You think I'm related to this woman?<eos> It's a collar.<eos> What does it do?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
And he's had it since before we met.<eos> He left it with me while he was away to keep him close, and now you have ruined it!<eos> If mending a cloak is our biggest obstacle, we're in fine shape.<eos> You realize you might not find him... or survive?<eos> I will.
The idea is it's supposed to help me remember more about what happened to me.<eos> And has it helped?<eos> I've not read it yet.<eos> Well, maybe it will help.<eos> Or maybe it won't.
You know that and he knows that.<eos> So, what?<eos> So, what if he tries that concoction on one of us, huh?<eos> You want to die?<eos> 'Cause you will.
What's going on here?<eos> - Did you see Field of Dreams?<eos> - No. Say it, Big John.<eos> "If you build it, they will come."<eos> - Yes, they will.
It's Bill.<eos> He asked me to kill him with my light ball.<eos> What the hell?<eos> He says he wants me to have a normal life with kids and everything.<eos> But with him in the world, I never will. Wow.
Easy, D, you're gonna get through this.<eos> How's Silvia holding up?<eos> Devastated.<eos> Told her I'd find a way out of this, but... I don't know.<eos> And you will, bro.
We need to go.<eos> They're almost here.<eos> We're at the coordinates you sent, sir.<eos> But we can't get a visual on the targets.<eos> You will.
I miss him, you know?<eos> I do, too.<eos> No matter how bad it got between you guys, he always loved you.<eos> And never gave up on you, not for a second.<eos> Neither will I.
We compete in the battle of the bands for real.<eos> I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals.<eos> We unleash the counterspell then.<eos> You'll have figured it out by the finals, right?<eos> Of course she will.
You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Our twin powers don't work like that.<eos> You actually have to tell Luke to his face.<eos> Well, I will.
Everything is not over.<eos> Eddie, you are not nothing.<eos> You're my husband... ..and our children's father.<eos> I can't remember their faces.<eos> You will.
We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation.<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the coroner will confirm?<eos> Yes, he will.
And you wouldn't have played on Carlos' grief to get rid of the evidence.<eos> The Alec that you met two years ago is dead.<eos> Or locked away somewhere.<eos> She wasn't using it, and technically I did invent it.<eos> Or I will.
Donna and I are getting married on Saturday.<eos> Just a small ceremony.<eos> I would like it very much if you were to stand with me.<eos> That's just... that's great.<eos> Of course I will.
It's just Abe.<eos> I thought you were Simcoe.<eos> Has he come by yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, he will.
I thought you were Simcoe.<eos> Has he come by yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, he will.<eos> Tomorrow-- tomorrow he will.
They already patted me down, took my gat.<eos> Nice of you to visit.<eos> Where's Ghost?<eos> She won't let me fuck her in the ass.<eos> Her sister will, though.
No!<eos> Yes?<eos> Maybe.<eos> So ditch the online persona and tell him the truth.<eos> I will.
Not now.<eos> And how about Donovan's guys?<eos> He'll have cops up there.<eos> There's no way we're getting near that place.<eos> We will.
I can help with the grieving process.<eos> Thanks, but I won't be needing this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You may, change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You mean like letting a terrorist bankroll you?<eos> That's what they called me when we first met.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Just think about what I said.<eos> Yeah. I will.
I was reminded of what being married could be like, and I realized I owe you an apology.<eos> I was unfeeling to you earlier because I was afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of what might happen if Francis finds out.<eos> He won't.
Dad, I gotta go.<eos> Well, there's two ways of looking at it.<eos> The first is you gotta.<eos> The second is you don't<eos> Will you...
He went to the boxing gym the second we got home.<eos> I think he needed some time for himself.<eos> Well, he and I are still gonna have a little talk about that stunt he pulled today.<eos> Feel free to tell him I said so.<eos> Okay, I will.
Today, I did.<eos> But she's alive.<eos> And safe. We did that at least.<eos> Why didn't you tell her the truth?<eos> I will.
Who else knows of your research?<eos> (CHUCKLES) Oh, well, there's stuff that I talk about on my radio show, but only Bill and me know the really mind-blowing parts of his theory.<eos> Well, it's been good talking to you, man.<eos> Mr. Segreto. (CLEARS THROAT) I thought that you came here so that we could talk about them.<eos> (WHISPERS) Oh, yeah, we will soon.
Thank you.<eos> I am surprised that you're letting this one get away, Victor.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> Of course the opposition's gonna try and put you through the ringer, but don't you worry-- it's just a show. I have your records.<eos> I'll...
It's okay, Isaac.<eos> I know you've done your best.<eos> The Reverend summons me now, heaven knows why, but I fear each second he's made to wait...<eos> He will ask you to watch over Mr. Sibley.<eos> - He will?
Don't worry!<eos> I blended in.<eos> According to them, I'm just another nosy neighbor.<eos> What if they figure out you're a cop?<eos> They won't!
And it's never gonna go back to the way it was.<eos> - OK, it's all over.<eos> You're OK.<eos> - Wh... what if they come back?<eos> They won't.
I hung on his every word all year. All of us did.<eos> He's the greatest teacher I have ever had, so maybe if it were someone else saying this,<eos> I wouldn't believe them, but Webber?<eos> I got to find what I'm good at.<eos> And I will.
He's the greatest teacher I have ever had, so maybe if it were someone else saying this,<eos> I wouldn't believe them, but Webber?<eos> I got to find what I'm good at.<eos> And I will.<eos> You will.
Wow, it really is like old times:<eos> Me hiding in shadows, you hiding me.<eos> Yeah, and me lying to my sister, Tess covering for me.<eos> I am so sick of lying. I thought we were moving past all this.<eos> We will, somehow.
- What meeting?<eos> Sorry, Don.<eos> Don't get no fresher than that.<eos> Who wants to try it?<eos> I will.
Well, now your plan is up in smoke.<eos> And I have formulated the only viable alternative.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, what do you mean?<eos> How would you get to him?<eos> I won't.
I think it's a fantastic plan.<eos> Has zero chance of success. What the hell?<eos> What's this Faraday suit?<eos> How do we know this thing's gonna work?<eos> It Will.
And Johnny's a fighter.<eos> Bobby may walk on self-defense.<eos> Which is why we need to get him for the trainer.<eos> Carrie have enough?<eos> She will.
Ain't nobody gonna take care of our people but us.<eos> Dell hurt one of our own, we can't let him get away with that.<eos> Can't let... that degenerate prick win.<eos> He's got to pay.<eos> He will, Ma, he will.
Seriously, my dear, you have to take control of your feelings, before they take control of you.<eos> Baxter.<eos> M'lady?<eos> I've thought a lot about what you told me yesterday, and I still think you should report Mr Coyle.<eos> I won't, m'lady.
What's this?<eos> Should I know?<eos> Should I start talking to IA?<eos> I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service...<eos> We will after this.
Let go of me!<eos> You're the nothing.<eos> We won't see her again.<eos> Get off me.<eos> No, sir, you will not.
Maybe that's the only way any of us are gonna get out.<eos> It didn't work for me.<eos> I died.<eos> I came back.<eos> Will she?
What about you?<eos> You wanna live? How much?<eos> awn's afrai she'll look weak in front of us.<eos> Thinks it'll tip things against her.<eos> Hell, it will.
He will strike back.<eos> You taking the necessary steps?<eos> Protect your family?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> He will.
I think you trade in black market fables.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> You have a much more genteel personality than your friend.<eos> It takes time... but he will soften... eventually.<eos> I will not.
Natasha's at your apartment? Okay. She's wanted by the FBI.<eos> Your apology was sounding a lot better a few seconds ago.<eos> She's a fugitive.<eos> What are you gonna do if she gets discovered?<eos> She won't.
Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Annie.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Imagine having a child like that.<eos> Asking for that second autopsy was a brilliant move, and I'd have done it myself if I didn't think that they'd find evidence against my client, which... let's face it...<eos> They probably will.
You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
- What's she afraid of?<eos> What'll happen when you wake up.<eos> - What, that the mission will fail?<eos> - No.<eos> - That it won't.
We have to alert the police...<eos> - Molly: He'll die if you wait.<eos> - EMT: Before we admit him to the hospital.<eos> Then he'll die.<eos> No, he won't.
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please.<eos> I will.
It has to be in perfect condition.<eos> We need every penny we can get out of this place.<eos> Okay, let me go get some club soda and salt.<eos> Lydia, it'll come out.<eos> It will.
I'm his father, in a way, the one that cares about him.<eos> I'll set him straight.<eos> Ezra, thank you for being a reasonable man.<eos> You understand that Ray can't know I'm connected to anything that might happen.<eos> He won't.
I tell you what, how about an easy one.<eos> You let me buy you a drink.<eos> No, that is way too easy.<eos> Think of something more exciting.<eos> I will.
Secrets have a way of coming out.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> We're going for a drive.<eos> I wouldn't know a javelina if it ran right past me.<eos> It won't.
The fish won't wait forever.<eos> Salim, you need any help?<eos> I'm fine here, Mr. President.<eos> All you have to do is bring home some supper.<eos> I will.
I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.<eos> Well, people don't need to know.<eos> People don't need to know anything, do they?<eos> No, and they never will.
Or are we contaminated with Amazon brain rot?<eos> Or maybe we passed through the tail of a comet that sprinkled the earth with zombie dust.<eos> Or was it a defense department weaponized virus that escaped the lab?<eos> Or how about self fulfilling prophecy.<eos> Public fascination with all things zombie just willed it into existence.
It doesn't matter what they think.<eos> - Maggie's with them.<eos> - She used to believe in me, but now... - Everything's changing.<eos> - I haven't changed.<eos> I never will.
He couldn't find out what he was carrying, but found out where it came from.<eos> He says it's sourced from a place no one will go.<eos> He says it's sourced from hell.<eos> A place so doomed even the Elites Zealots won't go there.<eos> So they but it from someone who will.
- I guess.<eos> I mean, Abel's a little freaked-out.<eos> Wants to know why he can't go back to school.<eos> Yeah. Just, uh, stay really close to<eos> - him today, all right? - I will.
I understand.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, mano.<eos> Uh, yeah, if I see her, I'll, uh... I'll let you know.<eos> I will, I will.
You wouldn't do that, would you?<eos> Frank wouldn't do that.<eos> Stay there!<eos> Be seeing you, Frank.<eos> Yes, you will.
A career official in the Foreign Ministry,<eos> Tasneem Qureishi has emerged in the last few days as a leading...<eos> You're gonna drive yourself crazy.<eos> I wish it would just happen already.<eos> Maybe it never will.
Eat your broccoli.<eos> Martin's been secretly taking self-defense courses, and now he's beating up Nelson.<eos> Aah! His fat fists are a blur.<eos> I've never seen moves like that.<eos> And never will again.
- I've never caught you in a lie.<eos> - No, I don't lie, but there are things I don't say.<eos> I've allowed this folly to go on because... I don't know, really, because it was a nice idea.<eos> And I would have liked to come in with you, I would have...<eos> - But you won't.
Yes, it does.<eos> I used to think about that day on the beach.<eos> It helped keep me sane when I was about to break.<eos> I used to imagine our life if we had gotten away.<eos> This time, we will.
I know you too well, Swan.<eos> So, stop trying to get me to forgive you, because it'll never happen.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You two need to mend your differences, otherwise, Storybrooke doesn't stand a chance.<eos> (CHUCKLES) We never will.
I can help, Russell.<eos> Please, I need to do something.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Just... be careful and get out of there as soon as you can.<eos> I will.
Yeah. It was a definite match to Briscoe and Winthrop's birth mother.<eos> D.B., Winthrop was definitely at that convent.<eos> He was there searching for his brother.<eos> - We can't prove that, though, right?<eos> - Oh, we will.
And, Garcia, I owe you another one.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> All right, call me if you need me.<eos> I will.
You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
Elsa was.<eos> They really are quite wonderful together -- like sisters.<eos> Your strange fixation really holds no interest for me.<eos> But it should.<eos> And it will.
You're a good man, Booth.<eos> Don't let them take that away! Because that really will be the death of you.<eos> I just want this to stop.<eos> I want this to stop.<eos> It will.
We cannot let them escape with that crystal.<eos> This is not a good place to hide.<eos> We need to find a shuttle and get out of here.<eos> We can't let Grievous have the crystal.<eos> We won't.
It was his doing.<eos> He's a good man, you know, and he'll make a good king.<eos> Your opinion is enough for me.<eos> And your lover, lady doutzen, When will she return to you?<eos> She won't.
We wanted to show them that the best thing about that house is its location.<eos> It's Dunphy-adjacent.<eos> That was so much fun.<eos> We'll hear from you soon, huh?<eos> You sure will.
It most certainly is.<eos> Everybody's on my ass for the drinking, but I don't bring that to work.<eos> My point is I do my job and the day I show up to work drunk, I'm telling you, Connie, and I mean this, you can fire me.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
You're talking about nothing less than the survival of the species.<eos> Surely that's worth compromising one's values for?<eos> In any case... I think you're bluffing.<eos> You might want the world to believe that you're an automaton, a calculating machine... but you and I know better.<eos> Or we will, anyway... in a couple of hours.
I've been looking forward to meeting you, Madam Secretary.<eos> It's very generous of your host to offer us this piece of Canadian soil on which to meet.<eos> Since I am not allowed to step foot on yours outside of the, uh, - UN grounds in Manhattan.<eos> - Well, I'm hoping that our diplomatic status will change soon.<eos> It will.
I'm not alone. I have David.<eos> Even after he reunited with Emily.<eos> You keep waiting for blowback, but it hasn't happened.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It won't.
So you failed.<eos> At kidnapping a child.<eos> Well, perhaps you could say my heart wasn't in it.<eos> The Snow Queen's plan also failed.<eos> But mine won't.
Keep coming after my father, and I will make things very uncomfortable for you in this city.<eos> And second:<eos> You don't know that that injunction is me.<eos> I don't have to know.<eos> Judge will.
Zap!<eos> You and Brian better get another turkey right now!<eos> And don't bother coming back until you do!<eos> Don't worry, Lois.<eos> We will.
Pierce, Shepherd, you're with me.<eos> She's alive?<eos> She is.<eos> You'll take care of her?<eos> I will.
Why?<eos> To be punished for our sins.<eos> I thought it was a second chance.<eos> I thought it could work.<eos> Oh, it never will.
That is what sacrifice is.<eos> Allow me to fulfill my duty as a Witness and end this madness.<eos> Henry, let us pass!<eos> You never gave up on me.<eos> You never will.
I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no idea what to do about it.<eos> I feel<eos> Like every single thing I am doing is wrong.<eos> You will figure it out.<eos> You will.
- Don't protect me!<eos> - No!<eos> Don't show me a map and not give me all the memories.<eos> - I thought we're gonna help.<eos> - We will.
It made you lie to me.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You said you'd never leave me.<eos> I never left you.<eos> I never will.
Nobody's innocent.<eos> And we can't leave anybody able to talk.<eos> Don't go soft on me, kid.<eos> Don't leave anybody breathing.<eos> I won't.
They really are quite wonderful together...<eos> like sisters.<eos> Your strange fixation really holds no interest for me.<eos> Oh, but it should.<eos> And it will.
We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.<eos> This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.<eos> Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.<eos> Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph.<eos> I will.
Even if Bobby was coming with the money, you'd still kill us both.<eos> But he's not coming.<eos> - He'll be here.<eos> - No.<eos> He won't.
As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.<eos> It took some tinkering.<eos> But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"<eos> Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.<eos> And now, neither will I.
"And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep... "... he took crown and seed with him... "... for permanent keep."<eos> "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away... "... truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
For Goddard, yes.<eos> Wyatt gave him the best years of his life.<eos> Jock lost his son Dylan to a drug overdose.<eos> So, if you talk about losing your mother...<eos> No, I won't.
I'm going to scare circles around you this year.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
The doctors don't know what she took, so we just have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I'm an old romantic.<eos> I always hoped that when I finally said "I love you" to someone... she'd say the same thing back.<eos> - And that someone will.
She loved me.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her.<eos> And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
You poisoned the king!<eos> Guards!<eos> Get them under control.<eos> The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!<eos> We will not!
- What's Kate gonna tell the kids? Shh. Shh.<eos> I can't... I can't remember what they look like.<eos> You tell them I was thinking about them. I will.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
Come over here!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I'm not gonna eat you or anything.<eos> He will.
Even the chalices were spotless.<eos> Weird, huh?<eos> I'll give my psychic magnetism a try to see if I can find him again.<eos> Take Stormy home first.<eos> - Like hell he will!
That's my problem, you're always there instead of going to hell!<eos> And vanishing for good!<eos> But I'll make you pay this time.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
You can't find me?<eos> BROOKE:<eos> I just need you... You can't find me?<eos> No, no, you have to find me!<eos> No. We will.
Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
Henry.<eos> I think it's time that you lived your life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If only I knew what that meant.<eos> You will.
I understand.<eos> This guy, he just moved in with my mom and me.<eos> And now he wants you out.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - He will.
You're very welcome.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Your skills are greater than mine, your Holiness.<eos> Please help.<eos> No I won't.
Yeah, you too.<eos> You... got the light.<eos> OK. Thank you.<eos> You watch out for assholes.<eos> I will.
Thank you.<eos> Kevin, what happened to you?<eos> Now I really need to make sure you girls come back soon,<eos> And you tell all of your sorority sisters.<eos> Oh, we will.
How do you think we'll ever make this place pay if you keep standing people drinks?<eos> They're old friends, Daisy. Locked up!<eos> That's the way of it.<eos> I won't have it.<eos> You won't?
No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.<eos> I imagine you're right.<eos> I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.<eos> He may not agree to meet.<eos> He will.
- Are you sure, Chris?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just be careful, okay?<eos> I will.
Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
- Yes, I did. - No.<eos> I never should've told you that.<eos> I'd do it all over again just to save you.<eos> But if it didn't work...<eos> It will.
I'm exhausted.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna go for your lunch thing, okay?<eos> - And then you're gonna call me.<eos> - I will.
It's a consensual arrangement.<eos> The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.<eos> Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.<eos> You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.<eos> They will.
You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
It erm... possesses a peculiar saltiness.<eos> Don't bother, Nico.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Wouldn't reveal anything even if he did.<eos> - Yes, he will.
These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of King Aelle, and King Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."<eos> God is on our side, too.<eos> The police are going to find him.<eos> They don't need me.<eos> Maybe they will.
The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> Then your father's hope for the future dies with you.<eos> I can't fail!<eos> You will.
Because it seems just the opposite.<eos> I pay by direct this and ensure our interests , thing you're doing.<eos> And the question arises: where is my gold?<eos> Oh, I have, Judah.<eos> You will.
But... we have a home, a good home.<eos> Away from the city to a new land... for our children.<eos> But you have no children.<eos> You can never have children.<eos> But we will.
Our Creator-Shh. Who made the stars, will give us as many descendants-. Shh, shh, shh.<eos> He has promised.<eos> You will have a child.<eos> I won't.<eos> You will!
Rabbi.<eos> I will not fall away.<eos> I will lay down my life for you.<eos> Will you?<eos> I will.
Go. Go faster!<eos> - Wait, what? - Hey!<eos> Kristoff!<eos> Don't come back!<eos> We won't.
And you don't wanna be killed.<eos> So put it out.<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He won't.
Nobody's seen him.<eos> He's not answering his phone.<eos> So, what about Jesse?<eos> He hasn't shown up yet.<eos> He will, Saul.
Four thousand hits in two days.<eos> If that isn't stardom, what is?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Does anyone here know about this?<eos> By this weekend, everyone will.
I only have a minute, okay, but there's some question about Thomas' death.<eos> Yeah, the insurance company is launching an investigation that my firm is handling.<eos> Now it's probably just a routine thing, but I thought you should be aware.<eos> Stay away from that family.<eos> I will. Yes.
Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
Thank you.<eos> Hanna.<eos> I've gotta get going. Yeah.<eos> You make sure he takes care of you.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Worst decision that you'll ever make.<eos> She says she'll be happy.<eos> Right now she doesn't need to be happy.<eos> She needs to stop using.<eos> And she will.
Then don't.<eos> More bread, please.<eos> Are you going to eat it?<eos> I don't know, but somebody else might.<eos> I probably will.
He has an older model, but it's still pretty accurate.<eos> Thank you, Jonah. Yeah.<eos> Hey, is there, like, a village or pueblo soon?<eos> Why? You need a toilet?<eos> Not right this minute, but I probably will.
It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous.<eos> Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
I visited her... every fortnight.<eos> So you do have a heart.<eos> She's dead.<eos> She won't know if I'm there or not.<eos> But you will.
Michel, we know how to talk to each other.<eos> Of course.<eos> But you must explain that you are moving to the Amsterdam apartment, that you are leaving the French flat empty.<eos> How will we know if it works?<eos> It will.
But you must explain that you are moving to the Amsterdam apartment, that you are leaving the French flat empty.<eos> How will we know if it works?<eos> It will.<eos> What if it doesn't?<eos> It will.
Why would I be upset?<eos> Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons, So you wouldn't have to deal with this.<eos> Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this Because you should've said no.<eos> Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't. I know.<eos> I'll...
It's been radio silence.<eos> Really?<eos> - What about Grace?<eos> - No. And she won't answer her computer.<eos> Nobody will.
Glenn: The three of them are right in the middle of it.<eos> No idea we're coming.<eos> They could get taken hostage or killed.<eos> A thousand things could go wrong.<eos> And they will.
Keep it together, Neal.<eos> You accuse me of corruption when, in fact, It was James Bennett who was the real stain on Metro P.D. --<eos> A criminal posing as a cop.<eos> I'm sure you, of all people, can appreciate the irony.<eos> Oh, I will.
You need to start right here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Steady.<eos> Promise me it will stop.<eos> It will.
Yeah.<eos> 'Cause you didn't know about Ginger or Mary Ann or the Howells.<eos> And I bet you didn't know that the Globetrotters were g u e sts o n Gi/I/jgan is Island.<eos> Better consult your atlas is what you should do.<eos> I will.
You came out here, you staked this out on your own.<eos> I always had Dennis to fall back on.<eos> Even when I went to Mary Kay.<eos> You didn't.<eos> And I never will.
I still do.<eos> That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me. I had no choice.<eos> You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.
That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me. I had no choice.<eos> You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
I need lipstick and eye stuff.<eos> Number 483. Pretty in pink.<eos> It'll look good on me don't you think?<eos> You got my coloring.<eos> Sure it will.
I made a mistake trying to repurpose you.<eos> - Repurpose me? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm not a vintage cardigan.<eos> Also, I will not be paying rent this month. - Uh, yeah, you will.<eos> - Actually, no, I won't.
- You're welcome.<eos> Sir... I don't like to ask, but...<eos> Why are we even going there?<eos> They won't take me.<eos> They will.
I've got some ideas.<eos> But I want something simpler and more permanent.<eos> We should do it, Kubi.<eos> We should make it succeed.<eos> Of course we will.
I told you, I need to do this on my own.<eos> No, you need my help now.<eos> The police will be here very soon.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet. But they soon will.
N-no one leaves.<eos> Owen says if people start leaving, the sale won't go through, and we're screwed.<eos> That's why we want to buy it, because we're doctors, and we know how it runs.<eos> Did you know you'll have to file a declaration for land use for approval by the state attorney general?<eos> Will we?
Stop running!<eos> You can't help me, Master.<eos> Someone's setting me up!<eos> I believe you, Ahsoka!<eos> But no one else will!
But if you can't, don't feel bad.<eos> Sometimes, no matter how much you want to help you can't stop someone from dying.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> Don't you want to see your daughter again?<eos> I will.
That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
Well, maybe you get him to pull, count it down like you did that old gun thug in Miami.<eos> Figure if it ain't broke...<eos> Well, what if he won't pull?<eos> They always pull.<eos> Well, what if he won't?
Well, let's try to turn it around today.<eos> Talk about the positive things we can take from negative experiences.<eos> For example, I just found another reason not to be sad when my dad dies.<eos> - Who wants to go next?<eos> - I will.
Look, I know what you're going through.<eos> No, no, man, you got no idea.<eos> Andre... You got no idea what this is like.<eos> But who knows?<eos> Maybe someday... you will.
Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
So your love has brought you nothing but pain.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> How will that pain bring peace to the Universe?<eos> It will...
I don't want to...<eos> I just want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side.<eos> Christine... will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course I will.
Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
She's so innocent.<eos> So pure.<eos> She's my little angel.<eos> You can't let anyone hurt my family, Ray.<eos> I won't.
I'm believe whatever is on that tape.<eos> Tomorrow Clayton is gonna pick us up in the getaway car,<eos> Juan's car.<eos> We get the car, I get the tape, and then I'm gonna know the truth.<eos> Yes, you will.
Oh, God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't have him yet.<eos> But you will, right?
Our little pack of wolves.<eos> What is their price?<eos> Land. The restoration of what has been taken from them.<eos> Tell them if they pledge their swords to me, they shall have all they had before, and the Borgia estates I will divide among them.<eos> I will.
- How are you?<eos> - Good, you?<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Call if you need to.<eos> I will.
I didn't know then that you were the land agent and son-in-law of our local milord.<eos> I'm surprised I'm so famous.<eos> Won't you defend your principles?<eos> No, not now.<eos> Then I will.
Green simply won't be back at Downton again.<eos> Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham as to why he has a different valet?<eos> I suppose not.<eos> So you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit.<eos> And will he, m'lady?
You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now.<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
Guess my agent afloat days are over, huh?<eos> Good for you, Stan.<eos> Yeah, it's gonna be a whole new chapter for me.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Maybe I will.
I know this great inn that you would love.<eos> And you can teach me how to make your abgoosht.<eos> I am so sorry that... I was too busy last weekend.<eos> You are gonna get through this, Arastoo.<eos> You Will.
The tests.<eos> The experiments, the pain.<eos> Please.<eos> Amanda, make it stop.<eos> I will.
The experiments, the pain.<eos> Please.<eos> Amanda, make it stop.<eos> I will.<eos> You will?
That's Charlie.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - That's his ear.<eos> Please pass on my regards to your wife.<eos> I will.
Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make;<eos> knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
What do you mean?<eos> Men are false.<eos> We had thought to purge our Vatican.<eos> As though the fresh blood of new cardinals would wash it clean.<eos> But it will not.
What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
You park yourself behind the computer, and you change the world keystroke by keystroke.<eos> But no one understands that heroism.<eos> Naturally, you wanna dream a little larger.<eos> And Alec, believe me.<eos> You will.
If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
Great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> I love the Jedi mind trick on Danny boy.<eos> But it'll all be for bubkes if I can't break the Falcon.<eos> You will.
Damn.<eos> The Mexicans didn't want the body.<eos> The feds?<eos> They don't know yet.<eos> Well, they will.
- Oh, God, I don't know.<eos> [Coughs] Hemlock takes about an hour to work its way into your system.<eos> Ambulance may not get here in time, but if we hurry...<eos> Please, get me to a hospital. I will.<eos> I will. Not just yet.
I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
You don't get it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I don't have kids?<eos> I would have.<eos> Spence... You still will.
I'm counting on it.<eos> Subject is in stable condition.<eos> All clear at Union Station.<eos> I told him his father was coming home.<eos> He will.
- Why's that?<eos> - You burned me back home. - How?<eos> - I'm here with you.<eos> - They don't know that.<eos> - They will.
- Dar Adal, he monitors the blotters.<eos> He knows Javadi's in the country?<eos> He knows something's up he's not in on.<eos> I suggest you go talk to him soon.<eos> - I will.
The killer.<eos> And...<eos> The FBI knew about Cristina and the video.<eos> That's why they won't share their files.<eos> Well, they will now.
You wasted a valuable asset.<eos> We can't see this through as designed without Peller in place.<eos> We have the Stuxworm.<eos> We can improvise.<eos> Oh, I Will.
Cece, I think.<eos> Just take the money and drop it, all right?<eos> Let him go!<eos> That guy was never gonna tell us the whole story anyway.<eos> But maybe this will.
Why would I wish for anything?<eos> I have everything I could possibly wish for.<eos> You are everything I've ever wished for, Cyrus.<eos> What if you change your mind?<eos> I won't.
But... you must leave this place.<eos> You are banished from here.<eos> You must never return.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> We won't.
We don't need that much.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> It's actually good-- we don't need hardly as much.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> I will.
You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
Something wasn't right.<eos> Benito.<eos> - How'd they find you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Probably never will.
In life there's nothing more important than school.<eos> The instruction...<eos> You are lucky to be able to study.<eos> You'll need to be responsible and if so, you'll succeed.<eos> - If Allah wills!
You'll need to be responsible and if so, you'll succeed.<eos> - If Allah wills!<eos> - May God help you.<eos> May God give you strength to carry all your projects.<eos> If Allah wills!
He knows we're gonna be in Cheyenne tomorrow and wants to broker a deal.<eos> Know what that means?<eos> We won the damn war, damn it.<eos> Ain't none of us out here never won nothin'.<eos> And never will.
You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I never will.
Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
That's Marcel?<eos> In all his overstuffed down.<eos> Okay, Lilly.<eos> Stay and watch over them.<eos> I will.
No one's going in or out.<eos> There've always been mortals trying to prove the myths are real.<eos> Don't even humor him.<eos> I'd just stay away from him as much as possible, if I were you.<eos> Yeah, I will.
If you wanna take a break, I can get someone...<eos> I'm not trusting this to some N.F.G.<eos> You wanna help? Pull up a chair.<eos> Yes. Yes, sure.<eos> Yeah, we will.
It's about the information on the pages.<eos> Moz, you can leave those pages blank.<eos> Nobody's going to see them.<eos> Uh, not soon. No.<eos> But eventually, they will.
The Mayor's foster brother is assigned to a weapons convoy that carries SCAR 16s by truck.<eos> The convoy's scheduled to come through Starling City tonight.<eos> FN SCAR 16s are military assault weapons with grenade launchers.<eos> The man gets a hold of these, Oliver, it's game over.<eos> He won't.
It might not be tomorrow.<eos> It might not be six months from now, but he's gonna find a way.<eos> - You mean she'll find a way.<eos> - That's exactly what I mean.<eos> And maybe she will.
For the rest of his life.<eos> I can arrange that.<eos> I want to end up someplace near him, so he can visit.<eos> If you cooperate, he won't have to visit you in jail.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Is she a man? Ooh.<eos> Secret penis.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Well, why don't you guys ever sleep together?<eos> We will!
Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.<eos> I'll get a warrant by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know Seth's location.<eos> She won't.
Why would I possibly agree to that?<eos> Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.<eos> And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.<eos> But if I win...<eos> You won't.
Natalia.<eos> Did anyone see you come in here?<eos> No.<eos> They never do.<eos> They never will.
I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
Do you think they will?<eos> No.<eos> You can stay in the guest room.<eos> Till the service.<eos> I will.
You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
We found her playing in the yard.<eos> We don't know how she got here, but we're taking care of her. Hi.<eos> I'm Miranda.<eos> Max doesn't talk.<eos> But she will soon.
How are you feeling?<eos> I feel good.<eos> Funny, I thought I'd feel different.<eos> - Changed or something.<eos> - You will.
Prepare to fire.<eos> What is this, Gene?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Horn said he was gonna leave my daughter alone.<eos> And he will.
Uh, "Don't tell me where to stand"<eos> sounds like, uh, "You can't handle the truth."<eos> We don't want to sound patronizing.<eos> Well, she started it!<eos> And so will Reverend Potter on the broadcast.
- All I meant was...<eos> You don't pick your family or their faith.<eos> And it doesn't matter whose blood flows through your veins.<eos> You choose your own path.<eos> Or your King will.
We land in half an hour. Good.<eos> The sooner we begin, the better.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work.<eos> I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
- But you hurt more people.<eos> I was trying to protect you from them. I was trying to atone for my sin.<eos> Hannah, please. Maybe if you forgive me, I won't go to hell.<eos> Only God can forgive you.<eos> And he won't.
Conrad put Father Paul in that car, not you.<eos> You tried to spare me from a monster.<eos> It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No. He never will.
Hey.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you see these people?<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Hopefully they never will.
Give me updates as soon as you have them.<eos> Meanwhile, there's been a development.<eos> Reddington's brought us a case.<eos> It's about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us.<eos> He won't.
And it worked.<eos> But you have to admit, what I've done is extraordinary.<eos> My father will never forget it.<eos> Certainly Dana won't.<eos> Or maybe she will. Will you?
Thank you.<eos> That was, like, our tenth gay guy tonight.<eos> Let's hope our gay buzz lasts longer than Adam Lambert's.<eos> Oh, it will.
The worm has teeth.<eos> What, you're here to pwotect your wuved ones?<eos> I'm not going to let you touch either one of them.<eos> Oh, and I'd like to see that.<eos> Oh, you will.
I care a lot.<eos> It's just the stuff I'm good at isn't the stuff that makes you popular.<eos> Contestants, all cakes must be... at the judges' table in 60 seconds.<eos> Ay. there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.<eos> Like heck we won't.
I know that you've been colluding with Annie Walker.<eos> When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes. - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
I'd just never thought it would get to this.<eos> The nurse. The limo driver.<eos> Now that kid, Boyd.<eos> Let's just hope it ends there.<eos> It won't.
I shall see she is released.<eos> Oh, no. Come.<eos> Come here.<eos> It will get better.<eos> It will.
But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.<eos> I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear. Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
Try again? Whenever you're ready.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You put the sensors in weeks ago.<eos> I haven't moved the damn thing once.<eos> You will.
You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
And it's such a shame the bride only has a few hours to live.<eos> Did you handle the Patrick situation?<eos> He shut me down, in favor of staying glued to mommy drearest's side.<eos> Which is exactly why he can't get on that yacht.<eos> He won't.
And Robinson takes outside.<eos> Ball one.<eos> - Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!<eos> - You don't belong here.<eos> And you never will.
My boss has half the city looking for him.<eos> Half the city and me, so...<eos> And if you find him, there's a hell of a price.<eos> Chunk of money like that, you should think on it.<eos> - I will.
You saved us! But Sandy...<eos> Would be proud of what you did.<eos> I don't know who you were in your past life. But in this life, you are Guardian.<eos> But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?<eos> You will.
Those things he said. He meant them. I know that.<eos> Cigarette?<eos> I need one.<eos> But I've accepted.<eos> Like you will.
Think about Telluride this summer.<eos> Judy would love it if you were there.<eos> I mean, I would, too.<eos> Actually, so would your brother if he could distinguish shapes.<eos> I will.
Just try to take care of you, you know that, do not you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just wish sometimes couldst tell me things ... And ...'d let me help.<eos> Alright.<eos> I will.
Yeah, do it that way.<eos> No fuss, no muss.<eos> Come on, Jordan!<eos> - What if he hates me?<eos> - He will.
Is he...<eos> What do we do?<eos> We're running away.<eos> We should call the police.<eos> Yes, we will.
Don't get hung up on the hook here.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> Come on. - Bring my dogs. - Come on.<eos> I got 'em. - Bring my dogs!<eos> - I will.
She shouldn't have to support you with it.<eos> What happens if the Pigeon and the Truck doesn't make any money, huh?<eos> Do you actually know anyone who likes warm beer?<eos> It'll all work out.<eos> I'll Always.
Hello, sweetie.<eos> I'm just calling to see how you are getting along.<eos> Mom, I can't really talk right now.<eos> I gotta get up for work. Well, don't forget to ask for that raise.<eos> I will. (GROANS)
Talk to his wife.<eos> What am I looking for exactly?<eos> Just break her.<eos> -This will never work.<eos> -Course it will.
- She has come from a school.<eos> You remember, don't you?<eos> - Oh come on Ashatai!<eos> How will she know?<eos> Why won't she?
- I really should kick his ass.<eos> - Don't do that here.<eos> - It's your sister's party.<eos> - But when my arm is cured, I'll give him a...<eos> No, you won't!
I felt like a breath of air.<eos> Theresa says we're like six little pigs packed into that cabin, all trussed and bound for market.<eos> We're six people bound for a new life.<eos> And we'll have plenty of air to breathe when we get there.<eos> We Will.
I think it's damn stupid.<eos> I should watch whom you say that to, Mr Murdoch, or you'll find yourself in the brig.<eos> It's too late.<eos> He won't want to be bothered.<eos> Oh, yes, he will.
Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you. They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until...<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
I'll stay with you until, until...<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.<eos> You cannot drink in my house. I won't.<eos> I won't. I won't.
I won't.<eos> You cannot drink in my house. I won't.<eos> I won't. I won't.<eos> You can't have a drink.<eos> I won't.
He says the single word...<eos> Gasoline.<eos> The hooker, she studied Vietnamese at Yale.<eos> I don't smell gas.<eos> You will.
Why didn't you pick up?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile. Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
How old are you? Why?<eos> Because at your age, you shouldn't have to be nursing someone.<eos> Tessa doesn't need nursing.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> And she will more and more.
How does it feel?<eos> It doesn't feel like anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because Alan doesn't yet know how to appreciate a woman.<eos> But he will.
Mitch, you heard him.<eos> That man is unstable.<eos> What if he does it?<eos> What if people find out we knew?<eos> They won't.
Well then, we have nothing to talk about.<eos> Well, that can't be the law.<eos> No, the law is clear:<eos> It assumes that a man on trial for murder will want to defend himself.<eos> And if he won't?
There is a link between Sarah and Noble.<eos> These guys chasing me did not want him to tell the truth.<eos> You have to talk to Sarah.<eos> She's your client and she's lying to you, Mitch.<eos> I will.
- I was suturing a turkey. - Uh-huh.<eos> Did you eat it afterwards?<eos> It wasn't an eating turkey.<eos> I see great potential in you, Mary, if you stop fucking up in my class.<eos> I will.
You got over your...bump in the road.<eos> Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony.
Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony.<eos> You will.
The emergency vehicle need to go.<eos> Stay in your homes.<eos> We await the announcement the president.<eos> Once this occurs, going forward.<eos> Now, we will for Suzanne Gibbs on Capitol Hill.
I will walk through this fire to show I speak God's truth!<eos> Savonarola's been disgraced.<eos> He's being hauled to Rome as we speak.<eos> Has he confessed?<eos> He will.
I'm pleased it pleases you,my lord.<eos> And there are-<eos> Ninety-five more like it making their way from other foundries as we speak.<eos> Perhaps our fragile illusion will yet have substance.<eos> It will,my Lord.
The people of Florence celebrate.<eos> Ah!<eos> We greet this good news with caution.<eos> Has he confessed?<eos> He will.
Maybe it was Rebekah.<eos> But there was also a Klaus period.<eos> And let's not forget the Elijah affair. I spoke to my brother.<eos> I know you're trying to find out who you descended from.<eos> Now you never will.
See, I'm still waiting for my old friend to come back.<eos> By the looks of it, he's just beneath the surface. Waiting to come out and play.<eos> Right, ripper?<eos> I've been fighting that part of myself. Thinking that if I repress it, it would go away.<eos> But it won't.
- So maybe you're --<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Look, if that kid's yours --<eos> I said don't say it!<eos> Fine. I won't.
You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why didn't you kill him?<eos> - 'Cause we can't yet.<eos> But we will.
He's an actor, so...<eos> A working actor but an actor nonetheless.<eos> Poor Abu keeps his heart medication close at hand.<eos> You know, if the war doesn't kill him...<eos> The wedding costs will.
She's not ready to give this up.<eos> You wouldn't have to run.<eos> Stay on Mother's good side.<eos> We can have what they have.<eos> And in a thousand years, we will.
Look, it -- it could be nothing.<eos> Or it could be something.<eos> I'll look into it. Okay.<eos> Will you let me know?<eos> I will.
See, that's crazy.<eos> You got your whole life ahead of you.<eos> You're gonna graduate and go to college and get out of this dumpy town.<eos> No, wade.<eos> I won't.
Um, the wife won't have me back.<eos> Threw me out, actually.<eos> Well, maybe you should talk to her.<eos> Peter, believe me. If she'd take me back, I'd go in a second.<eos> But she won't.
I do.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'm gonna get a coffee.<eos> (captain) Give her a kiss for me.<eos> - I will.
Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then.<eos> I don't need to take a piss.<eos> Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.<eos> No one can know.<eos> Well, they won't. Not from me.
-And then what?<eos> -l don't know.<eos> We'll go back to Winterfell.<eos> I have no desire to sit on the iron Throne.<eos> So who will?
But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey.<eos> I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.<eos> Of course they will.
This is something different.<eos> W...<eos> Well, do you know what did it?<eos> No.<eos> But the Argents will.
Like what?<eos> I haven't learned that answer yet.<eos> Well, keep up the good work until they shut you down, dude.<eos> They're not gonna shut me down, Van.<eos> Yeah, they will.
The Dothraki?<eos> Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.<eos> Your people are in Westeros.<eos> The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.<eos> - They will soon enough.
Cheshire's heading North.<eos> Sportsmaster was headed South.<eos> Kinda like this mission.<eos> Maybe he'll double back.<eos> Maybe she will.
I'm going up there to stay alive.<eos> Come home from the army, breeding' me like I was cattle, then you take off again?<eos> No, you've got your duties as a husband and father.<eos> Kids, mind your mama while I'm gone.<eos> We will.
Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
But I'm sorry that I clocked you and I appreciate you taking Annie to L.A.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, and we know who got the best of who in that scuffle.<eos> So, if you forgot, just ask your previous shirt.<eos> I will.
Who was that? That was the founder of Nanovex.<eos> I've never heard of it.<eos> They make magnetically responsive nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to tumor cells.<eos> I've still never heard of it.<eos> You will.
I like him, I think he's funny.<eos> Do you know he offered to get me a job<eos> - at his parents' restaurant?<eos> - Really? Don't tell him I said so, but... I can do better.<eos> I won't.
Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me, because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else...<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
No, no, no, no.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not? Surely he'll understand.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But not everyone will.
You'll find a way.<eos> How's Mother?<eos> Resting.<eos> It will take weeks for your letter to reach the Queen and hear if she will even accept your offer.<eos> She will.
- Yes, right here, yes.<eos> - Is she alive? - Yes.<eos> However, she is in a coma, and...<eos> I won't pull the plug.<eos> I will.
What right have his heirs to inherit anything?<eos> Darling, what right have I?<eos> Frankly, what difference does it make?<eos> I shan't keep it if I get it.<eos> Well, actually, you will.
And I still believe that.<eos> I think you should always fight back.<eos> - Arie, how do you feel?<eos> When you say that, he may think: He's right.<eos> I will.
- What have been saying about my party?<eos> Spreading the word.<eos> You have 32 friends already.<eos> I don't even know 32 people.<eos> - You will.
- By the sink.<eos> The Guardian wanted Nan followed to make sure she carried out his orders.<eos> I saw an opportunity to save Eric, so I took it.<eos> So nobody in the Authority knows about your relationship?<eos> And they never will.
Bree?<eos> After everything we've been through, I promise you can trust me.<eos> I don't want you to know.<eos> You're the only one who still believes in me.<eos> And I always will.
No. Probably not.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's just -- he's so different from Duke.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
Look... maybe there's a way we could help each other out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I could give you enough information... - ...to keep your bosses happy.<eos> - What if the other cops find out?<eos> They won't.
Yes, I suppose I has...<eos> No but you've read an atlas.<eos> Actually sat down and read cover to cover.<eos> - No. - Ah!<eos> - We will.
- Division has become expendable.<eos> You're planning an escape, which we both know is impossible.<eos> There is no way out of here.<eos> No way that you can see.<eos> But you will.
Well, I'm sure Raylan Givens paid you a visit, and you just pussed out.<eos> Nothing to do with the fact that you've spent the last 20 years looking for a way to hang me out to dry.<eos> I asked you to deal with the marshal.<eos> You didn't deal with him.<eos> Now I will.
But wow.<eos> All right, you guys, it's been 20 minutes.<eos> We should just go in.<eos> Spencer hasn't texted yet.<eos> She will any minute.
What do you think it means?"<eos> Kate, can you do this? When you say it,<eos> - believe it.<eos> - I believe it.<eos> And so will he.
That was after daddy died.<eos> She was having trouble accepting his loss!<eos> Save your breath, John Ross.<eos> There is nothing in mama's journal that will in any way overturn her will.<eos> Maybe it won't.
Now...<eos> I want to make a contribution to your campaign.<eos> A large one.<eos> I-I can't accept that.<eos> You will.
Dee Ann.<eos> Me?<eos> This guy I'm seeing -- it's just fun.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
!<eos> Malory, I just can't.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Can't?<eos> Or won't.
Yeah, maybe dinner tomorrow night, someplace quiet, romantic...<eos> Look, take it from me.<eos> The where doesn't matter as much as the who.<eos> - Well, if you need me...<eos> - I won't.
These are Turner's partners.<eos> From KPEK, the Norwegian firm that would manage the dam,<eos> No surprise then.<eos> - Stephen call you yet'?<eos> - Not yet, but he will.
Cooper.<eos> Get in the car, sir.<eos> Get back in your vehicle.<eos> That's good.<eos> I will.
Now Sterling, listen to me.<eos> - It's like seeing the face of God...<eos> - Sterling! What?<eos> This car cost me a lot of money, so you have to take proper care of it.<eos> I will!
Feel free to stop me when you disagree.<eos> You're starting to win me over.<eos> Go on. Corazon, I just wanted to believe that rosa...<eos> That you all still needed me.<eos> Papi, we always will.
See.<eos> Venus is passing through your 11th House just now turning on your love light.<eos> You need to get your affairs in order.<eos> I'm not having an affairs.<eos> Well, you will soon.
Don't worry, it's perfectly reversible.<eos> I don't intend to stick with it.<eos> Not only will you look the part, you'll be the part.<eos> To the point I won't be able to tell the difference.<eos> - I will.
And besides, condoms don't always work, and guys don't always stay.<eos> Burt did, and Robert would, too.<eos> And we could have a happy family just like you two.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> Maybe you will.
- Alone?<eos> - I'll have your back.<eos> Oh, great. She has my back.<eos> Look, if things don't go as planned...<eos> It will.
Yet.<eos> I need to know what else she has, what her next move is.<eos> If all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.<eos> Is this ever gonna end?<eos> Yeah, it will.
Who did?<eos> - There's no way--<eos> - Meredith, he was your father.<eos> You probably both said a whole lot of mean things to each other, but you loved him and he loved you.<eos> More than Otis ever will.
You leave from here?<eos> Fine<eos> Disappear?<eos> Fine<eos> And if she won't?
Hey.<eos> Now I know why you were trying so hard to keep her here.<eos> If Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> No, no, Owen, you won't.
Except you don't know where they are, either.<eos> Yeah, you got me there.<eos> Why didn't they send you after Knox?<eos> He's our key target.<eos> Maybe they will.
You replaced me with a tiger.<eos> I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you. But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
That's him. Here we go.<eos> You use their greed, their fear, or their rage to make them betray the things they value most.<eos> With a professional spy pushing them hard, most people abandon their principles.<eos> What the hell is all this?<eos> But sometimes, very occasionally, they won't.
What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
This whore shit all over our club.<eos> Got my mom locked up.<eos> This is our get.<eos> We got to send a message, make sure the other pussy thinks about doing it.<eos> I will.
First apologise to Dilbar and Janemann.<eos> Don't act too smart.<eos> I won't give it. - Give me the keys.<eos> Useless, dog.<eos> - l won't.
Don't, don't. Don't you dare make excuses for Kyle Parks.<eos> You are way past that.<eos> I know.<eos> So, snap out of it, girl.<eos> I will.
I am going to kill him.<eos> You said they would call.<eos> D.B.?<eos> You said they'd call.<eos> They will.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny.<eos> But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
They picked him up last night.<eos> My guys are solid.<eos> I vetted them with great care and Fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this.<eos> They're paid to stand up to the heat keep their mouths shut, no matter what.<eos> And they will.
This is the second time the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.<eos> You know?<eos> Jesus, fool me once, right?<eos> Look, he won't flip.<eos> But his nine guys will.
We've been very honest with each other. Okay.<eos> Well...<eos> It's a good start, I guess. We'll talk.<eos> We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
I love you, too, Mason.<eos> Coop.<eos> Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Do what you gotta do.<eos> But we got bigger fish, okay?<eos> We trade him in, we get outta here.<eos> - Won't matter.<eos> - Yes, it will.
But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
You meet me outside.<eos> - Jax, I know you...<eos> - We'll do this outside.<eos> We should get Tara and the boys back to TM.<eos> We will.
I'm lucky.<eos> I live at home 'cause I have massive student loans.<eos> I like him.<eos> In case you were wondering, I think he'd make a nice addition to the family.<eos> And maybe one day, he will.
it will take you ... to a lush meadow with the high summer where you lie in the soft grass, and bask in the sun.<eos> And feel nothing but bliss.<eos> And you will never want to return to this frozen pisshole in the snow.<eos> I have to get out of here.<eos> It will never this good again.
Just take a minute to download.<eos> I haven't heard anything from the adoption agency.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Listen, it'll all work out.<eos> It will.
Let's say they're all right.<eos> It's all true.<eos> That there are these people that secretly run things.<eos> Then they've always run things, okay?<eos> And they always will!
But ma will...<eos> Will thank us once we find El Dara.<eos> We'll bring back enough riches for all of us.<eos> But we don't even know where it is.<eos> Someone in thundera will.
She didn't survive the transplant.<eos> But you did.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't move it.<eos> You will, in a few days.
Scott's with us.<eos> Really?<eos> Then where is he now?<eos> He's looking for Jackson. Don't worry, he's not gonna have it easy tonight either.<eos> None of us will.
From KPEK, the Norwegian firm that would manage the dam.<eos> No surprise, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stephen call you yet?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
How can you do this to Violet?<eos> I mean, what kind of person would leave a little boy parentless, out in the street?<eos> For crying out loud, Cooper.<eos> Of course we'll take Lucas if something happens to Violet.<eos> We will?
We, uh, photographed all the walls, and we're running a paint analysis to find the most recent graffiti.<eos> Maybe a tagger saw something... or the unsub left his mark.<eos> My son. You've been so brave.<eos> I have no fear.<eos> You will.
I...<eos> - Winter Olympics. Uh-huh. - No.<eos> 2006. Bobsled.<eos> Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better. No!<eos> No, I never will.
- HOW MUCH DOES DADDY LOVE YOU?<eos> - ALL THE WAY TO HAWAII.<eos> AND BACK.<eos> TELL MOMMY I SAID HI.<eos> I WILL, DADDY.
AND YOU'VE ALREADY SIGNED WHERE LARS HOLM REFUSED.<eos> I BEGGED LARS TO CHANGE HIS MIND.<eos> BUT I NEVER THOUGHT TURNER WOULD HURT HIM... NEVER.<eos> I BELIEVE YOU.<eos> NO-ONE ELSE WILL.
You're gonna go to the next grave on your list, and you're gonna leave a ï¬‚ower that says, â€œSurrender yourself to the F.B.l.â€<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will arrest you.<eos> Oh, cut that out now.<eos> You will not.
We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!
He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!<eos> Of course I will!
When your brother loses, I expect the other stones.<eos> He won't lose.<eos> You better not lose.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> We've got about an hour to air. Let's put it together.<eos> He'll cave.<eos> He'll agree to the debate on their terms.<eos> - No, he won't.
I might buy some light bulbs, and then, if time permits, I might do a little work on my master project.<eos> - Top secret.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So don't you dare ask what it is.<eos> - I won't.
And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
Where'd you go? I went to work.<eos> I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.<eos> I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.<eos> You can check surveillance.<eos> I will.
The stories we heard as kids, they were about lands plucked from the bottom of the ocean by a giant fish hook or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.<eos> Telling an islander they're going to die violently is just reminding us we're home.<eos> Shower's $10.<eos> Didn't ask.<eos> You will.
- You'll be missed, Anthony.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - Take care of your boys.<eos> - Yeah. - Keep your eye on Pope.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
I want to.<eos> With all my heart and soul, I want to, but I don't know how to.<eos> It's for the best. You have to believe that.<eos> Never.<eos> I never will.
I wouldn't have thought there was much that could touch me in here, but that does.<eos> It's never come.<eos> They promised and promised, and I thought it was sure to be on the seven o'clock. But it's not.<eos> Well, I'll just have to wear black tie.<eos> But Lady Mary, she'll...
Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Well, if the vancomycin isn't working, then put me on colistin. It'll be stronger. - I understand that it's hard to just...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, because you know what your life is going to be.<eos> You know if you're going to... Take her to the park. Or if you're gonna stand at an OR table again.<eos> Of course you will.
He had a beard and a brown jacket.<eos> First, he slashed my brother and sister's throats, then he stabbed my mother in the back.<eos> I tried to stop him, but he said he would kill me, too, if I moved a muscle.<eos> You're trying not to scream.<eos> But you will.
I know it's right.<eos> For him. And for Sybil and this family.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Let me know if Sybil gets in touch.<eos> She won't.
Don't we owe this to Sybil?<eos> I'll do it on one condition.<eos> No, two.<eos> First, Matthew must agree.<eos> He will.
Wouldn't we be using him?<eos> He might not want to stay, my lord, after the unpleasantness.<eos> I think he will.<eos> But don't forget the cricket.<eos> I won't, my lord.
I-I thought you could drive us.<eos> There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right. I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
Two men caught a tiger under a barrel.<eos> Great story.<eos> The two young men were devoured by the tiger.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Sir, I will.
Oh, but I do have a use for it.<eos> I just need to know how it fits together, and I need to know what powers it, and I need to know how it works.<eos> To do that... I need to turn it on.<eos> You must understand your compatriots have gleaned no information from me.<eos> You will not either.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- Oh, that... ohh!<eos> - Chester?<eos> (strained voice) It hurts. My stomach hurts so bad!<eos> Morphine's not working.<eos> - It will, Chester.
Um... why isn't Claire here for this?<eos> Claire...<eos> Claire's dead.<eos> The skinwalker took her. We've gotta get that son of a bitch.<eos> We will.
Lie still.<eos> Much blood has been shed this day and all for something few wise men would ever want.<eos> You mean the Diamair?<eos> Morgana never found it?<eos> And she never will.
Yeah, no way you're taking leggy.<eos> This isn't about the bird, Skeezer!<eos> Stop acting all gangsta, dude.<eos> You're not going to kill anybody.<eos> Maybe I will.
Miss Paradise Pink.<eos> Oh, Miss Paradise Pink. Yes, that is marvellous, Mr Moray, sir.<eos> What is it?<eos> I will make an award for the most attractive lady wearing one of our pink flowers.<eos> Especially in your hands it will. Oh?
Steve, what if I were to tell you that you could help bring D.B. Cooper to justice?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is, how would you like a job?<eos> And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, so help me God.<eos> That I will well...
Did the couple you met kinda look like them?<eos> You must have walked by them on your way to the backyard.<eos> Classic.<eos> Still waiting for the subconscious clues to kick in, Jane.<eos> They will.
- Deeper.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You going for the record, Captain?<eos> Oh, she'll take it.<eos> Yes, she will.
Please.<eos> Hello, Finn.<eos> Hi, Mr. Brody.<eos> - Tell Dana I say hi.<eos> - I will.
You got me here.<eos> That's more than you ever had to do.<eos> Hey, you're talking in the past tense.<eos> Whatever happens or doesn't-<eos> It will.
Tpod.<eos> I am so good at naming stuff.<eos> You're really gonna plug an advanced piece of military technology directly into Mikey's head?<eos> What if it melts his brain?<eos> It won't.
I don't want you to stop.<eos> I want you to keep asking.<eos> But I'm not ready to say yes.<eos> Will you tell me when you're ready?<eos> I will.
Have you contacted his wife?<eos> I'm gonna see her tomorrow morning.<eos> She hasn't seen him in over 15 years.<eos> I need to know what happened to him, Bones.<eos> You will, Booth.
Do not shrink to console them.<eos> Do not look for friends here.<eos> You won't find them.<eos> None of these people have the capacity to understand you.<eos> They never will.
This was our place.<eos> - You have a problem, program? No!<eos> No problem. We're on our way out.<eos> - Don't come back.<eos> - I won't.
Come on. I want you to watch.<eos> I want you to watch as I take her life.<eos> Over here.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
Then you won't mind waiting a little longer for us to be together?<eos> Your plan to have Lily help you didn't work?<eos> My father has her wrapped around his finger.<eos> I have to find a way to expose him on my own.<eos> You will.
Maybe they're on the way here.<eos> Maybe their plan was to extract their men first.<eos> Either way, we have to find the key.<eos> You should get that taken care of.<eos> I will.
My memory's shot.<eos> Right.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Try and stay out of trouble.<eos> I will.
He also worked on the task force with Turner and me.<eos> I never liked him.<eos> Something tells me he doesn't like you, either.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> And never will.
I don't have any money.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I saw you with it.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.
I saw you with it.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.
Maybe we'll see each other again sometime.<eos> - Maybe we will.<eos> - Just promise me one thing...<eos> If you need help again, you'll ask.<eos> I will.
Only the Sidhe possess such magic.<eos> In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power. You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
You did!<eos> The kid's right.<eos> The money's coming out of your pocket.<eos> Sorry, slick, but we don't have that kind of dough.<eos> Oh, you will.
- George.<eos> - Tell us about your day.<eos> - Did you catch that spider guy yet?<eos> No, we didn't catch him yet.<eos> But we will.
Cherish your doubts, Michael.<eos> Jesus, lover of my soul.<eos> This is lovely, isn't it?<eos> Oh, I will never leave you.<eos> I will never.
Rachel, are you all right with this?<eos> I need you to be honest with me...<eos> I know I lost it in there, Dr. Rosen.<eos> I will not let that happen again.<eos> But it will.
I'm right here. Right where you wanted me, bro!<eos> Is this the guy?<eos> This is the guy? You know what?<eos> I don't trust you, dog! Jesus, I'm trying to make it right!<eos> -I never will!
Hit me!<eos> -Hit me, you piece of shit!<eos> -Let's get out of here.<eos> -Keep talking, Carmen.<eos> -Yeah, I will!
It's not a paper.<eos> It's my graduation speech.<eos> Save your money.<eos> No one gives a shit about those things.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom will.
We need to understand.<eos> $ 5,000.<eos> Listen, you pay in your DVDs.<eos> I have 500 discs Tranformers quality.<eos> Civilized people will always...
So, he really won't tell you where he's taking you?<eos> No, it's a surprise.<eos> Well, wear a hat. Sunscreen.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
But once in a while, people like you come along who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way.<eos> People who realize free will is a gift you'll never know how to use until you fight for it.<eos> I think that's the Chairman's real plan, that maybe one day<eos> we won't write the plan.<eos> You will.
I know.<eos> He's just mad that his friends don't visit him here.<eos> He thought they would all visit.<eos> But nobody came.<eos> Well, they will.
And about us.<eos> When will this be over?<eos> Soon.<eos> If all goes well.<eos> It will, won't it?
And Pooh supervised.<eos> And now to disguise the pit.<eos> Catch, Piglet.<eos> Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.<eos> Oh, it will, Piglet.
That's right.<eos> Well... I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.<eos> Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.<eos> My card is on the picture there.<eos> I will.
It affects you plenty.<eos> You may not have heard, but folks out there are getting crazy for a drink.<eos> A decent drink out in the open without a secret password, or some yegg with his face in a slot.<eos> You think your trade's gonna stick by you because they like your chicken and they want to help a plucky little woman get along?<eos> Ha, like hell they will.
I got this whole thing figured out.<eos> I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow, I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.<eos> Why don't you just tell us now?<eos> - Because I don't have it figured out.<eos> But I will.
Um, would you like to get lunch or maybe drinks this afternoon?<eos> I could really use one.<eos> Thanks. But I think I've had enough excitement for one day.<eos> Okay. Well, I'll be at Bradner's Pub in case you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
You guys are perfect together.<eos> You're in all the same AP classes, swim team co-captains, you've both been, like, class everything since kindergarten.<eos> Trust me, it's going to happen.<eos> Has he asked you yet?<eos> Well, he will.
It's more than that.<eos> I've never felt like this before.<eos> You and Jesse Richter.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> - Yeah, no one will.
Don't you tell me what my son feels.<eos> He's coming with me, and there isn't anything you can do.<eos> Then you can't have that commission.<eos> Oh, well, we'll see about that!<eos> Yeah, we will.
She adopted this life. I didn't drag her into it.<eos> I'm trying to give her what she wants.<eos> Why won't... she's my wife.<eos> Why won't any of you help me do this?<eos> I will.
I love you.<eos> Kate, water 15th, power 20th.<eos> I know. I got it.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother.<eos> I will.
I have had thoughts.<eos> I want to do a paper on this -- on you.<eos> Nothing flashy -- just a dry academic one.<eos> But I think we can help some people. How would a paper help anyone?<eos> Probably won't.
From where I stand, you are good, and Broadsky's bad.<eos> Thanks for standing there, Bones.<eos> I'm standing right beside you, Booth.<eos> Like always.<eos> Like I always will.
I... I was so inspired.<eos> You know, it's...<eos> It's funny.<eos> I've won a lot of trophies before for singing competitions and dancing competitions, but I've always felt like the girl who never gets the brass ring.<eos> And maybe I never will.
He doesn't appreciate you as a partner, Tess, and certainly not as a woman.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> You... And dad... For different reasons, of course.<eos> If you're here to take out Lionel, I'm afraid I won't be the one that can help you.<eos> Yes, you will.
You are so artistic, Silver.<eos> Please, I just hope I remember to take the lens cap off.<eos> What?<eos> You better.<eos> I will.
That's right, yeah.<eos> How about, uh, Dr. Armand Silva?<eos> Armand Silva.<eos> - No, I don't know that one.<eos> You will.
We are.<eos> I think that maybe sometimes I test you.<eos> You know, I keep thinking that if things get too hard, you'll give up on me.<eos> But you never do.<eos> And I never will.
Yeah, and if no one does, my mom will.<eos> You can't risk anyone else's future to protect hers.<eos> The right thing to do here is nothing.<eos> Then the worst that happens is Lily pays for what she did.<eos> At least no one else will.
I'm gonna do some serious time.<eos> I know this probably ain't the right moment but will you marry me, Maya?<eos> Yeah, I'll marry you.<eos> Will you wait for me to get out?<eos> Of course I will.
You also need to get closer to Alderman Gibbons.<eos> Why would Gibbons be getting cozy with the Irish mob?<eos> Because he's a smart guy, and he knows it takes a lot of friends to run this city.<eos> I've been under for almost a year. I've never met the man.<eos> After today, you will, and soon.
Really?<eos> I just made that shit up to turn you on, Dean.<eos> See, I know everything about you.<eos> Everything.<eos> And soon they will too.
You're hopping off?<eos> Look, there's too many guards. We can't outrun 'em.<eos> - I'm gonna have to buy you some time.<eos> - How will you get out of here?<eos> I probably won't.
Because I'm your niece and he doesn't like you.<eos> So it was just a matter of time before he decided to keep Isaac on the team and bounce me back out to street patrol.<eos> Now that I took a bullet for him, getting rid of me won't be so easy.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I will.
This thing pans out, I might let you keep giving me tips.<eos> That's all sorts of wrong, Wysocki.<eos> I am all sorts of wrong, Big.<eos> Stay sexy.<eos> I will.
- Wylla.<eos> - That's it.<eos> She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honour.<eos> You never told me what she looked like.<eos> Nor will I.
- Why?<eos> - We have to call him. - Ew.<eos> I am not going to talk to him.<eos> - Me either.<eos> - I will.
It affects you plenty.<eos> You may not have heard, but folks out there are getting crazy for a drink.<eos> A decent drink out in the open without a secret password, or some yegg with his face in a slot.<eos> You think your trade's gonna stick by you because they like your chicken and they want to help a plucky little woman get along?<eos> Like hell, they will.
I have to be somewhere.<eos> Like to come?<eos> Did you catch Ethan?<eos> Have you found out how he's going to do it?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I mean, think of what he's been through. He's a wreck.<eos> Well, maybe moving out of a house filled with memories of Beth would be good for him.<eos> Am I supposed to believe that you are suddenly interested in Paul's well-being?<eos> Look, I don't like the guy.<eos> I never will.
But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will!
Do you think it happens in other villages?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Wherever it is we have to stop it.<eos> We will.
You know, the only thing that helped me stop drinking was to be able to focus on her gorgeous face and not the bottle in all those ads.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, tell all your non-alchy friends to keep drinking the stuff.<eos> I own a piece of the company.<eos> - I will.
Philip pulled you out of the field for a reason.<eos> You have more important work to do here, Connor.<eos> We're so close.<eos> You told Philip this would work.<eos> Yeah, and it will.
How long until the next dark time?<eos> Nine months, in dome time. But out there...<eos> Less than three hours.<eos> What if they don't come back?<eos> They will.
It will do something.<eos> Its something may not be enough for us.<eos> French arms may alter the whole equation!<eos> Has the College of Cardinals heard?<eos> No, but they will.
How many more innocent souls do you plan to take?<eos> My faith taught me to value every soul.<eos> But in this kind of war I've had to learn to adapt.<eos> Compromise, make sacrifices.<eos> And so will you.
Like I've been saying, there's not gonna be a pattern.<eos> They're just gonna kill whenever the opportunity presents itself.<eos> So we're either gonna need dumb luck to catch these guys or just wait for Starla to turn on Mars.<eos> I don't see that happening.<eos> Yeah, it will.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> I'm not saying you're right. But they deserve to know the facts of the mission.<eos> Call for volunteers. But they got to hear both sides.<eos> And they will...
It's just like before, when Dad brought both of us here, put us on different planes back to the mainland.<eos> I haven't talked to you in ten years.<eos> And I never saw Dad again.<eos> We're gonna see each other again, okay?<eos> We will.
- Well, how do you think he feels?<eos> Have you spoken to him about it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Maybe you should.<eos> All right, I will.
- Limbs missing and faces blown apart.<eos> And Lady Sybil's been nurtured so very gently.<eos> And what types would she be working with?<eos> Still, you'll know what's best to do.<eos> Yes. I certainly will.
- I feel like I deserve some answers.<eos> - You do.<eos> At least you got to talk to your father.<eos> I'm never going to be able to do that.<eos> Maybe you will.
- He is my prisoner.<eos> - He doesn't look like a prisoner.<eos> My sister will decide what he looks like.<eos> Yes, My Lady.<eos> She will at that.
They're all gonna get your baby.<eos> But, honey, you don't feel this way because you were in an accident.<eos> You feel this way because you are a parent.<eos> It'll pass, mostly.<eos> Some of it never will.
So let me fix it then.<eos> If I pay, it means I have accepted it was my fault.<eos> But he has consented.<eos> He won't let us be.<eos> - He won't, anyway.
It wouldn't be much of a vacation.<eos> It's a big country.<eos> Not big enough.<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> I will.
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.<eos> - They've all gone away.<eos> - They'll be back soon.<eos> Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.<eos> No, they won't.

We think that your mother is going to use it to stage her invasion...<eos> When, how, we don't know, but we know we need to stop her.<eos> That's why you have to find out anything you can about it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I will.
I had a dream when I was detoxing and it felt real.<eos> I saw myself in the future after I had gotten my revenge. And that person scared the hell out of me.<eos> I realized what you said was right.<eos> I have a chance to get out before it's too late and I have to take it.<eos> You will.
And it is not just the hunters after us, it's everyone.<eos> But...<eos> They didn't see anything!<eos> I..s-swear, I--<eos> And they won't!
Let out of jail.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Before you ask, Marjorie, I'm afraid I haven't gotten to your letter yet.<eos> - As soon as you can, please. - Right.<eos> Have you seen Sergeant Daums?<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I guess I've come to realize...<eos> I'm more married to this team than I ever was to 3 ex-wives.<eos> It's been a hard year.<eos> We'll get through it.<eos> Yeah. We will.
You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice everything for him, and it won't save you.<eos> What will?
He looks like a douche.<eos> Fine, forget it.<eos> All right, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, of course I'll help you.<eos> I will, okay?
This is Barbara.<eos> You think you're the only one that was gonna have fun?<eos> I'll take care of Jimmy,<eos> Cynthia will take care of you.<eos> I sure will.
Seattle-Tacoma international airport is a nonsmoking...<eos> You didn't tell him we were going.<eos> I will.<eos> You got to tell him.<eos> Jack, I will.

Then we search.<eos> Room by room.<eos> Okay.<eos> But somebody has to watch them.<eos> I will.
I killed you.<eos> Stay back!<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> How's the world going to end if the beast is still alive?<eos> It won't.
That's rough, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Seeing that so young, the darkness got in deep.<eos> Never left me.<eos> Never will.
Forget it.<eos> Why?<eos> By then you'll have a new boyfriend.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I won't.

PYT Pretty young thing<eos> You need some loving<eos> TLC Tender lovin' care<eos> And I'll take you there<eos> Yes, I will, Yes I...
Okay, Dad.<eos> Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and... I need a place to stay.<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh... I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
What are you doing?<eos> You got a phone in here?<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> We could someone call for help. Yeah.<eos> We will...
The cops don't have this yet, but I can share it.<eos> You talk to me or they'll haul her in and charge her with accepting the blood money that you received for murdering people.<eos> She doesn't know anything about that.<eos> She doesn't know that you faked your death either, does she?<eos> She will.
What?<eos> ! And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
Your grandmother's getting worse.<eos> I need to move her to full care, or I'll have to transfer her to a state facility.<eos> I won't put her in a state facility.<eos> Then I'm afraid you'll have to come up with 25,000.<eos> Then, I will.
If we go on like this, we'll go bankrupt.<eos> We need Mariangela, baby.<eos> We need her if we want to grow.<eos> Grow?<eos> The family will.
Oh, he was looking for money.<eos> He seemed pretty desperate, though.<eos> I kicked him out, but I thought you should know. Just... be careful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.

Would you mind helping me with these?<eos> I assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus beneath them.<eos> - That mean you do know how?<eos> - I can kill Klaus.<eos> And I will.
All right, man, I'll give you the report, but it's not gonna have the right answers in it. It's a start.<eos> It's a form of communication, and I shouldn't have to chase you down here to get it.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Oh, it probably will.
All of you.<eos> See you losers tomorrow.<eos> I got to find out what Zachary meant.<eos> What my mom did to Heather Barnes--<eos> We will.
Or both.<eos> And I'm supposed to thank you for that?<eos> You could.<eos> Or you could worry about how Red Flag is gonna come at you next.<eos> Because they will.
It always comes back to the needy with you, doesn't it?<eos> It's kind of in the job description.<eos> I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner does wonderful work with the homeless.<eos> Why don't you speak to him?<eos> Perhaps I will.
Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.

You wouldn't have any idea what she wanted to talk to me about?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> Maybe you should give her a call in the morning.<eos> Make sure she's okay.<eos> I will.
And Bridge?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Keep safe while doing it.<eos> If someone's after your sister Siobhan, then they're after you.<eos> I will.
It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
It'll give you a chance to rest.<eos> What will you be doing there?<eos> Hiring a new lawyer.<eos> You can't leave him alone.<eos> I won't.
There is no man more attentive than the one feeling guilty.<eos> Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that? If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But he will.
Girl hates her life, is searching for something, thinks she finds it in a man, a man who needs her, and then... it all goes wrong.<eos> You killed her because she wanted her life back.<eos> Look... I don't know what happened to Rachel, and if you're trying to provoke me, it's not working.<eos> You can't imagine how the love that we had for each other existed, because you've never known it.<eos> And you never will.
Mrs. D'Agostino I know that anger you're feeling right now.<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.

Seven?<eos> A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy. Mm.<eos> So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will. Will she?
You son of a bitch.<eos> You want out of the deal?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take her back to Terra Nova and watch her die.<eos> Which she will, without this.
Maybe not point the gun at me.<eos> Put some weight and see how it feels.<eos> Get on out there.<eos> They're not going down!<eos> They will !

They have heightened senses.<eos> Like soldiers, but they blend in.<eos> They could follow a scent, work a crime scene, evaluate evidence.<eos> - Why not send another soldier after us?<eos> - She will.

I'm delighted to hear the news, though.<eos> I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> She's a wonderful woman.<eos> She'll make a wonderful wife.<eos> No, she won't.
Is she present?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Your lawyer requested to drop the suit?<eos> Will you drop the charges?<eos> No, sir, she won't!
I understand.<eos> Then you understand why I have to fight.<eos> If Uther is killed, so what?<eos> How many of our kind have died at his hands?<eos> How many more will?
- I'm telling you... No, I'm not gonna call Kieran and say I don't know where Julie is.<eos> - Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> No.<eos> All right, I will.
We have kids.<eos> Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named... -... Felicia.<eos> - Felicia.<eos> I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.<eos> And someday you will.
When?<eos> Saturday night I'll be back in Atlantic City.<eos> Is this the real number?<eos> You'll have to call it and see.<eos> I will.
- Hey, Greg. - How was your day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Sam?<eos> What? Come on, say something to me.<eos> No! I won't! Ah!
We love them. Early humans do need guidance.<eos> Is that your role, Jack?<eos> To guide them?<eos> Yes, I see myself as something of a shepherd, guiding our family through life's pastures. Yes, I would say Jack is sort of an honorary shepherd.<eos> Kind of a shepherd emeritus, if you will.
What's that, like a diary?<eos> No, it's like a writer's notebook.<eos> Short stories, essays... stuff like that.<eos> Why don't you just write the novel?<eos> I will.
I don't get it.<eos> I thought he'd show.<eos> I told you not to come. They're staking the place out.<eos> If they find you...<eos> They won't.
Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.
I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Gammy.
We survived that blast, somewhat.<eos> And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped with his research, which I perfected and which you will now experience first-hand.<eos> Does Ana know about this?<eos> About you?<eos> No, and she never will.
Locking people away.<eos> I'll play whatever role I need to.<eos> Claire will never look at you the same way again.<eos> Claire never needs to know. But she will.<eos> They all will.
It's honorable and worthy fairytale profession, Jack.<eos> Please sir, all I ever wanted to be is a hero.<eos> You want to be a hero?<eos> Everybody wants it Jack, but few that commit.<eos> I will.
You go ahead and make the arrangements.<eos> What?<eos> You got the money back?<eos> You serious?<eos> Not yet... but I will.
I'm gonna try and get on the 7:10.<eos> If I do, I'll be back in L.A by 9:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can always leave later, if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
My dad didn't make partner, but he and Mr. Black became friends.<eos> Not best friends, but good friends.<eos> Seeing as how they might get to be family someday.<eos> Um, I didn't agree to that.<eos> Oh, you will.
Robinson.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> I promised him.<eos> I promised him he'd see me again.<eos> And he will, but not in this world.
No-one knows what's happened to him.<eos> He's been arrested!<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - He'll tell the police about us!<eos> - Of course he won't.
You're saying it.<eos> Call my wife.<eos> - Call Regina.<eos> - Fine. Mark.<eos> I will. All right?
Call my wife.<eos> - Call Regina.<eos> - Fine. Mark.<eos> I will. All right?<eos> I will.
-So then you don't.<eos> -I know, it's true.<eos> Do not bait Father about politics when he comes. -No.<eos> -Or he won't pick up the check.<eos> -He won't, will he?
- She's smiling.<eos> - She's dreaming about her babies.<eos> It's the only thing that makes her happy.<eos> - I hope she finds them.<eos> - She will.
By that, I mean a casual lunch or after-work drinks, okay?<eos> No dinner and no movies.<eos> You're not taking these boys to see The Devil Wears Prada.<eos> God, I love that movie.<eos> No, I won't.
- You are saying stuff behind his back.<eos> - No. I'm just sharing a feeling with you.<eos> And I want you to.<eos> But, Peter, please don't say anything to him.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Get a pizza, some vino de la casa forget about the phony little fraud.<eos> I'm not a fraud.<eos> - Get the fuck out of here.<eos> - You... You don't understand.<eos> And you never will.
I'm really sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> Just keep... Keep saying it.<eos> Over and over again, please.<eos> Yeah, I will.
So they're at least normal enough to have real jobs that pay tons of money.<eos> You think having lots of money makes you normal?<eos> You've clearly never met my family.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
He's handsome as ever, and he's still interested in me.<eos> - Oh, wow. I could live here.<eos> - George?<eos> Promise you won't say anything to embarrass me today.<eos> - I won't if you won't.
You are not helping.<eos> The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you!<eos> Raphy, I have to get her to approve this stuff.<eos> Honey, I know.<eos> She will, okay?
She's the most beautiful girl in the whole world.<eos> You know, I remember when your father picked me up for our first date I swear, he was the most handsome man I'd ever laid eyes on.<eos> I knew right then and there that I would fuck him that night and end up marrying him.<eos> I sure hope that happens to me tonight.<eos> Oh, it will, Ronnie.
My country doesn't negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Neither does yours.<eos> This doesn't happen in my country.<eos> Give it time.<eos> It will.
- Where are you going?<eos> Layla called.<eos> She wants to hang.<eos> So your heart's healed?<eos> It will... in time.
No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.<eos> There's one client I'm interested in.<eos> Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched and you'll never see me again.<eos> I haven't seen you yet.<eos> You will.
- Yeah.<eos> Three-day stay, 13,000 and counting.<eos> Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover?<eos> I mean I know it's strictly your domain, but...<eos> They will.
I'll take it.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Just for Annie.<eos> - This would never fit Annie.<eos> - It will someday.
The country is incapable of taking care of itself.<eos> They just don't know it yet.<eos> So you're going to prove it by blowing up a building? I handed them a weapon that could've stopped all of this.<eos> They just didn't wanna make it.<eos> But after today, they will.
Going in the backyard and trying it out.<eos> It's pretty great.<eos> You stay away from me.<eos> You know what?<eos> . I will.
I don't remember my name, and they took everything.<eos> They took everything... except this.<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> Maybe it'll help.<eos> Maybe it will. Maybe it will.
He made a bunch of money selling stocks.<eos> - Jeez, how many stocks did he sell?<eos> - Never mind that.<eos> Go wash up, and don't touch anything.<eos> - I won't.
But I'll be lying and you know that I'll be lying.<eos> And one morning you're gonna wake up and... say to yourself,<eos> "I just wish that fucking girl...<eos> I just wish that fucking girl would leave me alone so I can be happy again." You won't be able to handle it.<eos> You won't.
It's safe with us.<eos> He's just a man,<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Then why can't you catch him?<eos> We will.
And that's cool.<eos> She just lost her husband,<eos> And maybe I'm asking for too much, too soon.<eos> But if there is something going on with her, I just want her to know she can let me in.<eos> She will.
The light.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Tell Lucy we're sorry.<eos> Tell them all we love them very much.<eos> I will.
Of that you can be certain.<eos> Aye. If the night proves your woman to be wrong again, she'll find herself rowing for 20 men on the morrow.<eos> Have faith, Ulfrich, for if Freyja's led us to Midgard's edge for nothing more than gloom and fog,<eos> I'll gladly take your place upon the rail.<eos> Or at least Thor will.
I knew you wrote the book.<eos> I liked it. - Really?<eos> - You're a good writer.<eos> I think you should keep writing.<eos> Thanks, Andrew. I will.

So, you're offering me Bradley's job as president of the company?<eos> I can't think of anyone better suited.<eos> Now, of course, it would be the same compensation package.<eos> - Please, tell me you'll accept.<eos> - He sure will.
I know that.<eos> It happened.<eos> But this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.<eos> Just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.<eos> I will.
I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> - Because you told me there was.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Well... you will.
Why should I adapt?<eos> I'm worked here my entire career.<eos> This is my home.<eos> And now I have to adapt?<eos> The hell I will.
What's the worst that can happen now?<eos> - I heard the word "jail" again.<eos> Um, why don't I just take Sarah to the movies?<eos> - No. No, you will not.<eos> Skip will.
Look, throw them away!<eos> I'm not gonna wear them!<eos> You can't have everything in life you want, Bennie.<eos> - I can!<eos> I will!
- See ya, mate.<eos> I ain't had one visit since I been inside.<eos> Tell Red that I said hello too, please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
It's an ambitious development.<eos> And a lucrative one.<eos> When this land becomes available, I will need capital investors.<eos> Ifthis land becomes available.<eos> Oh, it will.
Twenty three years on the bench, I've never been swayed by anyone or anything.<eos> I'm not gonna start now.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> You throw out the case or I cut your family in half.<eos> No, you won't.

that you could know this, Doctor... but... the trial's already over.<eos> - And that's justice?<eos> - That's reality. See, I have a sympathetic victim, a nervous defendant, strong evidence.<eos> And you never lose.<eos> Some day I will.
Eli, we'd better get back to the North Pole, lickety-split.<eos> Santa's gonna need all the help he can get.<eos> - He can talk? - Uh-huh.<eos> We don't have enough magic to power the truck.<eos> We will soon.
You're his mother.<eos> He'll come to you.<eos> He won't come anywhere near here.<eos> He knows better.<eos> He will.
But our cause is right.<eos> We can't surrender.<eos> Martyring yourselves won't change anything.<eos> No one will even know.<eos> God will.
What?<eos> That I want you in my life forever.<eos> Steve?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will.
He just thought you wouldn't want it since he already gave it to lindsey.<eos> So,you see,it's not all about x's and o'S.<eos> It's about heart.<eos> I just think you should really think about that.<eos> I will.
Because I wasn't with you.<eos> So I wanted To ask you something.<eos> Will you be my valentine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
Why did you lie?<eos> Listen, my job is to keep you safe and get you to your destination, not to answer a lot of questions.<eos> - Tell me why you lied to your partner.<eos> - Please, just drop it.<eos> I will.
It's a mess Every time I come down here.<eos> Maybe it's you.<eos> How's the jaw?<eos> You get anything from Ellis?<eos> I will.

Agent Dunham is on point.<eos> Please give her whatever assistance she needs.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dunham... take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
Well, you are marrying one hell of a woman. I'll tell you that.<eos> I am truly and sincerely happy for you, man.<eos> Look at you two, eyeing each other all sexy-sexy.<eos> I hope I find somebody to feel that way about.<eos> Oh, you will.
But you're not easy to read.<eos> We really need to talk about personal space.<eos> It's not too late, Jordan.<eos> Boodikka believes in my vision.<eos> Others will too.
- I'm bluffing.<eos> But the rest of us, we mean business.<eos> - I said, shoot it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - Yeah, well, maybe she will.

You know it.<eos> And God knows it too.<eos> But I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I will never forgive you for what you've done.<eos> And neither will Jesus.
Well, that's good.<eos> Thank you, nora.<eos> Because the pastor will know what to do.<eos> That's right.<eos> She will.
Actually, there's been a change.<eos> He wants me to drive you instead.<eos> - Where exactly is Mr. Gillum?<eos> - I'd like to speak with him.<eos> You will. Very soon.
How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> Because you told me there was, John.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well...<eos> You will.
But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.
Please, no-one here knows.<eos> We understand.<eos> You have nothing to blame yourself for, Ryan.<eos> I've been back to the house a thousand times and never once had the guts to go back in.<eos> But I will.
I'm giving you a chance to comment before I write the story.<eos> Go into print and you'll be laughed out of town.<eos> Not if I er... have the proof.<eos> But you don't.<eos> And you never will.
Well, either you like to slide headfirst or you're the utility player.<eos> Exactly.<eos> See, I can do everything... the interviews, the research, dress up like a hooker.<eos> So whatever you need, just tell me.<eos> Okay, I will.
Why would I do that?<eos> Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.<eos> All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.<eos> We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.<eos> We will.
I need to finish my yogurt... then I was planning on working out-<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, just know... I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
Why not? This is a couples thing. My wife is very excited.<eos> - As was I.<eos> - What's really going on with you?<eos> - What if your wife doesn't like Marlo?<eos> - Of course she will!
I got it over with.<eos> - And I wanted to tell you first because I wanted you to know that you didn't fuck me up.<eos> My life is tough and weird and unpleasant sometimes, but I walk around knowing that I have parents who love me, who care about me, who always try their best, even if they screw up sometimes.<eos> I know I gave you a hard time when Mom was gone, but I hope you know that I love you, Dad.<eos> And I always will.
The enemy. Your mom is not the enemy.<eos> She loves you.<eos> She wants what's best for you.<eos> Mom doesn't understand.<eos> She never will.
Her ass is ringing.<eos> Here, will you hold this?<eos> I should take this somewhere else. Santa Monica, perhaps.<eos> - Tell her I said hi.<eos> - I will not.
- It will be months before I can even begin fitting you with a prosthetic.<eos> Which won't feel anything like a new leg, by the way.<eos> It'll feel like five pounds of metal that hurts and pinches.<eos> And what if the Army says no, what if they don't take you back?<eos> - They will.
- [Mark] Mosaic. All those leads I was running down.<eos> We should start following up on them now.<eos> Assuming your vision is even accurate, the investigation doesn't exist yet.<eos> But it could.<eos> It will.

You know, that might not have been the word she would have used.<eos> I've counseled so many patients in her situation.<eos> Maybe if she just would have told us.<eos> It would have been hard, But we would have worked through it.<eos> You still will.

Free.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> You're... welcome?<eos> Just make sure you and the kids stay close to the crowd.<eos> We will.
You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.<eos> And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?<eos> That would be you.<eos> But residing within you, is the potential for another me.<eos> Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0, if you will.
Did the Colonel spatter when you deep-fat-fried him, you sick son of a bitch?<eos> Pixie dust and lemonade!<eos> You have no proof.<eos> That story will never hold up in court.<eos> This will.

You used her to try to find that poor man.<eos> Then you used him to try to kill me<eos> Because to you... I'm nothing but a monster.<eos> He doesn't see our humanity, claire.<eos> He never will.
He'll be high again tomorrow.<eos> If he does manage to quit, what do we do?<eos> As planned, we give him an OD.<eos> - Will the police believe it?<eos> - Of course they will.
Mr. Monk?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Why don't we think about it?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
BYE.<eos> YOU KNOW, I SHOULD JUST COME BACK LATER, MAYBE,<eos> 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GO AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM.<eos> YEAH. COME BACK TOMORROW WHEN SHE'S FEELING BETTER. OK.<eos> I WILL.
Well, if these autopsies prove they weren't suicides, then I need to inform the media right away.<eos> I would err on the side of caution.<eos> What?<eos> People need to know.<eos> And they will.
And, finally, I think this is my chance to.<eos> Give him more time.<eos> I'll wait 48 hours.<eos> - But if Eli doesn't wake up...<eos> - He will.
Why?<eos> Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.<eos> That's the way it might be tonight.<eos> There's always a chance you don't come back.<eos> The hell we won't.
Well, I see you traded up for somebody better lookin'.<eos> Actually, he's had a few partners since you.<eos> Doesn't matter how many you've had, You never forget your first, right, Johnny?<eos> It's true.<eos> I certainly won't.
Go ahead, Andy.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> You're never gonna answer for it. Not in this world.<eos> That's right.<eos> Didi will.
I have to go.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Leave me alone, you hear me?<eos> I won't let you do this to me.<eos> I won't.
It's... it's just a manager... It's a big decision to make alone.<eos> Wendy, i'm trusting my instincts here.<eos> She sounds great.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting her.<eos> You will. Tonight.
- It's okay.<eos> I've got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that I didn't do anything with those other guys. - I never did.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> - I will. I will.
But I can recommend the fried apple pie, the frozen Hawaiian pie the chocolate pecan praline pie, the chess pie, the seven-layer Jell-O pie.<eos> They'll have the peanut butter pie and the Spunky Hollow honey pineapple pie.<eos> - Please, Harley.<eos> - Gotcha, Buster.<eos> - We will?
If, if we can learn how to shut the bad cells off, That will lead us to a cure.<eos> And just so you know, I'm not gonna remember your birthday or National Assistants' Day.<eos> Not because I don't try or because I don't want to...<eos> Hold this, please.<eos> I just won't.
HER-2 is a protein and they grow it in mice, because it's illegal to grow in humans.<eos> And mouse protein is the most like human tissue.<eos> So it adds another step, because they have to test to make sure it's safe.<eos> What if Genentech says you can't test it?<eos> They won't.
Adi... when we meet the musiccompany guys, make sure you tell them about Debbie styling our music video<eos> You could tell them yourself<eos> Yeah, but she's my girlfriend and... it'll be a little odd<eos> You'll tell them, won't you?<eos> Of course, I will
Did everybody get some pizza?<eos> Did you guys get some pizza?<eos> Because I ordered plenty of pizza.<eos> So please, make sure that you get some, sir.<eos> I will.
- She's gonna walk.<eos> She's gonna realize that I'm not good enough for her.<eos> You can't pick and choose the parts of yourself you want Rebecca to see and know.<eos> Shutting her out won't help the relationship.<eos> - What will?
This whole back-and-forth game for leverage is pointless.<eos> That's right!<eos> I'll do what I want, when I want, to whomever I want!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.
Not at all.<eos> They said that stain would come out.<eos> I am the last person you wanna fuck with, because I will fuck you back!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.
Is that what you call false imprisonment?<eos> I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job.<eos> Ramon, if you don't take this offer, you're looking at jail time here, OK?<eos> The prick isn't even pressing charges, Miguel.<eos> My detectives will!
It's not good.<eos> And you're gonna tell me, "I know better."<eos> Bedell is quitting. Leaving school.<eos> No, he isn't.<eos> -He won't.
But not until he tells us who he is and what he's doing here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> -He is who I say he is.<eos> -I wanna hear him say it.<eos> He will.
and what did you say to that?<eos> "i acknowledge that by signing this document,<eos> "i waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure."<eos> i'm not signing this!<eos> i, however, will.
With all due respect, that's not good enough.<eos> Now, I've been trained for a lot:<eos> Hostage crises, terror campaigns suicide bombers, chemical attacks but the things I've seen since I started working for you...<eos> If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.<eos> And you will.
We both knowvery well that computer simulations and live trialsare very different.<eos> I don't think we'redoing this cavalierly.<eos> I stand by the data.<eos> It will work.<eos> Perhaps it will.
Tell me, Xiao, what are you getting in return?<eos> It's my job, isn't it?<eos> They've promised you the Atlantis command if you help them get rid of me.<eos> This will all go a lot easier if you just accept where this is going...<eos> - The hell I will.
The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Well, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in, I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.<eos> So if we do not wake them...<eos> Then they never will.
So, while I can't empathize, I certainly do sympathize.<eos> Believe me, I know priorities change.<eos> And sometimes they don't.<eos> Teyla, I'm sure Kanaan will support you whatever decision you make.<eos> Yes. Of course he will.
Slow song.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> It's Barney. So?<eos> For all the years Heather's been visiting New York, Ted's never let Barney meet her.<eos> And I never will.

We'll find him.<eos> You and me?<eos> You and me, Eric.<eos> This never ends, does it?<eos> And it never will.
- Tommy, that's not what we're doing.<eos> - Just enjoy your dinner.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hope this works.<eos> It will.
- It's fine.<eos> - Yeah, well, I should be.<eos> I'm a mother of two with a mortgage and alimony payments.<eos> - I've gotta nail this interview, Tommy.<eos> - Sarah, you will.
A cosmopolitan.<eos> That's your favorite, isn't it?<eos> It's 10:00 a.<eos> M. I don't want a drink.<eos> You will.
What's left is too friable.<eos> We can't reconnect the organs to the vessels?<eos> - Not at this moment.<eos> No. - But if we can't reconnect, they won't reperfuse and they'll die.<eos> - Yes, they will.
- Hi,mama.<eos> What is this?<eos> I won't let youhop on the bed, so you're hoppingon the pop?<eos> It's fun. You should try it.<eos> Maybe I will.
- But - - you know,contrary to popular belief, some people can take pills without turning into a junkie.<eos> I'm going back to bed.<eos> Look,if it makes youfeel any better, I could probably playthrough the pain, but those pillsreally seem to help.<eos> - I just want youto be careful.<eos> - I will.
Sorry, I don't...<eos> - Get back together with Serena.<eos> - She's just gonna lie to you again.<eos> - She doesn't respect you.<eos> - She never will.
I know I shouldn't have been using a fake ID,and I'm sorry.<eos> But you overreacted.<eos> I'll be the judge of that.<eos> I know you're dealing with a lot right now,but you don't have to worry about me.<eos> Thanks... but I will.
All by myself.<eos> Well it's nice and bright in my room.<eos> Thought I'd do a little reading before bed.<eos> Maybe you should re-read your book And think about the comet and how close it is But you can't touch it 'cause you're stubborn.<eos> Maybe I will.
I left everything I had up on that stage, except the clothes on my back.<eos> Maybe you should have left those, too.<eos> It would have been far more interesting.<eos> Maybe I should have.<eos> Maybe I will.
You can Finally here more 'late.<eos> And not 'what for you signed, right?<eos> I do not Andro 'now.<eos> If you're worried that I you think that the six date a raised legs when I was more 'need you... well, I do not think '.<eos> Si ', it will.

You need me to get the nurse?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> - Don't leave me alone.<eos> - I won't.
All I have is the financial aid.<eos> How am I supposed to do this after the baby's born?<eos> I wanna go to law school.<eos> You know, I wanna have a life.<eos> You will.
But I couldn't talk them out of coming.<eos> I'm going to make him pay for what he did to you.<eos> Promise me you'll be careful.<eos> No-one can find out about you.<eos> They won't.
And yet, I swear I have looked upon your face before.<eos> At court, perhaps?<eos> Of course. In the court.<eos> I never could forget such a face.<eos> And I never will.
Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession ?<eos> He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.<eos> Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.<eos> He tell you why he did it ?<eos> No, but he will.
- And what were you gonna do ?<eos> Shoot me in the head ?<eos> Shoot and gone me like an animal ?<eos> I told you, I take you to New York.<eos> And I will.
North.<eos> Hello my dear, it's lovely to see you.<eos> Where is my daughter ?<eos> I see you haven't found her.<eos> And you never will.
That's not bad.<eos> Now when I get up, I'm going to punch you back.<eos> I just want to say, stay away from my right knee.<eos> Watch my left shoulder.<eos> I will.
Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome, young lady.<eos> Now say, "Have a very good day."<eos> Have a very good day.<eos> I will indeed.
Red, behind you.<eos> You may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?"<eos> You are now.<eos> Abraham, many people have died for this crown.<eos> He will, too.
You need support at a time like this.<eos> Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.<eos> You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.<eos> I wish I knew love like that.<eos> Oh, you will, dear.
- Good.<eos> For the moment, the Americans think they've dodged a bullet.<eos> Do not be late.<eos> - Don't worry about me.<eos> - I won't.
Everyone's going to the boats.<eos> You need to go, too.<eos> But, I want to stay here with you.<eos> You'll come back soon.<eos> Everyone will.

Living in the woods with all those filthy beasts.<eos> But look at me now.<eos> I've got a castle.<eos> I'll never go back.<eos> None of us ever will.
Stay back, Four.<eos> I don't want to see anyone get hurt.<eos> You'll never get away with this, Two.<eos> The rest of the crew will not support you!<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Virgil said you should pick out the curtains.<eos> Couldn't make up his mind.<eos> House is hurrying right along.<eos> Virgil ever decides to come and live in it.<eos> Pretty sure he will.
I don't know why i'm calling you but i'm calling you.<eos> You said you could help us and... can you really help us?<eos> This just doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What if he finds us?<eos> - He won't.
Or really the Jesus business.<eos> God is super powerful. - He can do anything.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why doesn't he just obliterate the devil and therefore get rid of evil in the world?<eos> - He will.
Army wouldn't pay a dead man.<eos> You'll have to stop singing.<eos> I'll sing if I want.<eos> They won't let you.<eos> Not pregnant, they won't.
Leave with me, and we can finally be married.<eos> I'm sure my father would perform the...<eos> Your father once said I was half of one thing and all of nothing.<eos> DHe'll never agree to our marriage.<eos> dof course he will.
Give me a hand.<eos> Take out the cake.<eos> If Mom weren't here, would you still stay? Tend to the house?<eos> If you keep it.<eos> We will, for the children.
Write what's on your mind.<eos> I'm sure Tobei will listen.<eos> After all, he's always been on your side.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.

I've imagined it so many different ways, meeting you.<eos> Killing you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, I hope it lives up to expectation.<eos> It will.
He's fine. I called him earlier.<eos> We had a nice chat.<eos> Did he mention that?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> - Oh, he will.
So think about it.<eos> My offer's still good.<eos> My interview is on wednesday.<eos> I haven't even gotten the job yet.<eos> You will.
Why don't I take Roger off your hands?<eos> Have Robbery /Homicide book him.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna help me.<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> It will.
Tom, I'll go.<eos> Leon Cushman's out there from the Post, okay?<eos> I have a relationship with him;<eos> I'll talk to him alone. Tell him to fix it.<eos> I will.
Try 'em out on us.<eos> "Cristina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you.<eos> I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.<eos> I could say, "Till death do us part. "'<eos> But I won't.
Are you sure your mother's not coming home?<eos> I told you, she's at work.<eos> She won't be home for another couple hours. / All right.<eos> You know, you should tell everybody that you, uh... - you twisted your ankle on a curb.<eos> - I will. All right.

- That steak was amazing.<eos> - Yeah, what do you season it with?<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'll never tell.<eos> Oh, come on. You'll tell me.<eos> No, seriously, I won't.
They sound kind of like heroes to me.<eos> Well, heroes don't have people killed, They don't consume the personalities of innocent men and women.<eos> I don't know exactly what The Marked are up to.<eos> I haven't seen the movie.<eos> You never will now.
Well, heroes don't have people killed, They don't consume the personalities of innocent men and women.<eos> I don't know exactly what The Marked are up to.<eos> I haven't seen the movie.<eos> You never will now.<eos> No one will.
- Well, if you want to tell people go ahead.<eos> - You know, it's up to you.<eos> - I have already and I might continue.<eos> - Continue away.<eos> - All right, I will.
-That's what it means, right?<eos> -Tom...<eos> That's what it means, right?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I will.
And you are, you know. You...<eos> You're okay.<eos> People need to know what he did to my dad.<eos> People need to know the truth.<eos> They will.
And I want you to tell the DOD what's happening.<eos> No. No, not yet.<eos> One more hour, I'll know if this last trial worked.<eos> What if I don't make it through this?<eos> You will.
It's bleeding into everything.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Yeah? You want to tell that to the guy who switched off London?<eos> - Mr Freeman, you stay here.<eos> - Mr Syme, no, I won't.
When I finished my dance, people clapped!<eos> Nobody clapped her. There was just silence!<eos> Dance is important, but Pauline looks right for Alice.<eos> She looks right for everything!<eos> She always will!
I think you hate your ex-wife.<eos> I think you want to kill her.<eos> But you can't because she's the mother of your daughter,so you find girls who remind you of her and you kill them instead.<eos> You stab them over and over,'cause they deserve it.<eos> If not now,they will sooner or later.
She's gassed up and ready to go.<eos> Besides that, it's comfortable.<eos> I don't think I can drive anything this big.<eos> - Don't worry, I'll drive.<eos> - The hell you will.
I'm simply following some leads.<eos> Leads?<eos> How?<eos> Think about this.<eos> I will.
He is off limits.<eos> I just want to hear his side of it.<eos> Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus.<eos> People are gonna want to know why.<eos> And they will.
Nobody believes me.<eos> My word against Santa Claus.<eos> But you think it was the same man, this Mr. Kenworthy, who killed the woman in pacific heights last night.<eos> But you haven't told the authorities.<eos> I will.
My word against Santa Claus.<eos> But you think it was the same man, this Mr. Kenworthy, who killed the woman in pacific heights last night.<eos> But you haven't told the authorities.<eos> I will.<eos> I. I will.
Yep, that's definitely Rohypnol.<eos> Do you have with insomnia?<eos> - That's nonsense.<eos> - Drink it, then.<eos> All right, I will.
Because I love you.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.<eos> But you will.
Oh, come on, Rhonda, but...<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about Wallace? There's nothing<eos> I can do.<eos> 18 months I was in with your brother, okay and I still never got enough to put him away.<eos> And no one ever will.
I'm in Hewitt 220.<eos> No way.<eos> Hewitt 110.<eos> You should totally come by.<eos> Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.
How's zack?<eos> He's not great.<eos> Jack says he'll take him to the game.<eos> You have to tell him that you're not going, dan.<eos> I will.
You need to get out of here, now!<eos> I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore.<eos> Either you leave, or we attack.<eos> If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.<eos> No, we won't!
Bear in mind that you did sign a confidentiality agreement.<eos> - You can't talk about the work. - Yeah, I know that.<eos> The real world is nothing like the world of academia, Glen.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
Yeah,it's a drink they giveyou when you go for an x-ray.<eos> It shows up anything thatmight be floating around-- yes,I-I know whata barium meal is, harvey,but how does it pertainto parsifal?<eos> I'm gonna sendeach of my suspects in the vishnevsky leaka juicy piece of information about an ongoingsecret operation.<eos> He'll think that thisoperation is being sent to many people alongthe pipeline.<eos> Yeah,but you'll just sendit to one person.
Who are you?<eos> We're the government.<eos> Sector Seven.<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> - Never will.
Huh?<eos> Nothing, for me nothing!<eos> This is absurd, we can't go on like this!<eos> Pay me and we're even!<eos> -But of course I will!
Do what you wanna do<eos> I can't tell you<eos> Who to sock it to<eos> If you want me to love you<eos> Maybe I will
$400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
Because you think this might be an irreparable mistake.<eos> Because deep inside you, you know it doesn't matter what the rules say.<eos> When the lights go out and you ask yourself,<eos> "Is she better off here or better off there," you know the answer.<eos> And you always will.
- What about Amanda?<eos> - Who's gonna watch her?<eos> - Dottie.<eos> Yeah, does Dottie know that?<eos> - She will in five minutes.
Well, your ears got bigger.<eos> Yeah, I got weird ears. Well, just...<eos> Just think about going out with me again sometime.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No, I will, and...
We've got to run!<eos> Oh, wouldn't she just love to come crawling back here and steal my crown!<eos> Cast me aside like so much royal rubbish! What?<eos> Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.<eos> - Perhaps he will! - Oh! Oh, dear.
It's real.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?<eos> Something larger than themselves and they're not ready, are they to hear it?<eos> Yeah. But later they will.
So my copy lived 12 years before Bender murdered him?<eos> Brutally murdered.<eos> I wonder what his life was like.<eos> I guess we'll never know.<eos> Or will we?
Really?<eos> Yeah, I'll take a cab home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I will.
-What?<eos> It's still recording.<eos> This is all set.<eos> You'll never get it through the door.<eos> Sure I will.
Two hundred.<eos> That's a good idea, Mickey.<eos> It's colder than a well digger's rear in here.<eos> Yeah, y... You should turn up the heat.<eos> Yeah, I will.
It is not mine, it is not Mr. X's, so it has to be yours, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Yes, it's mine.<eos> Please don't leave your personal items lying around the house again.<eos> I... I won't.
All I can do is talk to Sal and try and make him see that.<eos> But I need your word Jimmy isn't planning anything else.<eos> You got my word.<eos> Tell your mother Sean's in my prayers.<eos> I will.
She was my best friend.<eos> There's nothing you could have done, Stan.<eos> She was half dead when you found her.<eos> I am sure she forgives you.<eos> No, she won't.
Did you guys hear that sound?<eos> They're saying that it's blacked out half the state.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> They don't know what's caused it.<eos> No, well, they... They will.
It's all right, just... It's okay.<eos> Just got here and you're putting me to work.<eos> I think... I got it.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet. But you will.
- Yeah. Mrs. Jenkins down the block called. Asked if I could read Jane Eyre to her.<eos> Jane Eyre, is it?<eos> I told my gramms I was gonna read Jane Eyre... to this weird lady down the row.<eos> What if she finds out you're not?<eos> She won't.
It's just that I never actually thought about the reality of that, you know?<eos> Because I've been so happy.<eos> We have not been so happy.<eos> Look, the longer that we do this the harder it's gonna be when the inevitable eventually does come.<eos> Which it will.
Shall we dance? - Yes.<eos> Do you know what? Those two make such a beautiful couple.<eos> I think it's their duty to reproduce.<eos> Take me sailing.<eos> I will.
There's some partners want to invest in two hotels, in your neck of the woods, actually... in-in Los Angeles...<eos> - and naturally, this requires an outlay of funds. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Which, of course, you would get back with interest.<eos> If the hotels show a profit.<eos> They will, Uncle Howard. They will.
Should be fine tomorrow, too, judging by the sunset.<eos> I should buy a house in the country.<eos> You really should.<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe I will one day.
You better get before you hit traffic.<eos> - Be good.<eos> - Do I have to be?<eos> And give Kate and Sam kisses from me.<eos> Yes, I will.
Oh, and don't worry.<eos> I'll let y'all take pictures with our trophy.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Your trophy...<eos> We will.
Suddenly stricken with some sort of gay panic.<eos> "I'm your straight husband."<eos> - You can throw colour swatches at me.<eos> - I know.<eos> Oh, I will.
Well do you want to stay and have a glass of wine or chai?<eos> I have to get going.<eos> But thanks anyway.<eos> -Say hi to Harold for me, Beth, okay?<eos> -I will.
- He's an Arab.<eos> - He's a cook!<eos> - A German cook wouldn't have this problem.<eos> - l don't know what he's accused of.<eos> - You never will.
Man, this is hard to spell.<eos> Swagger is going to go with what he knows.<eos> He'll try to track the shooter.<eos> He won't get far that way.<eos> Yes, he will.
- No way.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - No.<eos> - What if your dad finds out?<eos> - He won't.
But I do work out of LA quite often.<eos> Well, if you're there on a permanent basis,<eos> - call me up.<eos> - I will do.<eos> Yeah, I definitely will.
I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
A soldier in the service of God.<eos> Take good care of Chamsiin.<eos> You sit here daydreaming again?<eos> Do you still think that your lover will come to pick you up?<eos> He will not.
You know, Hope loved marigolds and they're growing crazy at Beaux Reves.<eos> Do you wanna pick some and meet me up there about 2?<eos> And we can tell her it's all over.<eos> Faith, I wish I felt that way.<eos> You will, you will in time.
- You never have to grow old.<eos> You never have to watch your friends die.<eos> You can still enjoy the music you love, the pleasures of a good meal, good sex.<eos> - You'll always be 41 years old.<eos> - Not in 4 months, I won't.
But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
Oh, you can bet on that.<eos> Well, tell Katie I said hello.<eos> Will do.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I will.
I saved your life.<eos> You never listened to me, did you?<eos> By doing that, you've probably just exhausted half your strength, not to mention the fact you've now exposed our presence to the Fallen.<eos> - My strength will come back.<eos> - No, it won't.
- That's an order.<eos> - Sir!<eos> I don't know what happened to you on Terra, but this is war, and I'd feel a lot better knowing you had my back.<eos> I've always looked out for you, kid.<eos> I always will.
- But assault on who?<eos> - Assad.<eos> What?<eos> We don't know where Assad is.<eos> - We will.
Dave.<eos> Dave, get up.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Have a good night, chief.<eos> I will.
Indeed.<eos> Do you know who did this?<eos> Yes.<eos> My father says they are cowards. They must pay with their lives.<eos> They will.
Transmitting iris code now.<eos> It's true.<eos> Everything they said was true.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> - And neither will anyone else.
We're having a baby?<eos> We're having a baby!<eos> Nik, what have they done to you?<eos> - If they catch you...<eos> - They won't.
And you've never seen an after-school special?<eos> Dawson's Creek?<eos> How do you get to 30 and not know about condoms?<eos> Oh, God. I have an STD.<eos> No. But you will.
Have you ever had an affair?<eos> Uh, don't answer that.<eos> Never.<eos> Never have.<eos> Never will.
It's pretty much a wasted day.<eos> But I bought a suit.<eos> What, right around 11:00?<eos> Buy me anything?<eos> No, but I will.
- What? Can he?<eos> Yes, he does some effects.<eos> It gets a bit dark, but...<eos> - Talk to him, Silene, please.<eos> - I will.
Silene, where are you?<eos> At the salon?<eos> Are you gonna straighten it?<eos> Have you cut it?<eos> You will!
It does not matter.<eos> Well, we think it does.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> If you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.<eos> I won't.
Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
Gone where?<eos> Back to France, I guess.<eos> Why?<eos> I think he understood even better than I did that as much as he loved me, I didn't love him.<eos> And I probably never will.
When I was unconscious, I saw Keith.<eos> This is where I was murdered, Luke.<eos> I still don't believe that Jimmy killed you, Keith.<eos> You still can't see it, can you?<eos> You will.
Thank god.<eos> One is perfection.<eos> Two is decadent.<eos> You take another step, and i will shoot you.<eos> No, you won't.
It's OK.<eos> You all right?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Stan'll come around.<eos> No, he won't.
We can at least some spliffs before you're taken out and debollocked.<eos> Oh, nice. Thanks Tone.<eos> Relax. We'll sell it tomorrow.<eos> Where?<eos> We just will.
Don't touch.<eos> But I wanna touch.<eos> Honestly, I'll die if I don't touch.<eos> So who's buying us a drink?<eos> - I will.
That's a sin of omission, much better than the comission.<eos> I think it's an omission/comission thing.<eos> But you still forgot about us.<eos> So next time, just bring like the family-order size...<eos> - I will.
Thank you, but no.<eos> You feel it, don't you?<eos> There's something going on here about Mina's death.<eos> Things you're not sure you can talk about with the police and FBI, because you don't think they'll believe you.<eos> I will.
-We've averaged a 5-7/19 over...<eos> -Over five months.<eos> Over two it's a 4-8 and the half-hours are simply unacceptable.<eos> -Then we need to talk about this.<eos> -We will.
We've entered bedlam.<eos> The very gates of hell.<eos> I don't understand why you didn't close this place years ago.<eos> Because, Miss Bagstock, they can change.<eos> And they will.
You're delirious.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> We'll talk about it when you're better.<eos> I can't wait that long.<eos> Of course I will.
As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
Brad, I know it's silly... - but it's policy.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> The policy is dumb, and I won't sign it.<eos> - You have to sign.<eos> - I won't.
- I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna need to see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
Then history will have to make its judgments.<eos> And since history's first draft will be written in our logs...<eos> Well, then I guess I've got some writing to do.<eos> Think about that commendation.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Don't let anyone see she got to you.<eos> We're trash, bro.<eos> Okay?<eos> Low life grunts. we have no place in her world.<eos> We never will.
I'm going to break this guy out of here, or I'm going to die trying.<eos> And if it's the latter, then that should count for something, right?<eos> That's got to count for something.<eos> You tell them that.<eos> - I will.
When he comes, ask him to come home.<eos> The bucket has fallen in the well, it has to be taken out.<eos> Okay, I will tell him.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> - I won't.
I can't!<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> The place is a mess.<eos> - Put them in the mailbox. - I won't snoop.<eos> Of course you will.
You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, have fun.<eos> Tell the truth.<eos> Okay, yeah, I will.
You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine. Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
That's actually a legitimate fear.<eos> She was rifling through my shit.<eos> Okay, Fine, whatever, dude, stay here.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
You must be careful.<eos> For a man, a woman's beauty always ends in tyranny for a man.<eos> 'Tis the law of life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> You will.
You have to let me go.<eos> But the truck will fall, and we'll both die.<eos> Let me go, or I'll pull this fucking trigger! - No, you won't.<eos> - I swear to God I'll do it!<eos> No, you won't.
I don't know.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Nobody gets old.<eos> Nobody dies.<eos> We just keep on goin'.<eos> What if you died?<eos> I will.
I'm flawed.<eos> I'm a flawed piece of shit, Jack.<eos> Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Do you want to hear me beg?<eos> 'Cause I will.
Well, Nigel got what he wanted.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> Oh, you don't get it, do you?<eos> You will.
The head's missing.<eos> Nigel got what he wanted. And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You will.
You've got to get in touch with your emotions.<eos> Go away!<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - Of course it will.
I'll stop and get a big bucket of chicken, go to the liquor store, get some great hash.<eos> We'll get drunk, smoke some dope, and we'll bang tonight, listening to April Wine.<eos> - Getting chicken and banging, that's nice.<eos> Fine. Be careful.<eos> - I will.
The vault itself is opened only with... two magnetic strip keys... and a corresponding off site security code... which changes every six minutes.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Clearly, your client's money is in very, very good hands, Mr. Malik.<eos> Indeed. I mean, these guys would be crazy to even try.<eos> They won't.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she's amazing.<eos> But does she do the... naughty things?<eos> - We really appreciate the ride.<eos> - Oh, you will.
How bad's the horse?<eos> Go back and put her down.<eos> She'll hear the shot.<eos> She'll think it's thunder.<eos> No, she won't.
Partner, huh?<eos> Wow, that's quite an achievement.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Well, it hasn't happened yet.<eos> It will.
You shouldn't be so alone.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> Mothers don't count.<eos> I'd like to find somebody, maybe after Mother.<eos> You will.
I mean it.<eos> I want this to happen tonight.<eos> Not in a day. Not in a week.<eos> I don't want you to get scared.<eos> I won't.
And what if someone just happens to have a boy?<eos> What do you do then?<eos> That depends.<eos> Let me ask you one other thing, because, frankly, I just don't get you. I do not get this place.<eos> Oh, you will.
That's the only way out for us.<eos> We must answer for what we did.<eos> Every one of us.<eos> I promised I would help you.<eos> And I will.
I found it taped inside of his computer case.<eos> Off-line, where they couldn't get to it.<eos> - Will it work?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But Zeigler will.
- Clear?<eos> You guys get in the room.<eos> Stay there.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
The location of King Solomon's Mines is safe?<eos> All right. Grab the first plane out and return to the library.<eos> I'm not coming home right away, Judson.<eos> I'm going to the Mines. It's dangerous, Flynn. I mean, if the Key of Solomon should fall into the wrong hands...<eos> It won't, okay?
Sit down, please.<eos> Are you Inés Bilbatua, begat by one Tomás Pio Bilbatua and his wife María Isabel?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - We have only a few questions and we expect you to answer truthfully.<eos> I will.
Look, it's a bigger company, the money would be better, and I could really use you.<eos> - Owen...<eos> - You don't have to decide right now.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> Okay, I will.
What if he's killed?<eos> Could you live with that, Mrs Jones?<eos> I worked for Ian Rider nine years. I didn't know about any of this.<eos> - if anything happens to Alex ...<eos> - It won't.
You're a strange man, Jørgen.<eos> She has to eat.<eos> She's a terrible cook.<eos> - Take care of yourselves, okay?<eos> - We will, mother.
I just have to stick it out for a year.<eos> One year.<eos> And then I can do what I came to New York to do.<eos> But I can't let Miranda get to me.<eos> I won't.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you ready? Yeah.<eos> Did you find your customer?<eos> Not yet... but we will.
-There she is.<eos> -That you've seen.<eos> -Yes, that I've seen.<eos> I can't believe you haven't told him who you are.<eos> I will.
That is you<eos> The Prince<eos> The hostage ln which case<eos> I shall not reach Khitan<eos> No, you will not
It won't happen again.<eos> Oh, I know it won't happen again.<eos> Just so you know, in case it does, you're gonna find yourself on the outside looking in, bro.<eos> Improved or not.<eos> It won't, dawg. All right?
But, to them, you'll become a legend.<eos> The one who gave his life for them.<eos> How about you let her go, and I let you live out your life?<eos> How about I make you my "weyotch"?<eos> I'll never will you my power.
- It's just nerves.<eos> - You're not listening.<eos> I can't give up everything for ballet.<eos> No one's asking you to give up everything.<eos> But you will.
Well, have a good night.<eos> And be careful... okay?<eos> 'Cause I worry about you, in that place all alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will...
But what I now think is this.<eos> What happens when you become a man is that you stop blaming your dad for not being perfect.<eos> You realise he's just a man and you love the man he is.<eos> And on my bar mitzvah, my dad became my friend for one day and I loved him.<eos> And I always will.
Then where is He?<eos> I think I shall enjoy this human form.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Someone takes things from you, you take it right back.<eos> One for five, five for one, as my will...
It's the last one.<eos> Good idea, I think they've run out.<eos> We'll meet again, won't we?<eos> Promise me we'll meet again.<eos> - Of course we will.
Even if I agreed, section 1-12 requires documentation, testimony, groundwork.<eos> The record of what is going on right now is documentation enough.<eos> Curtis, please.<eos> Think about it.<eos> - I will.
Suvarov is over six feet.<eos> He can't be looking down at the president of the US.<eos> That's a risky proposition.<eos> If the press finds out...<eos> - They won't.
And I trust you.<eos> Former president David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.<eos> No information has been released, but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles visiting his brother...<eos> - Bill will call if he needs us, you know that.<eos> - No, he won't.
I know you've been in pain for a really long time.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I care about you.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
- Stop yelling at me!<eos> I just think you're being disrespectful.<eos> Well, I just wanted to watch a fucking romantic comedy, Ben!<eos> Please don't tell your dad I said that.<eos> I won't.
Yeah.<eos> Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No.<eos> And now we never will.
Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.<eos> Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?<eos> Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.<eos> So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?<eos> But I will.
In fact, I will bet you 10 bucks.<eos> That's is a very generous offer, I just<eos> - I just- I know that you can do this.<eos> I wish I had your confidence.<eos> You will.
Everybody's waiting for you.<eos> Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Will you tell Andrea that I had a crush on her too?<eos> I will.
It's raining!<eos> Please, let me in!<eos> No, you're never coming in!<eos> Stop telling people I slept with you!<eos> I will!
Please, let me in!<eos> No, you're never coming in!<eos> Stop telling people I slept with you!<eos> I will!<eos> I will!
Life is a strange fast trip.<eos> I'm just glad we all have seats.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Don't forget to scream.<eos> I won't.
Come on.<eos> This is number 6.<eos> She didn't say much, but she was a very important part of the team.<eos> - Stay cool.<eos> - I will.
Liam's cute.<eos> Bites a bit, but he'll grow out of it eventually.<eos> Jack says you're clever.<eos> The last thing you need's to get trapped round here.<eos> - l won't.
-Thanks.<eos> Good questions.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Officer, would you like to see Zellie?<eos> The detectives will.
When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
Look, I can't begin to understand what you went through.<eos> - That's right, you can't.<eos> - But, Max.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> - lt will.
You can call my bluff, and we'll all find out exactly what the copy machine can do.<eos> Of course, if you choose that option, I'm posting this Tritons photo on your home page.<eos> I've heard what happens to Tritons who reveal their secrets.<eos> I don't have a home page.<eos> You will.
We could put it out, yeah.<eos> He could hit us back for playing politics with a mushroom cloud.<eos> If the press finds it on its own, it'll be 900 times bigger.<eos> - And what if they don't find it?<eos> - They will.
If I do anything else, I'd be playing games with a national emergency.<eos> Well, you have to do what you think's best.<eos> - Keep me in your prayers too.<eos> - Yes, Mr. President.<eos> I will.
- In exchange for what?<eos> - A resolution sanctioning oil revenues to Khartoum.<eos> - The Chinese will veto it.<eos> - They might.<eos> - Yeah, they will.
Pocket your $800 an hour and work your deposition with your driver... or your pool boy or the woman who presses your shirts or someone who won't say "boo,"<eos> because you have zero interest in hearing how this should be done, but your problem isn't your lawyer.<eos> It's you.<eos> She is never gonna give me my deposit back.<eos> Yes, she will.
- No, it's not too late.<eos> He knows that he mistreated you both.<eos> He didn't know how much you loved him.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Edward, I always will.
It freezes level.<eos> It's nothing to do with hills. You need four-wheel drive... Four-wheel drive will give you control in slippery corners.<eos> That's what it's for. That's why rally cars are four-wheel drive. You need four-wheel drive.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - You will.
I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Well, the ring will.
I don't get it.<eos> What's wrong with you people?<eos> You want me to confess?<eos> Again?<eos> Fine, I will.
Go find Neela, please.<eos> Okay, Abby, look.<eos> Look for the wire in the oropharynx.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> - You will, you will.
The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Some kind of circle of life thing.<eos> This kid doesn't have kidney failure.<eos> He will.
Anything the moisture isn't sticking to.<eos> Footprints, handprints.<eos> When you see something, just circle it with the chalk.<eos> So if someone walked in here while it was humid, their footprints would appear under new moisture.<eos> The outlines will.
I was the one who could only manage three weeks a year.<eos> I'm afraid that I...<eos> I'm just afraid that I don't have a generous heart.<eos> I'm afraid that I won't have the chance that I had with Kirk ever again.<eos> You will.
I miss you too, sweetheart.<eos> Why did you have to leave me?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> And soon, neither will a lot of other innocent people.
that's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> just get in the car, please.<eos> we have to move!<eos> you promised you would keep us safe.<eos> and I will.
your evaluation took me out of the field.<eos> I simply wrote the truth.<eos> there's gonna come a time. when you can't follow orders.<eos> it hasn't happened yet.<eos> it will.
And it is your life that is at stake.<eos> And it is your life that will end if you continue to push like you did today.<eos> You said the LVAD would make me better.<eos> I told you the LVAD would buy you more time.<eos> And it will.
I need you to put him into protective custody and bring him back here to CTU.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Logan will send his men to retrieve it.<eos> - You've got to get to Jack first.<eos> - We will.
How did she do that?<eos> She waited, and listened.<eos> To make things a little more interesting, I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat The Blind Bandit!<eos> No one dares to face her?<eos> I will!
I don't think so.<eos> I'm gonna wait a little bit on that.<eos> It'll go down easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.<eos> - What if they find out?<eos> - They won't.
Why are we being held here?<eos> Oberoth wishes to speak to you further, and he feels he can no longer trust that you will remain in your quarters.<eos> Well, he's right.<eos> Yeah, if he wants to talk to us, why doesn't he?<eos> - He will.
- I bet it would have worked.<eos> - It might have.<eos> I bet they could have seen us from space.<eos> We'll never know.<eos> Then again, maybe you will.
If you didn't shoot her, then what's this? That isn't mine.<eos> You're going to tell me you don't remember showing me that on our first date?<eos> And you used it this afternoon?<eos> ! You have no proof of that.<eos> No, but I will.
Kyle's renouncing his sexuality?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you sitting down?<eos> Now, who'd like to speak first?<eos> Okay, I will.
The Chitauri wouldn't assassinate a king just for kicks.<eos> They're up to something over there, and I want to know what it is.<eos> My Lord, there have been complications in securing the planet.<eos> Nothing must stand between us and the meteorite.<eos> Nothing will.
No, I'm not helping.<eos> Didn't you see what they did to that other girl?<eos> They took her away.<eos> I don't wanna go away.<eos> You will.
Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking. Oh, no.<eos> Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail? - No.<eos> But you will.
How do you propose to do that?<eos> I'm going to the Center.<eos> I'm gonna bring it down<eos> - and everyone in it if I have to.<eos> - No, you won't.
I lost my family because of what I did, not because of what anybody else did.<eos> Tell daddy he didn't lose his family.<eos> Jake is your family.<eos> He needs you.<eos> He always will.
She's ready to go now.<eos> Tell mommy and daddy I'm gonna like it there.<eos> Nana says so.<eos> Tell them I love them.<eos> I will.
What for?<eos> You trust me?<eos> Of course, I trust you, Brad.<eos> It's just that if anybody finds out about this, I--<eos> They won't.
Maybe Noam Chomsky's reading the Havana phone book somewhere?<eos> I'm stuck at work tonight.<eos> Maybe you could drop by?<eos> G-rated booty call in the library.<eos> Maybe I just will.
Nothing. Just, I bet you don't.<eos> And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?<eos> No, because I know the pendant.<eos> Well, you're wrong. Because I will.<eos> Yeah. But you won't.
There!<eos> That's yours.<eos> Yeah, that was mine. I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.<eos> You would.<eos> You will.
I know, but he paged us.<eos> It must have been sent in error.<eos> let her in.<eos> I believe one of you may try to exploit the opportunity to leave.<eos> No, we won't. Right?
So...<eos> I spoke to the credit card company and pulled some strings with my old boss.<eos> You know you're gonna have to pay back every penny, right?<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
There must be a pin sticking out of it somewhere.<eos> I don't see it.<eos> There.<eos> Thank you so much. And please come back again soon.<eos> I will.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just that...<eos> I'm home, but it doesn't really feel like home.<eos> It will.
You know, a gardener for a father-in-law.<eos> There's no shame in working with your hands.<eos> - Don't forget that, Rohan.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I will not.
- Girlie, are you coming, too?<eos> I forgot, Abuzer, bro.<eos> Duro, I swear you look like a man now.<eos> Abuzer, bro, isn't Tekin coming?<eos> He will, shortly.
Last time you and I had dinner, it turned out to be a terrible idea.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I am a senior partner here.<eos> You say that as if it will get you laid.<eos> It will.
You're standing there trying to convince me that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door<eos> I'm gonna charge all of your asses<eos> Yes,as soon as possible<eos> You have to tell your officers that morgan's not a threat<eos> Like hell I will

Hope on the streets.<eos> - But?<eos> - The Narrows is lost.<eos> And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.<eos> We will.

Good.<eos> I'll meet you in your room.<eos> No, I'm on my way to you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
No. Which is that?<eos> This bar of yours.<eos> This bar of your dreams.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> Maybe one day you will.
And she's already short handed.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's to know?<eos> You either will or you won't.

Or should I say your mother-in-law? Hey, look.<eos> Let's not go into one of those, OK?<eos> I don't know what I'm doing with you.<eos> You're never gonna leave Ohloe.<eos> Maybe I will.
And you know it's just routine.<eos> For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.
For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.<eos> It will.

Actually, not for long.<eos> Okay, you heard me say it, and I meant it.<eos> I do not want anything to do with that box!<eos> I swear!<eos> Oh, but you will.

I know you do.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. It's just party planning, surprisingly stressful.<eos> You do realize I haven't actually gotten into the school yet. But...<eos> You will.
- Well....<eos> Sit down, Lorelai.<eos> Davida, bring a coffee cup for my daughter.<eos> I'm gonna have to call the office if this is gonna take long.<eos> No, Dad, it won't.
- Sure. I'm fine. You go.<eos> Emily!<eos> Your florist is here, and everything looks fabulous.<eos> - Really?<eos> - No, but it will.
- Whoa, who sent that?<eos> - We all pitched in.<eos> The whole floor.<eos> well, please, tell the whole floor a big thank you.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Hmm, I think so. - Yeah.<eos> Would you mind giving me a lift ?<eos> Well, you know, I just don't think I should drive.<eos> - We should have found it by now.<eos> - We will.
ROULETTE: Who are you kidding?<eos> You won't be happy stuck on that ship.<eos> I give you a month, and you'll be back here crying for me to give you another chance.<eos> Mark my words, Wildcat, I know your kind, and you will fight again.<eos> Of course he will.
Nothing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you do change your mind-<eos> I won't.
We're okay.<eos> - I'm just glad you're safe.<eos> - But Vincent, he ran off again.<eos> He found his way back to you once, Walt.<eos> He will again.
Forget it... I just need some quiet in this house, so I can study.<eos> Can you, please, pray a little more quietly?<eos> She is coming for you.<eos> Yeah... Well, I don't believe in much of this, okay?<eos> You will.
Peg.<eos> This is never gonna...<eos> This is Jonathan's day.<eos> Can we not do this? Okay.<eos> I won't.
Well, it is.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't have to explain myself to a junior agent.<eos> Okay, is this work related, because...<eos> But I will, just this once!
Boss, for once I gotta agree with Tony here.<eos> I don't think I'm the Hawaiian shirt type.<eos> You're the closest we've got to an agent in looks to Smith and Kirby, McGee.<eos> Which won't matter if whoever he's meeting with knows their faces.<eos> No, it won't.
- You can give me a month, can't you?<eos> - It's not me you have to worry about.<eos> - Abby works alone for a reason. - Which is?<eos> Something you should ask her yourself.<eos> I will.
Look, we don't know why Miss Rivers is coming.<eos> It may have nothing to do with the face mask.<eos> And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.<eos> - We have a lawyer?<eos> - We will.
I'll put the bag in the car.<eos> I'll see you soon, sis.<eos> I'm so sorry that I put you both through this.<eos> - Just get better.<eos> - I will.
- No. Brooke, Rachel's the best cheerleader we've got.<eos> If we want a shot at state, we need her.<eos> Look, I make the rules and I say Haley's in!<eos> And, besides, the routine won't even work with an extra person.<eos> - Sure it will.
- Not really.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've seen enough Afterschool Specials to know that you've got to eat.<eos> I know.<eos> I will, just not right now.
Within the next week, each of you will go into our converted supply closet... push the green button in front of you, and videotape your thoughts.<eos> -Do we have to?<eos> -Yes, you have to.<eos> I won't see it.<eos> Nobody will.
- So we make sure that doesn't happen.<eos> Jesse!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - We have to fix this.<eos> I will.
I'll be available through this whole thing, if you need me.<eos> Reverend...<eos> Reverend, would you give this to my brother?<eos> It'd mean a lot to him, knowing it came from me.<eos> I will.
No, Trokey.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I need out.<eos> I gotta find him.<eos> You will.
Outcasts and idiots.<eos> They all get restless.<eos> With the fighting done, they want to be home with money in their pockets, not sitting in this dismal cold and wet.<eos> None of the good men have run.<eos> Nor will they.
I'll never forgive her.<eos> Be that as it may, your forgiveness is irrelevant.<eos> You must come home.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I will not.
Rubes... so many rubeS... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes.<eos> Please, no, rubes.<eos> I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species-- a devoted husband.<eos> Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.<eos> And I always will.
You're the one who deserves to go to Yale.<eos> That's so noble.<eos> But what about Jenda?<eos> Hey, I'm waiting till I find a girl who likes me for me.<eos> And you will.
You wanna utilize my skills, you come to me.<eos> That is, if you really wanna bring down Jonathan Kent.<eos> Then I'm assuming you have some kind of grenade to launch at him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I will.
I can meet you any morning next week.<eos> - No, we can't.<eos> - We can't?<eos> I don't mean to be pushy, but this entrance exam is next week, and we really need to talk.<eos> - And we will, just not right now.
I'm gonna need unrestricted access to your staff at all times.<eos> Absolutely. We're here to please.<eos> Well, in that case, I'll need personal info for everyone who works here... personnel files, tax returns, security access levels, email addresses, browser histories... all that.<eos> No problem, buddy. Just say how high.<eos> Oh, I will.
- Where is my money?<eos> - I'll get it, I swear.<eos> I need more inventory.<eos> I'll pay everything back.<eos> Sure, you will.
It's way too risky.<eos> But if the Democrats can force a vote on the amendment it puts the Republicans in a tough spot.<eos> Don't wanna vote against a minimum-wage increase...<eos> - ...in an election year.<eos> - But they will.
On their quest for new species,<eos> Mike and Mario have to cross one of the world's great natural spectacles<eos> The meeting of the waters.<eos> Here the black waters of the Rio Negro joins the milky waters of the river Amazon.<eos> Now, how long will the very, very definite line of demarkation
Be reasonable.<eos> I am, but I won't let her go.<eos> Your wife's back and Milos will be, too.<eos> Let the girl go.<eos> I won't.
Alex, it's me.<eos> Please go away.<eos> C'mon, baby. Open the door.<eos> I don't want your friend to see me like this.<eos> He won't.
It's a flying machine<eos> It can fly?<eos> Yes<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
I don't paint anymore.<eos> I used to paint all the time. I really loved it.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> So paint.<eos> I will.
I mean that I need you to stay for the late shift.<eos> Janine's sick.<eos> Yeah, she's got a cough.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - No, not yet, but she will.
Oh, man, they got a basketball court!<eos> He's beautiful, isn't he?<eos> I just want him to have everything I never had.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And he will.
I had a member of my family killed.<eos> But he was killed by a white man.<eos> What we need in the United States...<eos> You be safe out there.<eos> Yeah, I will, man.
José Marti'.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> We got rid of all his books just to be safe but I kept this one.<eos> - If we don't win the finals...<eos> - We will.
Every asset.<eos> You heard me.<eos> If you do that, you could lose everything.<eos> Well, I won't.<eos> I won't.
You don't know what it's like to live a lie.<eos> And you do?<eos> I must do this.<eos> What if you get caught?<eos> - I won't.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.<eos> You and me both, boy.<eos> Chris, listen.<eos> You be careful.<eos> I will.
And I am gonna meet my true love and I'm gonna dance all night.<eos> - I can't go.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't have a costume.<eos> - But you will.
Great, put him on.<eos> Bobby, I'm sorry, it looks like he's gone to bed already.<eos> - But I'll tell him you called, okay?<eos> - Tell him Clare and I are fine.<eos> Okay, sweetheart, I will.
That's good.<eos> She's good.<eos> - She's great.<eos> - All right. Well, listen, I won't see you guys for a while, so... try to stay out of trouble. And Jack, will you keep an eye on him for me?<eos> - I will.
Sometimes he would make it up as he went along... and I knew, but I didn't care.<eos> Your mom said I was here to talk about your dad. But we don't have to do that if you don't want.<eos> I don't want.<eos> OK.<eos> Then we won't.
- Just call me when you get a chance.<eos> But I might be out of the house for a bit.<eos> Yeah, because my girlfriends and I, we're gonna go on a search for the lost city of Atlantis.<eos> Maybe my treasure will help buy your submarine.<eos> - Maybe. Maybe it will.
- It took them three days to get upriver. - Yeah.<eos> That was before the rainy season.<eos> These waterways could be dangerous now.<eos> - You said you'd get us there safely.<eos> - And I will.
Okay. - The watermarks and holograms match.<eos> - Oh. But I still have to register the gun.<eos> You have a nice smile.<eos> I haven't smiled at you.<eos> You will.
- That ain't none of your business.<eos> Someday? "Someday my dream will come"?<eos> One night you'll wake up, and you'll discover it never happened.<eos> It's all turned around on you.<eos> It never will.
I had absolutely forgotten.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> They're carrying a dead man to the graveyard... when you pass away, i'll carry you just like that.<eos> Yeah, right. You'll die way before me!<eos> No, I won't!
And for my part, you're like a son to me.<eos> With everything that comes with it.<eos> And, Gry...<eos> take good care of him.<eos> I will.
Hear what he hears.<eos> Feel the Call, like he does.<eos> Can you feel it yet?<eos> - No.<eos> -You will.
You know Jack Miller, right?<eos> Jack Miller?<eos> He wants to fight you.<eos> No, I won't<eos> Yes, you will.
Thank you.<eos> Mom, can you please not do that anymore?<eos> I just want my boy to find love.<eos> Is that so terrible?<eos> I will.
But why won't you wash your face at least?<eos> So that nobody forgets.<eos> It's just that you stink a bit...<eos> I won't have a bath.<eos> I won't.
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> - I can answer anything.<eos> - Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> - They can't keep changing.<eos> - They won't.
He's showing you that he had the power to help start your political career, but he also has the power to end it.<eos> You can't lose this debate and fail to pass the most important legislation of your presidency.<eos> - We'd hand Keeler the election.<eos> - We haven't lost the senate vote.<eos> We will.
No, I'm not waiting around to get caught.<eos> - Osterlind!<eos> - I'm leaving, Stephen.<eos> - Yeah? - Has she left yet?<eos> No. She will.
What I'm doing here, I'm doing for us, Grace.<eos> This is where we live.<eos> I just want us to be happy and not be afraid any more and it starts with Bradley Park!<eos> - I don't want it to end there.<eos> - It won't.
You are not going anywhere, my friend, because you are the subject of a murder investigation.<eos> I told you, Ray's the one who shot at that guy.<eos> Are you sure about that, Chris?<eos> Yeah, Michael and Dominic'll tell you the same thing.<eos> No doubt they will.
- Well?<eos> - If she was lying, I couldn't sense it.<eos> Then how do you explain what happened?<eos> - Sure hope this works.<eos> - It will.
Gideon?<eos> - No echo.<eos> - A good sign.<eos> They can never know we were behind this.<eos> They won't.
But please don't need me, because I really think I'm onto something here.<eos> Stubborn little witch.<eos> She's not playing along.<eos> What if she finds us out?<eos> - She won't.
I'm telling...<eos> - Good for her. I got them in the trunk.<eos> Wanna see them?<eos> - Not right now, but I'll see them.<eos> - You will, you will.
- Long as it's the only one you told me.<eos> I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.
I'm gonna rob Cy.<eos> Don't, Eddie.<eos> He'll know.<eos> What's the time, kid?<eos> No, he won't.
I haven't spoken to him in 13 years.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I suppose it's better than nothing.<eos> Nessa, both your lives, and mine, are in danger if anybody finds out.<eos> They won't.
No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It'll be bad for business if these morticians have their party in Mystique.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yes, it will.
You'll have no right to correspond with the child, it will be entirely up to Arlene and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you.<eos> Understood?<eos> - Upon your discharge from the hospital, you will be given an additional payment of $20,000.<eos> I just want to make sure that you're gonna take really good care of the baby.<eos> Of course we will.
- Oh, I said, "when you hear the beep."<eos> - Well, so what?<eos> I should have said, "after you hear the beep."<eos> They might start talking during the beep.<eos> No they won't.
So he knew you were having an affair?<eos> No...<eos> Derek was on assignment in Italy, he just got back last night.<eos> You can check with the Post, they'll vouch for him.<eos> Oh, I will.
Just keep him under surveillance.<eos> Whoa, hold on a second.<eos> You are not gonna believe where he's pulling in right now.<eos> Hammerton's Country Bar.<eos> Okay, maybe you will.
You can't use any of this in court.<eos> She was read her rights.<eos> She waived them.<eos> We can use it all.<eos> We will.
She is a beauty,sir.<eos> She is that, Gunny.<eos> She is that. You change your mind,sir, you just call.<eos> Go plenty of people willing to help you.<eos> I will, Gunny.
Sometimes feels more intimate than anything else.<eos> Maybe you could help me with him.<eos> Just until this thing with Gina is resolved, until I get custody.<eos> - What if you don't?<eos> - I will.
I know what that must have looked like or seemed like, but it's not like that.<eos> - We've got a connection.<eos> - Yeah, not anymore, you don't.<eos> - Lf Marissa finds out...<eos> - She won't.
Well the storms passing through.<eos> By the time we get there it should be gone.<eos> Okay, wait a second.<eos> Shouldn't somebody stay here by the phone? I mean, incase your dad calls.<eos> I will.
If Whitey wants you to feel like you're part of the team, fine, I just...<eos> I don't understand why I have to baby-sit you.<eos> He just wants to make sure you're going to be able to get open.<eos> - I don't have a problem with getting open.<eos> - Well you will with me out of the line up. Okay?
Brooke, it's really important to me that Nikki never finds out where Jake took Jenny.<eos> I know it's important to you, Peyton.<eos> That's why you can trust me with this.<eos> But she still hasn't told you?<eos> No, but she will.
Let's try to keep things legal this year.<eos> I'll give $5 for the microphone boy.<eos> - I'll go 10.<eos> - Do I hear 20?<eos> I will.
Look, I know he's got a lot of music connections.<eos> And I know how important that is to you, but I won't have drugs in my club, Peyton.<eos> And I don't expect you to handle everything on your own.<eos> But you have to come to me if anything like that ever happens again.<eos> -I will.
What are you talking about?<eos> Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an active imagination.<eos> Why do you keep talking that way?<eos> You'll see when you read your wife's book.<eos> Well, then, maybe I will!
Hi.<eos> Nate's gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope this whole thing helps him move on.<eos> It probably will.
Get used to it.<eos> I did.<eos> People are going to come looking for me.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Son of a bitch.<eos> We know all about you, and I think it's great.<eos> Well, that's a relief, huh, Tony?<eos> Speaking of dental school, people told us Finn would never amount to much.<eos> He won't.
O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.<eos> Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.<eos> The Asgard satellite is armed.<eos> You said the humans wouldn't fire.<eos> They won't.
Who are they?<eos> - Bring him to the gate.<eos> - They're friends.<eos> - Make sure he will enter the code.<eos> - He will.
- We go way back.<eos> You wouldn't know where she was heading?<eos> Her mom's, I think.<eos> You could try her there.<eos> Thanks, I will.
I know I'd really like that.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Sorry, Tru.<eos> Some things change.<eos> Some things never will.
That we can do more than talk it up or smooth over the rough spots?<eos> It's a lie.<eos> What we really owe that union is the truth.<eos> We're running around saying free trade creates high-paying jobs.<eos> And it will.
The only drug talk we have is from street-level small fry.<eos> So, the feeling is that maybe two weeks from now... we don't go back to the court for another extension.<eos> We charge what we have... we try to roll someone up at Cheese or one of Joe's other lieutenants.<eos> What, are you kidding? We don't have a case worth making yet.<eos> And at this rate, we never will.
All I know is that I'm dying here.<eos> I know what happened to me.<eos> I can remember all of it.<eos> But who's gonna believe me?<eos> I will.
He seemed okay.<eos> I'm sure he was perfect.<eos> Mrs. Case, I suggest you take your daughter home... and you have a nice, long conversation with her.<eos> Believe me.<eos> We will.
I can't believe you voted for Reagan.<eos> -I hope he gets better.<eos> -Reagan?<eos> -Your friend.<eos> -He won't.
What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Of course you will.
Isildur's heir?<eos> It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.<eos> I guess that concludes negotiations.<eos> I do not believe it.<eos> I will not.
Maybe the future has been written.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is what the Terminator taught me:<eos> Never stop fighting.<eos> And I never will.
Hi.<eos> You guys enjoy New York.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We will.
Yes!<eos> Now, just knock it in.<eos> Go on, knock.<eos> Come on, use some elbow grease.<eos> Aah! Okay, I will.
Well, I'd best get back to the party.<eos> Mary will be wondering where I got to.<eos> Sure.<eos> You go on and look after that girl of yours.<eos> I will indeed.
-What's that?<eos> -What's what?<eos> I could have a one-night stand any time I wanted to.<eos> -Yeah, but you won't.<eos> -Maybe I will.
We found their clothing near the bakery, Stilgar.<eos> We're certain they're no longer in the sietch.<eos> They must be wearing those robes they brought from Arakeen.<eos> But our search parties can't find a single trace of them in the desert.<eos> They won't.
It's shameful and the field mice can see you.<eos> - I'm going no further.<eos> - I am.<eos> What if I run away?<eos> You won't today.
-And my name's not really Ricki.<eos> -And what would it be, then?<eos> Then how about I keep calling you Ricki just to piss you off?<eos> -If it'II make you happy.<eos> -Yeah, it will.
Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go, Brian.<eos> Just remember, you two, keep an open mind because you never know.<eos> -We will.
Deacon, the only reason I went out with you is because I thought you were a nice guy.<eos> And now you wanna break up with me?<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> - If you tell anybody about this...<eos> - I won't.
Timing was never your thing.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, so, thank you.<eos> And, call me about dinner.<eos> - I will.
We could've been too.<eos> Andrew, don't start or I can't hang out with you anymore.<eos> Sorry, it's just hard.<eos> I'll never meet anyone as good as you.<eos> You will.
There are a million things that I don't know.<eos> But there's one thing that I do.<eos> And that's that I love Sarah.<eos> And I am going to love her day in and day out for the rest of my life.<eos> Now, will you please, please,
It's common for them to keep wariness We are about to begin the trainning.<eos> Too early.<eos> You have to start trainning now<eos> If you wanna join those matches<eos> Will you?
And it's not just them that I worry about.<eos> I can't protect you.<eos> - Where are we with Rohr?<eos> - He hasn't stepped up yet.<eos> He will.
It was really pretty.<eos> Take care of yourself, Dad, okay?<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> And remember to send me the girls' shoe sizes, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
You take him out of this school, you may as well take his life.<eos> -l've compiled a list of care agencies.<eos> -Oh, I'll bet you have.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I will take care of it personally.<eos> Yes, I will.
He and Francine have to keep ahead.<eos> They have to get there first.<eos> Where could they possibly find the time to devote to a child... who has come so tiresomely out of the blue?<eos> -Do you think he'll take me to Siena?<eos> -Of course he will.
-Yes.<eos> Riversmith.<eos> He's gone to bed.<eos> It'll seem strange without her.<eos> -It will.
If you hadn't shot him, what then?<eos> - The riots would continue, sir.<eos> - And then?<eos> Maybe they would take power.<eos> Eventually they will.
I wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding and now I can't do mine.<eos> How do you explain love?<eos> I guess I wouldn't know.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt that way about a guy.<eos> Someday you will.
Hi.<eos> - You take care of him, honey.<eos> - l will.<eos> - You take care of yourself first.<eos> - l will.
No father. I know nothing else<eos> You can't leave me and go away<eos> "l'm not leaving you, my son. It's only for a few days"<eos> "All right, father. I will not turn down anything you say" But you will have to listen to something I have to say<eos> "You will, won't you?
My...<eos> I'm not Elizabeth!<eos> Of course you are, my dear.<eos> You may not see it yet.<eos> But in time you will.
Better still.<eos> Tell us what's on your mind, Roy.<eos> I've been... struggling with something for a long time.<eos> I prayed for years for it to go away.<eos> But it won't.
I'll catch up with you.<eos> But we have to find... Carmen.<eos> Valentin, my old friend.<eos> You think you'll catch me this time, don't you?<eos> Well... you will.
But we have to find... Carmen.<eos> Valentin, my old friend.<eos> You think you'll catch me this time, don't you?<eos> Well... you will.<eos> Oh, you will.
Listen, you're going to think I'm crazy but I have to tell you, I don't think your brotherjumped, I think he was pushed...<eos> That's nonsense!<eos> Take her downstairs please.<eos> Will your brother come to identify the body?<eos> No, I will.
Once someone in Penguin's organization is willing to talk...<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> - If Penguin finds out you're spying...<eos> - He won't.
"Promise me, Priya.<eos> You will not leave me ever again"<eos> And you must promise never to shout at me again<eos> "When do I...?<eos> All right, I won't"
Hi, Ji-hae<eos> Sang-min, I won We made a bet<eos> I bet you'd come and Sang-min bet you wouldn't<eos> You have to treat dinner<eos> Okay, I will
- Still?<eos> Okay.<eos> Fire two.<eos> - Is that supposed to work?<eos> - It will this time.
Check this out.<eos> When you're tired of nickel-and-diming,just give me a holler.<eos> I'm gonna hookyou up.<eos> Well, you ever get tired ofwearin' those bum-aSS do-ragS, you give me a holler.<eos> I'll hookyou up.
- I can handle Carrie.<eos> You don't have the training or the experience to read a guy like Ali.<eos> - I shouldn't have put you in that position.<eos> - We should press him.<eos> - They will in Guantanamo.
- To deliver Kingsley.<eos> - No.<eos> He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't, but you will.
Come on. - I'm on it.<eos> They're sending Division to do an evaluation. - Yeah - Why are they doing this now?<eos> We're operational, getting results.<eos> Why don't they leave us alone?<eos> They will.
They may want revenge.<eos> If your revenge theory is wrong, we're setting a terrorist free. To say nothing of the fact that taking Arvin Sloane's intel at face value is insane.<eos> I'm aware of your history with Sloane, but if Director Dixon can trust him, I think you can, too.<eos> For the record, I don't.<eos> I never will.
How long you been back?<eos> A little over a week.<eos> The dreams start yet, nightmares?<eos> No.<eos> They will.
The things you've done.<eos> There's just been too much suffering.<eos> You have every right not to believe me.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> You will.
We are many.<eos> But Gunn and Wesley and Lorne.<eos> They've all been turned.<eos> - We have to stop whatever they're...<eos> - We will.
MAN: Si?<eos> Gracias.<eos> Muchas gracias.<eos> - I wish I could see what you see.<eos> - You will.
- Sir, we will not be starting with Les Cousins... - until you leave.<eos> - Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card... - was good for one and a guest.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I knew society would never accept this.<eos> And they never will.
I almost forgot.<eos> Well played, little man.<eos> I wouldn't keep him waiting.<eos> I wonder if that poor baby is ever going to get to the Land of Nod.<eos> He will. He will.
Why the hell can't you just leave me alone?<eos> They're getting worse, aren't they?<eos> The dreams.<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> You will.
Jeffrey liked it.<eos> Some singer in Paris sang it to him once.<eos> It stayed with him for some reason.<eos> - I'd really like to meet the guy.<eos> - You will, man.
I'm the only black man in West Indianapolis who can't dance, Daddy.<eos> (preaching) And I heard an angel say, with a loud voice,<eos> "Woe, woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth!"<eos> I never heard the angel, Daddy.<eos> You will.
(preaching) And I heard an angel say, with a loud voice,<eos> "Woe, woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth!"<eos> I never heard the angel, Daddy.<eos> You will.<eos> - You will.
It's written in a dead language, over 1,000 years old.<eos> Everything about these people... their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to feel alone.<eos> I won't.
- I don't think that means anything.<eos> - I think it does.<eos> Van's just a guy.<eos> We don't know if he loves you or me, or neither of us, or both of us.<eos> And we never will.
Roger.<eos> Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> This Brain knows about everything, right?<eos> It will soon.
- Next week?<eos> - Consider it an open invitation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Richard, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.<eos> She has impeccable taste, the highest standards... and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.<eos> Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - She still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.
Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - She still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.<eos> But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.<eos> - She will.
Taller would be tougher once they're cut... but if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.<eos> - I assume you'll have servers.<eos> - Yes, we will.<eos> I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the Pinocchio humor.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- Sounds good.<eos> - Yeah, sounds good.<eos> So, see ya.<eos> Watch those crosswalks.<eos> Thanks, I will.
That would be just like that old Porky Doody-dridge.<eos> You're really bummed about this, aren't you?<eos> On the outside, I am a mature adult... who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place.<eos> On the inside, I just want to wear that pretty dress again.<eos> You will.
I'm sorry, Billy.<eos> I'd trade my life for yours if I could.<eos> Maybe he traded his life for us.<eos> Yeah probably he did.<eos> I would.
Some for the rabbits, some for the resurrection.<eos> Most think of the food.<eos> All that fucking sugar?<eos> They don't think of the truth of the day.<eos> And why would they?
'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.<eos> I wouldn't recommend anybody get into the business today.<eos> I just wouldn't.
I'm in a party situation.<eos> And if you could use a super power right now, what would you want it to do?<eos> I would make... everyone else disappear.<eos> And then what would we do?<eos> Well... we would...
Because you aren't every other guy.<eos> You're different.<eos> You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.
Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
I don't know I have it in me to do.<eos> You don't know, hmm?<eos> You don't know?<eos> Why should I follow you if you don't know?<eos> Why would anyone?
Can't hide the truth forever.<eos> Inmates talk.<eos> Found out I was an ex-cop and jumped me.<eos> Uh, maybe I need to talk to my lawyer.<eos> I would.
It is all of us.<eos> There's you, teacher Na'omi.<eos> You think this looks like me?<eos> Of course it looks like you!<eos> Why wouldn't it?
No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.<eos> Of course he would.
And as much as I love you, and...<eos> It would kill me to have you go...<eos> I don't know, Annie.<eos> I mean, if I could move somewhere, and start over right now...<eos> I would.
Dear Maja is as much a sister to our girls as she is to you.<eos> And now you've brought us Mr. Besso.<eos> Such a charming dinner companion.<eos> I hope you'll return for many more meals. Mm.<eos> Yes. And so would Anna, apparently.
A ship full of 'em came to Jamestown.<eos> Did you not get yourself a wife from amongst them, Henry?<eos> Must you talk all day long?<eos> If I was a man in Jamestown, all them years, I'd want a maid.<eos> What man wouldn't?
Well, what if Meg came back?<eos> Do you have information about where she is?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I just thought it might help.<eos> Of course it would.
You were in my prayers, is what I mean.<eos> Thank you, Hild.<eos> Please continue, do not let me disturb your peace.<eos> Would you care to sit with me, in peace, Lord.<eos> I would, Hild.
I don't know.<eos> So my brother is about to marry the sister of your boyfriend, so that kinda makes us something... - I guess.<eos> - Yeah, something.<eos> Well, I think that sounds like a good excuse to get lunch and just get to know each other.<eos> Ah, I would...
You-You didn't think that was something you should tell me?<eos> I-I... it's...<eos> You porked my wife? !<eos> I wouldn't use that word.<eos> I would.
It's your birthday.<eos> You don't think he could figure that out?<eos> Look.<eos> You found out Bill or Curt or whatever he called himself was married, you got angry.<eos> - Any woman would.
Yeah, there's room in the bed by Sheldon's feet.<eos> As much as I appreciate this, I can't accept it. Okay?<eos> Halley's my goddaughter,<eos> I don't take care of her for money.<eos> I would.
"Can we make people look at this as a punishment for petty crimes?"<eos> Like, Indian food is not visual food.<eos> It is audible food, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Like, if you walked past an Indian restaurant and there was beautiful pictures of food, you would not go into that restaurant, would you, ladies and gentlemen?<eos> You wouldn't.
Thank you very much for taking us out today.<eos> I know you guys are swamp. You didn't have to.<eos> I had to.<eos> Listen you mind losing that tie?<eos> I would.
You smell fantastic.<eos> You never would've let those breasts so near to me if I wasn't in a wheelchair.<eos> Oh, yeah? Well, you never would've been looking at these breasts if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.<eos> What? Of course, I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I won't tell.<eos> No one would listen to me anyway.<eos> I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
-What's the first rule of battle?<eos> Never reveal your position.<eos> And if one unauthorized person knew?<eos> If Congress knew?<eos> So would the enemy.
Those shoes must be killing you.<eos> You're quite the gentleman.<eos> But, you know, Naomi told me you always have an agenda.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> She would.
How would you like it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Having to sit up here in front of all these people, answering this type of question?<eos> That's what you meant.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
So... Okay, good.<eos> Yeah, just let me know if we're making too much noise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think I should call my morn to tell her about Dad?<eos> No, I wouldn't, Patty.
She's 37 weeks pregnant.<eos> She's very fragile right now.<eos> She will not understand this, not in a million years.<eos> I'm sure she wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
...if you go out to the barn at night.<eos> - How? What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
The only thing holding you back is yourself.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> You said no one in the real world will know.<eos> I thought you weren't supposed to notice things like that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Hi, I'm Amy.<eos> All I did today was, like, rub lotion on my face and talk, talk, talk, talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Amy, would you like to...<eos> Yes, I would!
Now they just pick on their boyfriends.<eos> Part-time cowboys, full-time unemployed.<eos> Podge and his old mate Boof, they love their beer.<eos> And Michelle, she loves Podge.<eos> And who wouldn't?
Whatever this is, it's a forgery.<eos> I'm not falling for your slick talk.<eos> But you're falling for his.<eos> You're willing to believe any phlegm Vernon coughs up onto the paper because you're worried that I would betray your trust.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Yes, but...<eos> Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple.<eos> - Would that it'were so simple.<eos> - Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple.<eos> Would that it...
You didn't... you and Spencer didn't have to go out there, but you did.<eos> - That's different.<eos> - It's not.<eos> I wasn't gonna leave her out there like that.<eos> You wouldn't.
Oh, there's some calculated risk.<eos> If the soldier doesn't SOAP back quick enough and the target dies we could conceivably lose an American soldier but our soldiers are so highly trained there'd be very few deaths.<eos> If they fail, of course we terminate the dormant consciousness in the soldier's body.<eos> We don't want these terrorist walking around in the highly capable body of American troops.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
- What do you think?<eos> - I don't know, but I think it would be brilliant if he could.<eos> Were you able to talk to mother?<eos> - I'll keep trying.<eos> - You'd better.
Trained and unprotected. One second.<eos> Hanna.<eos> Go ahead, Granger.<eos> Can we send a robot in there?<eos> I wouldn't.
You weren't asking about becoming Inhuman.<eos> I was talking about us.<eos> Every terrible thing that has happened to you could have been avoided if you'd never met me.<eos> I wouldn't change a thing.<eos> - I would.
He beats himself up for what he turned you into, and you want to hate him for it.<eos> I don't hate him.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> Like he did me.<eos> Like he would for you.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.<eos> A Franklin stove.<eos> I thought you said Leeds hated the man.<eos> Why would he have his face in his kitchen?<eos> He wouldn't.
You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
What, so your strategy is just to sit here, paralyzed, hoping that Cutter leads us to the suspect?<eos> What a terrible idea.<eos> Hmm, you think so?<eos> I do, I mean, for one, even though Cutter's no brain surgeon, surely he wouldn't just...<eos> Wouldn't what?
And my dad said he knew my mom wanted sex when she got me and my sister Blockbuster videos.<eos> I always wanted to know someone that well.<eos> Yeah... me, too.<eos> So, your parents would talk to you about sex?<eos> Mine would never.
Do it, do it. Do it!<eos> Look at these people!<eos> They no longer support me!<eos> Look!<eos> Why would they?
Jeez.<eos> Your Honor, we're holding her on a misdemeanor.<eos> She's gonna make bail on Monday, and I'm certain she is gonna skip town.<eos> And you'd like to sneak a little peek inside her domicile before that happens.<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
We were gonna get married, have kids someday.<eos> But after I got hit by that wave from the particle accelerator, all my dreams ended.<eos> You know, I see her sometimes, walking down the street.<eos> She doesn't even recognize me.<eos> But why would she?
When Kublai's mother, Sorkaktani, stole the Khanate from our house... anyone who sided with us was decimated in the cruelest of fashions.<eos> A wicked bunch they were.<eos> A wicked bunch they are.<eos> Sorkaktani demanded that my sister, Oghul Qaimish... pledge her fealty to the House of Tolui.<eos> She would not.
Objection.<eos> Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?<eos> Doesn't mean I'm lying.<eos> Because you wouldn't lie just to get out of going to prison?<eos> No, I would not.
- Blackpool?<eos> - Yes, a big tower, donkeys, kiss-me-quick hats.<eos> - Kiss your what?<eos> It's like a trilby, you know?<eos> No, why would you?
I was a silent partner, no involvement apart from putting up half the money.<eos> - If I'd known what was going on...<eos> - You would have put a stop to it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course I would.
Thanks.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why are we clapping?<eos> Who else would like to share?<eos> I would.
If you win, what happens to you here?<eos> Well...<eos> I'd have to resign.<eos> Well, whoever replaces you won't know how we handle things.<eos> No, they would not.
They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
Little test here, Liv.<eos> Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> In my league?<eos> She'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Of course she would.
She just lost her mother.<eos> She was letting poor Pam take the blame for her thievery.<eos> You won't do it.<eos> You won't ask a poor orphaned girl for her alibi?<eos> Clive would. But not you.
A goddess.<eos> We summoned, and she came.<eos> You mean, um, here? To your loft?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> Shit, I wouldn't either.
Now, strictly speaking, I didn't mind most of it.<eos> But when she got into the pin-up stuff, that was too much, and we argued about that a lot.<eos> Well, what's the difference between that and stripping, really, right?<eos> And I asked her to stop.<eos> She wouldn't.
A broken pecker?<eos> Why not fix it?<eos> I'm sure Bill and Virginia would agree.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't.
Speaking of "gone wrong," I just got my final rejection letter from a game show.<eos> I've got half a mind to sue.<eos> Half a mind is right...<eos> no lawyer would take that case.<eos> That one would.
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
There's a storeroom downstairs that I could convert, so if you let me follow you on this case, lab's yours.<eos> Lab's mine?<eos> Okay. Deal.<eos> You can't slow me down, though.<eos> - I would never.
If I knew where Kort was, I'd have tried to put him away myself.<eos> How'd you two first meet?<eos> It was so long ago.<eos> Through work, I suppose.<eos> The way you would anyone.
That's so good, Kevin.<eos> Oh... That felt good.<eos> Now all we need to do is just take a quick whack at the alt pass, huh?<eos> Oh, come on, we don't need an alt pass, what are you talking about?<eos> Why would you-- wh-wh-what, for what?
Not fine at all.<eos> What about you, kiddo?<eos> Saw that comin'.<eos> No... Come on, tell me. I wanna know.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
-So he knew Crowley was under suspicion?<eos> -Henry? What a holy mess.<eos> [Linda] According to the toxicology report, there were no drugs in Arne Durnst's blood.<eos> Unless Caitlin was lying to us.<eos> And why would she?
You get two yachts...<eos> - So what?<eos> - So what?<eos> So I wouldn't want to give all of that up.<eos> Would you, Mr. Miller?
Okay, I'm not gonna lie, Gran and I didn't always get along.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I could stand here all day talking about how much I'll miss Mom.<eos> [cackling] But she would want us to move on.<eos> [groans] Like bonk I would.
Get in the car.<eos> Let me finish putting my shoes on.<eos> Slower.<eos> - Would anyone else like to share?<eos> - I would.
- Well, why wouldn't you?<eos> I mean, we're... You're really close by.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I swiped left, so...<eos> No. Yeah. No, no, I would...
Etruria? Campania? Sardinia?<eos> Perhaps Macedonia?<eos> An excellent question, Senator.<eos> And to be honest, I haven't had the time to get into specifics.<eos> And why would you?
[laughs] Good one.<eos> Uh... what?<eos> Wait... you don't know who I am?<eos> How could I?<eos> Why would I?
Yes, I did.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> I fear I have caused extensive damage to the house next door.<eos> Handcuffs?<eos> I'd rather not.
That is wasn't really an accident.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, are you saying that you want to write that she, killed herself?<eos> Gene, I don't want to be a part of romanticizing what we do.<eos> Isabelle wouldn't either.
Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.
- Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.
- But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.
- But you might.<eos> But I would not.<eos> We could go round and round.<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> - But I would not.
You dirty bitch!<eos> They won't go back to school!<eos> Why won't you go back to school?<eos> Why should they go back?<eos> I wouldn't!
I'm not going.<eos> You're not going?<eos> I can't leave Eva.<eos> Nell, would she leave you?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
It hasn't been used in a while.<eos> Your visit is... unexpected.<eos> Good God.<eos> I didn't have time to clean the room properly.<eos> Well, why would I?
Yeah, you keep quiet, Liddy.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Perhaps you'd care to lend a hand?<eos> You don't think I would?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
But let us not forget this.<eos> Lance Armstrong has never tested positive.<eos> Can you imagine how disastrous it would be if he did?<eos> - He wouldn't like it.<eos> - Nobody would.
All right, enough, you two.<eos> What would you guys do without me?<eos> We'd probably kill each other.<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> I sure would.
I'm gonna bring a friend.<eos> She's cool, she just moved here.<eos> Rose?<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> I sure would.
What would you guys do without me?<eos> We'd probably kill each other.<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> Rose'?<eos> -l sure would.
She never liked to drink.<eos> Now she's some shot-loving world traveler.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you want to be judged based on who you were in high school?<eos> I wouldn't.
And she's so hot.<eos> You must have sex, like, all day.<eos> - Bel!<eos> - What?<eos> I would.
Fine.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> We can at least begin a discussion, right?<eos> Even though you never stated it, surely you'd like to see the bombings stop.<eos> - Yes. Yes, I would.
Yeah, you want to put it up a couple of inches on your side, love.<eos> Okeydokey.<eos> You really think anyone's gonna pay to see this rich nancy sing show tunes?<eos> I wouldn't.
I never said that.<eos> No, you didn't, because you're very polite. But you think it.<eos> Otherwise you wouldn't be talking about commitment.<eos> - You find that idea distressing?<eos> - Who the hell wouldn't?
And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
But I caught a break with Keith. And I'm gonna make it worked, okay.<eos> You know I wouldn't have to dress up like a fish. if someone would represent me.<eos> I knew this was going to coming up.<eos> Just putting the agency on my resume would be life changing. Tris.<eos> It probably wouldn't, Amaya.
Maybe I am.<eos> No one knows and I don't want them to.<eos> When you read Genevieve Everidge, she's anything you want her to be.<eos> And I doubt people would feel the same way about Esther Kohn, a shirtmaker's daughter from Pittsfield.<eos> I would.
- Then what happened?<eos> I just want to leave this house and never come back.<eos> My father isn't a man you want to upset.<eos> I don't care.<eos> And neither would I.
Then I guess it's a good thing that just came in the mail for me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Maintenance records showing they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains within six weeks after the derailment.<eos> Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
I imagine he still is.<eos> What were you like as a young man?<eos> I was rooting for Mephistopheles and contemptuous of Faust.<eos> Would you like to talk about your first spring lamb?<eos> Would you?
I've seen it.<eos> It can save Thea. Right.<eos> But only if you become the new Ra's.<eos> Okay, well, even if a magic hot tub were not crazy talk we're not gonna let you join the League of Psychotic Murderers even if it is to save Thea.<eos> Which this wouldn't.
(NORMAL VOICE) I know.<eos> What's the news, Maurice?<eos> (DISTORTED VOICE) Sour old bitch.<eos> Would anybody like another slice of cake?<eos> - Ooh, I would actually.
I know.<eos> What's the news, Maurice?<eos> Sour old bitch.<eos> Would anybody like another slice of cake?<eos> Ooh, I would actually.
Well, I just -- I figured a guy your age would wanna keep things casual.<eos> Well, I'm not like most guys my age.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> So, Mrs. Powell, you'd like to adopt a child.<eos> Yes, I would. Very much.
I'm very good at sticking it to the man, but this woman...<eos> I don't want to stick anything to her.<eos> Except myself, but she won't let me.<eos> Why would anybody want to be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
Charles?<eos> - Chuckie.<eos> - What? Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
I almost didn't get in 'cause my license is expired.<eos> They thought I was a Muslim spy or something.<eos> Um, well, um-- I'm glad you came.<eos> You know, I wasn't sure you would when I called you.<eos> Of course I would.
I think this situation's a little bit different, mate.<eos> No, you would've done to her exactly what they wanted to.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do know that!<eos> They would... You...
- Blast their planes out of the sky?<eos> - Well, for a start.<eos> Our daughter wouldn't want that.<eos> And my people would never - blindly follow me into a war.<eos> - I would.
Drugs in the pack?<eos> Little busy to check.<eos> Would make sense.<eos> Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
- What am I to tell people?<eos> President's in town?<eos> - I don't know. You think they'll believe you?<eos> - No, Joe.<eos> They wouldn't.
I can tell you guys have something special like me and Daisy.<eos> You ever cheat on Anna?<eos> What?<eos> A lot of guys do.<eos> I never would.
Blood.<eos> It's wet.<eos> The art docent Identified this as a self-portrait Of the artist who painted it.<eos> Not only would a surgeon have an understanding Of human anatomy...<eos> So, too, would an artist.
Breath.<eos> Why would I hold my breath?<eos> I would die. Ca hold your breast?<eos> It's "holding your breath" because there's danger if you hold your breath.<eos> I wouldn't.
Says his partner was a little obsessed with nailing this firebug.<eos> You know, the one that always got away.<eos> Let's talk to this cop.<eos> If he'll talk to you.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
All right.<eos> Thank you, Beth.<eos> Lester's sweat strikes out again.<eos> I'm starting to lose hope.<eos> Well, I wouldn't yet.
We're cops. - Please, take the boxes.<eos> I want them out of here.<eos> - Oh, okay, great.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?<eos> - Actually, I would.
I just didn't... just didn't want to be.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna argue with that.<eos> I tried to convince myself that maybe I was having twins.<eos> But the doctor would know if I were having twins.<eos> Yes, she would.
I'm the Mozart of Halloween decorations, and tonight is the Super Bowl.<eos> Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to... Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Quickly!<eos> They took half the village.<eos> Yeah, and it was the good half.<eos> They went willingly to Valhalla... as would we all.<eos> I wouldn't.
They recruited me because my background in bio-engineering makes me an expert on alien physiology.<eos> And, yeah, it helps that I shared a bathroom with one.<eos> I'm leaving now.<eos> Unless you wanna try and stop me.<eos> Which I wouldn't.
I'd value your advice.<eos> I've had a letter from the Royal Yorkshire Hospital, asking if I'd head the new Board of Charitable Donors.<eos> We'd be working alongside.<eos> Well, that's if I stay the almoner, once we've amalgamated.<eos> Of course you would.
Senator Darnell.<eos> That's his justice. He's going after Darnell.<eos> Yes, but if he does that, he'll be arrested.<eos> He will never get to tell his story.<eos> No, he would.
- Sir?<eos> - Not now, Andrew.<eos> But, sir, if Ted and George could get to the satellite tower and install the RDS, that could stop the flooding.<eos> Andrew, that's the most ridiculous thing I...<eos> Actually, it would.
It's fascinating, really.<eos> - The science is so new.<eos> - Psychiatry, is it a science?<eos> Dr. Winter, would you like to discuss this privately?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
You guys fucking broke his skull.<eos> Don't knows when he will wake up.<eos> Do you think one million will do?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Ten million wouldn't.
Each one of them, I'm happy to report, has a recovery program, so I shan't want for meetings.<eos> Oscar Rankin kidnapped Alfredo, and he tortured you.<eos> It doesn't matter-- you're not going to prison.<eos> A week ago, you'd have said I'd never relapse.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Just kiddin'.<eos> I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool.<eos> Summer.<eos> He knows my name!<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would? The Winchesters?
You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.<eos> You'll find your party and then turn around and come right after me and my family.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
I'm gonna help us both out and keep quiet.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't want to have to come back.<eos> If I come back I got no choice but to give you citation or ticket or worse, place you under arrest.<eos> I'd much rather not.
What?<eos> Now we're blaming Henry for defending his daughter?<eos> Why don't we talk about the fact that your son has an unsecured phone?<eos> Who'd like another cocktail?<eos> - I would.
If someone tried to kill me, I would not rest until I took my revenge.<eos> But you're not going to kill my doctor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.<eos> But he wouldn't.
You know, it is so great to finally spend some time with you, Karen.<eos> It would be even better if you lived closer to Max, you know?<eos> We could... We could do this all the time.<eos> Right, I'm sure Max would just love that.<eos> Oh, he would.
- You recall that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You testified that one of the FBI's concerns was that if there's a corrupt cop on the street doing something illegal, and certainly planting evidence to frame somebody would be illegal, right?<eos> - Would you agree with me?<eos> OK. - Yes, I would.
He may not be a regular churchgoer, but he's a good man, my son.<eos> He just turned 21.<eos> And he already has a job at the auto plant.<eos> It was stupid to mention the job.<eos> A real mother would.
- I know.<eos> As if it was cued up for us.<eos> You know, I used to feel that way about everything.<eos> I'd just blindly trust in life to work out.<eos> And then it would.
Would you be our baby's godparents?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - No.<eos> - Sure...<eos> - Yeah, we would.
- My granny made it for me.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> I would love a red cape like that.<eos> You would look pretty foolish.<eos> I would, wouldn't I?
When he was murdered, I took his ship and almost left of our men I let our home.<eos> And now the King has put the prize your heads.<eos> Yes.<eos> And what will you do with the woman when King Dunchaid does not pay?<eos> What kind of father would not?
I will fight and die by your side, Commander.<eos> Welcome to 37.<eos> It is an honor, sir.<eos> The men seem like they'd follow Spears into hell.<eos> Would you?
- Stan, this is my life.<eos> This is my life.<eos> And this is how you pay for your life.<eos> If you were a nobody, still just David King's kid, I wouldn't care what you did.<eos> No one would.
What do you think, Tom?<eos> I think you need to leave.<eos> - Tom!<eos> - If he left, they'd go!<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Hello?<eos> Last night I passed out and locked in a storage room by Jasper.<eos> What?<eos> He will kill you.<eos> No, he would never.
Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
- Um...<eos> - You OK?<eos> I'm alright. I'm alright.<eos> - Do you want a drink?<eos> - I would... No.
Brooks.<eos> Brooks, huh?<eos> Your parents just let you run around at night, Brooks?<eos> They'd have to care.<eos> Wouldn't they?
Brooks, huh?<eos> Your parents just let you run around at night, Brooks?<eos> They'd have to care.<eos> Wouldn't they?<eos> They would.
You would only see a seizure response in a brain afflicted with photosensitive epilepsy.<eos> Or afflicted by something just as damaging.<eos> Like encephalitis.<eos> That would suggest a radically unorthodox form of therapy.<eos> Yes, it would.
Morning, Jane.<eos> Cab to a crime scene?<eos> That's very Cosmopolitan of you.<eos> Well, my car wouldn't start.<eos> Well, of course it wouldn't.
Yeah! - Though I grant it's not looking good.<eos> - Alice...<eos> If we were the ones tied to stakes, do you think she'd lift a finger to help us?<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> She wouldn't.
All right.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay to save your life?<eos> I'm the Queen!<eos> Surely somebody would!
I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
- Irrelevant.<eos> Not legally speaking.<eos> I'm certain I can convince a judge to issue a subpoena on the grounds that you weren't their legitimate spiritual advisor.<eos> Which is your prerogative, but I can appeal.<eos> - And I would.
Just because I have sex with someone doesn't mean I can't see them for what they are.<eos> - Julie. - He's a good doctor.<eos> You know me, okay?<eos> You know that I would never let anything hurt Rosemary ever.<eos> What, and I would?
Baby, can you help me? Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> He's got enough ego for the both of us and the cat.<eos> He would make a good character though.<eos> He would, right?
I was never late for kindergarten again.<eos> Come on.<eos> I second Marshall's vow.<eos> I will never, ever get that drunk again.<eos> Yeah. She would.
Valdes is full of shit. [laughs]<eos> - Who'd you rather bang, valdes or frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick. - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
[man] My Français is a bit shit.<eos> What do you define yourself as?<eos> [John] Some people would say I'm a mercenary.<eos> [Gouby] You're a mercenary?<eos> [John] Some people would... some people wouldn't.
You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
Did you see the baby's foot?<eos> It's a mark that pagans sometimes put On their newborns, to distinguish the baby In the eyes of their gods.<eos> Isabel must have put it there.<eos> Who knows of this tradition?<eos> Any pagan would.
You'll make your own luck.<eos> - The drawing lots are a good idea.<eos> - Thank you, Recep.<eos> Who would like to be team leader?<eos> I would.
No, I am fine.<eos> You sure? Because once we set foot on this houseboat, we need to remain calm.<eos> Yes, I will be fine.<eos> I could walk in on them in flagrante, and I would be fine.<eos> I wouldn't.
I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her...<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
- Right.<eos> -Your approach wasn't...<eos> New.<eos> The judges of the Forbes prize didn't see a problem.<eos> They wouldn't.
How do you figure?<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> I like my odds.<eos> You want to watch her die try something.<eos> I wouldn't.
In my thigh.<eos> Thigh?<eos> That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
Maybe you felt you deserved more.<eos> May I feel your mandible?<eos> It'll just take a second.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> I would.

He was paranoid about his work.<eos> And what was the project that he was involved in?<eos> He never told me, but he did let me know we were almost broke because of it.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, if anything should happen to him, that I wouldn't get the life-insurance money.<eos> The project would.
And I keep seeing it in my head, but the details won't define themselves and...<eos> I need to remember exactly what happened in that attack.<eos> I think...<eos> POTUS thinks I'm lying to her.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
What idea is this?<eos> Edith has taken in a motherless child and is giving her a home here.<eos> I should have thought an orphan rather an uncomfortable piece of baggage for an unmarried woman.<eos> You mean a man might not want to take the child on?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
But instead of selling a drug, you'd be selling Penny-- it's cute.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn't crap all over their ideas.<eos> I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.<eos> Then again, why wouldn't I?
~ Why?<eos> ~ Cos she's perfect, innit?<eos> The control freak and the man who should never be controlled.<eos> You'd go to hell, if she asked.<eos> And she would.
But I don't understand why xolal had to step in.<eos> As guardian of the moon, weren't you supposed to watch over the harmony of the planet?<eos> Yes, and I did.<eos> I watched over the moon.<eos> But then why would you into exile after that?
74% viewed your candidacy in a positive light,<eos> - even with his wording.<eos> - Stop, Eli.<eos> Peter would kill for those numbers.<eos> Any politician would.
The whole thing's rotten.<eos> Well, maybe we should just repaint it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it would look better.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
You mean everything to him.<eos> You both work so hard to be strong.<eos> Maybe it's hard to be... soft with one another?<eos> Why, did he say something? No.<eos> Please, he would never.
Your daughter's nine years old.<eos> Let's revisit this in ten years.<eos> No, trust me, I will now.<eos> You know what?<eos> You probably would.

The Diviner reads your DNA to determine if you're worthy of its power.<eos> You'll understand when you touch it.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'd rather not die just yet.<eos> You wouldn't.
What's wrong with you? RYAN:<eos> Come on, man.<eos> How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
Agos is innocent, Bishop is guilty.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> I'm with Trey.<eos> You want to talk to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
I hardly see what that has to do with anything.<eos> Relax, henry.<eos> I am not suggesting that you ask our murder suspect out.<eos> Why would Iona be reading that?<eos> She wouldn't.
Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?
They know everything.<eos> They didn't know Adrian was dead.<eos> They knew enough to tempt us.<eos> They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform.<eos> Hey, who wouldn't?
HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE ARROW THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED BILLY.<eos> HE DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST KIND OF LOVE...<eos> GIVING YOUR LIFE FOR SOMEONE ELSE.<eos> I DON'T THINK I COULD DO THAT.<eos> NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD.

I can squash you all.<eos> Today I met someone who will have you all begging on your knees.<eos> All of you. You know, Rahul.<eos> Whenever I made a mistake in school.. ..the teacher would say, write a thousand times.. ..on the board that you won't do mischief again.<eos> And I would.
I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark.<eos> He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
That might pay for the cork.<eos> This guy's probably got a million-dollar wine collection.<eos> The place is temperature controlled, fireproof probably.<eos> It's a great place to hide $10 million.<eos> I would.
What's your home number, Edmund.<eos> Now!<eos> 049-157-0158.<eos> They're never going to let me set foot outside the apartment again, are they?<eos> I wouldn't.
Are you gonna keep her from me, too?<eos> Because that would be very hurtful to me.<eos> And you wouldn't wanna see me get hurt, would you?<eos> Would you?<eos> Would you?
- And you're dating the Avatar, right?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything That might compromise the security of Republic City,<eos> Would you, officer?
Frank.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Take your marks.<eos> Congressman, would you like to respond to that?<eos> Yes, I would.
I don't know.<eos> I didn't pick up. Good.<eos> Don't.<eos> So don't even call him back?<eos> I wouldn't.
I've loved our time together.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you think it would be weird if we hung out as friends?<eos> I would love that!<eos> I would!
- No.<eos> Why didn't she like you?<eos> She thought there was something between us.<eos> She thought that?<eos> Why would she?
Okay.<eos> How much of that do you take?<eos> I follow the directions.<eos> Can we trust your brain on that?<eos> I probably wouldn't.
Okay.<eos> How much of that do you take?<eos> I follow the directions.<eos> Can we trust your brain on that?<eos> I probably wouldn't.

She didn't say anything to me, Mr Carson, not a word.<eos> As long as she didn't.<eos> I know you all think she must have said summat, but she didn't.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Thousands wouldn't.
SanCorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> Market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
Not normal?<eos> Alex is willing to give her life up to go with me.<eos> And not here, just... away somewhere from all of this so I can be free, you know, from... from Muirfield.<eos> Would you?<eos> Would she?

What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
Yeah.<eos> But he has Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah. And I'm sure if they needed anything, they would ask.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
A 12-step program usually doesn't traumatize the participant.<eos> But conversion therapy might.<eos> Several conversion camps have been shut down recently 'cause their methods border on torture.<eos> Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children?<eos> None of them would.

I think I could get used to them mushrooms.<eos> Imagine Jamie's head today?<eos> Think it's any worse than Mimi's?<eos> Maybe Jamie hasn't said nothing.<eos> Well, why would he?
Different victims, different states.<eos> Only connection is the person who shot them.<eos> Contract killings.<eos> Why would a Jihadist be working as a contract killer?<eos> He wouldn't.
How were you raised, Clark?<eos> Uh... Protestant. Presbyterian.<eos> Yeah, that's not so far off, hm?<eos> So, would anyone like coffee?<eos> I would.

Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
Hope is here?<eos> She was about to testify to the grand jury.<eos> That'll never happen.<eos> Now it won't because the Lieutenant is gonna save us all a lot of anguish, but it must feel terrible to hear that the love of your life was about to help us put you on death row.<eos> - She wouldn't. - Oh, but she would.
See, we get a little more wiggle room to operate than our friends in the military, so, naturally, there's some low-grade resentment.<eos> You mean Captain Martens?<eos> Well, if he can avoid explaining anything that even smells like it wasn't by the book, we're the fall guys.<eos> And killing an unarmed Taliban suspect is something you're saying he'd rather not own up to?<eos> Would you?
Good afternoon.<eos> I'd just like to say that... before today, I didn't know the Munsters were driving around in a funeral car.<eos> I'm beginning to think everything on that show was a big joke.<eos> I'd, um...<eos> I'd just like...
But in this case, we're not trying to catch our killer.<eos> Fosse's already dead.<eos> You know what bugs me?<eos> Why would a guy on a bombing spree be worried about selling his baseball card collection?<eos> He wouldn't.
So let me give you some advice.<eos> Take advantage of what I'm offering you.<eos> Make something of yourself.<eos> For the record, anyone who leaves you behind is a fool.<eos> I wouldn't.
Honestly, Mina, it's like talking to a man sometimes, nose buried in whatever silly thing has captured his attention.<eos> Lucy, what's wrong?<eos> I hate this.<eos> Lucy, I... I don't understand.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
Especially since I'm about to win.<eos> B-But we didn't finish.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> The same way any normal person would.
Why would I?<eos> Sangwoo said you went on a trip abroad.<eos> - He did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why would he?
Whatever.<eos> Come on, giddy-up, little doggie.<eos> It was in Hanna's locker.<eos> Why would Cece use an envelope from the place where she used to work?<eos> She wouldn't.
I held on to her the whole time.<eos> Until you grabbed a statue.<eos> Guys, I didn't let go of her.<eos> Even if she let go, why would she just leave like that?<eos> She wouldn't.
It's a copy of Colonel Mariga's deposition.<eos> My copy count didn't reconcile with the machine.<eos> It was off by seven pages, the exact amount of that.<eos> You thought I wouldn't notice.<eos> I would.
The electrical junction is where the ceiling light is.<eos> The mike goes into the light.<eos> That's why he doesn't notice.<eos> But wouldn't that depend on the ceiling light?<eos> Yes, it would, Professor.
Which brings me to my next question.<eos> Did you fire me for refusing to bribe witnesses on your behalf?<eos> - You're under oath.<eos> - Don't answer that.<eos> I wouldn't.

What was in it?<eos> Thracian Phiale.<eos> A ancient relic, allegedly protected by warlocks after Cromwell's conquest of Britain.<eos> Why would someone want something like that?<eos> You wouldn't.
- On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
You ever think about what would happen if you're, you know, stay in the course.<eos> You know what? When I riding' home on the subway, and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the same suit 3 days in a row,<eos> Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.<eos> Who wouldn't rite?<eos> Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?
Will you let me drive you home?<eos> I'm afraid you'll drown.<eos> Okay. I actually have a date tonight.<eos> I should probably shower, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Uh, what a bore.<eos> - Yeah well, she just got me fired.<eos> - Well fuck her.<eos> I think it's because her boyfriend I don't know, maybe has a crush on me or something.<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
And I wonder<eos> Would I give my life?<eos> Could I make that sacrifice?<eos> If it came down to it Couldl take the bullet?<eos> I would Yes, I would

Say what?<eos> That's right, back when I was in prison.<eos> Mm-hmm. Oh, I got to hear about this.<eos> Y'all don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, we would.
You know who Tom Petty is.<eos> And she said that if she had to come back that she was going to... "F" up his pussy-ass, which is what she said.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I would never.
He quit to be a bouncer.<eos> I wanted to get close to this girl who danced at this disco.<eos> Yeah, I can't believe she dumped you.<eos> -WouIdn't you?<eos> -I would, yeah.
I don't call floor and I don't call time on you, Jerry.<eos> I want you to talk yourself into playing.<eos> Why don't you concentrate on fucking yourself up your sideways wink-ass, Leo?<eos> - You're not gonna call floor?<eos> - I would.
Who the fuck are you?<eos> So the left's only three in the clip, and the right... one in the chamber.<eos> It was a thing of beauty, no?<eos> You know that shit that killed Elvis, right?<eos> This shit here definitely would.
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice-message system.<eos> Six-1-2-8-4-5-4.<eos> Would anyone like some more wine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I would.
Do you but take my master's place.<eos> And what would your master do now, if he stood so assaulted?<eos> He would see me dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> He would.
Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Uh, I'll need your help till I can get down there.<eos> We really have two choices here.<eos> Okay, what do you need?<eos> We need to find the money, but I want to make this as easy as possible for Becky. Wouldn't you agree?<eos> Yes, I would.
You want coffee?<eos> He's an unstable, pathetic drunk.<eos> And now, he has the power of a crystal.<eos> Why?<eos> Just so I wouldn't?

- What is it? Where?<eos> - Come home to me as soon as you can.<eos> - Okay, okay. - I'll be there in an hour.<eos> - I'm on my way there now.<eos> What would the mad virgin?
- I did.<eos> And did he express his desire to live with Mr. Donatello and myself?<eos> He did, very much so.<eos> And would it be your recommendation that it would be in Marco's best interest... to be raised in our care?<eos> It would.
I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> Since you indoctrinated Robin into crime fighting at the ripe old age of nine...<eos> Robin needed to help bring the man who murdered his family to justice.<eos> So he could turn out like you?<eos> So that he wouldn't.
I mean, you're young.<eos> As long as you take your folic acid and avoid hard drugs, you'll clean up.<eos> I like this guy.<eos> And you can always change your mind, and keep the baby and the money that they gave you.<eos> But I wouldn't.
He's on his way if we don't step in.<eos> I hear that his armies are full of wild men, six feet tall and full of sinew and hate.<eos> I could be dead in a month, or a leg ripped off.<eos> Who'd think of me then?<eos> I would.
What are those?<eos> They're for Tyler's band.<eos> I'm not done with them.<eos> I still need to take some photos, but I really hope he likes them.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Ooh!<eos> Oh, remember how I've been working on origami?<eos> This is my new favorite.<eos> Do you think I should show Luke my goose?<eos> Well, I would.
Henry.<eos> I have a son.<eos> Had.<eos> When you made the sacrifice to step into that machine, you were not the only one who ceased to exist.<eos> So would he.
Do you know where you are?<eos> Zoey, call down to the OR, tell them to hold off.<eos> - I want to get film from every angle.<eos> - Got it. - Are you gonna try to save the foot?<eos> - Wouldn't you?
Uh, it's inert, so it won't compromise the bones.<eos> You put rose water on the bones?<eos> Yep, so when Dr. Brennan's working, she will also be relaxing uterinely.<eos> And the bones needed a little freshening up after four weeks in the sewer.<eos> Who-who wouldn't?
You dropped this.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Each one of us is, in fact, a living, breathing community, but it doesn't stop there.<eos> Why would it?
Are you proposing to Emily?<eos> Don't say anything to my mother, all right?<eos> She doesn't need to know until Emily says yes.<eos> You think she will?<eos> Well, after your lengthy courtship, who wouldn't?
So maybe this is payback.<eos> Instead of ball bearings or nails.<eos> Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?<eos> A real one?<eos> Well, you wouldn't.
It's a rare thing.<eos> It's exactly the kind of thing you want in a partner.<eos> So, no...<eos> I didn't report it.<eos> Would you?
Yet they're still keeping quiet.<eos> That's loyalty for you.<eos> To a fault.<eos> You know we'd do the same thing.<eos> Yes, we would.
22,000... ish.<eos> My company adver... used to advertise with that newspaper.<eos> And how am I angry and unlikable?<eos> Can I take this one?<eos> I wouldn't.
But that's America...<eos> it's a foreign land... you can't even speak English well.<eos> Will you he happy... 3 weeks without me?<eos> Shashi If I was you...<eos> I would he at the airport right now.
And actually, I do want to turn into a wolf.<eos> But I have a really hard time imagining how that would be.<eos> Would he get hair on his face?<eos> Long hair'?<eos> And would his eyes...
Never figured out it was me who set the damn thing off in the first place.<eos> Oh, you are the man.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> How much do you love this guy?<eos> Krueger would, too.
What do you do then?<eos> You go on.<eos> I'm not sure I know how.<eos> I have faith in you, Maria.<eos> Joe would, too.
Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Where are you going?<eos> - For a walk.<eos> - I'd like to talk about this.<eos> Say we find out that Jeff Carson raped Alicia or someone else did, unless he confesses...<eos> And why would he?
What is it?<eos> It was with some of Mr. Sanchez's things.<eos> As you can see, he wrote your address on it.<eos> But that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would he...
Tell me again.<eos> General...<eos> Sanjar Esfahani.<eos> General Esfahani denies it.<eos> Well, wouldn't you?
Clorera has the strength to clean up life's messes. May I?<eos> Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy, Cam Hicks.<eos> And I just wanted to say, for the record, thanks for saving my life today, but you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with.<eos> Hey. What I said before, about if I could help you forget, I would?<eos> I wouldn't.
Archer.<eos> ...michelada.<eos> You realize this is kidnapping.<eos> I do, yes. And do you realize you're insane?<eos> He wouldn't, by definition...
You have to understand, uh...<eos> Ms. Hewes built an incredibly successful firm from the ground up.<eos> She has tremendous influence and the freedom to try only those cases that interest her most.<eos> Well, that would be very hard to give up. You confessed to me, Patty.<eos> Yes, it would.
I just think it would be cool if they gave us one, too.<eos> Us?<eos> Well, you know, our fictional us's.<eos> Well, yeah, honey, but no one would know who we are anyway.<eos> Michael Vincent would.
You know when someone is, um, is confused, they... they... they start sending out mixed signals?<eos> She's doing that?<eos> I think I am.<eos> You know, mom would want you to be happy.<eos> She would.
He was so proud to have followed in his father's and his grandfather's footsteps.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> My dad was a Marine, too.<eos> Do you have any idea why your son would go back to Afghanistan?<eos> He wouldn't.
Klaus, where's Tyler?<eos> Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...<eos> He wouldn't.
What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie.<eos> - Relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
So far, tonight, we have raised... $35 million!<eos> And I know we're just getting started.<eos> So, let's have fun, let's party, and spend a lot of money.<eos> So, when are you gonna run for governor? !<eos> She would, too.
I think we're at a point now where we have the opportunity to get beneath the surface of some issues we've all been wrestling with.<eos> Please, Ed.<eos> Tell me you're still bowling.<eos> - Who would like to start?<eos> - I would.
Yeah, of course.<eos> You can all go home.<eos> Never in my life have I been so happy to be home.<eos> I kind of miss that place.<eos> You would.
- Nobody's Fault But Mine<eos> It is you.<eos> I knew...<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> I'd...
And Arthur Zimmermann was a near-perfect example of the type.<eos> The American ambassador in Berlin described him as<eos> "a very jolly, large sort of German".<eos> Zimmermann dreamed of changing the world.<eos> And he would.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we're okay.<eos> Where is Michelangelo?<eos> You don't think he went after Leatherhead, do you?<eos> Only an idiot would...
This guy's getting smarter or he's got insider knowledge.<eos> We should take a look at first responders.<eos> You know, his rage might not be directed at tourists.<eos> If the bodies are found and removed prior to morning rush hour, then most of them might not even have a chance to see his work.<eos> Then who would?
I Would have killed him If I had let him.<eos> The judge said: " Henry" you knew what You Were doing? "<eos> " Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I wanted to kill That son of a bitch! "<eos> And I would.
And we've only got 27 days left to raise that dough.<eos> Hey, bub, your trousers are falling down, let me help you.<eos> Hey, man, you trying to get yourself capped?<eos> Oh, no thanks, I don't wear hats.<eos> Why would I with a head of hair like this?
That's where you learned your English?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just another story of misfortune.<eos> It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Put some honey butter on them muffins. They'll taste an awful lot better that way.<eos> Oh! Motherfuck!<eos> Now, that's not so bad.<eos> I can fix that if you'd like.<eos> I would.
I don't wanna impugn anyone's character, but the other night I caught Rex measuring the vault.<eos> I asked him what he was doing and he said he was trying to see if there was enough room for the new foreign currencies.<eos> - Oh, my God, that's so weird.<eos> - It is. He would know when the system was down.<eos> Oh, my God, he would.
You should have talked to her.<eos> That's what women like. We like to talk.<eos> I tried. I just can't get a word in edgewise between slaps.<eos> Do you want to know what I think?<eos> Well, I sure would.
I don't need to ask Kate.<eos> What? Ask Kate what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Don't you think your mom would enjoy some quiet time away from the family?<eos> I would.
That's taking it a little far, don't you think?<eos> The gift basket?<eos> No, honey, your attitude.<eos> You're suggesting that you'd reward a killer for killing.<eos> In this case, I would.
But ultimately, Ed Samuel was shot.<eos> After she got tired of waiting around for him to keel over on the dining room table.<eos> Which one do you think it was?<eos> I don't think the wives would have access to radium salt.<eos> Who would?
But the baby is fine.<eos> Will you please tell your mama, "Don't worry"?<eos> You realize that's pointless advice to give a mother, right?<eos> Yes. wouldn't you hate it if we didn't reassure you?<eos> Yes, I would.
I'll run the sketch past Narco and Vice, see if they recognize him.<eos> Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar.<eos> And, Esposito, can you talk to Zack's teammates about the steroids, find out what they knew?<eos> Zack would never touch steroids.<eos> None of us would. Mm-hmm.
Oh, Bart rides that board with a passion of an Arapaho ghost dancer.<eos> You know, passion has always been a passion of mine.<eos> Uh, something else about me is that I'm thinking of becoming an excellent cook.<eos> ♪ Would you love her?<eos> Yes, I would, sir ♪
You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's a mystery.<eos> How will people know what they're buying?<eos> Well, they wouldn't, John.
And by "everyone", you mean, uh--<eos> I invited the planning committee to help put together the gift bags for the pink party.<eos> I figure it's the least I can do, and it'd be nice to hang with the girls.<eos> And they're--they're coming?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
And I spoke to your in-house psych service unit-- no time for them either.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you were avoiding us.<eos> Oh, cases take priority.<eos> Some would say that's-- I don't know-- shortsighted.<eos> Well, the victims' families wouldn't.
Not the vacation, tom.<eos> She doesn't wanna choose which one of us to live with.<eos> That is awful.<eos> Why would she think that?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
- Turtle, what's up with Arnold?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Anybody smell smoke?<eos> I could make the argument that this is Drama's fault.<eos> I wouldn't.
Any idea what these are?<eos> Prenatal vitamins.<eos> I took those when I was pregnant. What?<eos> Why would a doctor keep prenatal vitamins in a safe?<eos> They wouldn't.
It's an old bootlegger's tunnel.<eos> Must've run liquor through during Prohibition.<eos> Never knew it existed.<eos> Why would an agent leave plans like these for a civilian to find?<eos> They wouldn't.
Dad, I have to talk to you.<eos> Scott was running these tests with the transmitter, um... Yeah. ...Trying to see if he could block the signals between the Skitters and the Mechs.<eos> Yeah, j-- like a, you know, a jamming signal.<eos> Yeah. How would -- how would you even know if that worked?<eos> We wouldn't, but...
- Where can he live around here?<eos> - It's a perfect isolated area.<eos> - Where did John Larsen live?<eos> - On a boat.<eos> Kristian Almen wouldn't.
Yes. And he ate something shiny.<eos> - Glitter.<eos> - Somehow he ingested it.<eos> Why would a horse eat glitter?<eos> He wouldn't.
He would return home, tamed.<eos> Broken.<eos> - What if he died?<eos> - From a fall?<eos> He would never.
- Well, Sarah and I thought they were nice.<eos> I bet.<eos> So did Chairman Mao, hmm?<eos> - I could talk to Sarah about it.<eos> - I would.
I think something else caused this.<eos> Could this be the age of these bones as opposed to the others?<eos> Well, he's significantly older.<eos> Arthritis in the joints puts him in his late 50s, but that doesn't account for this degree of breakdown.<eos> In fact, nothing in the ocean would.
Can one of you help me with the rest of this sushi so that I can dump it in the neighbor's pool?<eos> Hey, don't.<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> I know she doesn't want to know what Max was thinking right now, but some day she will.<eos> I would.
Let's go downtown.<eos> You and Mrs. Whiteside.<eos> Why?<eos> We're trying to clear your friend and her husband of homicide charges.<eos> Why wouldn't you?
-Turtle, what's up with Arnold?<eos> -l don't know.<eos> Anybody smell smoke?<eos> TURTLE: I could make the argument that this is Drama's fault.<eos> I wouldn't.
Louis is the father of my child, so... he is the only ending to this fairy tale.<eos> Right?<eos> He--he doesn't have to be.<eos> You don't think it would matter that my baby is another man's child?<eos> It wouldn't to me.
You're not listening, Nick.<eos> There are no more under-the-table deals, no more going rogue, no more personal vendettas, no more L.A.<eos> Now, what does this have to do with L.A.?<eos> I wouldn't change anything about what I did there.<eos> I would!
Uh, I should go find that circuit breaker.<eos> I'm starting to think that my dropping out of the race is a big mistake.<eos> No, you're doing the right thing.<eos> But no one seems to buy that Sutton would give up the chance to be queen.<eos> Because she wouldn't.
Did Papa summon you?<eos> As a matter of fact, I came to see you.<eos> I wanted to find out what you meant when you said you HAD to marry Carlisle.<eos> And that I'd despise you if I knew the reason.<eos> Yes, you would.
It's gotta be mobile, something that can block out the electromagnetic field so that I can cross through and turn off whatever's causing this.<eos> Walter, you need to build a moveable-<eos> I heard the idea!<eos> I know what a Faraday cage is!<eos> A baboon would.
Look, all I'm saying is, lucky clothes are a thing.<eos> If you don't believe me, test them out.<eos> Lucky panties!<eos> I hope Scarlett likes our flatware.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
You think?<eos> Green bloat stage.<eos> He's been here at least 18 hours.<eos> Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose, eat the brains?<eos> I would.
And it's a good one, Jim.<eos> Consoling dead firefighter's wife.<eos> Ask her.<eos> You didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you?<eos> No. Would you?
I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now, don't lose hope.<eos> Mollie wouldn't want that now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.<eos> There's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.<eos> Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.<eos> Why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?<eos> He wouldn't.
Just because he called me the young you?<eos> Guess that makes you the, uh... ooh, old you.<eos> He can be a touch theatrical.<eos> I wouldn't take his praise too seriously.<eos> Oh, I would.
- Nothing.<eos> Sometimes when you don't eat, you grind up your feelings. Then you get stomach breath.<eos> I wouldn't kiss Ryan Gosling with stomach breath.<eos> - Yes, you would.<eos> - Yes, I would.
"Quarantine protocols."<eos> "Psychological profiling."<eos> "Subject experimentation?"<eos> There is no way the U.N. would sanction something like this.<eos> Sure they would.
Yeah, I mean, because there's nothing more soothing than the sound of somebody trying to sell you gold coins, right?<eos> You know, I need something to block out the sound of the ocean 'cause the waves keep crashing over and over and over again, Steven.<eos> Some would say it's a relaxing sound, Danny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Some people would.
There's 40,000 cops in this city... Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just trying' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> Yes, I would.
Cell phone.<eos> Fig Newtons, which I love.<eos> The key, obviously.<eos> And my father's message to not stop looking.<eos> And I wouldn't, not ever.
And you've been in them.<eos> Really?<eos> What? Oh.<eos> No. Not like that.<eos> Not that I wouldn't. I...
Going after Eric Nichols is not the solution to our problem.<eos> We have to sell assets, we have to cut costs.<eos> That's the only way we're gonna save our family.<eos> - Sorry, she's not handling it well.<eos> - Well, who would?
Someone said a cocktail waitress.<eos> But I reckon you were a model.<eos> Whatever it was I did, you can bet I was pretty good.<eos> You must have enjoyed your work.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
Hello, I think lack of oxygen is affecting your brain.<eos> I thought you're supposed to be on my side.<eos> Alright, alright, we'll go back.<eos> If Hawk only knew what was going on around here.<eos> Well, how would he?
Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?<eos> Shut up.<eos> What, you'd do it for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
My mom called me a monster.<eos> To be fair...<eos> I think I could live with this much better.<eos> My son overslept, so he had to take the train instead of walking.<eos> If I'd just...
Yeah.<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> Tell me it ain't true you got them girls in there.<eos> They wouldn't hurt my Conor.<eos> They wouldn't!
Now, if you'll excuse me. Our scientists have been working on a top secret project, so-<eos> Uh, what top secret project?<eos> - I'd tell you what it is, but I'd have to kill you.<eos> No, I wouldn't kill you.<eos> Yes, I would.
Uh, what top secret project?<eos> - I'd tell you what it is, but I'd have to kill you.<eos> No, I wouldn't kill you.<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Better.<eos> I think.<eos> How did you end up there?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Sure, I would.
We had it all planned out.<eos> Listen, when Fisher gets here, he's gonna tear this place apart looking for it.<eos> People are gonna get hurt.<eos> Why don't we just give it to him?<eos> I would.
You just have to be a dad.<eos> I mean, the bond that you have with Lux already?<eos> - Most people would kill for that. - Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> I would.
Look at me.<eos> Go and talk to her, bro.<eos> A man needs to tell a woman how he feels.<eos> I don't want to talk to her.<eos> Tane would.
I'm burning up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I love the English painters.<eos> England has painters?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
You're rushing to marry Ryan, but the second Baze says he likes you, you freak out.<eos> If you didn't have feelings for Baze, it wouldn't matter to you.<eos> He just told you that he has feelings for you.<eos> The least you can do is appreciate it for one second.<eos> I would.
Let me tell you something. These serrations were made AFTER the explosion.<eos> From sunfish gnawing at the carbon!<eos> I need to dive the river right away.<eos> Told Secretary Grady that I would. We wouldn't want to disappoint Secretary Grady, would we?<eos> No, Colonel, we wouldn't.
We should not hate someone or fight.<eos> We should do right always.<eos> And we should listen to the old words and remember Leonard.<eos> If anyone else has something to say...<eos> Oh, I would.
Won't it gum up your machine?<eos> Whatever it is, this baby can handle it.<eos> Okay, so the only way the body could've gotten down here is if someone threw it down a laundry chute.<eos> Well, that would seem to suggest homicide.<eos> Yes, it would.
I don't know much about that but I'd be interested in hearing what you have to say.<eos> My name's Brick.<eos> So, what do you like to do?<eos> Reverend TimTom, you showed up.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
I don't see why.<eos> I shouldn't care what I found out about you.<eos> Whatever it was, it wouldn't alter my opinion one bit.<eos> But it would.<eos> It certainly would.
But that is precisely what they already know. And do.<eos> I'm sorry, my lord. I didn't think you'd be in here.<eos> Are my eyes deceiving me or is one of these missing?<eos> - I don't know them well enough.<eos> - No. Why would you?
Put your hands in the air.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Officers, please escort this gentleman downtown.<eos> Special Agent Howard, would you like to examine those bills?<eos> Yes, I would.
First, I combined the background audio from all the calls to our 911 operators during the attack.<eos> Then I added the sound portion of the film one of our witnesses took with his cellphone, after which I managed to cobble together the argument between Armand and his father.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Yes, I would.
He's... he's doing a lot better.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You'd never know how bad he was before.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
That wasn't a little extra weight.<eos> Admit it. You don't care about the inner me at all.<eos> No, you admit it!<eos> You'd be ashamed to be seen in public With someone as hideous as me!<eos> Would not!
However, I did have a little run in With one of the brothers that killed me.<eos> I assume he didn't live to tell about it.<eos> Actually, I spared him.<eos> He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.<eos> They both would.
- All right, enjoy.<eos> - Always.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> He said the meeting with Randall went great.<eos> Why wouldn't it?
I'm sorry, I just... I don't know what that word means.<eos> Oh, come on, Jesse. You know very well what the word means.<eos> No, Paul, I did not tell my father that Nate was sucking my dick.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Why would I?
What were you gonna say?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nate, but he would never come.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - He just wouldn't.
Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancee?<eos> He'd better!
See if we can't get you a little reward money.<eos> For your cooperation.<eos> I don't know. If I came across that kind of money, I'd buy myself a '65 harley panhead.<eos> Not me.<eos> I would, uh...
Just one.<eos> I just have to...<eos> I hate to make a scene.<eos> But I'll rip your throat out with this plastic fork if you don't tell me who you are and why you're wearing an earpiece.<eos> Well, that certainly would a scene, wouldn't it?
These men are hunters.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> It wouldn't.
Then Ryan will help me.<eos> I mean, he'll give me his kidney.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Ryan can't give you his kidney.<eos> But he would.
As I was trying to say before I was interrupted, we are standing in the wreckage of a secret laboratory belonging to your old enemy, the Cabal.<eos> Must've been a secure off-site location, some kind of research lab.<eos> Bad guys were doing some seriously secret work down here.<eos> It would explain your interest in such a place.<eos> It would.
Oh, Rarity! Your beautiful tail! Oh.<eos> It's fine, my dear.<eos> Short tails are in the season.<eos> Besides, it'll grow back.<eos> So would the mustache...
Foot Long, you are cleared for takeoff on runway two-zero.<eos> Roger that, tower.<eos> Turn and burn.<eos> Honestly, I'd have sex with that guy.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I was weak.<eos> I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
You're allowed to observe and that's it.<eos> General, when can we interrogate this man?<eos> At the moment, the military is in charge of any interrogation.<eos> If that changes, we'll let you know.<eos> Colonel, if you would.
Mayhaps you desire to...<eos> Squirrel!<eos> Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But maybe Dug would.
I was gonna be a teacher.<eos> And then my power manifested,and the dreams came.<eos> Visions of a bloody future of deceit and death- the apocalypse.<eos> And when I woke... I tried to warn everyone,but no one would listen.<eos> Why would they?
Don't you miss that?<eos> Well, no.<eos> You're telling me that you wouldn't jump at the chance if you could turn the clock back?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
He's doing a nickel in Concord.<eos> Okay. Your bust.<eos> My bust.<eos> But then the Boston PD would know that.<eos> But a hotshot sheriff from Paradise wouldn't.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, Lisa, you can't, like, tell anybody about this.<eos> Ever.<eos> Of course, I would never.
Well, a few questions.<eos> But, look!<eos> Makes you wonder what they're looking at on the fifth floor, right?<eos> You could turn your desk around and just stare at it all day.<eos> I would.
No.<eos> Not anymore. I used to be.<eos> I don't know what happened, but... all that anger just washed out of me.<eos> So then why not look for her?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Who do you think for? For me.<eos> You're just scared I'll make off with it.<eos> No, but I know you.<eos> If I were to offer it to you, you're quite capable of accepting.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
I'm doing this corporate gig for MySpace and I'm gonna need some jokes and shit.<eos> I was thinking maybe you guys would want to write me some.<eos> You know, he's kind of a flaky guy, but I'm...<eos> I've got nothing going on, man.<eos> I would...
Bruce?<eos> Bruce?<eos> You want to know what I remember about that last summer?<eos> I remember the Christmas party and not wanting to go and you telling me that I had to go, that I had to take care of my sister to bring her home when she wanted to leave.<eos> But I wouldn't.
We made a good book together.<eos> We can make another one.<eos> Would you wanna do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Hey, Nordic.<eos> I just read in Us Weekly that Lance is dating one of the Olsen twins.<eos> Which must be total vindication for Sheryl Crow.<eos> I mean, that guy is just gonna fuck everyone, isn't he?<eos> Hey, I would.
- Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Sorry about that.<eos> Yeah, that's what she told me, too.<eos> Only, it didn't.<eos> - That's weird.<eos> Why would she...
You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing,<eos> b., I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
But he saw her trying to steal his wallet So he hit her so hard he split her eye open<eos> Which he only owned up to Because Langston found Amber's blood in the apartment<eos> Now, Humphreys drove her to the emergency room, and he signed her out<eos> He did everything the congressman asked him to do, so if the congressman ordered Humphreys to kill Amber, then why did he show up at her house that afternoon?<eos> He wouldn't
Who we still need to identify. Obviously.<eos> Okay, pretrial hearing is in 48 hours.<eos> You're gonna have to reveal the prints then.<eos> It would be nice if Kent would give us a name.<eos> Yeah, well, why would he?
The deeper in he gets, the more we're protected.<eos> Yeah, and the more you'll hurt Jax.<eos> I don't give a shit about Jax.<eos> How did Otto take it?<eos> The same way any of us would.
I can't bear to lose you!<eos> Your father was right<eos> We cannot develop feelings in battle<eos> If you were me... wouldn't you have come?<eos> I wouldn't
She rides the elevator twice to the basement.<eos> The first time to put the clothes in the washer, the second time to put them in the dryer.<eos> Only the second time, the trip takes her five seconds longer.<eos> Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?<eos> It wouldn't.
I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
Mornin'.<eos> Is your father back?<eos> Right here.<eos> Why don't you ask him what he's doing?<eos> I would rather not.
He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.<eos> And you're going to?<eos> I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.<eos> Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you, why would Juliet?<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
It doesn't look like the ones that we found in the other victims' mouths.<eos> I've seen this symbol before.<eos> It's the symbol for death.<eos> Why would a guy mark his own stall with a death symbol?<eos> He wouldn't.
Well, we'll sneak out the back and shift, and run and play. Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work right now, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't slap me with a harassment suit for telling you this but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> - Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
She had help.<eos> Can I just say, this was really exciting.<eos> You know, when they first asked me to run this project, the subject of maternal feelings came up.<eos> You see, I used to have a daughter.<eos> She'd...
I could meet your kid. We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
Ms. Davidson, I wish to welcome you and let you know that we will provide any medical assistance your father may need.<eos> Is there something you need?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I'm--I'm fine.<eos> I would just...
Isn't that something?<eos> Two people, like your brother, his family...<eos> That's what they want us to think.<eos> 313, you ever been on a boat?<eos> Why would I?
Two people, like your brother,<eos> His family-- no-no-no-no-no.<eos> That's what they want us to think.<eos> 313, you ever been on a boat?<eos> Why would i?
Well, you can't.<eos> You said yourself, you have to go back there.<eos> Now you're the one who can't wait to go.<eos> - Can you take my case, please?<eos> - Well, I would but, erm...
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.<eos> - There's no way he could...<eos> - That is really bad.<eos> He does not know that you are supplying it.<eos> He'd better not.
I'm someone you can't trust.<eos> Please!<eos> Don't tell her about this.<eos> - I'll think about it.<eos> - I would,
Thank God we live in LA. It's 70 degrees.<eos> I don't know where I'm gonna go.<eos> - Go home.<eos> - Come on, Marlo would never have me.<eos> Actually, she would.
Don't touch it.<eos> It hurts.<eos> I bet that mr. Bear would like to see Sage's scar.<eos> Wouldn't you, mr. Bear?<eos> Yes, I would.
No, $499.<eos> Streisand comes expensive or she doesn't come at all.<eos> Forget it!<eos> I wouldn't pay that much to see Barbra do Céline!<eos> Or would I?
I am your friend who slept with your brother and didn't tell you, and I know what that did to you, and I want to be your friend and I don't want<eos> - to keep secrets from you...<eos> - Oh, my God, Nai. You slept with the captain.<eos> - No, no, Addie.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Yes, still a lot of pillow talk to talk about.<eos> You phoned my wife.<eos> That's always what it comes down to.<eos> Men and their wives.<eos> I'd like
But up he something changed.<eos> Then he drew her a bath. And this is where Melissa Johnson was murdered.<eos> This is where the fantasy ended.<eos> Because she broke it?<eos> I would.
Ms. Davidson, I wish to welcome you and let you know that we will provide any medical assistance your father may need.<eos> Is there something you need?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I'm--I'm fine.<eos> I would just...
You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us.<eos> Conversation's over.<eos> Playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher, I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.<eos> And you would know, huh?<eos> - I would.
He... Well, even more important, he was my family.<eos> And where was I when he was breathing his last breath?<eos> In Japan, making a business deal.<eos> Is there anyone who would like to say anything about Lucky - before we say goodbye?<eos> - I would.
There are the statements. Non.<eos> Poirot would like to ask questions of his own.<eos> Yes. Already done it.<eos> I would like to ask questions of my own, Inspector Hardcastle.<eos> Of course you would.
We agreed to meet for lunch so we can talk. You know what?<eos> I'm allowed to.<eos> I'm single.<eos> I can change my mind if I want to.<eos> not that I would,okay?
What?<eos> I'm late for AP English.<eos> Smooth move, Doctor Love.<eos> You actually think I went to all the trouble of stealing the SATs just so I could go out with Francesca?<eos> I would.
- A good sarge knows her staff.<eos> I can tell you the names of everyone who works at our nick.<eos> Fine.<eos> But do you know them?<eos> - A good sarge would.
Come on away.<eos> Two Guinness, son.<eos> Oh, is this her?<eos> She would do me.<eos> She fucking wouldn't.
- Love you, too.<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - You, too!<eos> Hello, sir. Would you like to buy some cookies?<eos> I would.
- Happy birthday!<eos> - You, too!<eos> Hello, sir. Would you like to buy some cookies?<eos> I would.<eos> I really would. I just...
Chuck is my asset.<eos> He's my guy.<eos> Just give us more time, please.<eos> I'd appreciate it.<eos> I really would.
There you go.<eos> Well I'm Stephanie but I'm sure you know that.<eos> Sam.<eos> Sam, you haven't been sending me e-mails or photos<eos> Why would I?
Been coming through Beck's fax machine for days, but I've just been throwing them away.<eos> Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.<eos> If there was no other way to reach each other, the members of my team had a method of communicating in the open so that no one could read it but us.<eos> - Is it from Chavez? - No.<eos> He would...
This isn't about us.<eos> This is about our friend who we've known for 15 years now who hates surprises, by the way, so you two be juliet for a moment.<eos> So, juliet, if davis was dipping his wick in cilia grey, would you want to know?<eos> - Dipping his wick?<eos> - Damn right I would.
I'm not saying it's bad. I just don't think I want Birdy to be like...that.<eos> Life would be easier for her if she wasn't.<eos> I sure as hell wouldn't want any a son of mine growing up queer.<eos> Jim!<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
I mean, you know I got tasters in the kitchen.<eos> If there was a 1 percent chance of you dying, sir would you eat the lettuce in that sandwich?<eos> One percent?<eos> No. Probably not.<eos> Most people wouldn't, sir.
- I was just playing with you.<eos> Everyone loves my tits.<eos> I was just having a laugh.<eos> - Yeah, whatever. - Seemed like he fancied me.<eos> Or he would with a little push.
Sorry, mate, I can't help you.<eos> No, appreciate it.<eos> Hey, Lewis, has Jason talked to his lawyer this week?<eos> Should he?<eos> I would.
Right back at you.<eos> So,crocotta,huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> That would explain the flies.<eos> Yeah,it would.
Take the damn gun!<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> She did.<eos> And that would explain How it got to the yacht.<eos> It would.
Kirby, victory is slammed.<eos> I'm gonna be filling that room with colleagues and friends.<eos> You know a lot of these people.<eos> Won't you find that embarrassing?<eos> No. But obviously, you would.
Tracy, the Wallace's babysitter.<eos> She told me she'd never even heard of Luke Wallace.<eos> Interesting look for a centuries-old witch.<eos> If you were a 600-year-old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in, wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader?<eos> I would.
All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
More reason to have her in a hospital under constant supervision.<eos> For a doctor, you can be amazingly stupid.<eos> She should be delivered.<eos> It's too early. Besides, the baby might not survive.<eos> At least the girl would.
Only it was going to be me that died and her sitting here with dumb cops asking dumb questions.<eos> "Why was a respectable girl like you with a thug like Hector Romerez?"<eos> Why was she?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Sure, she would.
Previously on...<eos> We had an agreement to keep things casual.<eos> Susan made her feelings clear.<eos> So if I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
This is it.<eos> we're gonna be okay.<eos> How?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would have an answer for that one.<eos> Normally would.
Hey, my kid's a big Knicks fan.<eos> Sammy's in danger, isn't he?<eos> Rose also?<eos> I mean, the Pignatos are surely gonna come after them.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
You think so?<eos> Two more K-town killers dead on his clock that's three murders in two days.<eos> If that turns out to be a hit list we could have a gang war brewing.<eos> Yeah, Kenny, but he hasn't even returned the captain's calls.<eos> Neither would I.
I was thinking a little more uptown.<eos> - 10?<eos> - 25.<eos> I'll understand if you decline.<eos> Most teams would.
Wrong answer.<eos> If I end up making acorn kettles for the rest of my life, I am holding you personally responsible.<eos> Hey, hey. Look at this!<eos> Okay, just stop squirming.<eos> Would you just... Hey!
I know what the police said.<eos> But that place and the remains, they couldn't be properly identified.<eos> And maybe that kid made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture.<eos> I understand you don't want to accept this.<eos> What mother would?
Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell Jack.<eos> But I'll give you guys a nice, long head start.<eos> I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.<eos> No, he wouldn't
Would you like some cake?<eos> I didn't come for sweets.<eos> I know you've been talking about me, and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean.<eos> So who would like to hear the gruesome details?<eos> - I would.
Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.<eos> Why would Ed tell you that?<eos> So, she's not in town?<eos> Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.<eos> Yeah, of course you would.
Everything is as it was.<eos> Nothing has been disturbed.<eos> Wine poured but not drank.<eos> The victim simply let the assailant in.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
Hey, you !<eos> Whoa!<eos> How many?<eos> Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?<eos> Well... who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this?
Rusty.<eos> Just so I'm clear, if I'm ever even... slightly attracted to another woman, I should just lie about that?<eos> Through your teeth.<eos> Really? Why would you tolerate dishonesty from your partner?<eos> I wouldn't.
A... a nasty... nsa incinerator.<eos> Special issue designed toeliminate all biological traces.<eos> That's what killed the doctor.<eos> And guess who worksfor the nsa?<eos> -Why... why,why would casey...
What do you mean,let it go?<eos> You know,the guy in hudson.<eos> You told her?<eos> No,of course i didn't tell her. Rufus.<eos> I would never.
You think?<eos> Sidle: Green bloat stage.<eos> He's been here at least 18 hours.<eos> Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose,eat the brains?<eos> I would.
Die, probably.<eos> Betty.<eos> Nobody gets out alive, kid.<eos> Well, aren't you going to fight it?<eos> I would.
I can read a face, me.<eos> There's a couple of rentals in Hammersmith, they'd probably be more up your street.<eos> I mean this place...<eos> I know I shouldn't say it, but quite honestly, I wouldn't lock up my worst enemy in this place.<eos> I would.
No, uh...<eos> But, uh, here's... Uh... Here's your cake carrier.<eos> - You ate the whole thing ?<eos> - We. [Stammers] I didn't eat a whole cake.<eos> I... I wouldn't.
I showed this photo to you two hours ago.<eos> You told me you didn't recognize him.<eos> Because I couldn't make out his face. I...<eos> - it never occurred to me.<eos> - And why would it?
You know, you just...<eos> It was just... It was horrifying.<eos> And we would just pray.<eos> Please, please let it just go away.<eos> And then, eventually, it would.
How in the hell Did they know?<eos> "traitor Kukushkin trial-- Spied for Americans,<eos> Betrayer Of the motherland."<eos> You'd think It'd get easier over time.<eos> What would?
Do you think Jesus, if he would've come back, would enjoy Family Guy?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> No. No.<eos> If he would've had the network, would he cancel Family Guy?<eos> Yes, he would.
- We're buying insurance.<eos> - We're going to the States to see you.<eos> Right, that's just across the river.<eos> You wouldn't go over to see us in Michigan for a couple of hours without insurance?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
He a pretty good boxer with a glass jaw.<eos> But he was a very good man.<eos> And a good father, and I'd- I'd like for people to know that.<eos> Would you put that in your story?<eos> I would.
I just thought maybe...<eos> I know Lucy told you.<eos> I knew she would.<eos> So I wouldn't have...<eos> So I wouldn't...
You can get whatever you want.<eos> Would you go to a seafood restaurant and have a steak?<eos> Yeah, maybe, if I wanted a steak.<eos> You would?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Your man has made a mistake.<eos> There is no exit.<eos> He's trapped.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why would he?
He may be in trouble with the press, but he stayed out of jail.<eos> You don't see God's hand in this?<eos> Well, reasonable people can disagree, but I don't see God anywhere within miles of this.<eos> On the other hand, if you slept with me tonight, I bet you I could change my mind in a hurry.<eos> - Oh, you would.
- I think it might be from that funny yellow soft drink Joe gave me last night.<eos> What was it called again?<eos> (MUMBLES)<eos> Margarita?<eos> - You wouldn't.
What was it called again?<eos> (MUMBLES)<eos> Margarita?<eos> - You wouldn't.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Everybody, I need a tight formation, right now, in front.<eos> Tight formation, everybody.<eos> Calling an audible.<eos> Fifty-nine razor.<eos> What would...
Look, if you said spaghetti, I wouldn't be confused.<eos> Taquito.<eos> And then he hit me with two lefts and a huge right, and then I realized how do I know the guy beating the crap out of me is actually gay?<eos> 'Cause no one else would be stupid enough to pretend they were gay to enter a boxing tournament.<eos> Or would they?
They're hitting us with MG-42s.<eos> Roger.<eos> Go after them.<eos> They need help.<eos> I wouldn't.
Let me help you.<eos> The computer short-circuited.<eos> I need to activate the time machine and bring the gang back!<eos> Doreen...<eos> - would you...
No dream.<eos> She's getting people whipped up.<eos> That poor girl is dead, and that boy is burnt in the back room!<eos> She's got 'em believing she's a psychic, she has a direct line with God.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
What if we made it look like a suicide?<eos> How we gonna do that?<eos> We slice up his wrists and when that didn't work, he started stabbing himself.<eos> I would believe that.<eos> Yeah, but nobody else would.
How are you holding up?<eos> What was it that Paul drank?<eos> It was this mixture that he made out of industrial- strength cleaners because he couldn't find one that was strong enough.<eos> Why would Paul have a cockroach problem?<eos> He wouldn't.
I'm responsible.<eos> I took the memory of his brother away from him and that's why he comes after me.<eos> He actually believes that he is a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that I'm, some king of lean leader.<eos> How would somebody know if they had this... condition?<eos> Other than the seizures? They... They probably wouldn't but...
How we felt about each other.<eos> Whether we could handle a long-distance relationship.<eos> Did she ever see herself coming back to Sacred Heart?<eos> Would a pizza place deliver to a bench at 3:00 in the morning?<eos> They would.
You're different<eos> Since that stuff last year--<eos> The shooting.<eos> - I'm sure Carm would agree.<eos> - I would.
Teyla!<eos> Teyla, this is Atlantis, do you read?<eos> Teyla, this is Sheppard, come in.<eos> - She wouldn't turn off her radio.<eos> - No, she wouldn't.
Forget I said that.<eos> No, that's— I-I would love to get a drink.<eos> You don't have to say that. No, I would.<eos> –No, no, no, no!<eos> –I would!
And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.<eos> I need to know how this delay is gonna affect things.<eos> Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.<eos> Well, thank you, James, but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.<eos> - And what would?
Knew that question was coming.<eos> It's a normal question.<eos> I told you.<eos> 20.000 € to dance in a private school.<eos> Great Opportunity what else would a girl?
I don't want to go from Camilla Lopez to Camilla Bandini.<eos> It's not much of an improvement.<eos> Who asked you to go anywhere?<eos> -You'd ask me.<eos> -No, I wouldn't.
It's not much of an improvement.<eos> Who asked you to go anywhere?<eos> -You'd ask me.<eos> -No, I wouldn't.<eos> -Yes, you would.
Who asked you to go anywhere?<eos> -You'd ask me.<eos> -No, I wouldn't.<eos> -Yes, you would.<eos> -I wouldn't.
-You'd ask me.<eos> -No, I wouldn't.<eos> -Yes, you would.<eos> -I wouldn't.<eos> -You would.
-No, I wouldn't.<eos> -Yes, you would.<eos> -I wouldn't.<eos> -You would.<eos> -I wouldn't.
-I wouldn't.<eos> -You would.<eos> -I wouldn't.<eos> I know you like the palm of my hand, Arturo, and I'm telling you, you would.<eos> Right after Sammy would.
I don't make a big speech.<eos> A big weepy speech.<eos> Oh, that's it!<eos> You're afraid that you're gonna cry!<eos> I wouldn't.
My name's Sally Rowe.<eos> I'm a forensic psychologist.<eos> I've been asked to talk to you to find out what happened.<eos> Would you like someone present during this interview?<eos> Would you?
- I won't take it personally.<eos> Okay.<eos> Blow me off again, I will.<eos> Should I take that under advisement?<eos> - Yes. I would.
- Do you really think.<eos> If some commited people really want it to hurt us..<eos> You think they couldnt manage?<eos> You think we hear them coming?<eos> We wouldnt!
You are lying.<eos> I've only said this much to convince you I'm not CIA.<eos> - Then why did you not tell this to Ahmat?<eos> - Because he'd never believe me.<eos> - And I would?
- Hey, can I help you?<eos> - Do you work here?<eos> No, sorry, just making conversation.<eos> I wouldn't buy these trainers, though.<eos> - Seriously, I wouldn't.
I'm just telling you because, you know I thought you'd want to me to tell if I noticed that.<eos> What made you think I'd want you to tell me if my ass was getting fat?<eos> Because I guess I'd want you to tell me if I was gaining weight.<eos> -Really, you'd want me to tell you?<eos> -Yes, I would.
Does anyone know what a Donzi boat is?<eos> -I don't.<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> Who would pay to walk on Nip/Tuck?<eos> Oh, God, I would.
And the funny thing is, all I really want to do is make you happy.<eos> I just want to make you smile.<eos> Now, I've had a lot of time to think about some of the things that went on, and I know, Brooke, that I don't always do the right thing or always say the right things, but I am willing to try to do things differently.<eos> And I'd be happy to go take a dance class.<eos> Well, I would.
Although she'd rather do social work.<eos> Help women in her same situation.<eos> Say that again...<eos> Get a B.A. in Language Studies.<eos> Though she'd rather...
It is a tenet of Church teaching that a confession attained by 'The Question' constitutes ultimate proof.<eos> I'm sorry, Lorenzo, but how can this sort of confession be an ultimate proof?<eos> If I were tortured, I'd confess to anything.<eos> I'd confess I was the Turkish sultan.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
If I were tortured, I'd confess to anything.<eos> I'd confess I was the Turkish sultan.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> I would confess to anything to avoid pain.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
And anyway, it wouldn't be just setting you up. You could start the farm, then I could come and live with you.<eos> If we decide to get divorced and live together.<eos> You'd never want to live with me on a farm.<eos> - You'd never want to be Mrs Oliver Parkin.<eos> - I would! Why wouldn't I?
Do you smoke?<eos> No.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I'd like us to be friends.<eos> Would you now?
You can't stop them...<eos> I always think that killing enemies is a kind of glory... where will you go after the battle ends?<eos> Wherever needs me, I'll be there<eos> What if Zhao is being invaded and ask for your help will you go?<eos> Of course I would
Okay, why would she steal your dog?<eos> 'Cause she's a thieving stripper!<eos> I wouldn't steal your dog. Oh, really?<eos> What if you thought you could get a lot of money for him?<eos> Well, then, yeah, I would. Yeah.
Mr President, I'm glad we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs Logan personally for your hospitality.<eos> Mr President, it's been our pleasure.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We would love that.<eos> Wouldn't we, Martha? Yes.
Right below the neck.<eos> Did you know she only salts popcorn on the right side, never on the left?<eos> And every time she watches The Wizard of Oz, she cries.<eos> Every time, did you know that?<eos> No, why would you?
- What are you doing?<eos> I chose the first one.<eos> "Took donuts from a banker, when I was not a customer." - I have to go now.?<eos> - Randy, people don't want their donuts in the afternoon.<eos> - Oh sure they would.
No.<eos> No. Come on, man.<eos> I love when you go for the comedy.<eos> But I would not quit your day job beating up people.<eos> I wouldn't.
Dad's in prison, my mom... couldn't make it work.<eos> I just knew there was something about you that didn't quite fit in.<eos> In a good way.<eos> I wonder if your dad knows my Uncle Jack.<eos> Why would he?
He went down there to make peace.<eos> To end it.<eos> He didn't want anyone else to get hurt.<eos> If I could, I'd switch places with him.<eos> I would.
I wish he was dead.<eos> What if something happened to him?<eos> You'd feel terrible.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
You'd feel terrible.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
And I'm not gonna take it back.<eos> It's perfect, Angel.<eos> She'll love it.<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
I'm actually looking forward to it.<eos> Me,too.<eos> Um... - I'm not exactly the type that would do well in prison,guys.<eos> -No one's going to think any less of you if you want out,Palmer. -Really?<eos> Well,no,they probably would.
No, that's how she got crabs.<eos> Poor Bunny, it's always something.<eos> If not the clap, it's a botched face lift.<eos> Be that as it may, do we all agree that I should tell this man's wife?<eos> I wouldn't.
NCIS Season 4 Episode 4: Faking It.<eos> Men are such bad liars.<eos> But if a good liar was telling you a lie, you would not know it was a lie.<eos> Ha!<eos> I would.
Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.<eos> Why would Ed tell you that?<eos> So, she's not in town?<eos> Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.<eos> Yeah, of course you would.
Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.<eos> Lily, would you like to join us?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.<eos> Why would it?
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.<eos> Attention, losers:<eos> this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love.<eos> I'm not going to fall for such a cheap stunt.<eos> Mom would.
It's a good thing I've already bought my shroud cloth.<eos> You wouldn't wrap me in three meters of rags.<eos> He is obsessed with three meters of rags!<eos> You wouldn't even do that.<eos> You wouldn't.
That was bitching.<eos> Jesus Christ, girl!<eos> Ain't you China's old lady?<eos> No, it's like he won't leave me alone.<eos> Well, I wouldn't either.
Oh, that's nothing.<eos> That's just a material object.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's with us either.<eos> Who would?
It means nothing.<eos> I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's with us either.<eos> Who would?<eos> Me.<eos> I would.
- Wait a minute. - Whoo whoo whoo! I can't let it dry too much.<eos> Are we getting out of bed today, "Camille"?<eos> What for?<eos> I could die and nobody would care.<eos> I would.
- It doesn't matter!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I told you I'd let him drown.<eos> The man who drove my wife into a bridge abutment.<eos> - But I wouldn't.
So.. Where are you going?<eos> I was actually just looking for a place to eat.<eos> Oh, ok. there is only one place.<eos> You would like that I take you?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
Now you're certain?<eos> Hal, you don't know anything,<eos> The book, the math, the dates, the writing, all that stuff you just decided with your buddies, it's just evidence,<eos> - It doesn't prove anything,<eos> - OK, what would?
- Why me?<eos> Because it wasn't one of the girls, was it?<eos> Put that down!<eos> - I wouldn't know what to do with it!<eos> - Well, he would!
What did you do to them?<eos> You crazy goddamn broad.<eos> Just take a look at this mug.<eos> Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you?<eos> None of you would, but Goldie.
- Where's Captain Newport?<eos> - There's nothing to eat.<eos> Captain Newport will be back shortly.<eos> Will he have food?<eos> He'd better.
How can you be sure?<eos> I knew after three seconds.<eos> I've heard of love happening that fast.<eos> The French call it le flash.<eos> They would, bloody perverts.
You follow?<eos> With naked girls on the last page, like in the old days.<eos> With 10 million euros I'd rent 100 boats and bring all compatriots I could to Spain.<eos> The government wouldn't let you do that.<eos> Yes, it would.
Yeah, well, we all lose people.<eos> Yeah, but your people don't usually get back up and take a bite out of you after they die.<eos> Careful, you can infect yourself.<eos> You sure as hell wouldn't want that, would you?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
I thought I'd save you the trouble and turn myself in.<eos> What makes you think you'd end up dead?<eos> Flynn framed me for murder 3 years ago with deputy DA.<eos> Powell and Dr Easton, so clearly, I'd say, they'd feel better if I ceased to exist.<eos> Maybe I would, too.
As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> When do you prune yours?<eos> Mrs. Mays, I understand that you may want to do everything you can to protect your son but that little boy may be dying right now.<eos> I would like to help you.<eos> I really would.
Yes, definitely.<eos> I'm definitely having fun.<eos> Make a wish?<eos> Can I take this hat off?<eos> I wouldn't.
Vigilant to detail like his pa.<eos> I'd think Mrs Garret, as the bank's chief backer... might wish to be present for its opening.<eos> - Well, as far as that, I got her proxy.<eos> - Yes, but wouldn't she wish to be?<eos> Perhaps she would.
It burns you that your own daughter picked me over you.<eos> She did not pick you.<eos> It just didn't occur to her that I would agree to do it.<eos> Well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again,she'd pick me.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Yeah, I wonder if I...<eos> If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
So you've memorized it?<eos> I meant you're the guy who can't break up with somebody but that's because you're the kind of guy who doesn't wanna hurt anyone.<eos> Yeah, well, that has its downside too.<eos> Truth is right now, I figure I'm lucky you're even talking to me.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Well, because...<eos> We both love you and everything.<eos> You could be our mother.<eos> I would be proud to have you two as my sons.<eos> Any mother would.
--No. --No?<eos> !<eos> You wouldn't want me to be happy?<eos> Fine.<eos> Sure I would,ok?
-Yeah.<eos> They're such a rip-off.<eos> It says in the book to take it to the dealer.<eos> If it said to drive off a cliff, would you drive off a cliff?<eos> Yes, I would.
Sanitize the Watchtower.<eos> We've got business, Waller.<eos> You told me once that you were a patriot. Well, it's time to step up.<eos> You have to know that the Justice League would never have fired that weapon at you.<eos> Sure you would.
- They are.<eos> They wouldn't offer me a nickel.<eos> I wouldn't take it if they did.<eos> This doesn't change anything, does it?<eos> No. / Well, why would it?
Yes, I have a son.<eos> Well, then you know how I feel.<eos> Wouldn't you do anything for him?<eos> Wouldn't you die for him?<eos> Yes, I would.
Maybe the only way to save Ducky, Abby and McGee is to kill yourself.<eos> Special Agent McGee.<eos> Found Ducky and Gerald's cell phone in the park.<eos> Why would they leave their cell phones in the park?<eos> They wouldn't, McGee!
Go to Bethesda, keep me updated on Tony's condition.<eos> Of course.<eos> Find out why Kate hasn't checked in. You got it.<eos> I got the phones, but they wouldn't trust me with a weapon.<eos> I wouldn't either, Jimmy.
This is from a speech by John F. Kennedy.<eos> -I think it could work for you.<eos> -This is all about courage.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe this coming from me.<eos> I would.
He still has some terrible hold over me.<eos> I wish it were not so, but he will not let go.<eos> Will you ask your brother?<eos> Would that make you happy?<eos> Yes, it would.
There!<eos> And you went back to bed?<eos> Only for an hour.<eos> Leave the kids here for an hour?<eos> Would you?
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.<eos> You know, there's something cathartic about telling a 3-star general to go to hell.<eos> You know, all these years I thought I had my sister pegged but... in reality, she's a complete stranger to me.<eos> Even if that were true, I think that if she called you tomorrow, you'd be there in the second to help her.<eos> Yeah I would.
It's an honour to meet you sir.<eos> Really?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't want you to be nervous.<eos> Why would I?
We're above the search coordinates.<eos> Okay. It should transition seamlessly.<eos> Alright, then.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> I... I wouldn't.
There's no way I could learn 'em in time.<eos> I'm not comin' back as the Bobbinator's partner.<eos> We'll look like an olive and a toothpick together.<eos> Besides. she would never dance with me.<eos> Sure she would.
Besides. she would never dance with me.<eos> Sure she would.<eos> Just the Latin dances.<eos> I'll still do the waltz and the quickstep.<eos> She would.
Sure.<eos> To Sergeant Rose.<eos> Stu Wolff.<eos> Right, well, now that that's settled, would anyone like to come to a party with me?<eos> I would.
E-boat captains radioed Berlin, claiming two dozen.<eos> We went on the air with a decodable signal to Patton's fictitious army saying it lost five landing craft.<eos> First reports back from Signal Corps indicate Jerry bought the whole program.<eos> I'd be surprised if Jerry's really buying the idea that the bulk of our forces are in the east.<eos> I wouldn't.
I lost all my energy because of you!<eos> You little brat!<eos> There are so many young and cute girls out there!<eos> Did your dick work for her?<eos> Mine would.
- What about infrared?<eos> - We can't get through the walls, Jack.<eos> - He knows we're here.<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - Cos I would.
But I liked the kid... so I kept paying for his education and so forth.<eos> Obviously, he doesn't know.<eos> His mother said it would break his heart.<eos> He so liked being... the son of Denny Crane.<eos> Hmm. Who wouldn't?
We processed the guy's jeans.<eos> Tight GSR pattern around the entrance hole.<eos> So, he was either shot by someone at close range who left the gun behind, or it was self-inflicted.<eos> Why would the shooter leave the gun behind?<eos> He probably wouldn't.
Duct tape.<eos> So the shooter stuck the gun in the toilet earlier to avoid the metal detector.<eos> Echoes of Michael Corleone.<eos> So if Manny is the shooter, why would he need to hide his own gun?<eos> He wouldn't.
Anytime I see a black man in a tie and a suit, I think, "Hey, you must park cars for a living."<eos> I feel it was an honest mistake, Wanda.<eos> No no, if it was a white man standing here, you would not.<eos> I would have given him the valet.<eos> I would too. - No, you wouldn't.
What about you?<eos> What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?<eos> - You don't know who I am?<eos> - Should I?<eos> Every other person in here would.
A cleansing is coming.<eos> There will be a reckoning.<eos> A cleansing is coming.<eos> Who would like to see a cleansing?<eos> I would, I would.
Put a name brand on it, you know it's a name brand.<eos> I mean, no one ever thought to put a brand name on a party till I did it.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I should take this.<eos> - I wouldn't.
At ease, Major, please.<eos> There you go, sir.<eos> I'm glad to find you all here.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have another one of those?<eos> I would.
Extra gum for your big night.<eos> -Guess this makes it official.<eos> -You do your family proud.<eos> Shouldn't I just stick my head in and say hello?<eos> -I wouldn't.
What about my wife?<eos> What about her?<eos> The Mayor.<eos> Eunetta's seat.<eos> Why would the Mayor...
Of course.<eos> And he was already engaged, but he couldn't stop watching my mother.<eos> This is my song.<eos> And finally his fiancée got very jealous and--<eos> I would too.
You know that old man I killed in your village?<eos> What if your whole village was next?<eos> Would you kill them?<eos> Me?<eos> They certainly would.
He may be right to fear.<eos> Someone has been feeding you a poison.<eos> It's the only possibility left.<eos> But the doctors have never found evidence.<eos> They wouldn't.
Who do you have to know... to get a little Grey Poupon around here?<eos> Ray!<eos> It's you, in my apartment, making a sandwich.<eos> It wouldn't kill you to keep lettuce in the crisper.<eos> No, it wouldn't, Ray.
-To the Baywatch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm going there.<eos> I was on my way.<eos> -Yes, I would.
We got an item that we want to package ourselves and, you know....<eos> -Mail out.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Could we just get an envelope from you?<eos> What size would you Iike?
- The only reason I ask is because I think that as you go through life, you learn to depend only on yourself.<eos> You know? Do you own a firearm?<eos> A gun?<eos> A gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.<eos> - No. Why would I?
I don't want to see you again.<eos> I just wanted to apologize and make sure that you don't have any problem with me that would interfere with the wedding.<eos> - There's not gonna be a wedding.<eos> - Would you like us to step outside, sir?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> You're nobody!<eos> I could make you disappear like that... and not one fucking person would miss you.<eos> Not one fucking person!<eos> - Bernie would!
In our attempt to free them Mr. Rhodes and... the priest got shot and killed by the drug dealers.<eos> Three of my men are also dead and a forth badly wounded.<eos> We got three of Valdon's men, the rest got away.<eos> I think Chief Fuentes would like to make a statement.<eos> No, but Detective Castillo would.
PATRICK. I hope you're gonna be comfortable.<eos> Mom. HRAM. Am I in Josh's room?<eos> PATRICK. Hey. Buddy.<eos> DOUG: That kid and his dog will show up here.<eos> What kid wouldn't?
your ship is outmatched.<eos> if your people refuse to stand down, you have ordered them to their deaths.<eos> maybe, but sooner or later, a swarm of very angry genites are going to come out of slipstream, and they're going to kill whichever one of us is left.<eos> yeah, but i can't believe that you would allow this facility to fall back into the hands of the genites.<eos> i wouldn't.
- The new Mickey?<eos> - Yeah, Mickey... used to look out for me now and then for Cathan.<eos> Maybe that's why Cathan put you in the car.<eos> No, he didn't mention it.<eos> Well he wouldn't.
Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright.<eos> Would anyone like to see a picture of their aeroplane?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> You all would.
Unbelievable, shocking, working at an inn and learning so little.<eos> We must be dumb.<eos> Who would ever think that inns need doors and floors?<eos> - Doors and floors, we can't afford that.<eos> - We'd better...
