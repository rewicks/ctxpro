Nobody knew anybody.<eos> I thought I wouldn't be safe and comfortable here.<eos> One day, he asked me to get a few things for his restaurant, and I couldn't do it.<eos> I had to pay a boy to get them for me.<eos> I hid in the doorway and waited for them.
You go to school for that?<eos> No.<eos> Just fool around on my own.<eos> I saw you looking at my scars.<eos> You're not gonna ask me about them?
An eggshell is never gonna come back together.<eos> A window will never unbreak.<eos> 30 seconds in, she's talking about her boobs.<eos> That's what's on her mind... her boob job, her boobs, which are perfectly fine, by the way.<eos> You know what? When she gets in the car, you look at them, and you tell me that they're not perfect.
Age, coloring, vanished off the streets.<eos> But the difference is a big one.<eos> The first two vics were runaways, addicts.<eos> Turned tricks.<eos> Classic street life. Nobody out there looking for them.
As a matter of fact, yes.<eos> Eric just called from the lab.<eos> He says they believe the laptop may have been hacked.<eos> Specifically, the browser history.<eos> Like all these websites that Khalid visited, the ones that support the idea that he'd been radicalized, it's possible that he never logged onto them.
Where can he be?<eos> For your own safety, please return to your cabins.<eos> For your own safety, please return to your cabins.<eos> Should have took the damn pills.<eos> - I'll go get them.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, trust me. I'm already thinking of a new song.<eos> - Just from going for coffee?<eos> - Yeah. It's what I do.<eos> I sort of take everyday situations, and then I look at them from a different perspective.
We don't have that at home.<eos> That's your only evidence?<eos> I smelled his underwear.<eos> I waited all day for him to take off his shorts.<eos> When he did at last, I pounced on them. And sniffed.
Uh, I think the unsub watched and waited, most likely from higher ground, till the three of them were isolated.<eos> He attacked Jeff first, the biggest threat.<eos> And he had a compulsive need to brand him, like his prey.<eos> What if that's why he's kept the girls alive?<eos> He's hunting them.
She is trying to control you, Avery.<eos> I can't believe that you're giving in to all of her crazy demands.<eos> They're not crazy.<eos> They're not even demands.<eos> I know Juliette's done some bad things in the past, believe me, but, I mean, at least she's trying to take responsibility for them.
That's how fast things are moving around here.<eos> If I said I was sorry, I'd be saying it all day.<eos> What I'm asking you to do, what I'm asking everyone in that room... all my geniuses... is to look beyond the numbers.<eos> To look around them.<eos> Through them.
He's odd, like he has no social skills.<eos> Some people don't.<eos> But most dangerous criminals seem super nice to their neighbours, so I guess he's safe.<eos> Oh please.<eos> The killer brought four prostitutes to his room, handcuffed and raped them, then flew them all to the mountains in his plane, released them in a forest, and hunted them with a rifle.
What did you say?<eos> We have reason to believe - You dare to accuse my Marcel... ..of attacking those...women?<eos> I believe that later today he will be identified by the woman he attacked last night.<eos> Just... ..look at these photographs, if you will.<eos> Just look at them. Look at them.
I had the lab test one of the pills.<eos> They're anti-hypertension for blood pressure.<eos> - Completely harmless.<eos> - That's what you think.<eos> Look, she may be allergic to them.
Nice to meet you.<eos> It's good to have you on board.<eos> I'm sorry that I had to bring Tom, but, uh, El insists he gets separation anxiety, and, well, since we share custody...<eos> Uh, your ex-wife came back for her notes.<eos> I-I tried to look at them before, but...
All right, look, you want me to do the spring cleaning, I can start right now.<eos> These two drawers down here, I haven't touched those in a least a decade.<eos> I'll get started on those.<eos> I started on my storage unit this morning.<eos> My mom sent me these boxes of junk from when I was a kid, and I am plowing through them.
It's like riding a bicycle, bitch.<eos> What's our destination?<eos> Just cruisin', seeing the sights.<eos> Ladies?<eos> They're a sight, and we're seeing them.
She just hacked into the IDI Bank to steal money.<eos> I didn't do any of it.<eos> Elvis... you know me.<eos> I loved Henry.<eos> Stop with your tears and your lies, 'cause nobody believes them, okay?
We will capture the culprit who murdered 13 Chinese fishermen!<eos> This is our first joint operation.<eos> Our goal is to subdue Naw Khar's group.<eos> With the help of reliable sources, we managed to locate Naw Khar's various drug factories and trafficking spots.<eos> We must hit them on the blind side, and we have to make our move at once!
A few months ago, I found something strange on Damien's laptop.<eos> A file with photos of women.<eos> They were girls.<eos> They looked young.<eos> But when I asked Damien about them, he said they were in college.
There's something wrong with him, Eric.<eos> It's not just the anxiety.<eos> - He's fine.<eos> - He's not fine.<eos> He is saying the craziest things and he believes them.
I believe that animals listen and speak to us if we only have the ear for it.<eos> That's how we learn to look after them.<eos> Who looks after us?<eos> Fairy godmothers, of course.<eos> And do you believe in them?
- We can't confirm the pathogen without them!<eos> - I'll fix it.<eos> What happened?<eos> Boy Wonder here left the samples back at the shack.<eos> I'll get them back.
But then the occultist dabbler found himself amongst the real thing.<eos> Now, I needn't remind you of the consequences of disloyalty, need I?<eos> All those photographs.<eos> So indiscreet.<eos> I just can't imagine what the Museum Governors would make of them.
You were a shop girl then.<eos> ~ Look at you now.<eos> ~ Well, it's down to you.<eos> ~ Well... ~ You changed my life, gave me opportunities.<eos> You reached out and took them.
Now, when we get to the grape fields, if you see wire, you see metal, you see plastic, newly turned dirt, don't step on 'em.<eos> You didn't drop it, don't pick it up.<eos> Try to stay at least five body lengths between the next man in the patrol.<eos> When we get in the village, you're gonna see women dressed in bags.<eos> Please don't stare at them.
Where were you?<eos> I had to take a leak.<eos> Where's the girls?<eos> They're waiting.<eos> Let's go get them.
What happened to the good old days of just hiding drugs up your butt?<eos> What the hell are you doing now?<eos> I just got the girls' blood work back.<eos> Their alcohol level is zero, but there's an anion gap acidosis.<eos> And look at them.
Huh. Abe, where did you get this?<eos> Oh, this guy brought it by earlier looking to sell it.<eos> Said it was 18th-century Britannia silver, so I thought you might be able to authenticate it.<eos> Trays like this were very rare, even in the 1700s.<eos> Only the wealthiest families could afford them.
No.<eos> You stopped yourself.<eos> She went to find us a room, and I saw these...<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Are you okay? [sighs] I saw these two girls in a hot tub and I was turned on, and I was staring at them.
Now the guy in there now refuses to put his name on the mailbox, so he keeps getting my magazines.<eos> And you are mourning the loss of popular geek?<eos> No. Molecular gastronomy.<eos> I like to stay current, but he hoards them.<eos> - So man up and go get them.
We now have a potential scandal on our hands which will do what that monstrous object you found was designed to bring about, create outrage among the population, directed towards surgeryschools.<eos> God helps us when Warburton and the newspapers get hold of this.<eos> You could silence them, sir.<eos> Too late.<eos> We might silence the newspapers but the bally sellers will accomplish the task for them.
Not me.<eos> I need a moment.<eos> For what?<eos> I may have intimacy issues.<eos> Well, tonight, I was thankful for them.
'We will comb through everything' until we find another piece of the puzzle.<eos> When are you gonna find him?<eos> I have to get back to the precinct.<eos> I ask that each of you give your statement to my detectives before you leave.<eos> How can she keep looking at them?
Not a day goes by that I don't miss my parents, or Tommy.<eos> And I think about what I would... give just to spend another minute, but what's happening with Sara isn't healing anyone's pain;<eos> It's just--it's making it worse.<eos> She almost killed those two girls.<eos> I mean, why would she even go after them?
What's going on?<eos> Ben, the situation is... more complicated than you think.<eos> See, my competition, they'll destroy me if they find out about this.<eos> I employ 862 people. This is not only about me.<eos> This is about them and their families.
They've survived all five of the most recent mass extinctions on this planet.<eos> A visitor from another world could be forgiven for thinking of earth as the planet of the tardigrades.<eos> If we're ever gonna get to the bottom of this dewdrop, better get a move on.<eos> Every leaf and tiny clump of moss has hundreds of thousands of microscopic mouths called Stomata.<eos> Plants breathe through them, taking in carbon dioxide and exhaling the oxygen that we need to live. The plants can survive without us.
Oh, yes.<eos> Rich women always complain about their maids to their friends.<eos> - You think?<eos> - They complain about us.<eos> We complain about them.
Oh, yes.<eos> Rich women always complain about their maids to their friends.<eos> - You think?<eos> - They complain about us.<eos> We complain about them.
Yeah, we believe those were sustained while they ran for their lives through the woods.<eos> He hunted them like prey.<eos> He's a mission killer.<eos> He's ridding the world of sin.<eos> He hunts them, he guts them, he skins them.
- All right.<eos> - Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.<eos> - Go talk to some bitches.<eos> - All right.<eos> When did we start calling them bitches?
Maybe it's his shame?<eos> Or maybe he's impotent.<eos> He doesn't rape because he can't.<eos> And the embarrassment of not being able to perform manifests in him wrapping up his victims.<eos> He doesn't want to look at them after he kills them.
It's all about finding balance, my friend, embracing who you are.<eos> And, you know, that's something in life we're all looking for.<eos> Not just you.<eos> Okay, is this another of your pep talks?<eos> Yes, and pretty soon I'm gonna start charging you for them.
I sprained my knee, couldn't work for a week, and now the new manager, Cliff, won't pay any of my medical bills.<eos> And now he's suing her to pay for a new pole.<eos> $1,300.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I... Know it probably sounds dumb, but, um, the girls at Kandy's... they really look up to me, and I look out for them the way you look out for me. Mm.
I know.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> Come on.<eos> I was watching this video and just had a bowlful of tentacles.<eos> And you pour, like, soy sauce over them and they,
Are you all right?<eos> I want to know how these drugs are getting in.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I know you care about the welfare of these women, Liz.<eos> You fear for them and it's made you an excellent peer worker, but you're coming up for parole.
Are you all right?<eos> I want to know how these drugs are getting in.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I know you care about the welfare of these women, Liz.<eos> And you fear for them. It's what's made you an excellent peer worker, but you're coming up for parole, soon.
I never heard the soccer ball thing before.<eos> - I know.<eos> That's a pretty amazing story.<eos> - Yeah, you got to wonder.<eos> He's handing out all these soccer balls, paying for them out of his own pocket, and not one bit of press about it.
No, no, actually I can't. I have to work.<eos> But this won't take any time.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about the twins.<eos> They're in your school!<eos> Because Melissa wanted them under your influence.
I do.<eos> And he's a friend we may need.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He has certain skills.<eos> And I know that you don't believe in them or the occult.
But they obtained their visas under false pretenses.<eos> That's not their fault.<eos> They were lied to.<eos> My God.<eos> - Look at them.
Rocco, I mean, could you...<eos> He wanted hot credit cards.<eos> Stolen credit cards?<eos> What for?<eos> So he could buy things and not have to pay for them.
Being Expelled Is Kind Of Like That...<eos> Except The Weather'S Awesome.<eos> Your Life Is A Never-Ending Series<eos> Of Missed Opportunities.<eos> At Any Given Moment, You Are Completely Surrounded By Them.
Dude, Wendy plays volleyball.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I don't think you knew that.<eos> And then he, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and, we... that's when we saw him with, the three rings and his penis.<eos> He was pulling it through them somehow.- -
There you are... Thief in the... Shadows.<eos> I did not come to steal from you... O Smaug... the Unassessably Wealthy.<eos> I merely wanted... to gaze upon your magnificence.<eos> To see... if you really were as great as the old tales say.<eos> I did not believe them.
Yeah... I can't talk now. Sorry.<eos> Clary. I came for the Tarot cards.<eos> - I need them.<eos> You know, the ones my Mom painted.<eos> I just need to look at them really quickly and I'll give them back.
! He was making out like he won an Oscar.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's an Oscar, for God's sake.<eos> Why doesn't anyone like my awards?<eos> Well, sweetheart, because you didn't earn them.
You're not gonna tell me that your love is dependent on pigment, are you? - Huh?<eos> No?<eos> - No, no, but, you know...<eos> I see the red in our girls' eye lashes.<eos> I look at them and it makes me think of when we met.
That guy's wife wrote the blog.<eos> I know.<eos> Can you believe he kept doing this dead-end job?<eos> Julie's blog meant there were no shortage of strongly-felt opinions about my choices.<eos> Usually, I tell them off.
- Adios.<eos> Jeez, what's the rush?<eos> - Is that--<eos> - Shh, shh. The stolen engraving plates.<eos> I came across them when I was looking for the bathroom.

Choice, yes.<eos> I have heard of these rumors, these stories; That if we travel west, that we will somehow reach a land that is rich and plentiful.<eos> But I tell you that I will not risk my ships or my reputation<eos> on such a deluded fantasy.<eos> They are my ships - I pay for them... and they go where I tell them to go.
I sacrificed everything to save their souls.<eos> No, they did nothing but disappoint you.<eos> Chelsea is weak.<eos> And Rebecca was a drug addict.<eos> You worried about them so much.
Did he say exactly what it was that he found in Chechnya?<eos> No.<eos> But he was very excited, and he said that he was finally going to be able to publish something of real scientific merit.<eos> So he knew that his previous books were sensationalistic nonsense.<eos> Bones. We preferred to view them as an accessible way for the public to get introduced to archaeology.
Don't take that!<eos> It's a horse tranquilizer!<eos> Come now, Judy.<eos> These pills are perfectly safe.<eos> You signed for them yourself.
- Hey. So, Dad who won't let his son say the Pledge of Allegiance, why don't you meet a big ex-marine? Have at him.<eos> I admire that you stand up for your principles.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do! I-I fought for America.<eos> And to me, those stars don't just represent 50 states. They represent different beliefs, and I fought for them all.
Oh, please, his lasted an hour at a time.<eos> An hour and a half if he was drunk.<eos> Exactly.<eos> He treated women like rental cars.<eos> You pay for them when you need them, and it's someone else's job to empty out the trunk and hose them down.
Jack, sometimes there's a difference between what you can do and what you should do, and... sometimes that's a tough choice, but...<eos> Like, you can jump off the roof, but should you?<eos> Nicky, you know what, we're not talking about jumping off a roof here.<eos> Linda, the department has procedures to handle situations like this.<eos> I believe in them.
Groan of Arc.<eos> She'll give you some slack for a while, then she gets rough, aggressive.<eos> Be ready.<eos> Oh, a lot of names to remember.<eos> And the twins out there, Scary Skate and Crashley Olsen, do not get between them.
Just his eyes in the mirror.<eos> And his voice.<eos> I kept thinking that this must have been what it was like for all those girls.<eos> How alone they must have felt.<eos> Just his eyes, you know, looking at them.
It's one of the toughest things a cop has to wrestle with.<eos> Prosecutors, too.<eos> But isn't there a gray area when someone can do the wrong thing for the right reasons?<eos> Sometimes we have to pay a price for our ethics.<eos> But we either pay for them or with them.
- Yeah, especially not here.<eos> Let's go!<eos> You took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> Okay, so what do we do with the rocks?<eos> Put 'em in the middle of the room. He'll go for them first.
A.T.W.<eos> That's why we wear these wristbands, to constantly remind ourselves of that.<eos> Wait, what did you do with yours?<eos> These are the pulsers I described to you.<eos> And as we discussed, I'd like you to take one in each hand and concentrate on the vibrations being emitted through them.
I think I might know why.<eos> As a prosecutor, Ms. Watkins would know the extent of the city's surveillance network.<eos> She could have avoided the cameras altogether?<eos> That's just it, she doesn't.<eos> She looks right at them.
Women like that I can anticipate their needs.<eos> They're used to guys doing the bare minimum.<eos> I go above and beyond.<eos> Try it sometime.<eos> You're hunting them.
And take it personally.<eos> I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow.<eos> However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard.<eos> But do not worry.<eos> I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out.
Ain't nobody got time for that.<eos> The chances of you being bit by a shark are, like, .0001%.<eos> Not if you're black.<eos> Sharks are racist as hell.<eos> That's why they call them "great whites."
I spend 90% of my day on empty gestures, Ted.<eos> Every once in a while, I have to do something that actually has meaning.<eos> Listen. I know I'm a sinner.<eos> I have many flaws.<eos> I make no apologies for most of them.
- No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Sounded pretty good to me.<eos> I'm singing into the notes, not through them, but I'll get it.
To double what it is now.<eos> What?<eos> They're talking about cutting academics so we can chase a ball around?<eos> Thin twins for the win!<eos> Vote for them, you guys.
Orson, I understand you're shocked, but please talk to me.<eos> I am shocked.<eos> You agree help cover up Carlos' crime, and then they just abandon you?<eos> How can your friends do that?<eos> You're angry at them?
Come on, man.<eos> You've been in there for, like, 45 minutes.<eos> What's taking so long? Almost there.<eos> Just deciding on the right shoes to go with the outfit.<eos> Buddy, we're going to the bar to meet women, not turn into them.
I don't want roots.<eos> And the roots are rotting anyway.<eos> - Rotting? - Mm.<eos> The tree roots...<eos> they're rotting underground and all the trees are gonna fall down unless I spend $40,000 on them.
"Jugni treads along the path of love"<eos> "She fears betrayal"<eos> Our future may seem uncertain<eos> All those wedding vows.<eos> Not that I believe in them.
Okay, so Lance, I'm setting up your profile.<eos> Ooh, philosophy.<eos> What's your philosophy of life?<eos> What do you think it is?<eos> When life presents obstacles, I skip over them and jump as high as I can.
Sorry.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> Nature is throwing me a bone.<eos> Haverford playbook move number two--<eos> "ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain."
You're not a bad man.<eos> Stop looking!<eos> I am breaking Matthew 5:28 all over the place.<eos> I mean, look at those legs.<eos> Yes, look at them!
If he doesn't, it's on homicide.<eos> It's on him.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I gave him the Seals casings.<eos> He signed for them.
So how would I like to get up and clear a shitty, rancid, disease-hole of a drain or would I rather just stay in bed?<eos> You have no faith in humanity, Jerry. Devil's advocate.<eos> It will turn political and it will turn on you.<eos> You sound to me more like the devil's best friend.<eos> It's my job to spot the traps and pitfalls, name them, shine a big light on them so that you, Mr Mayor, can step right around them.
( Crying ) Okay.<eos> I have only been your mother for a few months, and I just...<eos> That's okay.<eos> I should have talked with Regina.<eos> My mom only knows where the landmines are because she stepped on them all.
Or we could go for a drive.<eos> Or I could rip your spine out with a finishing move.<eos> Well, if you ever feel like hanging out, here's my number.<eos> You've got really soft hands.<eos> I sleep with socks filled with lotion on them.
Wait, wait!<eos> I thought they would roar like Solomon the Lion.<eos> No, tigers and lions are very different.<eos> Tigers don't growl or roar, they chuff. Like...<eos> When you chuff at them, they chuff back, see?
For Pina, the elements were very important.<eos> Whether sand or soil, stones or water...<eos> Somehow, even icebergs and rocks appeared on stage.<eos> When we dance, they become... obstacles.<eos> You have to go against or through them, or climb over them...
And now everyone in the region thinks he's a lunatic thanks to your letters to the newspapers.<eos> Well now, George, your father's clearly a sensible and educated man and I have tremendous respect for him, but that doesn't mean I believe every letter that comes to my desk...<eos> You mean you don't want to believe!<eos> I think Mr. Fort was right about you.<eos> Look, it's my job to study old legends, not to believe in them!
Oh. How about the Verite Cabernet?<eos> Isn't Cabernet really grapey?<eos> I mean, I like grapey, but not overly grapey.<eos> Did you go over the index cards?<eos> I glanced at them, yes.
Well, don't settle for anything less than the gold standard, as in...<eos> Booster Gold!<eos> I appreciate the thought, but you have to stop it.<eos> The all-new, all-different Clark would not be sending me roses.<eos> He's allergic to them, remember?
I didn't think that was prudent.<eos> I don't want them to go missing too.<eos> I need your help, Terry.<eos> I need to see a copy of those files.<eos> Will you at least look at them and then look me in the eye and tell me you think there's nothing going on?
Something's wrong.<eos> Maybe they hit traffic.<eos> If Karina was tipped off, she would have called in reinforcements and cut off the roads.<eos> It's right out of the FSB playbook.<eos> We're going back for them.
The guitar is missing four strings.<eos> We believe those strings were used to tie Ron down.<eos> The knee pads were used to hold him down while he was choking on his wife's remains.<eos> I left these things back there at the house.<eos> And then you went back for them.
Well done.<eos> Family disagreements, territorial wrangling-- you handled them all superbly.<eos> And when the time comes, all of them shall owe you loyalty.<eos> But now you must apply yourself to your new powers.<eos> You asked for them, and yet you shy away from using them.
- How do I date you?<eos> - You don't, unless my father says you can.<eos> I need your help, Terry.<eos> I need to see a copy of those files.<eos> Will you at least look at them and then look me in the eye and tell me you think there's nothing going on?
I was gonna drop them at the toxic-materials pickup on Saturday.<eos> - You have the cans. - Yeah.<eos> Marla, you're awesome.<eos> - They're at my house.<eos> - You should go get them. - Go get them.
Not quite!<eos> Miss, you're gonna need to come with me--<eos> Dyson, please--<eos> Sheri saved these women from virtual slavery.<eos> Look at them!
Or a surprise handy in a movie theater.<eos> So wait, what exactly does a foot fetishist do?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Oh, God. Is he gonna lick my feet?<eos> Ooh, or rub his mister up against them?
Maybe the unsub works at the hospital?<eos> Even if she conned her way into a job, I doubt she'd last long enough to get close to patient files.<eos> We were off on our profile.<eos> She doesn't find her victims by chance like we thought.<eos> She hunts them.
I told you... Dennis has a very powerful aura.<eos> We want the names of every single one of those women.<eos> What does it matter what their names are?<eos> They're dead.<eos> It's not about them.
You think you can handle that?<eos> My apologies.<eos> I will bring you two eggs over medium.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, would you like me to spit on them in the kitchen or would you prefer tableside?
They wasn't gone, old man.<eos> They was sleeping.<eos> And they ain't sleeping no more.<eos> I miss girls.<eos> Not even talking to them. I never talked to them. Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
- Or a version of herself.<eos> She's mourning the loss of her own identity.<eos> What if she's older than these victims?<eos> Maybe they remind her of the person that she once was.<eos> And caring for them is like caring for herself. Piquerism.
Every one of those peaks is over 6,500 metres.<eos> What a spectacular sight.<eos> But it's incredible to think that, just a few tens of millions of years ago, those mountains were something very different.<eos> 'The Himalayas haven't always been mountains.'<eos> We can find clues to their true origin by looking at them more closely.
Babe, I don't know what he's like at work, but once you seen him reading Everybody Poops to Harrison, you realize he's a big softie.<eos> Just talk to him.<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> I have the personal effects of Jessica Morris.<eos> You asked for them.
What -- what's that?<eos> I went and bought the clothes from the boutique that you wanted the other day.<eos> I-I really don't want to talk about --<eos> I know.<eos> I just thought that we could look at them together.
You might want to get right in there.<eos> How did you film that?<eos> What do we have here?<eos> Oh, "Happy Easter."<eos> Now, my grandma used to make me little Easter eggs, and she used to put little daisies on them.
Figure out what you want, Matty, because I'm tired of being your secret.<eos> As I walked to my very public death, I couldn't help but wonder, did I just kill my private relationship with Matty Mckibben?<eos> J, you really put me over a barrel here.<eos> I am not comfortable with your additions.<eos> - I mean, look at them.
And then he'll play with his toy and his shovel.<eos> And then maybe he'll go on the swings for a little bit. It's easy.<eos> We just have to watch him.<eos> I don't know about the swings.<eos> Look at them.
The guys just want their wives to be themselves.<eos> Is that true, Jerry?<eos> Did you really like me the way I was?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you're always staring at them.
That's real good.<eos> (Vernon) And they have sand dunes in Wilmington.<eos> White, white sand dunes.<eos> Where it's the ocean in the distance there.<eos> And we're gonna run over them sand dunes and we're gonna run in the water.
What, with Kevin?<eos> When?<eos> Last night.<eos> He came over to help with the shearing.<eos> Some sheep got out and dad went after them.
We must try and keep a cool head.<eos> The problem is one of communication.<eos> Communication?<eos> These things are different, Cavor.<eos> Look at them.
Problem? No, it's just one of the bands is holding the leg in place, making it a little difficult to get around.<eos> Can you move the ultrasound up here?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Her uterine arteries are engorged. But the only way in is in between them.
You'll tell them, right?<eos> That I cooperated.<eos> You want to knowow I figured you out?<eos> Those toys.<eos> You take care of them.
Full of pride, these wandering eyes<eos> Eyes with wings<eos> Two crazy eyes<eos> Eyes with wings in the land of clouds and winds pluck the shining stars of precious dreams<eos> Oh look at them, the moon they steal!
Well, it is a small price to pay to finally get you out of the house.<eos> It's been three weeks since you and Chelsea broke up, and you need to move on.<eos> Says the guy who still carries around a naked picture of his ex-wife.<eos> Hey, I bought those boobs.<eos> I have a right to look at them once in a while. Damn.
Uh, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> Well... you're still young.<eos> Well, it wouldn't matter how old I am.<eos> Girls never notice me.<eos> Well, did it ever occur to you. That they might be waiting for you to notice them?
You stay standing.<eos> She gonged your gong!<eos> And, Grayson. Ah...<eos> And... cooking classes?<eos> We can take them together.
Well, I'm hoping to get some parenting tips.<eos> Sure.<eos> Cool. Like about diapers.<eos> What, like, uh, cloth or disposable?<eos> Is there any way around babies wearing them?
I'm sorry?<eos> They went to a fraternity party across the bay.<eos> What?<eos> And Kelsey actually got really drunk.<eos> Amber called from the party and I went and picked them up.
- What if he comes back?<eos> - He's a liar!<eos> Nothing but promises!<eos> What are you doing with Papa's things?<eos> - He asked for them.
- Maybe once a month?<eos> Mm, that sounds reasonable.<eos> Uh, w... what do you think, Carmen?<eos> Um, I guess.<eos> Look at them.
No.<eos> I'm not feeling at my best these days, dad.<eos> I don't want to get rejected.<eos> Henry, let women figure out why they won't sleep with you.<eos> Don't you do it for them.
Everybody but you.<eos> I haven't seen her in three days.<eos> I miss her so much.<eos> We don't miss our kids.<eos> We care for them, help them be their best selves and then we leave.
You did a 1:52.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Look at all the lids.<eos> Look at them.
Why would he even tell you something like that?<eos> Maybe I reminded him of you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I know. It looks harsh.<eos> We tried insulated gloves, but she shattered right through them.
I feel like throwin' it up<eos> Man, look at our cheerleaders, bro.<eos> They're like Heinz ketchup.<eos> Just terrible, sloppy.<eos> Look at them.
My friend has a dress you designed.<eos> She guards it like a treasure.<eos> - You make nice things.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - But I can't really afford them.
It's Rebecca kelly, and you died in 1968.<eos> You've been haunting the girls here ever since.<eos> Please,I want to help you.<eos> Just tell me what happened.<eos> It's all because of them.
Eli Scruggs, quietly, with no fuss, had a heart attack and died.<eos> And, most importantly, without leaving a mess.<eos> It took an hour for someone to finally notice the body laying atop Susan Mayer's roof.<eos> It was less than 10 minutes later that the neighbours began arriving, each determined to get a look at the various paramedics and policemen who were all frantically trying to figure out exactly how to bring the body down.<eos> And it took two days for my friends to realise this tragedy had affected them...
How would you feel if you seized every time you went into the operating room?<eos> Yeah, OK.<eos> You realise, as your doctor, I'm not recommending this, right?<eos> I need to get through my surgeries today.<eos> You're gonna get through them, just hurt later.
The alternative won't make for a very pleasant memory.<eos> Oh, and I hear that poison is really not that bad.<eos> You really like those olives, don't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe I just like how I look reaching for them.
We don't have a lot of time. I think you can beat these girls if you switch your defense to a full-court press.<eos> These girls, they're healthy, you know?<eos> They're tall and healthy, but they're not good ball handlers.<eos> I want two defenders on the ball at all times.<eos> Keep them flustered, and they'll lose their cool.
Curious.<eos> The instructions refer to the recruit.<eos> The author of the manuscript uses the same term.<eos> "Many warriors of the inevitable confrontation are among us now but before they can be considered soldiers they must be regarded as recruits and the expectation must be that they shall be unwilling."<eos> So I'm supposed to just turn these lights off by looking at them?
Man my post.<eos> Don't let this one in.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sarah, listen to me.<eos> Uh, Chuck forgot the rings, so he-he went home to go get them.
I'm never hurt.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I just want to help you, that's all.<eos> You want to help me?<eos> Go back to those stands, and anytime one of those crazy bitches checks me or one of my girls, yell at them.
Serial numbers?<eos> Clean as a whistle.<eos> Which makes no sense, if you think about it.<eos> Whistles are nasty.<eos> Coaches blowing into them, spitting germs everywhere.
- Rightly cards?<eos> - Absolutely right.<eos> - What do you say, Howard?<eos> - Absolutely right.<eos> The first two yellow cards of the game have gone for two teams, and one for each team of them.
You can talk to him tomorrow.<eos> Serena.<eos> You came.<eos> I'm sorry for the things that I said to you at the wedding.<eos> I deserved them.
Our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations that the victims visited prior to their death.<eos> These are high-class establishments.<eos> We're going to want to visit the same places.<eos> So, look for men who fit the profile, but also women who match victimology.<eos> If somebody's been paying a little too much attention to them, talk to them.
From Torrence.<eos> How did those girls survive?<eos> Maybe they were too small and the triffids had easier prey.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I promised to look after them.
You just have to imagine the changes that would happen here in three weeks and if that was all joined together and one frame the plant might be there and you take a shot of it an hour later and, if the wind's blowing, it's over here somewhere and then you join those two shots together...<eos> It just won't work.<eos> So what we've got to do is not only have we got to produce a move that is exactly the same repeatable move, a track that can be built exactly the same again in a studio.<eos> Build exact models of every object in here so we can put plants in the right places and then time everything,<eos> - so they grow just as the camera happens to be pointing at them.
Draco you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?<eos> I've done things that would shock you.<eos> Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?<eos> Replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?<eos> Forgive me, Draco. I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak your heart can't really have been in them.
Now he should begin to circle around the flock.<eos> Why is he going that way? .<eos> Oh, he's circling them.<eos> Do you see the difference between the two dogs? .<eos> Where Joe is calm and can move the sheep by eyeing them your dog is struggling.
No more favors.<eos> They say a picture's worth a thousand words.<eos> Add in a few hundred that survive the censor's black pen, suddenly, you've really got something.<eos> There's the negatives.<eos> You earned them.
Listen... my brother... my brother, he made some big mistakes.<eos> Big mistakes.<eos> But every night my father would come into his room and say, "tomorrow brings another day."<eos> Do you understand that, Harry?<eos> We've all done... bad things, but tomorrow... you can always try to make up for them.
Good.<eos> So now that I've given you your babies and your Xerox machine, should I throw in a couple of elephants?<eos> I don't want there to be any excuse when you can't bring in Martinson's Coffee.<eos> Don't get worked up.<eos> You know, there are other ways to think of things than the way you think of them.
An unredeemable sin.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> No reason...<eos> Dykes are perverts.<eos> Watch out for them.
Gus.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are those meat balls from craft service?<eos> Yes, Kelly knows they are my favorite.<eos> Usually I hunger for her meat balls the way a Jackal Salivates for an injured possum... but Sadly, I have no appetite for them now.
- Okay, I'm excited to see what you got.<eos> Should I turn off the lights?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, gosh.<eos> Look at them.
Choose.<eos> Place of business.<eos> GATE allows us to find the pathway to personal freedom.<eos> Define our boundaries.<eos> See past them.
And, when they hang out with someone who's got it all figured out... someone like you... it bums them out.<eos> It takes away their woo.<eos> You're just saying that so I don't feel like an old married lady.<eos> Look at those girls, Lily.<eos> Look at them and listen to what their woo's are really saying.
how are the women doing?<eos> i believe they're doing well.<eos> it's a tough transition for them.<eos> yes, i know.<eos> - you taking care of them?
You were holding out On us, dragan.<eos> I will take all of the girls as payment.<eos> that's too far.<eos> These girls are mine.<eos> If you want to drop out This deal over them, do it!
They're getting a new TV, bunk beds...<eos> I'll have it ready by the time you get here next weekend.<eos> Next weekend, Carlos and I have plans.<eos> Well, I'll bet the girls don't.<eos> I'll send a car for them.
Oh, great.<eos> I have to say, i am really excited.<eos> So am i.<eos> I do have a few changes to go through,<eos> But don't worry, i'll walk you through them.
You've got lovely normal breasts.<eos> Hm, normal.<eos> Do you want some?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> See I look at them now and I think what I said to you.
You think I don't know that?<eos> I love adam, mac!<eos> But passing on those automated work stations-- That keeps our lab a year behind in the technology.<eos> Let's say we wait.<eos> Who's to say sinclair will actually Pay for them in six months?
For example, we wouldn't be able to see.<eos> Our eyes wouldn't work the same way.<eos> In a universe where light moved at the same speed... through all materials... we would know little of the world around us... seeing only vague blobs of dark and light.<eos> That's because our eyes depend on biological lenses... to focus images on our retinas.<eos> Just like lenses made of glass... they work because light slows down as it passes through them.
Love.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> Plastic surgery, the works.<eos> Here, here, here...<eos> When my husband first saw my new breasts, he literally pounced on them!
Oh, sweet.<eos> - Good job. - Thanks, man.<eos> Perfect timing, Bolton.<eos> We weren't just given these lockers.<eos> We had to earn them. Right.
No!<eos> Count Friedrich will take you as far as the coast.<eos> I can't thank you enough for all your help, Stephen.<eos> Yes, you can. The families of the men that died.<eos> - We'll look after them.
And for all you know, this is really important.<eos> Stop it!<eos> That hurts, right?<eos> Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this.<eos> You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb, because your bones have formed abnormally, thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.
Sorry.<eos> Ok. so that's one type.<eos> What's type 2?<eos> the adaptive satanist is the one you have to worry about.<eos> the typical serial killer Rationalizing his fantasies by blaming them on outside forces.
A philosopher once asked,<eos> "Are we human because we gaze at the stars, "or do we gaze at them because we are human?"
I know, I know.<eos> I impressed the great beauty of your gift upon her and she finally gave in.<eos> Do you think she would like this?<eos> You've chosen the correct path to her heart.<eos> Above all, women adore when we spend money on them.
Give it to me!<eos> Hurry!<eos> The less they find. The shorter the sentence!<eos> There are two more trays!<eos> Go get them!
Listen, let's booze up after the concert.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> This is just the time now to rake in good money.<eos> Take me, I come to Nenets... and get ten deer fells for a case of spirit.<eos> And here I have a dude who pays me loads for them!
Just misunderstood. She cared about you more than she should've.<eos> She was... special.<eos> She had an ability?<eos> What was it? Suffice it to say, she learned how to use it wisely.<eos> Not everyone who has these abilities deserves them.
The dead girls in the leaves.<eos> Reid, we've seen worse.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we've seen worse, but... For the first time, I know.<eos> I look at them, and...
I left them inside.<eos> Dude...<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Uh... relax.<eos> I'll go get them.
You're a fugitive?<eos> That's the least of my problems.<eos> So the Federal agent's been bitten?<eos> No, she's the biter.<eos> She's turning initial victims into lichens and her partner, also FBI is hunting them down for fun.
Thank you.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> Make it right.<eos> Walls, they're everywhere.<eos> They define us, limit us, we can try to go around them, break through them or give up and let them close us in.
You teach them to beg.<eos> How many bullshit souvenirs does one guy need, anyway?<eos> Then you develop this glazed-eye stare.<eos> You know, you walk straight.<eos> You don't look at them.
- Yeah, already did.<eos> - What are we looking at?<eos> - Okay so these are the structures for the three HIV proteins that drugs know how to fight.<eos> Target it here, here and here.<eos> The drugs basically know how to see these pockets - and they click into them.
Just wanted some air.<eos> It was late.<eos> I was home by myself, and.. I was worried whether or not we were going to have a pop quiz in algebra.<eos> We live pretty far out of town, so you.. You can see the stars.<eos> I was just starin' at them.
Paris.<eos> Has history taught you nothing?<eos> You're in limbo, sister, no man's land, quite literally.<eos> Logan is not that bright. You need to spell it out for him.<eos> He's got to know where the red lines are, or he's gonna leap right over them and into bed with multiple british floozies.
Both those women are in their 30s.<eos> They were raped about 5 days apart.<eos> Where have the new attacks taken place ?<eos> Opposite ends of the city.<eos> He was waiting for them when they got home.
- Okay, look. - I know that's hard to believe.<eos> - You know what? It's really not.<eos> So, what do you need?<eos> I mean, aside from the touching.<eos> If I could just... watch them?
Her brothers couldn't get to him, so they came for me.<eos> I was taken from a cafe, in front of my children, tortured.<eos> I thought they will kill me, but they just wanted to make me suffer, like their sister suffered.<eos> You know, every night in prison I closed my eyes and I dreamed of my bride's perfect sweater puppies.<eos> Now look at them.
It'll be weird having two writers as parents.<eos> Yeah, well, Dad influenced her.<eos> She never wrote before she met him.<eos> I haven't read any of Dad's books.<eos> I've looked at them.
It won't help you see them, but it'll let you know when they're nearby.<eos> They live almost exclusively in the dark.<eos> Sunlight is lethal in large doses But only certain light frequencies can hurt them..<eos> These lamps have been set to an effective frequency.<eos> But for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin.Cuts right through them.
I told you.<eos> You know, when McDonald's says 13 billion served... it's not that much. 0nly 43 visits per person, per year... which is once every 8,49... days.<eos> It turns out you can't control people... or even predict them.<eos> But numbers are different.<eos> As I use to say, you can count on them.
- Oh, great.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Are those puppies?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at them.
And I don't care, and...<eos> I'm just fed up, and I can't be here so I called you, because I knew you...<eos> Knew you'd understand.<eos> You know what I like most about the stars?<eos> You look at them, at all of them up there and you just know there's gotta be something more than...
- Caveh, you can tell me anything.<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> - Sometimes when we're having sex... - Yeah? ...I fantasize about other women.<eos> Christa was devastated by my confession and became hyper-sensitive about other women.<eos> She would notice them even before I would and immediately scrutinize my face for any sign of interest.
Velvet and silk has arrived from across the border. Better catch some sleep.<eos> Uncle Jeevraj, it has been 8 months... of the new bride arriving in this house... and you never visited even once.<eos> Greetings, Kisan. - Greetings, Jeevraj kaka. So long no see!<eos> Hope everything is fine. What to say?<eos> I have brought such beautiful bangles for the new bride... that you won't stop looking at them.
Back in college, there was a very pretty freshman girl in our school club.<eos> You know how guys are,<eos> - We only paid attention to her.<eos> - So what happened?<eos> So all the other girls in the club became jealous, and they all decided to quit the club. But this guy bought the other girls lunch, took them to the movies, wrote reports for them...
- Okay.<eos> So I was at lunch with some of the girls, and I started sniffing around, just casually asking if anyone had any funny stories about Constance. You sly fox!<eos> So, one of the girls tells me that about three months ago, she was in the office with Constance, and as Constance was heading out for lunch, she stumbled and dropped her purse, and her Altoids box popped open spilling out enough funny-looking pills to fill a pharmacy. Constance claimed that they were all vitamins.<eos> Julia didn't buy it, because the minute the pills spilled out,<eos> Constance threw herself on top of them to cover them up.
Oh, you mean bizarro like messing with Lucas and then hiding all those letters under your bed?<eos> Hey, check it out -- catfight.<eos> What were you doing snooping through my things? !<eos> I wasn't snooping through your things.<eos> I bumped into them when I was trying to maximize on the 2 feet of storage space that you so generously offered to me.
Fortunately, I keep a box of 'em in my car.<eos> Tom is two hours late.<eos> These women are gonna rip this place apart.<eos> We've gotta think of some way to distract them.<eos> What do you want me to do, throw a ham at them ?
- What's all that about?<eos> - Well, let's just say I was a big hit with the ladies.<eos> You're in his fantasy, Carol, tread carefully.<eos> But you weren't, were you?<eos> You couldn't even talk to women so you stalked them and attacked them.
But now, without any more work from her, her young will have all the food it needs to develop into an adult.<eos> Underground nests are certainly among the best protected of all insect nurseries and, indeed, they are very difficult for parasites to break into.<eos> Ants defend their colonies against intruders with great ferocity.<eos> And yet, here in this meadow in central Europe, there are ants' nests where intruders live undetected.<eos> This is the caterpillar... of the blue butterfly and it's lived in this nest undetected and protected by the ants and fed by them for the last two years.
This is produced from nectar which the bees industriously collect from flowers.<eos> They systematically expose it to the air so that the water it contains evaporates and the nectar becomes sweeter and thicker.<eos> Eventually it turns into honey.<eos> The combs in which they store it are continuously guarded by the covering of bees.<eos> They cling so thickly that it might seem that nothing could get past them.
You're not invulnerable.<eos> I can repair your body, but I can't protect your mind.<eos> Why not?<eos> You can see all my thoughts so...<eos> You should be able to secure them.
I mean, I got... my whole office here is wondering what's happening.<eos> You come in with that jacket, it embarrasses the hell out of all of us. And this? It's a fucking cartoon.<eos> It's an old article. It's four years old. And you're asking me questions about an old article with a silly cartoon?<eos> And you haven't spoken to DC. Are we, um... are we waiting on your lawyers?<eos> I never have lawyers in the office when I'm talking to regulators for two reasons. One, I'm not doing anything wrong. Two, I know the rules better than most because I drafted a majority of them.
But first, the work of the lord, then the work of man, alright?<eos> Hit the button.<eos> And just as soon as that there sun shines down with its warmth and light on all things equally, so too will guilt enwrap you like a plague.<eos> And drown you in sorrow.<eos> Now, when we imagine things, we start creating them in our mind.
I forgive you.<eos> Please, please!<eos> It does a body good to let the healing waters flow.<eos> Those are your tears, Mackenzie.<eos> We've been collecting them for a long time.
- Let it go!<eos> - Well, it isn't settled yet.<eos> What's up, bro?<eos> Come over here.<eos> Your pockets were empty, I filled them.
Everything's about Sherlock.<eos> 'How did you know my kitchen was tiny? '<eos> Well, look, the fading pattern on the paper, it's not much, but it's enough to know your kitchen window faces east.<eos> Now, kitchen noticeboards.<eos> By instinct, you place them at eye level, where there's natural light.
I'm Mija.<eos> This is Okja.<eos> We are animal lovers.<eos> labs.<eos> We tear down cages and set them free.
I know, baby.<eos> Me, too.<eos> At least he gave me the coins.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He must've left them out there for me to find.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey, where've you been?<eos> - Mae.<eos> I've seen your cameras aren't working.<eos> I can send Tech out... Yeah. Yeah, we disconnected them.
It's sort of like eating a bag of chips, you know?<eos> It's never gonna actually make you full, and at the end you're sick, but you want to go back for more.<eos> You want more chips.<eos> - Murder is chips.<eos> - Okay, you know what, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I'm gonna find these tapes, and I'm gonna destroy them.
Okay, look, well, usually, we're a pretty reasonable crew.<eos> - Yeah, right?<eos> I mean...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ...we have our differences, but we settle them in house.
Can you answer me that?<eos> You broke every rule!<eos> You just embarrassed me.<eos> We have these rules.<eos> We've gone over them a hundred times!
Hey!<eos> - Where is Diana?<eos> - We are on our own. - What?<eos> - What did you see, Charlie?<eos> Seems like a bunch of gas pumps... but I can't see where they're taking them.
- Please!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Hands where I can see them!
They have knives and ropes.<eos> If you have any sense...<eos> People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.
Fucking nuthouse.<eos> Fucking nuthouse.<eos> I better do that.<eos> What'd you want me to do with the crates?<eos> Just leave them. I'll throw the linens on them in the morning.
What are those pills?<eos> They're just for in case, you know, the day comes.<eos> Not that it's coming any time soon, but I just have them.<eos> You are 16 years old.<eos> Where did you get them?
Mother south is dead.<eos> No.<eos> She is alive.<eos> I saw young witches.<eos> Only she can make them.
After what you saw?<eos> You were protecting those girls.<eos> And you risked your life for them.<eos> Why?<eos> The tunnel in nimbo would have brought them to glinda.
I left her behind.<eos> I made her feel safe, and I left her.<eos> That's how I killed all my sisters.<eos> I took away their fear.<eos> I gave them milk of the poppy to make them forget their pain, and then I sent them out to fight.
How else was I supposed to win the war?<eos> You cannot kill those girls.<eos> They're not girls. They're the beast forever.<eos> They're just doing what glinda tells them to do.<eos> Then I'll shoot them right out of the sky!
I must say, I'm becoming very concerned about your lack of progress, and for the safety of your wife.<eos> Brinn told me you threw out your medication, replaced it with ibuprofen.<eos> Migraines got worse and my dreams got more vivid.<eos> Gabriel, you didn't take the pills.<eos> You threw them out.
Yeah, I'm just looking for my camera.<eos> It's right here.<eos> Have you got the keys?<eos> I'm gonna put the bags in the trunk real quick. Okay.<eos> Uh, yeah. They are in here somewhere. It's just a matter of finding them.
So, it does just record a memory?<eos> It's pretty fucked up what happened today, huh? With Lacey?<eos> She spoke out of turn.<eos> And she knew the rules.<eos> She basically helped write them.
Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.<eos> Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,
I wanted to honor that.<eos> But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.<eos> There are 14 audio files on there.<eos> You should listen to them in order.<eos> I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.
But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.<eos> There are 14 audio files on there.<eos> You should listen to them in order.<eos> I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.<eos> But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.
There are tapes.<eos> Hannah recorded tapes.<eos> She talked about what happened to her.<eos> And where are these tapes now?<eos> Last I heard, Clay Jensen had them.
Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right?<eos> With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank!<eos> And we can go break him out of prison!<eos> Look at these dead flies!<eos> Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.
How about you just give me back my stamp and we'll call it square.<eos> No, I'm talking to my brother.<eos> Look, you are lucky I don't sue.<eos> I mean, a legal document which delineates things.<eos> Bequeaths them to specific parties.
Am I gonna be needing that robe anytime soon?<eos> She said it was a light month.<eos> Full of shit.<eos> Talked to Morgan.<eos> She's got so many overflow cases, she's sending them to traffic court.
I can drop you at Plaza Palau, where I'm going.<eos> Don't ask me to go any further. No, no.<eos> In the back with the sheep.<eos> Fine.<eos> I like them more than people.
It never did.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> - It's true.<eos> Three decades of sanctions were killing us.<eos> We had to find a way to get them lifted.
I'm gonna have to talk to Saul.<eos> There will be a pardon for him, down the line.<eos> I still have to talk to him.<eos> Your parking pass is in the envelope, along with the parking rules, which are, let's say, complicated.<eos> Read them, or you'll get towed.
Or was he always this-this insane?<eos> He was desperate.<eos> Not that I'm justifying what he did. I'm-I'm not, but...<eos> Desperation can make you do terrible things.<eos> And it can make you keep them from the people you love because because you don't want them to see that part of you.
She was here in '61, but since then...<eos> I've called the Land Registry, sir, to see who owns the property now.<eos> Looks to be patient records.<eos> Hundreds of the bloody things.<eos> Better go through them. See if any of the names ring a bell.
Yo, if she shoot this guy, we gonna get guard brains all over us.<eos> Ew. No, these are my good pants.<eos> - That's what I'm saying. - I had frogs when I was a kid.<eos> We lived by a creek.<eos> We used to scoop them up into buckets...
"for other people no matter what it costs them. "Somebody who's taught me "about the kind of person I want to be.<eos> Miss Frances Houseman."<eos> Oh, Your Majesty.<eos> The crowns of Fillory are yours.<eos> So I guess we just put them on.
Doesn't make him innocent.<eos> I mean, I'm sure Norman Bates was nice, at least when it came to his mother.<eos> Besides, I mean, look at our board.<eos> Look at the killer's M.O.<eos> First, he kills his victims as humanely as possible, takes care of them for six months, and then brutally kills them again.

Put these plates in.<eos> I'm good.<eos> You're not a SEAL anymore, Taggart, so you follow orders.<eos> And orders say we're supposed to look like we know what we're doing.<eos> Put them in.
Yay to discharge day!<eos> Okay, that sounds grosser out loud than it did in my head.<eos> Uh, yay to getting out of here finally, is what I mean.<eos> I brought some options.<eos> Although I think I need to see them on to know which one looks best.
You hurt them, next time we meet, I'll do this to you.<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> Blood under the bridge.<eos> I promise I will not kill these ladies.<eos> We'll free them once you're gone.
So much for simple answers. Look, it, um...<eos> It might be simpler than you think.<eos> We are trained so fiercely to believe that... emotions cloud our judgment.<eos> But... I believe that emotions give us power.<eos> And when we suppress them, we are all the weaker for it.
Lian Yu is the simplest answer.<eos> It's good to see you thinking about the future.<eos> I only wish I had more time to spend with this Oliver Queen.<eos> You have 48 hours.<eos> I know just how to spend them.
Oliver and Felicity might suffocate.<eos> How can you be so glib?<eos> You've met me, right, and how come your toy balls can't float down there and do this for us?<eos> For the thousandth time, Rene, they're called T-spheres, but if you want, call them by their proper name.<eos> You named them?
I don't know if this counts, but it could help.<eos> Where the hell did you get this?<eos> Argus likes to keep tabs on interesting tech.<eos> You copied my T-sphere? No.<eos> We improved them.
We made a discovery on Phoebe.<eos> An extra-solar lifeform.<eos> We found your lab notes on the Anubis.<eos> Maybe you can appreciate what it is.<eos> An organism that can repurpose other life forms and use them to evolve.
You are my sister.<eos> You're the only Stark in Winterfell.<eos> Until I return, the North is yours.<eos> I delivered his bones myself.<eos> Presented them to Lady Catelyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.
And so you left.<eos> I hid in my parents' room.<eos> My father was supposed to be buried in a pair of cufflinks that I'd bought him for his birthday the year before.<eos> He always said they were his favorite.<eos> But when it came time to give them up I couldn't let them go.
Thank you.<eos> Great.<eos> Um, how exactly is this gonna help Cisco vibe any differently?<eos> Simple science.<eos> We just broaden the overall harmonic resonance of Cisco's vibrational frequencies all while focusing them on a fixed temporal locus.
The real one went over something called wickery bridge in 1992.<eos> Anyway, I have spent the last three weeks sending people into that river to look for that bell, and they haven't found a thing... but I know it still exists, because it can't be destroyed.<eos> That's not ominous.<eos> Blame the witches.<eos> No wonder people found them so annoying.
You may never win a beauty pageant again, but here's a little consolation prize.<eos> Whatever that is.<eos> You can go now.<eos> I know you're not gonna want to see this.<eos> You let them go.
Evil people and murderers.<eos> These girls are innocent, Stefan.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Such exemplary young women.<eos> They have no idea that the world is out to crush them.
That could've changed everything for me.<eos> The Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork, those things fit together to make the hammer that swings inside a bell.<eos> When properly assembled, this bell becomes, like, a mystical<eos> - super-bell.<eos> - You let them go.
Man, were they hot?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you're into cannibal divas.<eos> I think I am.<eos> But the second you stop feeding them evil people, things get ugly.
Uh, at the Armory.<eos> Hey, listen, uh, I was thinking, maybe we could, I don't know, come by and meet you at the house tonight.<eos> Oh, my God, Ric, come by and meet you that would be just amazing.<eos> I could really uses something good in my life right now.<eos> But are you sure you want to bring them to town?
Look around.<eos> We are in the hotbed of supernatural energy, with the artifacts and books and talismans and the God knows what else.<eos> I mean, witches literally eat that up.<eos> They siphon it without trying.<eos> So the girls' magic is going haywire because we brought them to the Armory?
Yeah, well, you and I both know that Katherine would smell a rat if they weren't there. So...<eos> Stefan called in a favor from Valerie.<eos> It turns out she has a soft spot for Gemini twins.<eos> She put a protection spell on them, so they'll be safe no matter what.<eos> Thank you for bringing them.
It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.<eos> - Your girls need you.<eos> - They have you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just... Come on. Get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there.
"Standoffish" refers to a person who, for various reasons, is not associating with others.<eos> It is a word which might describe somebody who, during a party, might stand in a corner instead of talking to another person.<eos> Gustav?<eos> Jacquelyn here.<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.
For instance... in my own lonely room, I have... gathered a collection of things which are important to me, including all of my notes on the Baudelaire orphans, a few crucial objects that I have gathered in my travels<eos> and... a blurry photograph... taken a long time ago, of a woman named Beatrice, which I look at from time to time while writing this account from across what was once a prominent theater, no more able to help the Baudelaires<eos> If we had kerosene, we could make Molotov cocktails with those old wine bottles.<eos> - What are Molotov cocktails? - They're small bombs.<eos> If we throw them out the window, we could attract attention.
Jesus!<eos> I have a problem... lice.<eos> You've got lice?<eos> No, no.<eos> I was checking bed 5 for concussion, and I saw them.
- No, you're not.<eos> - I'm not trying to buy them.<eos> Just gonna give it to 'em.<eos> Most of it.<eos> See them once more, and then I'll just--
Then what?<eos> Are you gonna threaten me?<eos> Break my legs?<eos> You get me those pills, and I'm gonna pay you $20,000.<eos> Get them.
I need to see Dr. Cruz as soon as possible.<eos> The man killed for helping the truck driver.<eos> You are trying to correct something which cannot be corrected.<eos> Hector wants to use my dad's business.<eos> If you manage to pull this off and switch those pills, switch them back.
Did she already say something?<eos> I just want you to know, I was not unkind, though I was quite firm.<eos> Well, what are you talking about?<eos> Your daughter was corrupting my twins.<eos> I caught them smoking.
Warner wants to see you.<eos> Yeah, why does that sound like a relief?<eos> Here.<eos> Sinatra's changes.<eos> Just put them in some kind of order.
What happened?<eos> Dumont, what happened?<eos> Give me eyes.<eos> One of our own...<eos> Tom Keen... has stolen senior-level secrets and intends to make them public.
Well, hold on now.<eos> When the police arrived, Larry was wearing his roller skates, but push in here.<eos> There's a bloody print on the wall across the room.<eos> But the skate marks end here.<eos> So, either Larry killed her, took off his skates, walked across the room, then put them back on and skated through her blood...
On the floor. Go.<eos> Go on the floor!<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Hands where I can see them.
We need to make sure this is very, very quiet.<eos> This is a Senior Iranian Quds Force Operative, which means we were never on the Mount Pleasant campus and this never happened.<eos> Cover the stairs and the door.<eos> Step away, please.<eos> Your hands, so I can see them.
Or we can go to Principal Weatherbee.<eos> About the coach's son? Who is captain of the football team, and Riverdale High's resident golden boy?<eos> Or I can expose him in the pages of the Blue and Gold.<eos> Yeah, I can do that! No. Spoken like a true good girl who always follows the rules.<eos> Well, I don't follow rules, I make them, and when necessary, I break them.
That's the real question.<eos> What exactly you expect to get out of this experience.<eos> Short version.<eos> I just want to hear you guys play my songs.<eos> Making them better.
It is so you, Ethel.<eos> Ronnie, I can't take all this.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> These things...<eos> My dad gave them to me.
Well, must've been tired.<eos> Must've been.<eos> Can't imagine why.<eos> Why do you have my dresses?<eos> Because you've had them forever, mother, For years, and look... Still the same old dresses.
Get rid of 'em.<eos> I'm gonna go online and order a bunch of new clothes.<eos> Dead or not, I can't be prancing around the house naked.<eos> You don't like your old dresses anymore?<eos> Make up your mind. Do I like them, or do I not like them?
Yeah.<eos> I was just cl... i've been cleaning out the house, Just trying to get rid of a bunch of old stuff, And...<eos> This is gonna sound really weird, But I was just about to donate a bunch of my mother's dresses, And I've got no use for them anymore.<eos> But I just felt bad putting them in the bin, And so I wondered if I could give them to you.<eos> I... i just feel like you'd. Take care of them and wear them, Like they wouldn't be something unanimated anymore.
I do a lot of yoga.<eos> We can pick up where we left off.<eos> No, I...<eos> - I'm just gonna go.<eos> - These visions will keep coming unless you can remember how to control them.
An offer to buy it.<eos> I've accepted.<eos> I just need you to review these terms.<eos> I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.<eos> We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Sounds good.<eos> Yeah, just noodling.<eos> Wish my noodling sounded that good.<eos> So at the trial... I never believed those things I said.<eos> And I said them anyway.
But it's like I can't help it.<eos> 'Cause that horror, it's just right there at the surface.<eos> And I don't want them to feel that.<eos> And I don't want them to think I'm feeling it.<eos> So I write songs and I sing them, 'cause that's the only way I know how to deal with this pain that I carry inside me.
And you play the hell out of it.<eos> But you couldn't run highway 65.<eos> Not on your very best day.<eos> And, of course, you love the girls, absolutely.<eos> But are you ready to raise them by yourself, without Rayna?
- Be right there.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> These girls are going through hell.<eos> Anybody can see that.<eos> It's hard enough on 'em as it is without all this crap we're putting them through.
But, hey, this is private property.<eos> That's stealing.<eos> You can't steal what's already stolen.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - This guy takes in stolen goods and sells them to the highest bidder, so it's like we're hurting the bad guys.
- So send 'em over.<eos> - Great!<eos> That's awesome.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> I mean, honestly, I can just send them to you.
I was 14.<eos> I spent a year in a body brace.<eos> Kids at school would call me The Bride of Frankenstein.<eos> They'd throw my books on the floor.<eos> And watch me struggle because they'd know how hard it would be for me to be able to pick them up.
The sheets still had his smell, and I used to wrap them around a pillow and pretend I was holding him.<eos> My mom... put all of Dawn's things in a... storage as soon as she died.<eos> In a box.<eos> No, she can't do that.<eos> You have to tell her to take them out again.
But the only idea you've had was postponing until after the inauguration.<eos> I'm talking the fun stuff, like shooting rats between dinner courses.<eos> Ah, see?<eos> My notes.<eos> Right where I left them.
Making them guess your true feelings?<eos> Wear this tiara and continue on our fairy tale.<eos> Three offices on the left, two on the right.<eos> Kitchenette's here. And then there's this.<eos> I know there are cracks in the glass, but I think, with a little coaxing, the landlord would be willing to replace them.
Not fast enough for what?<eos> Remember the Rosetta thing I asked for for my birthday?<eos> Language lessons?<eos> They were a little too expensive.<eos> I found them online for free, only it takes forever to download.
Every conviction my office has ever made would be in question. No.<eos> Well, you can't afford to think in absolutes.<eos> I'm gonna fight this all the way to a trial if it comes to it.<eos> Buddy, you gotta understand.<eos> One hundred and twenty seven cases, if you're found liable even for a portion of them, it could bankrupt you.
"I, Henry Tudor, King of England,<eos> "hereby, prohibit any English trade with Burgundy."<eos> There.<eos> That's for all the times that Yorkist duchess tried to catch me in her trap for Richard's executioner.<eos> You must decree the English Lords' reduce their guards, or they will form them into private armies and rise up at every tax you levy.
That might be a rumor, but no one can say it didn't happen, so who knows what that flower might inspire this time?<eos> Well, I'm just excited we all get to see it.<eos> Oh, Chief Sanders.<eos> Did we get those "Home of the Middleton Merriwick" stickers in yet?<eos> I'm picking them up from the printers.
We're asking questions, she's not answering them.<eos> Now she's calling Doug.<eos> Seems pretty last-resort if you ask me.<eos> No, you're being lazy.<eos> If you want answers, just beat them out of her.
- We have ants.<eos> - Ants?<eos> You know... [snarling]<eos> They don't look like that, but we have them.<eos> And you needed to spray for them at 2:45 in the morning?
I have an old bracelet with a Nazar on it, and I'm pretty sure we have all the herbs here.<eos> I'm gonna go check.<eos> What did you guys do with the books?<eos> I wanna find out as much as I can about Zerstoerer.<eos> In the cellar, we left them out and open.
That's for me to know.<eos> But if you ever wish for more, I'll comb the earth in search of them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Aunt Agatha, Drake's here, with a surprise!<eos> Uncle George hates toads. He had them all cleared from our pond.
Miss Chynoweth, if you had any idea of the agony he suffers whilst awaiting your answer.<eos> He is quite distraught and hardly knows what to do with himself.<eos> I thought you'd be wed by now.<eos> The delay is deuced awkward.<eos> A man has needs, and if they remain unfulfilled by a wife, he must satiate them elsewhere.
You said you weren't a homicidal maniac.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's a bully.<eos> And where I come from, bullies take desperate young girls like your daughter and force them into prostitution.
You know, when she was in bathroom, I got quite a good look at her.<eos> - You what?<eos> - Firuz joking.<eos> I don't have cameras in bathroom anymore.<eos> I had them taken out when you had the big hemorrhoid.
Wait, you were Captain of the Glee Club?<eos> The official title is Lieutenant Colonel, but that's cool you didn't know that.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, my God. You still had braces at 17.<eos> Actually, I had them again at 28.
You took a payout and you signed a non-disclosure agreement.<eos> That's got nothing to do with it.<eos> They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.
You don't understand.<eos> I was their supervisor, Mr. Ross.<eos> I was responsible for all those guys that got sick and I'm the one that got us the money that went with those NDAs.<eos> And let me guess:<eos> ever since you signed them, you haven't had a good night's sleep.
Look, I know this isn't exactly what we wanted, but I can still be the one to insist on an admission of guilt, so what's really going on here?<eos> I promised Rachel that if this thing got too risky I'd pull the plug, and it just got a hell of a lot riskier.<eos> Well, it also got real.<eos> Those miners need us.<eos> I'm not going to abandon them, so... what do you wanna do?
Rachel said that it went great.<eos> I thought it did, too, but then she called me and said that the next time she asks for a meeting with me and Harvey, she better get a goddamn meeting with me and Harvey instead of two nobodies.<eos> - What did you tell her?<eos> - I told her how dare she talk about my superstars like that.<eos> She's lucky to have them.
And from now on, every Minister and every member of my immediate family must be given a taster.<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> What of those social powders?<eos> Now banned, Sire.<eos> Anyone found selling them will be punished appropriately.
What are you doing?<eos> We'll get stuck.<eos> Drones will be here any second.<eos> Drones?<eos> Dwarfs, whatever. The Doctor invented them.
If more people see what you saw, maybe they'll fight back, too.<eos> how is she?<eos> No change.<eos> bakshi's exposι worked.<eos> You've found them?
No. No, no, no!<eos> She has Inhuman powers now? !<eos> Can we get a break, please?<eos> Can we get one break?<eos> ! Guess they weren't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them.
Zoe, got her out.<eos> She was the only one.<eos> Those guards at the school were not gonna let those women go.<eos> We think, they were, um, looking for fertile women.<eos> Gathering them up.
I couldn't compete, so they eliminated me, and it filled me with disdain, almost hate.<eos> Hate is nature's most perfect energy source.<eos> It's endlessly renewable.<eos> I don't want to lean into that feeling.<eos> You know the rider in the bicycle movie who, just when he has victory in sight, takes his hands off the bars and just holds them out like this, taking in the sun, gliding, letting all the other racers whiz by him just because?
Agreed. Agent Schott, have you found records of human dealings with these life forms?<eos> Uh, yes. Actually, lots.<eos> If you just take from it what you will, but between genies, djinn and leprechauns,<eos> I mean, humans have been documenting contact with reality-bending creatures for centuries.<eos> And how did they slay them?
Let me handle it. Oh, hey. So we're going to go non-lethal?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No. The DEO has some recovered alien artifacts in a sub-basement storeroom.<eos> Maybe one of them can send Mxyzptlk back to the Fifth Dimension, or at least suppress his powers.<eos> I'll have them brought up.
I know Mustique is an island.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what'd you do, Larry?<eos> I said, "What do you charge for the lemons?<eos> I'll squeeze them myself.
I thought I would do a sweep at this place and make sure no one had eyes on your daughter, but I overstepped my bounds.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> You should have asked.<eos> Understand?<eos> Then let's go find these witches and put them down so I can go home.
More magic?<eos> It's a witch thing.<eos> A mundane object powered up with their magic can keep a spell alive for a long time.<eos> So, we disable it, we disable them?<eos> It could weaken them or it could whip them into a killing frenzy.
"From the ashes, we will rise."<eos> Not this guy. Hmm.<eos> The 11th seal.<eos> Their faith was based on 12 seals.<eos> Followers could level up by unlocking them one at a time.
Open up.<eos> We have about 500 photographs we need you to look at.<eos> Um, childhood friends, uh... uh... friendships at school...<eos> I know you don't want to believe it, but your daughter is about to be responsible for something truly awful.<eos> She's planted bombs inside innocent people and rigged them to blow in about a half-hour.
No luck with the adoption records.<eos> No luck with the hospital. And no luck with the nurse.<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> Your wards are airtight.<eos> - You complained, so I fixed them.
This is what I was planning.<eos> The wards around this place were deceptively advanced.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> You have talent.<eos> I bet you say that to all the girls right before you rape them, kill them, and eat their hearts.
I got 41% charge.<eos> I got a different sort of charge.<eos> Anyway, since we had proved- well, Hammond and I had proved- that it was possible to charge up a telephone-<eos> I began to wonder if we could charge up a car using nothing more than vanity.<eos> In London alone, there are over 750 gyms, and every day they are full of people picking things up and putting them down again so they can be more attractive.
Aneela.<eos> Interesting proposal, well-thought out.<eos> However, the Commander has already decided that, with the loss of our resources in that area, it was best to wait and gather intelligence before...<eos> I'm aware of my decisions, Gander.<eos> I made them.
It takes time to accept the change.<eos> But... a word of caution:<eos> if you feel the commander's affections allow you to do as you please...<eos> Aneela always tires of her toys.<eos> And then she breaks them.
And back with you lot, asking questions like this.<eos> So, no, I never lost hope.<eos> Patience, on the other hand, well, that's a different story.<eos> Let's just say that I, er... painfully mastered patience.<eos> For the Queen. You must have a million emotions. Can you describe them for us?
This is a disgrace to the name Gas and Gobble.<eos> How do you even wake up in the morning?<eos> My alligator licks my face.<eos> Oh, my God, Max.<eos> Whoever stole our credit cards maxed them out.
Alicia, do you need something?<eos> We're never gonna be normal again, are we?<eos> You know, like we thought?<eos> I had all these things I was gonna do.<eos> I can, you know, see them.
My husband drowned in the lake two years ago.<eos> It hit Mia pretty hard.<eos> She started writing more songs.<eos> They were-they were beautiful, but they were sad.<eos> She was playing them for people, friends at parties.
Friend to CEOs, Senators and Royals.<eos> Manipulative, narcissistic.<eos> Charged twice with corrupting minors.<eos> Both girls settled out of court.<eos> But there were allegations that he intimidated them into dropping the charges.
That's right.<eos> Do you wear contact lenses?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was hoping you were gonna say that.<eos> Can I borrow them?
They're like the Native Americans of southeast Asia with a comparable history of persecution.<eos> The ones here in Minnesota arrived after the Vietnam War.<eos> We have Senator Vang's financial records.<eos> Investments, donations, tax audits...<eos> I'm still going through them.
And then, as acting president, you can insist they report directly to you.<eos> If they catch him or get close, you'll be right there to issue your orders.<eos> And what if the president wakes up before then?<eos> You've got at least a few hours.<eos> Make the most of them.
Mr. Atwood, your son will be safe as long as you do everything I tell you to do.<eos> Hannah Wells?<eos> That's who they have in custody?<eos> Find out what she knows.<eos> And if the president wants answers, I'll give them to one person...
So we got nothing.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Because there were so many files to begin with, whoever's been covering their tracks has been deleting them in small batches over the past few months.<eos> There are only five files still remaining associated with Browning Reed.<eos> Gonna need you to make copies and print them up.
Check this out.<eos> It's a digital fingerprint left behind by the person who deleted the files.<eos> Now, they tend to be unique, but if I'm good...<eos> And I like to think I am... I can program a trace and plant it in the remaining files.<eos> So if the traitor tries to delete any of them, we can track the user back to an exact I.P. address.
My treasure.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> A few toys and three quarters.<eos> Yeah, no, I see that. I mean...<eos> I put them here once, and after all these years later, they're still here.
Uh, I don't know, by doing a wrestling show that's just a big casting couch for you.<eos> Fucking Rhonda.<eos> Goddamnit.<eos> That's none of your business, so, just keep quiet.<eos> Right. You only listen to women if you're fucking them.
- Yeah.<eos> Plus, I don't like it when people tell me what not to do.<eos> Another thing we have in common.<eos> Well, they did say we were a perfect match, so...<eos> I asked my friends for some trashy magazines, but instead they brought in those, and then they wallpapered the place with them which kinda makes it look like I like staring at pictures of myself, which is kinda bizarre.
I'm good.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> So, I want to talk to you about my latest project.<eos> My family owns quite a bit of coastal real estate all over the world.<eos> Most of these properties are empty and a bit faded, so I plan to restyle and rebrand them as boutique hotels.
We were oven partners in the Advanced Baking Course.<eos> You weren't oven partners.<eos> Aunt Josephine was desperately afraid of turning on an oven.<eos> Soon we became fast friends, and then one day she said to me,<eos> "If I ever adopt some orphans and then meet an untimely death, promise me that you will raise them as if they were your own."
I ate a banana just before you arrived.<eos> - I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Leeches are very small animals.<eos> If we were in the water, we might have reason to fear, but I doubt they'd attack a sailboat.<eos> Hurricane Herman might have even scared them out of the territory.
Thank God she's okay.<eos> Bryan...<eos> Mindy's injuries were much worse than they could have been because her feet were up on the dashboard, and...<eos> Yeah, they said, the airbag...<eos> I told her to put them up there.
And why did you zero in on the plaintiff?<eos> He showed signs of deception per the Friedman method.<eos> This is a method utilized by the police - to question suspects? - Yes.<eos> And the plaintiff signed this confession?<eos> Yes. He told us exactly how he... slipped the crates into his car, took them down to Maxwell Street Market, and sold them to a vendor for $10,000.
Carl, you said this was a battle between the firm's heart and its head.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's about the past or the future.<eos> Your past glories have a lot to teach us, but this... this is now.<eos> The fights are now, and Adrian knows how to fight them.
"The Blade of Death."<eos> Azrael's.<eos> "The Medallion of Life."<eos> Johnson's belt buckle.<eos> And the key that binds them all together.
We'll fix it.<eos> There's plenty of time.<eos> Just not for me.<eos> God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces.<eos> The Blade of Death, the Medallion of Life and the Key that binds them all together.
Ah, your cleaners.<eos> What are their names?<eos> Sakiya and Fudo.<eos> Why?<eos> - I want to hire them.
I got through to customer service, but... I really don't remember that much Japanese.<eos> Hey, Captain.<eos> Update on the rat situation.<eos> Wolf pee's in place, and the traps are set in the evidence room.<eos> I thought we were luring them into the break room.
Nobody wakes up thinking, "My world will explode today."<eos> "My world will change."<eos> Nobody thinks that.<eos> But, sometimes, it happens.<eos> Sometimes, we wake up, we face our fears... We take them by the hand.
Yes, sir.<eos> I went through fortesan's inventory, and I noticed he was missing six cans of super Max.<eos> I'm wondering if someone thought it would be fun to steal it for the party.<eos> That was me, sir.<eos> I took them.
He's here. Yeah, no kidding.<eos> He's here!<eos> JAKE: So are these zombies slow or fast?<eos> JENNY:<eos> They ain't slow. ALEX: But you beat them before, right?
The Church of Amiens.<eos> Built in the 1600s, for centuries, it was a shelter, a refuge.<eos> Now just a place for marauding armies to squat.<eos> Look closely, but be careful.<eos> Returning knights of the Crusades were known to hide their relics so only the worthy could find them.
And how old is Crystal?<eos> 9.<eos> And you're certain she didn't take those sleeping pills with her when she left?<eos> Positive!<eos> Honestly, I forgot she even had them.
Ironic, isn't it?<eos> What?<eos> How eventually we become parents to our parents.<eos> Must be time for the profile.<eos> The person we're looking for is targeting victims of high moral character, manipulating them into killing themselves, marking them, and then disposing of the bodies in secondary locations.
He says that she's a doctor.<eos> So his short-term is coming back, but it's limited.<eos> It sounds like his long-term is still a mess.<eos> Ok, this definitely reads chicken scratch, but it's... oh, there are a lot of Rosa Medinas in Mexico.<eos> Well, let's start with women in Houston and Brownsville, and then cross them with Mexican citizens.
It's like a mass sulk.<eos> Come on. The sooner we get there, the sooner we'll know the answer.<eos> Yeah, I know, but...<eos> Picts, early Celts. Loved stone cairns.<eos> They built them under the ground but close to the sky.
Why?<eos> She asked for it.<eos> She's gonna ask for a lot of things.<eos> That doesn't mean we're just supposed<eos> - to give them to her.
I have to go.<eos> No.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - You're you're scaring me.<eos> I washed them in holy water.
And they won't tell me a damn thing.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I'm flagged as culpable in his death.<eos> There are rules.<eos> And friends to help me break them.
- Oh, no, it's, uh...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Sausage Crunchies are people food.<eos> They're like brown cheese snacks.<eos> Yeah, it's like space food. I-I put them in soup.
I wish we were at war.<eos> These are the place settings for the wedding.<eos> Much more dangerous.<eos> How's Josh doing in the royal kitchens?<eos> Uh... he's declared them "adequate."
It's 5:30. You're gonna be in bed in 90 minutes.<eos> I'm going out to dinner.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> With who? - A friend.<eos> Okay, your only friends are cows, and you eat them.
Thank you.<eos> Off. Yes.<eos> Off.<eos> My hands are stuck, my hands are stuck.<eos> It's okay, I'll take them outta there.
I'm a betting shop manager who stole from her employer... What kind of chance does that give me?<eos> Well, there are other jobs.<eos> Yeah, I sold 'em!<eos> You clocked 'em last time.<eos> I sold them, I got 100 quid and I didn't piss it up a wall or go down the bingo... I filled the fridge with it.
Her real name is Ellen Briggs.<eos> She was an Army General.<eos> I need to know everything about her.<eos> Well, we don't know much right now, and the files we found on her are mostly redacted.<eos> I need to see them.
With the given name Carl.<eos> I am a Danish citizen, residing at the Three Widows House at Arpajon.<eos> Remove your shoelaces and your belt.<eos> - I will not do that.<eos> - Place them in the tray.
Asking them for help has conditions.<eos> Invite them in, and it will be the last free action you take.<eos> If you do not ask for help, then see the days to come.<eos> Theses are the threads that lead to one year in your future.<eos> Take them as proof.
_<eos> Look, I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Can we do this later?<eos> Now is good.<eos> I tell you to stay away from Mary's kids, and you take them to that punk-ass godson of yours.
That's it.<eos> Did you see them girls?<eos> What girls?<eos> Star and Alexandra.<eos> Did you see them tonight?
You know what's interesting about that footage?<eos> Your interaction with Otis is the last time he was seen alive.<eos> So what that got to do with me?<eos> We know you wrote letters to Social Services begging for the custody of those kids.<eos> You said you'd do anything to get them.
- What's he saying?<eos> He wants us to meet us at his office.<eos> He doesn't want us to tell Jahil.<eos> The girls are here, Big.<eos> Show them in, Okiko.
You ask a computer-simulated person to generate a random string of numbers, it won't truly be random.<eos> And if all the simulated people are part of the same computer program, then, they'll all generate the same string.<eos> The exact same numbers.<eos> The numbers...<eos> I said them, too.
Now we cover our tracks.<eos> I'll do this.<eos> You finish with the tools.<eos> What about the safes?<eos> We'll open them up when things have cooled down a bit.
Maybe it was something in those chocolates.<eos> There're practically enough instruments - to start a whole band.<eos> - You never know what kind of useful things you're gonna find in that attic.<eos> When did you want to get this over to donate to the school?<eos> Oh, I, uh, I told Mrs. Grandstaff that I would drop them off tomorrow afternoon.
You're one of the strongest women I know, so just keep on being yourself, and everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Whether the chocolates work or not.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I can get rid of those, - if you want.<eos> - No. I bought them; I may as well finish what I started.
You callin' me a liar?<eos> Here we go.<eos> I'm not saying that, but those are my things.<eos> How they got here, I don't know, but...<eos> I'm gonna take them back now.
This is Lady Lennox's doing.<eos> I need to talk to Darnley.<eos> I think I can still reach him. (Birds singing) (Sighs)<eos> Thank you, Jane.<eos> I had some books sent over to your house as a gift, but no one was home to receive them. Oh.
Two missing women.<eos> We don't know how many more she came in contact with.<eos> And now they are gone.<eos> Is that reason enough for drama?<eos> - So you think she killed them?
That-That's not true.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> That's what Visser thinks.<eos> LAPD is sending marked units to the veterans' home.<eos> No, you should send them to the bus.
I wouldn't have come if the circumstances weren't extraordinary.<eos> _<eos> David, I need you to help me identify a depositor at the bank.<eos> You know the rules.<eos> Yes, and I have great respect for them.
You'll have to forgive me, Ms. White.<eos> I mean no disrespect. But we have very limited resources.<eos> Look, I know you must get a lot of crazies, But I swear to god, I'm not one of them.<eos> You saw what he wrote, about the girls he sees 0n the subway and on the train.<eos> How he followed them, what he wants to do to them. And there's more.
Well, you said that they took her last night?<eos> They'll need to give her hormone injections before they can harvest.<eos> It will be at least another day.<eos> Jesus. She hasn't even had her period yet.<eos> Yeah. Well, we're born with all the eggs we'll ever have, and technically, you could extract them from infants.
I'm the only one left?<eos> Your brothers, they... they all...<eos> Thank you for trusting me.<eos> You're doing the right thing, Mark.<eos> Honey, are you sure you don't want to just store your craft supplies instead of donating them?
They could all be sisters.<eos> Why did the cases go cold?<eos> - It's unclear.<eos> - I hate to ask, but if it's the same offender, what makes you think Katie's still alive?<eos> Because he held on to them for a week before killing them.
You better start talking, Reznik.<eos> You better tell us who you hand those girls off to, or you'll never see the outside of a jail cell again.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> They don't want me to know who, in case I get caught.<eos> I get them from Hayes.
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Come in.<eos> Okay. Jesus wants to do his senior project alone, but I need you to say that you won't help unless it's both our projects, because you can't choose sides.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, you know I'm on the school paper, right?<eos> I know you fold the copies and stack them in the hallway.
And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Come back anytime, Ms. Amin.<eos> I'll wait for your funeral, you right-wing sellout.<eos> Hands where I can see them.
He wanted to write from experience.<eos> So, in his last few years as a prosecutor, he started recording all of his court appearances on microcassette.<eos> It's not entirely legal, in case you're wondering.<eos> These are the tapes of his prosecution of Eli Kotite.<eos> Would you like to listen to them?
Every document, every photograph, every video.<eos> I made a copy before I handed it over to Gephardt.<eos> You'll know everything he knows.<eos> Most of these file names are in Spanish, but that doesn't prove they're the Fidel Files.<eos> We'll have to look at them.
I only believe that we should let our elected leaders lead.<eos> Well, then, let my mother lead.<eos> I would, if she'd been elected.<eos> You want to bridge the gap between the sides?<eos> So do I, by eliminating them.
This is drywall dust.<eos> These are drips of paint.<eos> They don't match the walls.<eos> Gonna take a wild guess here and say Darren was stealing valuables from his drywall jobs.<eos> Probably fencing them, too, which is why he could afford a second home.
Thanks.<eos> I'm not a monster.<eos> I don't like turning veterans away.<eos> I'm a veteran myself, but, you know, just like in the service, you follow directives.<eos> Even when you think the ones giving them are fools.
Nope, all good.<eos> Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.<eos> No, what is wrong with you?<eos> Aha, you are upset.<eos> I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.
You don't have to kill him.<eos> I don't have to consult you or anybody else on these matters.<eos> You know, Guero, he still sees you as a morra on his arm.<eos> He doesn't see what I see.<eos> If you want to succeed as a businesswoman, Teresa, you have to learn to control your weaknesses... before somebody else exploits them and it costs you your life.
I'm too old for dolls.<eos> I'll fix up the bullet holes.<eos> No. That's all right.<eos> Just send my books, please. I definitely want those. You got it.<eos> Will you bring them yourself?
I'm not saying another word without a lawyer.<eos> There was no plan.<eos> We met two girls and we partied.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> You separated them, and then you took their cell phones so that they couldn't call for help.
This would make a perfect look for a bachelorette party.<eos> Yes!<eos> Bridesmaids, take note!<eos> Um, where did you get these done?<eos> Actually, I did them myself.
Mama.<eos> Mama.<eos> Well, hey there, sugar.<eos> I... I brought you some chocolates with coconut.<eos> My chef made them this morning.
Well, hey there, sugar.<eos> I... I brought you some chocolates with coconut.<eos> My chef made them this morning.<eos> Mama!<eos> I'll... I'll just leave them right here.
Eight years ago, I put him away for life.<eos> The victims of David Zachariah.<eos> For ten years, young women were going missing.<eos> He posed as Wi-Fi repair.<eos> Once inside, he drugged them and drive them to the middle of nowhere, kill them, have sex with the corpse and bury it.
You're wrong.<eos> She's a nightblood novitiate, which means she trained in combat exactly like this.<eos> You want us to cheat?<eos> You know the rules.<eos> If we break them, we lose, and if we lose, we die.
Turn the truck off!<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Show us your hands!<eos> Show me your hands!<eos> Keep them where we can see them!
And yes, the pearls are real.<eos> What... What is this?<eos> What angle are you working right now?<eos> Nothing, sweetheart, I just...<eos> I just want you to have them.
"There's something bigger going on here."<eos> She wouldn't say what.<eos> That is all.<eos> Her boyfriend stole 40,000 painkillers.<eos> They're missing, and I think she's got them.
Yeah, but he's been raised to believe that sex is wrong unless it's for procreation.<eos> And repressing his natural urges is triggering aggressive impulses, which he's struggling to control.<eos> - Aggressive?<eos> - He fetishizes blondes.<eos> Stalks them.
- Is this about Leonard and Amy?<eos> I don't like it either.<eos> Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you.<eos> That doesn't make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.<eos> Well, sometimes women don't care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.
It's a good question.<eos> I might be able to shed some light.<eos> In 1987, when new citizens were sworn in at the Bennett Courthouse, it was customary to give them pocket-sized copies of the Constitution.<eos> These were on display at Ms. Spivey's memorial.<eos> I borrowed them, along with this photograph of the victims taken shortly before the shooting started.
I have more emotions than you.<eos> I have them.<eos> I'm having one right now.<eos> She really left you?<eos> We will not only rebuild both our agencies from scratch, but we will combine them.
This'll be so great for the women, Governor. And, I won't lie, for me too.<eos> I need something to exercise my considerable skills.<eos> And, uh, how do you propose to make this...<eos> Green walls.<eos> That's what I'm calling them. Them?
Then do something about it.<eos> Like what?<eos> The women are frozen in fear.<eos> Kaz...<eos> - win them over.
Yeah, he says there's nothing in it. Ugh!<eos> Yeah or maybe he just can't be arsed.<eos> Look, just 'cause he's rolled over doesn't mean you have to.<eos> Do you have copies of the abusive posts?<eos> Okay, well there's no internet access here so you're gonna have to ask someone in your family to print them out and bring 'em in.
Shit, Allie, I told ya.<eos> The best revenge for Red is to get the fuck out of here - and leave Ferguson to rot.<eos> - Yeah, only she won't rot, will she?<eos> She'll still be here. She'll still be Top Dog, torturing the women.<eos> Killing them.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WILL NEVER BE A REAL WOMAN.<eos> OH DEAR. NOW WHAT?<eos> I was never attracted to breasts, for example.<eos> Specifically in the girlfriends and women that were objects of my desire, breasts were not exactly special items to me.<eos> But at any time during sex, have you wished you had them?
Because I am very jealous of my books.<eos> Do you want to write that down?<eos> I'll write it down, don't worry.<eos> -My house is a mess, Rafa.<eos> -Okay, so leave them here.
Beth!<eos> Who are you?<eos> What did you do to my sisters?<eos> We're your sisters now.<eos> You're the reason we chose them.
Yippee!<eos> And he's wagging his tail. Love you, sweetie.<eos> He's been practising tricks in front of the mirror. Bad day for the prosecution?<eos> Better one for the defence.<eos> It's a function of my pathological insecurity - women won't like me unless I rescue them, be useful, somehow.
Kyung-hwan probably believes his dream world is the real world.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> If Kyung-hwan dies while you're inside, there's no way out for you.<eos> You'll live inside his dream forever.<eos> When you press the chime bell, concentrate on moving your brainwaves to separate them from his.
You know them?<eos> There was a story my great grandmother used to tell.<eos> Two twisted spider sisters.<eos> They'd attack pretty girls.<eos> Ate them whole, but for their faces.
- Don't push it.<eos> I see my things are back.<eos> Somebody must've misplaced 'em.<eos> Yeah, somebody.<eos> Glad you put them back.
Ow! That's where it hurts, right there?<eos> I'm gonna need the oxygen tank.<eos> It's with the Rangers fan in back.<eos> What about the oxygen masks on the plane?<eos> We can only drop them in case of an in-flight emergency.
What about the oxygen masks on the plane?<eos> We can only drop them in case of an in-flight emergency.<eos> - I'm a Cop.<eos> - I'm calling this an emergency.<eos> Tell him to drop them.
Comrade Detective was produced and funded by the Romanian government, not merely to entertain, but to celebrate and promote Communist ideals.<eos> But with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989,<eos> Comrade Detective would tragically become nothing more than a curious footnote in the dustbin of a Communist history.<eos> Until now.<eos> After a two-decade journey spanning four continents, hundreds of dead-end leads, and the cooperation of five international governments, we have finally tracked down and restored the original master copies and dubbed them.
Well, it's hard to put it simply.<eos> You don't have to say it simply.<eos> Just talk about it.<eos> I'll admit that my novels don't sell well.<eos> But even so, there are still people who enjoy reading them.
Mr. Michima, don't underestimate the power of expression.<eos> Isn't that why your novels never sold?<eos> They're only selling now because of the scandals surrounding you.<eos> I love novels.<eos> That's why I've continued to write them.
In six months, I would change an unpopular novelist who feared death into a best-selling novelist who desired to commit murder.<eos> Don't you think that sounds like an interesting game?<eos> Is that why you sent those invitations to them?<eos> You need friends if you want to play.<eos> I selected women appropriate for you, and had them come to your home.
I had the exact same question, but the producers told me that people don't want to read.<eos> (laughs) People read all the time.<eos> Yeah, but doesn't mean people like it.<eos> -I've written several books and... -Oh... you...<eos> You've written them?
Did you drink any?<eos> We're doing you a favor.<eos> Move, assholes!<eos> Shit!<eos> We can hang them from here.
I have a fucking gun!<eos> Don't tell me I don't know how to use an axe, man.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm getting the bombs out of their heads. See?<eos> I'm gonna put them on the wall, man.
You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.<eos> We never lose our demons, Mordo.<eos> We only learn to live above them.<eos> Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.<eos> If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin... Upon us all.
- What other fish?<eos> - The Walkers.<eos> We're at war.<eos> Don't forget the leading lights.<eos> Light them when you hear three owl hoots.
No, no, no.<eos> No, this can't be happening.<eos> We have to go back to sleep.<eos> Aurora, we can't.<eos> We just have to get back to our pods and start them up again.
He is attending the village dance tonight.<eos> How does this concern our warrior daughters?<eos> Oh, how can you be so tiresome? You know I mean for him to marry one of them.<eos> Daughters do not dance well with masticated brains, Mrs. Bennet.<eos> You, sir, have already put them at a decided social disadvantage by insisting they do their combat training in China as opposed to Japan!
You know how I know that you are the Ghost, my friend?<eos> Because if you're not... I will kill you.<eos> I will cut you slowly and painfully with my knife.<eos> So painfully... that your innards will fall out and spill out on the floor.<eos> Then I will grab them and place them on your chest.
Even the Soviet Foreign Minister.<eos> More than we were expecting?<eos> Oh, yes. There's dozens of names.<eos> Good.<eos> Will you read them to me?
Chicken's dry.<eos> At least it's not dirty like the broccoli.<eos> You might want to cut that up for her.<eos> Those books have your name on them.<eos> I wrote them.
Who's to say it wasn't the way it was meant to be... when you first brought it in?<eos> War and Peace. Not just War.<eos> That's what we editors lose sleep over, you know?<eos> Are we really making books better?<eos> Or just making them different?
No, 95.<eos> -It's simple math.<eos> -Well, okay.<eos> It might be simple on paper, but you're forgetting the wind, the weight of the Kia, the four of us, bird cages...<eos> I prefer to call them bird condos, and so do the birds.
And your friends here were about to sell him these. That's what we make at MBI?<eos> - What are these?<eos> - Microchips.<eos> In the wrong hands, the information on those chips could be used to undermine the entire U.S. missile defense system.<eos> For the last three months, Dan's been smuggling them out of the building.
Give us three jugs, you old hag!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Get up, rascal!<eos> Go and eat your bread in the cart!<eos> When I have leftovers, I'll throw them.
3 months.<eos> The end there was pretty rough.<eos> I could've helped out a little if she asked.<eos> I could've fed them skinny cows.<eos> We had nothing to feed them.
I'll be here whether you finish it or not, so... you take your time.<eos> Sure is quiet in here.<eos> Open the drawer.<eos> 5s, 10s, 20s.<eos> Fan them out like a deck of cards.
I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn, so Saint Peter can hear me when it's time to open the Gate.<eos> You hear that?<eos> You hear that?<eos> That's the hellhound.<eos> I'm gonna chase them out of here.
Live boldly, Clark.<eos> Push yourself. Don't settle.<eos> Wear those stripy legs with pride.<eos> Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury.<eos> Knowing I might have given them to you has eased something for me.
- You're up, man. I don't think you could use that one, though.<eos> He does not like losing, at all!<eos> Lot oi Twilight Zones, man.<eos> Almost every single episode.<eos> Recorded them all over the last year or so.
Poor guy.<eos> Never found love.<eos> Wrote all those books for children and never had any of his own.<eos> Might be a good thing.<eos> If he had them, he undoubtedly would have disappointed them.
It's all about the blocks, dirty great towers that have stood firm for two generations, full of initiated kids who'll be dead before they grow old.<eos> Grim towers and hopeless kids.<eos> "For the first 10 days they sailed on beautifully<eos> "and found plenty to eat, as there was lots of fish.<eos> "And they had only to take them out of the sea
Incredibly rare.<eos> One in 10 million.<eos> His frontal lobe remains in an undeveloped state.<eos> A hotbed of neural stern cells.<eos> We stimulate them with theta waves, duplicating the pattern.
Is that the number you were looking for?<eos> Think about it, Quangel.<eos> Every single card was voluntarily turned into us‒voluntarily.<eos> We didn't find any ourselves.<eos> They couldn't wait to hand them over to us, all those people.
A card and a pen.<eos> You took her anyway.<eos> I read all your cards, Hobgoblin.<eos> Yours and your wife's.<eos> I am the only person who read all of them all of them, except for 18.
Only when I think about it.<eos> The most interesting things happen in doorways.<eos> At the borders, right along the edges.<eos> Ancient fishermen learned to sail where the warm water met the cold.<eos> The little fish would reach the edge of the warm water and they'd stop and the big fish would come out of the cold water and they'd eat them.
- Yeah. It's what I do.<eos> I sort of take everyday situations, and then I look at them from a different perspective.<eos> It's gonna be a Coldplay vibe, I think.<eos> 'Cause that's what Chris Martin does.<eos> He gets really mundane things and he makes them about the universe, and stars, and electricity and shit, so...
Most important, he had the money he needed.<eos> I had never made such amount of money at one time.<eos> I sent Roosevelt his share and I bought a new laptop.<eos> In other words, I was in business, And I liked... a lot.<eos> Roosevelt continued to send me things, and I continued to sell them Earning the money he needed.
Forums that maintained a list of vulnerable online shopping sites, And were easy to penetrate.<eos> I did not want to cross that line, but those companies were insured, So there really was not too much damage.<eos> I cloned a few hundred credit cards and sold them on Darkweb.<eos> ROOSEVELT I'll give you $ 3,000. ALEX It's seven!<eos> ROOSEVELT So good luck selling them yourself.

Sign here please.<eos> We started lowering our guard.<eos> Every time we used the card, We always did a test purchase online<eos> To make sure the card was not locked,<eos> But we had hundreds of credit cards, And it was difficult to keep track of them, So we made a cut.
But it was just a tree.<eos> The branches had grown a little too long,<eos> And they hit the window when the wind blew.<eos> Ones I knew that, the witch never came back.<eos> Sometimes scary things go away when we understand them a little.
My momma, your momma Witches never cry<eos> My momma, your momma Witches gonna die<eos> Witch number one, drown in the river Witch number two, got a noose...<eos> Hand out your leaflets.<eos> I'll know if you dump them.
- I heard him.<eos> - Yeshua.<eos> Two days ago.<eos> I know voices.<eos> I hear them.
What am I gonna say?<eos> Sully, do you want me to come be with you?<eos> No, Lorrie.<eos> Thanks, but the girls need you.<eos> Tell them I love them.
Grab on.<eos> Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.<eos> We got you.<eos> - My hands.<eos> - Gotta warm them up.
Never had to deal with the fears of life.<eos> Ironic, people... who have suffered the most... have the strongest resistance.<eos> Your daughter is just gonna get worse.<eos> She'll die.<eos> In the meantime, you gather all the dolls and the box... and bring them here to me along with your daughter.
A man who gets punished very badly indeed.<eos> Stories aren't real though.<eos> They don't help anything.<eos> Stories are wild creatures, Conor O'Malley.<eos> When you let them lose, who knows what havoc they might reek?
No.<eos> No, but I did... I heard noises.<eos> Your honor, noises...<eos> Continue.<eos> I heard things, and I saw them.
We can stop the darkness!<eos> Save our island!<eos> There's a cavern of boats.<eos> Huge canoes.<eos> We can take them, find Maui, make him restore the heart.
You almost got us all killed today.<eos> Now, I would appreciate it if you didn't act on every idiotic thought that comes into your mind and just do what I say from now on.<eos> We don't know if this man is deranged.<eos> We don't know what he's done.<eos> Anybody could be next including the women. So get them safe.
You're not gonna get rid of me.<eos> You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life.<eos> You're like a dog.<eos> Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.<eos> You can kick them, but they keep coming back to you. Thinking that somehow if they're good...
You're like a dog.<eos> Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs.<eos> You can kick them, but they keep coming back to you. Thinking that somehow if they're good...<eos> You're not doing this again.<eos> You'll love them.
When you survive because somebody else is willing to die like in war, then that... You're immune to the pain of the people who are dying because you have an investment in their being willing to die.<eos> You say, "1 will build a statue."<eos> I will remember you in a history book."<eos> But if you look at that from another perspective, that building of the statue or remembering you in a history book is a bribe to be willing to die so that I can live.<eos> Both sexes in the area where they are rejected tend to turn what rejects them into an object.
- Yeah.<eos> - Right?<eos> They want attention.<eos> And what do they do?<eos> They kidnap girls and sell them into marriage or slavery, right?
They want attention.<eos> And what do they do?<eos> They kidnap girls and sell them into marriage or slavery, right?<eos> And everybody... the u.N.,<eos> Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, the u.K. Government, the Canadian federal minister of defense, they're all promising aid and help and equipment and personnel to help find these girls and bring them back, because this is such an outrage, and, "oh, my goodness, something needs to be done."
No!<eos> No! You take it!<eos> Jesus Christ, kid. With all that time in hand, you'd think you'd do a better job than this.<eos> It's "homeless", not "homies."<eos> You started with the letters too big here, then you had to scrunch them up at the end.
You should be happy for me.<eos> Each of these fridges, $75 cash.<eos> Tax-free.<eos> Why don't you go live with your new friend?<eos> And you all can collect all the refrigerators you want and put them all over everywhere for all I care.
I made us some flyers.<eos> Let's check it out.<eos> This is nice work, man.<eos> I like the writing.<eos> Passed them out on the way over here.
We'll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.<eos> Hope?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rebellions are built on hope.<eos> Hands where I can see them.
I think this is gonna work better, faster, if we split up. - Okay?<eos> - What? You see a guy with a blue face, you come and find me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's the killer bees. That's what you gotta worry about.<eos> You know why they call them killer bees, don't you?
Why not?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Avdeyeva is not the only victim of that psycho.<eos> He slipped a mickey to the girls' drinks, then raped them and taped it.
Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Avdeyeva is not the only victim of that psycho.<eos> He slipped a mickey to the girls' drinks, then raped them and taped it.<eos> Later, he blackmailed some of them with these videos and forced them to have sex with him again.
Only if someone tries disrupting their rituals or repeating actions.<eos> For example, flicking a switch like your boy.<eos> Where do these rituals come from?<eos> An autistic child chooses actions himself.<eos> He fixes them, repeats them and turns into rituals.
He's your son!<eos> This does not concern you.<eos> Keys, faster.<eos> I need to take my things.<eos> You'll pick them up tomorrow at the door.
I don't want us to be seen together.<eos> I really ask you to.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> Your friend was taking pills and feeling sick.<eos> When she stopped taking them, she got better.
Well, we broke off the lock and found...<eos> You'll see for yourself now.<eos> This way.<eos> He killed his victims here.<eos> He put them to sleep with chloroform and then strangled.
That is the Milky Way galaxy.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Tom, have you heard anything about malfunctions or issues with the tricobalt torpedoes?<eos> They're experimental, still in testing, but Starfleet wanted us to have them.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Especially the puppet!<eos> You are of noble birth, yet you engage in the lowly work of copying paintings.<eos> There was a time when I dissipated my wit and skills on gambling.<eos> Imagine the torment of having so many women make advances on me, when I couldn't afford to buy them a glass of Burgundy.
She'd never admit it, but she knows it. She loves it.<eos> I think you need to sign Danny up for your dating class, Vick.<eos> Actually, I'm off women right now.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> Think about it, you obsess about meeting them.
I think you need to sign Danny up for your dating class, Vick.<eos> Actually, I'm off women right now.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> Think about it, you obsess about meeting them.<eos> Then once you meet them, then you obsess about taking them out, and then once you take them out, then you start obsessing about having sex with them.
Yeah, we'll meet you there.<eos> So, we're driving right back into that war zone?<eos> Stupid!<eos> All these people.<eos> We'll protect them.
It's just, um, my father has the same condition,<eos> - not as bad, but, uh...<eos> - You know what I really resent?<eos> Attractive, young women telling me I remind them of their fathers.<eos> So, you want them?
- Fuck, really?<eos> Uh... - Let me explain.<eos> - What, uh... What did you order?<eos> - So, we ordered M16s.<eos> You've heard of them?
Ah. C'mon, Connie.<eos> If you can tear yourself away from Professor Flimflam here.<eos> Cup of tea?<eos> How are you getting on with the Woolwich shells?<eos> Do I have to keep on with them?
Previous notes?<eos> Could they be under her maiden name, Lakey?<eos> Ah, there's nothing for a Roseanne Lakey.<eos> They must still be with her previous doctor.<eos> Find them for me, Mrs Turner. Quick as you like, please?
She can't get it in her mouth yet, but...<eos> Most children can't feed themselves until they're a wee bit older.<eos> Last time we were in the children's hospital, there was a little boy born just like Susan, only with proper legs and feet and he was having his fingers amputated.<eos> Doctors said they'd be no use to him cos they were so misshapen.<eos> I think you should encourage Susan to lean towards things, Rhoda, try to pick them up.
Was that Ty?<eos> It's just a muster call. It's probably nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just tell the girls I say I love them, all right?
I'm going to the bathroom.<eos> Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing.<eos> I know that a war is coming between us and the girls.<eos> I knew it the moment they sat out the national anthem.<eos> They sat it out because you were harassing them online!
He was never the same person after he used 'em.<eos> Used 'em?<eos> Wait, you're not seriously telling me you believe in magic.<eos> I believe in evil, Wil, and those things will bring you nothing but misery.<eos> Do yourself a favor, throw them in the river and be done with 'em.
- No, I don't feel the cold.<eos> Come on, your hands are freezing.<eos> This should do the trick<eos> I'm fine, really<eos> - Throw them on ... no go on ... take them
How much did you know?<eos> I didn't get this far.<eos> I was asked to leave.<eos> Well you must have kept records.<eos> Show them to me.
"How can I live without you?"<eos> "It's hard to live without you."<eos> "How can I live without you?"<eos> "You made so many promises."<eos> But you broke them all in a moment.
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division We've asked GSDF to retrieve some living cells for us.<eos> GSDF Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle .<eos> Roger that.<eos> Samples retrieved.<eos> I'll send them to BSL4 labs.
The idea of O.J. just standing there, in front of the cameras and the jury, wearing those gloves...<eos> Chris, come on.<eos> We're going downstairs to get our conviction today.<eos> We have his gloves with all the DNA, everybody's blood, the fibers, all of it.<eos> We have a receipt that proves he owned them.
Did he cut you?<eos> - Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.<eos> - I didn't know. I thought you knew everyone's secrets.<eos> I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.<eos> The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.
Gnomes.<eos> They think Elf ears have some sort of medical properties.<eos> By this time next week, my left ear will be ground up in some horny gnome's tea.<eos> I was travelling with two friends.<eos> I'm worried that these hunters might have snatched them.
What if I get ill?<eos> Don't blackmail me, please!<eos> Of course not, honey.<eos> I have work and I need to get my notes in order.<eos> Maybe I'll put them in a book.
May I butt in?<eos> Help us.<eos> I've had an idea.<eos> These orphans live on the streets.<eos> You could take them in.
I mean, she's no Jane Seymour.<eos> Where is Jane Seymour now, anyway?<eos> She makes jewelry, and it's beautiful.<eos> I just bought two brooches for the lesbians across the street.<eos> Mom, I keep telling you, if you don't rein it in a little bit, you're gonna scare them off.
Be careful what you say about the man I love.<eos> Ms. Newberg, you're here.<eos> I wanted to hole up in the house until the summer was over, but my wedding planner convinced me that, wedding or no wedding, there's nothing like being surrounded by friends and family.<eos> I just didn't want all the cupcakes to go to waste.<eos> Is there anything to wash them down with?
Or 13.<eos> Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?<eos> Well, his references aren't too clever.<eos> Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.<eos> You faked them, Pine?
Walking around, had a few beers.<eos> And then I impressed you all with my arm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The milk bottles.<eos> I knocked them over.
And then I impressed you all with my arm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The milk bottles.<eos> I knocked them over.<eos> No, I... I knocked them over.
I had no reason why but I killed it.<eos> No reason at all.<eos> Just looking at it made me feel disgusted.<eos> I see... they spread bacteria .but cockroaches never cost us harm.<eos> But we humans still kill them.
Rule number two.<eos> Keep getting pledges and you can dress them up like idiots.<eos> Minions!<eos> Minions! They got a hilarious army of fucking Minions.<eos> I love Minions, and now I have to hate them.
My dear boy, if it weren't for the circumstances, we couldn't wish for a better match than Sonya.<eos> She's a dear girl and we're very fond of her...<eos> What circumstances?<eos> You know the circumstances very well!<eos> Our family affairs are in disorder and we've been expecting you to help put them right!
She still loves you, Andrei, and she longs for your forgiveness.<eos> That's all over now, and I thought we'd agreed we'd never speak of it.<eos> I went back to Bald Hills.<eos> I was walking through the orchard.<eos> There were a couple of peasant girls there, very young, picking the plums and eating them.
"Satan's Palace IV," as a matter of fact.<eos> The greatest video game ever.<eos> Seems a bit much to me.<eos> No, look, these games make billions of dollars, right?<eos> They come up with crazy ways to promote them.
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?<eos> No.<eos> This is just one associate helping another.<eos> Like here, the Roman numeral headings... we use all caps for those.<eos> And you indented them, which is perfectly fine, but Cliff likes them centered.
When people will die.<eos> I don't know about you... or Jamie... about any of us.<eos> Even knowing what Jamie says ye do...<eos> I wouldn't want to bear that burden.<eos> Now, place these bottles where the men are sure to find them.
It's been horrible.<eos> He forced me to mend his socks and to fetch his meals.<eos> Hey, I'm just tryna educate the lad on the finer points on traveling in the Highlands.<eos> All right, children.<eos> I'll have a word with the ladies... try and get them to make as many bannocks as possible today.
And my father suffers the compound shame of financial failure seen through the eyes of his son and descended into drink.<eos> I'd sit beside him as a boy at the Sunday service as he shouted at the pastor, at the altar... at anyone who'd listen, really... at the injustice of it all.<eos> And I'd put my arm over his shoulder as the insults began, help carry him out of the church.<eos> God, the insults.<eos> At his funeral, our neighbors were kind enough to whisper them rather than call them out loud.
Does every cop walk into a jersey casino last month And cash in $50,000 in chips?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Violent crime is down, Drugs and gangs away from schools Because of this unit, because of wozniak.<eos> A good cop might conclude that wozniak's been taking payoffs And laundered money.<eos> Go after cops who are tearing communities apart, Not the ones who are trying to hold them together.
What kind of thank you note you going to send?<eos> Tess was right-- this would all be ancient history if I'd just broke off a little piece of the haul and gave it to him.<eos> No, word gets out that you did Raul a favor, then everybody wants the same.<eos> If it means keeping the peace, then I'm gonna take that risk.<eos> You start moving those lines, eventually you forget why you drew them in the first place.
Only that we accessed his inner circle.<eos> If I didn't think you had a strong lead in what could be a significant public corruption case, I wouldn't have authorized the operation.<eos> But if your informant is in danger...<eos> Detective Santos was having second thoughts, and that's to be expected.<eos> We work through them.
Ladies, come on, the bell rang.<eos> Harlee, come here.<eos> Go home.<eos> Your emotions are a liability that we can't afford right now.<eos> If you don't keep them in check, Harlee...
If you follow the Lord's command... then you are Saul the Deliverer.<eos> The Philistine armory is impressive, King Achish.<eos> Mattiyahu.<eos> Of course you know my nieces.<eos> I spoil them?
There is a dazzling array of perversions.<eos> I mean, beyond the sadism and the overwhelming fetishism with female underwear.<eos> He was a voyeur, a transvestite... into autoeroticism and necrophilia.<eos> There's also signs of pygmalionism - his obsession with mannequins and dolls.<eos> I've sometimes wondered if he breathed air into his dying victims to prolong their lives... ..so that they could see clearly that he was going to kill them.
He's just a pen-pusher.<eos> It's this Henry Williams we need to find, but all we've got is the name.<eos> What about these two women at the station?<eos> The contract workers.<eos> Still trying to find them.
- Why the glasses? - Um...<eos> I like them. They totally work on you. But do you need them?<eos> - Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.<eos> - Knew it!<eos> I used to wear them in school.
Seeing my good behavior, the government pardoned the rest of my sentence.<eos> After getting released from jail I thought of coming here and surprising you.<eos> And to see my daughters once.<eos> Not like a father, but as a stranger.<eos> But just see them.
Open up, hurry up in there.<eos> I can't control it.<eos> Let's go and tell the girls the truth.<eos> That till date we did everything for money.<eos> And that we actually love them.
That's correct.<eos> A legal transaction.<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> The bonds are missing.<eos> I'm trying to locate them.
If there's no magic bullet, the case goes right back to archives.<eos> So there was no DNA or fingerprint evidence in these cases.<eos> - None. - All right.<eos> So what's the connection?<eos> Why'd you pull them?
- Whatever.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> Come on. Let's take this baby for a ride.<eos> Women, huh?<eos> Fuck them.
Hey, Nick, oil prices may rise and fall.<eos> The real estate market may go in the shitter.<eos> No matter how bad the economy gets, Nick, children always wanna jump on trampolines.<eos> I can't hear what you're saying and listen to the music.<eos> Oh, maybe just take the buds out and hold them next to your ears.
[falcon screaming] Lauren, I thought we talked about this.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I just thought that if Jan and Bonnie came here in person that you might change your mind.<eos> I do not want a predator flying around with our rings in its mouth.<eos> Well, for your information, she wears them in a little pouch around her neck.
I actually feel like a dad again.<eos> And when no baby brother shows up?<eos> Well, then we tell him.<eos> We can get a new chimney, but we'll never be able to replace this time with Nate.<eos> And if we put those headsets back on, how old will Nate be when we take them off again?
That's the posture you're looking for.<eos> Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can actually be quite charming.<eos> Have the neighbors complained?<eos> Safe to say, they're asking questions.<eos> The rocks would prefer not to move, but we shall move them yet.
He thinks Lake Michigan is an ocean.<eos> I already bought a giant winner's trophy.<eos> I already bought 300 ribbons that say "Special" on them.<eos> Perfect.<eos> We can stuff them into the trophy to reinforce how special the winner is.
Miracles?<eos> Mm, that's... that's part of it, yeah.<eos> I believe you saw that statue bleed real blood, and I believe you've seen other things...<eos> Things you doubt because of the rational parts of your brain or because you're surrounded by people of limited imagination.<eos> I have sought you out because I not only believe you saw these things, you saw them for a reason.
There are so many.<eos> - I'm just making sure...<eos> - It just looks like...<eos> Anything?<eos> I found the right discs, ported them to our system, the data is all restored, but there are tens of thousands of entries.
Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.<eos> Right. The bruising indicated a large hand performing manual strangulation.<eos> Our theory was the killer choked his victims first, then stabbed them.
Neither of the shrinks agreed with anything.<eos> Because they're profiling two different killers.<eos> Shrink number one said that the killer was pathologically angry.<eos> Citing a brutal, powerful stabbing of male victims.<eos> And the other suggested that he idealized the female victims, killing them gently with an overdose of heroin.
Stay with him.<eos> Don't give up any ground.<eos> Keep yourself between the man and the basket. Stay with him. Let's go.<eos> And again.<eos> Use your hands and go up with them. Finish the play.
And, by the way, those routines that they're doing, the one that they did at the game -- not my department.<eos> That's not me.<eos> That's Pam.<eos> Well -- well, what's Pam's deal? Hey, you know?<eos> "Send me your suburban white girls so I can teach them how to dance like hos"?
Bloody idiot<eos> - And they've released Hjörtur<eos> - And the girls?<eos> He didn't say anything about them.<eos> Maybe the police found them
I know. That's why I'm so pleased with you<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> You know what those girls have been through?<eos> Actually, neither of us can begin to imagine<eos> I thought you were going to protect them
- Everything all right?<eos> You know what those girls have been through?<eos> Actually, neither of us can begin to imagine<eos> I thought you were going to protect them<eos> - I am protecting them
Then it had us pick up the same packages later and deliver them to their original addresses.<eos> The building directory shows no tenant in Suite 908.<eos> My training driver says packages have been going there for weeks.<eos> Looks like they're all from electronics companies.<eos> It could be that the Machine is rerouting them, looking for something to help it rebuild.
When you do the kind of work I do, steeping yourself in conspiracy theories day in, day out, you get good at recognizing patterns, and sometimes the patterns are just coincidence, but sometimes... sometimes they're real.<eos> Tonight I'm announcing this discovery on the air.<eos> I'm hoping my listeners will help figure out what the messages mean and who they're coming from.<eos> These messages are a secret for a reason, Max.<eos> You sure whoever's doing this is gonna be happy you're exposing them over the air?
Don't see anyone here.<eos> I'm taking a look around.<eos> Where are you now, Warren?<eos> I don't remember getting these pills, Max.<eos> Someone put them here.
The fairies are in the box?<eos> Mmmhmm. And they're nice?<eos> They are nice but they're also tricksters.<eos> They tell us riddles.<eos> To understand them you have to listen carefully because your eyes can be easily tricked.
- Steve? - Yeah.<eos> That teacher, what was her name, Broderick-Allen? She emailed. She used the word "bully."<eos> Sounds like you haven't been keeping your promises to me.<eos> Fix it.<eos> Do you remember the night we pretended we were in real beds and we described them to each other?
But what if psychic just means your mind is able to pick up on even the subtlest cues in the world around you?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You're gathering information the whole time. You don't realize it, but you are.<eos> I mean, even as a little girl.<eos> So... maybe your mind is picking up on all these cues, and using these dreams to process them.
I thought to myself,<eos> "I can't wait to get away from these people." See?<eos> Success!<eos> I would never do that to my daughters.<eos> I like them.
I don't know how you could volunteer for something like this.<eos> Well, you know, we just drag around in this, our everyday marriage, and I just thought, you know, this is something so different and...<eos> Yeah, 'cause, you know, she gives you these books, and it fills your head full of... you know?<eos> I'm glad she didn't give you Mein Kampf.<eos> And then you give them to your silly book club, and then these ladies get crazy.
I didn't mean to cross a line.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're training to be in the FBI.<eos> It's good that you want to get answers.<eos> Maybe I want them, too.
Right.<eos> Because what drives you doesn't understand "enough."<eos> Well, last night, I was doing it...<eos> Staring at the numbers.<eos> I look away from the screen, out the window, and I see them out there,
Do you have any idea the can of worms you're asking me to open?<eos> Rigging an election is a serious accusation.<eos> All the more reason to listen to Peggy.<eos> Where are those newspapers?<eos> I-I had to leave them behind.
Which would trip the 3,000-volt mechanism underground...<eos> - and kill us all. - And kill us all.<eos> So, a key, you say?<eos> We cannot steal atomic bombs.<eos> It's not stealing if your company made them, dear.
-Yeah, you were strong.<eos> -I know.<eos> And you didn't think you could.<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> Well, I pushed my feelings down and I built a stone wall around them.
Do you know where they are?<eos> There is one garment bag over there.<eos> Um, random question, but do you happen to know about two pairs of leather pants?<eos> They should be in the bag.<eos> She wants to keep them.
How much money do you have?<eos> If I was unemployed for, like, six months, could you afford our rent? Oh.<eos> Uh, I was actually going to ask you for a little more time this month.<eos> My grandma hurt her hip and she has dementia, and I've been sending her money, but she keeps losing the money.<eos> And she's been yelling at the nurses and accusing them of stealing it.
Saw you leave.<eos> It is your wedding day.<eos> I figured I'd follow.<eos> You know, before the surgery, I had dreams about dying, saw signs.<eos> I ignored them.
I said, "on your knees," asshole.<eos> I just need a moment of your time.<eos> Take one more step and you die.<eos> -You killed my friends.<eos> -I saved them.
Half his money, half mine.<eos> Clean weapons, small bills.<eos> Instant escape plan.<eos> It was smart.<eos> And I'm gonna hide them again but in places he don't know about.
Hey.<eos> Are the kids home okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> I saw them with Bruce Layner, and it seemed like he was drinking.
I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I never knew you wrote me all those letters.<eos> That doesn't matter now.<eos> Clive hid them from me.
Each drop represents a demon.<eos> They're converging on...<eos> - Sleepy Hollow.<eos> - Supernatural creatures from all over the world are headed here.<eos> It's as if someone's summoning them.
Ah, there's some small purchases, here and there, some nickel-and-dime stuff for food and water, but there is one that's a little bit more expensive, from a place called Supernova.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an online company where you can purchase a star.<eos> Oh, yeah. I've heard of that.<eos> You can give them as gifts or name them after loved ones.
Was anyone from his family here?<eos> - No.<eos> There was no one.<eos> You must stan coming to the church again.<eos> Instead of clawing at your wounds" ..find a way to heal them.
That's just kitchen cleanup.<eos> Fun!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Procedures aren't "fun."<eos> Sure, if you call them "procedures," they're a bore, but if you think of them as "chores," they can be a blast!
If he enters that ring, he won't come out alive.<eos> That's Aakash.<eos> Aakash, this is Aarfa.<eos> Got your bones broken?<eos> I didn't get them broken, the fool broke them.
It's too dangerous.<eos> Take it as a sign of something... like love.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> In the Dark Ages... in certain parts of Europe... novitiate nuns were asked to pledge themselves to God... in blood.<eos> They would cut off their own breasts and make them an offering to the Almighty...
- I will fix it.<eos> Okay, get her P.A. over here right now.<eos> Put her in someone else's underwear if you have to because I'm an underwear psychic, and I bet this bitch packed granny panties, okay?<eos> Get me our coats now. - Go. Move it!<eos> - Coats. - Get them. - Excuse me.
You want to hit me?<eos> Does that get you off... hitting women?<eos> Come on.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Next time... I'm cutting them off.
The girls are all asking about Darius, Quinn.<eos> They're worried about him.<eos> Yeah. What should we tell them?<eos> Not a damn thing.<eos> He's going to come back, he's going to take them on a helicopter ride into San Francisco, dinner, dancing, and most importantly...
You, Mr. Drake, you think the man correct in his suspicions?<eos> This man, Constantine,<eos> I know him not a good man, sir, and most every thought he ever had an evil one.<eos> But this... what my son... what Sayid has written is not only evil thoughts, he has written them.<eos> He has proclaimed them.
Amen.<eos> Amen!<eos> All right.<eos> My numbers are spot on.<eos> I will double check them, sir.
- I agree. He done wrong.<eos> If I had my strength, I'd cuff your head clean off.<eos> There's two machines down there.<eos> Two monsters the size of sunrise rock.<eos> I turned them to junk.
Starting right now, everything you do here, you're going to do it for me.<eos> Let's say I disagree.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> So this is what's going to happen now.<eos> I'm going to take these plates, I'm going to put them in one bag.
There is no sanity clause.<eos> So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, headed for places in your past where the screaming is unavoidable...<eos> Remember this, there's always madness.<eos> You can just step outside, close the door on all those dreadful things that happened.<eos> You can lock them away forever.
- Abbie. - Why wouldn't you tell me<eos> - that it was your father's place?<eos> - I would've told you to knock on the door yourself.<eos> Supernatural creatures from all over the world are headed here.<eos> As if someone's summoning them.
Let's not do this, shall we?<eos> You cannot invoke one element of the charter and disregard the rest.<eos> As it happens, I know the rules.<eos> After all...<eos> I helped you write them.
Yeah, it's a one way communication.<eos> Hmm. The point is our boss is excited and it would be a good thing for us to keep her that way.<eos> Has he sent you more pages?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I see them?
Looks like we have ourselves a taller, more dude-like version of Felicity.<eos> And I can help.<eos> Now look.<eos> These bees, they're tiny computers, ok?<eos> With Felicity trapped inside, you guys are gonna need someone to hack them, but I'll have to "bee" careful.
Basically, it's a collector magic.<eos> And here I thought earthquake machines were as strange as it got.<eos> Esrin Fortuna told me that one of these chambers exists in Star City.<eos> I'm betting it falls on a Ley line.<eos> What did Vixen call them--Wi-Fi for magic?
Why is your... Electrostatic inducer superior to Franklin's method of grounding?<eos> The answer is simple.<eos> You chose the wrong mentor.<eos> Among his many brilliant, albeit dubious, achievements,<eos> Leeds sought a method to isolate animal traits in order to use them to augment humanity.
We got to finish this thing.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> My compass, it's broken.<eos> I cannot locate the ley lines without it.<eos> Then we need to find another way to pinpoint them.
That's all.<eos> What's all this?<eos> This is how I raised the $15 million for our foundation.<eos> By selling your things?<eos> By auctioning them online... anonymously, of course.
So, what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go be a Ranger.<eos> And if he's right and something happens out there, it's kind of the gig, you know?<eos> You work with some powerful, kick-ass women.<eos> Well, that's the way I like them.
I know where my mother hid the Cup.<eos> I know where the Cup is.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - The tarot cards.<eos> My mom, she must have painted them years ago, but the Mortal Cup has to be hidden inside the Ace of Cups.
I can deglamourize myself, Jace.<eos> - It's "deglamour." - Whatever.<eos> - The cards?<eos> - Right.<eos> How exactly are we gonna get them?
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.<eos> That's a good idea. You should get on that.<eos> I need your help, Harry.<eos> What you need, Ramon, is to figure out what triggers your vibes.<eos> Exactly, and I don't know what triggers them.
He's odd, like he has no social skills.<eos> Some people don't.<eos> But most dangerous criminals seem super nice to their neighbours, so I guess he's safe.<eos> Oh please.<eos> The killer brought four prostitutes to his room, handcuffed and raped them, then flew them all to the mountains in his plane, released them in a forest, and hunted them with a rifle.
Now, ever since vampires took over this city, those same spirits have been restless.<eos> And the covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.<eos> Now, my guess is the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.<eos> Use him on vampires, right?<eos> Use him on the family that begot them.
Let's call more men to the pier tomorrow.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> After safely disembarking in Seoul, we'll meet one last time at our designated rendezvous.<eos> Hur and I will take the boxes to Antung Station by truck.<eos> From there, Hwe-Ryung will place them in the freight car.
I just think you guys are blowing it way out of proportion as usual.<eos> I come bearing cupcakes.<eos> Salted caramel.<eos> They might have entirely too much salt.<eos> I don't know. First time I've ever tried making them.
You think that you can just run away each time?<eos> What about the meat?<eos> It's bad, eh?<eos> Let me get you something for it, it's your nerves.<eos> I have these pills, I take them all the time.
Valentine has my mother.<eos> That's what I saw.<eos> Emotions are nothing but a distraction.<eos> You're ruled by them.<eos> We're taught to control them.
I have followed every rule.<eos> I've given up everything!<eos> We'll find a way out of this.<eos> Screw the rules.<eos> Screw them.
So you believe her disloyal?<eos> What motive does she have to lean to loyalty when she brings you to mind?<eos> We do not act, you and I, whether it is with fury or another's idle tongue-we must ask is all I say.<eos> And this great action you describe?<eos> Our vases, I have a sense of where Croker may have hid them.
I know where the Cup is.<eos> Previously on Shadowhunters...<eos> The tarot cards.<eos> My mom must have painted them years ago.
Soon, I'll be making twice as much cash with Maria, 'cause she's all about, like, upward mobility and la raza.<eos> And you know what? She's just plain nicer.<eos> -And slipper socks.<eos> -You said that already.<eos> I really like them.
- Yeah.<eos> He's the chief medical examiner.<eos> He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.<eos> Well... his report says that Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle each were killed by a single gunshot, but Frank says there were multiple wounds.<eos> He describes them in awful detail, um... different angles, uh... bullet calibers, exit wounds that are too big for a handgun.
My grandfather used to tell me stories about abandoned railway tunnels.<eos> - Abandoned? Why?<eos> - They kept caving in.<eos> Cost a ton. The city just finally threw in the towel...<eos> Gated them up.
Lead poisoning is often the result of exposure to contaminated soil or water.<eos> It seems unusual that he would be the only crew member to suffer.<eos> He had adopted a vegetarian diet, brought all of his own canned food aboard.<eos> Perhaps the tins were contaminated?<eos> If he was the only one to eat from them that would explain it.
This is unexpected.<eos> Well, I have a reputation to maintain, don't I?<eos> And I hereby request an immediate assembly of the Time Council in accordance with General Order 52.<eos> So you've returned to answer for your crimes?<eos> No. I'm here to justify them.
That a tiny female bartender knocked you out, stripped you naked and put you in your ex's bed?<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> Lux's books are clean.<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> I had them run for discrepancies with receivables.
Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah, generic Satanist.<eos> What about the, uh, subdermals... she know what they mean?<eos> No.<eos> Says Rose brought them in herself.
What did I miss?<eos> Do me up.<eos> Done?<eos> It's the gloves.<eos> - Take them off.
I watched my dad get dragged off to prison when I was 11 for murder.<eos> How okay could I be after that, dad?<eos> Whoa!<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Hands where I can see them, now!
Ican'trememberlastyear ...<eos> There's been severe tissue damage to his frontal and temporal lobes.<eos> His memory's been permanently affected.<eos> I need to see the security tapes.<eos> We checked them.

So, I'm going to make it easy on you by taking the decision out of your hands.<eos> I've planted 10 bombs in 10 different toys at the convention.<eos> You won't know where they are.<eos> And if you don't kill dunholtz,<eos> I'm gonna set them off.
-Mmm-hmm.<eos> -They will all die.<eos> -No, no, they won't, they won't.<eos> Because you won't let that happen.<eos> You are going to save them by killing him.
-Agent chase:<eos> Take him out!<eos> -(gunfire)<eos> He planted 10 bombs here.<eos> You have to find them before he blows this place up.
I know about the girls, Max.<eos> - Those women had lives.<eos> - They were brain dead.<eos> Zero chance of recovery.<eos> You treated them like guinea pigs.
Okay, um, Wood Line's on tour?<eos> It's three weeks and they're writing songs for the new album.<eos> Did you want to order lunch?<eos> Is this gonna go all day?<eos> No, no, we order sandwiches and then we eat them at our desks.
The state is dead.<eos> You're the best AI mind in the hemisphere.<eos> My neural nets are not for sale.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep them.
- There's nothing I can do in this moment to stop the comet from crashing into the earth, is there?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Uh, What is this?<eos> - My books.<eos> I'm headed to return them.
If it is my time to go, then so be it.<eos> Who were those men in there?<eos> They were clients of my associate, Saskia, the woman who sent you here.<eos> Men who visited her prostitutes?<eos> Yes, yes! Disrespectful men who harmed them.
What I say.<eos> Nobody here understands what you're saying, King Ragnar.<eos> Well, then maybe they ought to listen, instead of talking.<eos> We are going to lift the boats up the cliff.<eos> Then we are going to carry them across the mountains, past the forts, and then simply slide them back into the river.

Up there?
The defeat of ragnar lothbrok will resound down the ages.<eos> As long as my brother is still alive, he is not defeated.<eos> What is the point of making camp here?<eos> We are going to lift the boats up the cliff,<eos> Carry them across the mountains, And then simply slide them back into the river.
Leave me a message.<eos> This is Betty, the Realtor.<eos> Just checking in about the...<eos> It's Otto. I need blood samples from you as a basis for the universal cure.<eos> Once I have them, we won't be needing you anymore, so...
I'm not exactly housebroken these days.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - You're on our ship.<eos> You were shot, and you're okay, but it's your mods that I'm worried about.<eos> Did you see all of them?
A couple of rattles, a bonnet, a stuffed rabbit and a whistle that doesn't work.<eos> Crabtree.<eos> What do you want us to do with them?<eos> Nothing, sir.<eos> I just thought I should bring them back down to the Station in case one the mothers wanted to claim them.
Henry, have a look at this.<eos> If the teller had stepped out to speak to these two mothers, she would be standing here, facing towards the front door.<eos> If you say so, sir.<eos> Yes.<eos> Bring them in, Henry.
Wow.<eos> These are beautiful suits, Bobo, but it doesn't look like you used any of the bags at all. - What?<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> The... the suits were in the bags.<eos> That's how I got them here.
For God's sake, just pick a pair, and just because you've been invited by a couple of old tarts to a Sunday roast does not mean that you can take my manservant for days.<eos> Uh, I thought we agreed on "personal assistant"?<eos> And the Von Falconburgh sisters are not tarts.<eos> They are the most popular queens in all the seven realms.<eos> I remember the first time I saw them.
- Wait. Don't.<eos> - What?<eos> Your gloves.<eos> You're not wearing gloves.<eos> - Well, I... I just took them off.
- Well, I... I just took them off.<eos> - When?<eos> Uh... I don't know.<eos> On the way back?<eos> Tony, did you see where Dennis took them off?
And... and I...<eos> I need to know what's happening to them.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> I know how you feel, but my hands are tied.<eos> Right, because you let Lommers tie them.
Do you guys see what's happening?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> The reason why your dad is so attached to these ducks is they remind him of you guys.<eos> We got to get them home.
Go on.<eos> We have not always loved the ducks, Phil, but I think we're starting to get it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We want them to stay.<eos> We know why you love them.
Thank you. I'm a very thoughtful man.<eos> With a few notable exceptions.<eos> So, what's in here?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I asked Hildy to put them together for you.
Yes.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You have a wife by your side and heirs to spare.<eos> My daughters.<eos> This will... crush them.
I'd like to know if I agree with your choice.<eos> What happened to "one for all"?<eos> You want your lands back and a treaty guaranteeing Lorraine's independence from France.<eos> France has no right to them.<eos> Louis took them by force and deception.
You want your lands back and a treaty guaranteeing Lorraine's independence from France.<eos> France has no right to them.<eos> Louis took them by force and deception.<eos> Because of your years of plotting with Gaston against the king.<eos> And here I am plotting with Gaston to take them back.
That's what you found on his phone?<eos> I thought you were just gonna get his contacts.<eos> Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.
The house looks...<eos> Spotless?<eos> I know. I've been cleaning for hours.<eos> You could eat off these floors, but please don't.<eos> I just scrubbed them. [Chuckles]
That's evident from his colonoscopy report. What's this?<eos> Parking ticket.<eos> He paid that.<eos> Ah! This says he was known to cavort with prostitutes.<eos> An outreach program to help get them off the streets.
- Right.<eos> - What are these files?<eos> It's the last doctor's.<eos> Seems to be medical reports on police cases he was called out on.<eos> Just... just leave them.
I've never ever seen girls wrestle.<eos> What will the villagers say?<eos> For how long will they talk?<eos> What if the girls break their hands and legs?<eos> We'll fix them.
If only you had given birth to a boy!<eos> Their mother doesn't protest either.<eos> The entire village is laughing at us.<eos> Who will marry our girls?<eos> I will make our girls so capable, that boys will not choose them, they will choose boys!
Hi, thank you guys for waiting, this is Riley.<eos> She'll be your server this evening.<eos> Push the apples.<eos> You know what, Ben?<eos> Ben, push them yourself.
You look uncomfortable.<eos> Not a fan of this sort of establishment?<eos> Guess I just know too much?<eos> I've got a certain appreciation for strippers.<eos> I like watching them work.
of a United States senator for something that you believe to be, but can't be certain, is harmless.<eos> Did I... I leave anything out?<eos> Nuance?<eos> How can you be sure that these pills aren't dangerous?<eos> Your lab analyzed them.
I was really unfair to you after New Year's.<eos> I didn't give you a chance to talk or hear me out.<eos> Yeah, well, I just wish we had more time.<eos> I only have 10 minutes before I have to head back.<eos> I guess then we'll have to make them count, huh?
The answers to all of your questions are on the other side of this door.<eos> And our future is on the other side of the border.<eos> - We're gonna fail. - So what?<eos> Then we'll spend the rest of our days busting Palins in Anchorage, but it'll be worth it.<eos> Shelby, you'll have your answers whether they're good or bad, but at least you'll have them.
I'm just going to slip out.<eos> I am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord.<eos> Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live.<eos> ♪ All things wise and wonderful<eos> ♪ The Lord God made them all

Good.<eos> I assumed I'd still find you at the shop.<eos> Look, I'm in Prague doing an appraisal, and I've found something that might interest you.<eos> Some kind of very old text, leather-bound, hand-written.<eos> I'd never seen anything like them, but I think you should come and have a look.

I am sorry.<eos> I get carried away.<eos> How much do you want for the books?<eos> Well, handling such material is very dangerous.<eos> But in spite of the fact that they are priceless, I will let you have them for $100,000.
Well, this one is pretty amazing, even as far as Grimm books go.<eos> If there are 19 more like this, it would help replace what was lost when the trailer was burned down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A lot of irreplaceable history was destroyed... And not by accident.<eos> If Black Claw is willing to kill to get to these books, they must consider them dangerous.
I am stubborn too.<eos> No matter how high the destination is the path's always under our feet only.<eos> Mr. Sheikh... d0 you believe in fate?<eos> These fate lines are very stubborn.<eos> You can clench them... but never control them.
Do you like it?<eos> I think it'll suit you.<eos> It will, right?<eos> Without this, okay?<eos> Anyway, some seagulls came along... picked up her things and carried them into the air...
This is epoxy mortar.<eos> It's used to set, among other things, cobblestones... like the ones in some of your famous little streets around here.<eos> Agent Seger, those cobblestone streets are hundreds of years old.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's why people travel all over the world to walk on them.
I don't even know what a "chupacabra" is.<eos> It's a spine-covered goat-sucking primate indigenous to Mexico.<eos> I can already see we are immensely handicapped by your presence.<eos> In 18th century England, a secret society known as "The Brethren"<eos> encrypted hundreds of spells to hide them from the church.
What are you doing in here?<eos> I was, uh... I was just looking for my files.<eos> Your files?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sent them over to 125th yesterday.
Is this about the headphones?<eos> - What headphones?<eos> - Oh! I don't know.<eos> I mean, I didn't take them.<eos> They probably forgot to load them on the truck.
But things are just as bad here.<eos> Maybe you are better off without me after all.<eos> Vincent, listen to me.<eos> I've spent most of my life looking for answers.<eos> And now that I've finally found them, now that I have found you, I'm not giving up.
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> This school exists for a single and timeless purpose:<eos> to reveal your innate abilities and hone them to the highest degree.
Consider the jaguar - how it crouches in the tree, like a blameless shadow among the branches, but he is death and he is remorseless.<eos> Or they lie to avoid detection, pretend they are powerful when they are weak as an un-shelled chick.<eos> You know what doesn't lie?<eos> Money, and I have the books.<eos> I have them and I will follow the money to Marley's killer.
Ha-ha-ha! The evening was a success!<eos> Yes!<eos> Although the exertion of it has worn me out.<eos> I'll leave the lights to you, Bumble.<eos> I shall extinguish them quick time, my angel, and visit you shortly afterwards.
Like, I could've been killed.<eos> What possible reason would I have to lie for her?<eos> You're... Seriously?<eos> I wrote, "See ya later."<eos> You know, I always use sticky notes to build really cool stuff, and now you have tainted them forever with your sad... sadness.
I understand. I'm not asking for the originals, Just some copies.<eos> Why?<eos> So you can watch dear old mom screw a bunch of strangers?<eos> I gave those tapes to you in good faith.<eos> I found them in my house.
Alison Sutherland lied, Marjorie Travers.<eos> So, what, you think this is some big conspiracy?<eos> Connect the dots.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Why don't you connect them for me?
It's been a week now.<eos> Today's papers are here.<eos> - I think we've seen enough.<eos> - No.<eos> Everyone else will see them.
What girls?<eos> In the mall.<eos> Parking lot.<eos> You said some sweet words.<eos> Led them to a quiet spot.
Okay, I think you're all probably familiar with the old axiom, "Plans go out the window when the first shot of a war is fired."<eos> Well, that has certainly been the case with all parties involved since Pavel Ostrov's death a few months ago.<eos> Now, I want you to ask yourselves, have the decisions your leaders made worked out?<eos> How have my own decisions worked out?<eos> Would I still stand by them today?
And of course thousands of people were beheaded during the French Revolution, including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.<eos> Could the be the work of a terrorist cell on U.S. soil?<eos> None have claimed responsibility.<eos> So what's he doing with the heads?<eos> He could be keeping them as human trophies, or like Jeffrey Dahmer and Dennis Nilsen, he might have partialism and he's using them for his sexual gratification.
even from years ago. I'll... I'll go.<eos> I'll return him.<eos> Mm. You always do.<eos> What do you do with the cupcakes you don't sell?<eos> Uh, we donate them to a food bank.
Well, then don't.<eos> You are too important to all of us.<eos> Hardly.<eos> All I do is bring you things to sign.<eos> Then take them away again.
- I figured out the rope thing. - More than just a pretty face.<eos> I really wanted to believe in you.<eos> I admit, I can't contact the spirits of the dead.<eos> But that doesn't mean they're not out there.<eos> But that doesn't mean I've seen things, I've felt them.
But Daniel was found here.<eos> The search party checked everywhere in between but didn't find anything.<eos> Finding nothing doesn't mean there's nothing to be found.<eos> - That doesn't mean there's nothing to. - Apparently some sheep were stolen.<eos> Think the Martians abducted them too ?
Bury the other side in paperwork, so they can't find what they're looking for.<eos> And what are we looking for?<eos> Gibbs' trial strategy.<eos> Somewhere in these boxes are the pieces that she is putting together to make her case.<eos> We find them, we know specifically what we have to fight.
You.<eos> You've been bending the rules since the day you were born, and I'm not letting you get away with it anymore.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You bent rules up and down this entire case.<eos> Except the difference between you and me is, I'm bending them to get justice.
No one will be killed because of that.<eos> If we do nothing, Rose Janus will die.<eos> The kidnapper's instructions--<eos> - We know what they are.<eos> - Follow them.
God forbid!<eos> Honey, don't say things like that.<eos> Hello, Mr. Etesami.<eos> Hello Sir, how are you doing?<eos> Mr. Yeganeh gave me these books to give them to you.
Why?<eos> He said they're not suitable for kids.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't suitable for the kids?<eos> Go, throw them in the bin.
Quiet!<eos> Mr. Yeganeh decided these weren't suitable for the kids?<eos> Go, throw them in the bin.<eos> Why the bin?<eos> Just throw them away.
Yeah, it's almost back to what it used to be.<eos> That's great.<eos> You definitely have a shabby chic vibe going on here.<eos> Too bad the cabinets aren't original.<eos> You had them redone?
Oh, God, there's more of them?<eos> First Fisher and now Turner.<eos> Looks like the NSA isn't taking any chances with the rest of us.<eos> Just because you're the guy in the black jumpsuit doesn't mean I have to explain mind map anomalies to you.<eos> That's exactly why you should explain them to me.
This is the Rev 2.<eos> We've been prototyping it since Marta's accident.<eos> It's made from the same zinc-blackened nickel over copper, but reinforced with padding and Kevlar panels.<eos> Kevlar?<eos> Let's be honest, you used to come out of the stitch and sort of feel emotions, and ever since yesterday's stitch, you've been starting to really feel them.
Blatant disregard for protocol, breaking and entering, assaulting a security guard, getting arrested?<eos> In our defense, things wouldn't have escalated the way they did if we had badges.<eos> Oh, you mean badges like these?<eos> Are those real?<eos> I asked Turner for weeks to let me issue them to you.
How can I thank you for this?<eos> Have you become a house husband here?<eos> It's you who's marrying and it's me who's gonna get laid.<eos> These ladies are going crazy.<eos> This marigold necklace is making them lusty.
We were trying to protect you.<eos> You... You broke the law.<eos> You shot your own father and lied to the police about it, and you're gonna tell me about what is right and wrong?<eos> Alex, what you had to live with, it almost killed you.<eos> You came here to get answers, and you got them.
_<eos> That's who you've been texting all day.<eos> So, that's why you only made eye contact half the time.<eos> You know, I heard a rumor Shaw was training twins.<eos> Training them badly, it turns out.
I can tell you something about the body.<eos> Did my own examination.<eos> Anything unusual or creepy about the wounds - or the way she died?<eos> - Well, she died because humans can't survive when their organs are removed.<eos> She was alive when he took them out? !
We didn't realize she was bulimic.<eos> I'm gonna bring over the replacement brains personally.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Bye.<eos> I told you, you need to take the yellow coolers out of circulation.<eos> They noted them in the FBI report.
- grumpy little birthday girl.<eos> - There isn't.<eos> - They're all burnt.<eos> - OK, you know what?<eos> You want soccer boots, you go upstairs and you make a plate for your friends and you give them out.
I would have to check their files.<eos> Do you mind if we take a look at those files?<eos> Uh, I don't, but the state does.<eos> I can't give 'em to you unless you have a warrant, but the moment you do, they're yours.<eos> I will hand them over personally.
I will hand them over personally.<eos> Why don't we drop the whole "I'm a fighter for my patients" act, all right?<eos> We know you mistreat your patients, and we know you did something to these four women.<eos> Yes, I helped them.<eos> By poisoning them?
Zoom is on a rampage with the power that he stole from me, and you are keeping me here.<eos> You were given a rare and precious gift, and you rejected it.<eos> No, I did not reject it.<eos> I gave up my powers to save someone's life... To be a hero.<eos> I nearly killed myself trying to get them back, when you brought me here, wherever here is.
No, I did not reject it.<eos> I gave up my powers to save someone's life... To be a hero.<eos> I nearly killed myself trying to get them back, when you brought me here, wherever here is.<eos> - That's not what we meant. - Okay.<eos> If you would rather have given these powers to somebody else, why did you give them to me?
Infinite.<eos> Yeah, well, he can do that?<eos> If he can create a breach to Earth-2 all on his own...<eos> He can get to all of 'em.<eos> One pulse to destroy them all.
- You know the drill.<eos> Indeed I do, yeah.<eos> I mean, my license expired a few years ago, but I get the general idea.<eos> So, Penny. Penny.<eos> We want to reauthorize the amphibious fighting boat and have them built in your district.
It's not funny.<eos> How'd you get the bullies to take out Jack?<eos> The most powerful bribe in the world:<eos> a free full-page ad in the play program.<eos> It's a funny thing about fists, everyone gets them, but not everyone gets the instruction manual.
Your Honor, as the victims' mother, I certainly would like to see justice done, but as an officer investigating the case,<eos> I feel that I also must tell you that I am confident that Tyrone Hensdale did not steal the truck that he was driving.<eos> Mr. Olson claimed otherwise.<eos> Joe Olson is afraid that he will be charged with obstructing justice.<eos> Your Honor, I brought along with me my case notes in the hope that you would consider them before sentencing.
No. Involving yourself in a student's thesis.<eos> Sally can't be perceived as getting special treatment, Monte.<eos> - There are rules th...<eos> - Yes, of course there are.<eos> But sometimes, for the greater good, we bend them a little.
Sally can't be perceived as getting special treatment, Monte.<eos> - There are rules th...<eos> - Yes, of course there are.<eos> But sometimes, for the greater good, we bend them a little.<eos> You didn't seem to mind when I bent them to get your son back in school.
What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?<eos> But the mission was to destroy it.
Serena played us for fools.<eos> Betrayed us.<eos> This isn't about Serena.<eos> This is war.<eos> And either we stop it today, or we watch the world burn tomorrow.
There's gonna be cops all over this place.<eos> - Ed. Where the fuck is Ed? - Ed's keeping a low profile.<eos> There's way too much heat on him to risk being seen.<eos> All right, where's my tape?<eos> We'll give it to you when we come pick up the bag. No!
Really, it is no trouble at all.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, same procedure as usual.<eos> Uh, the cash will spend the night in here.<eos> In the morning, we'll take it out, divvy it out to the other branches to be paid out to the farmers when they come to cash their checks.
I could just see you staring at somebody for a minute. Like a real, true minute which is a long time to stare.<eos> Tells me you got something brewing up here.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else?<eos> I'm gonna say something else. Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.
It's kind of like a painting of a rose.<eos> You know, it stands out in front of all the others.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I never said that it was from me.<eos> But, whoever it was from, they put a lot of thought into it. So...
I can't take it with me.<eos> I want it to be safe.<eos> It's my life's work, you know that.<eos> Of course, Szymon, yes.<eos> We can put it in the basement.
Attention.<eos> Tomorrow the evacuation of the ghetto will begin.<eos> Pack your belongings, and prepare for resettlement.<eos> And now, listen to an old story.<eos> I wrote it for you.
No, no, no!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Hard a-starboard!<eos> There, your celestial fix was off.<eos> I've adjusted it two degrees north.
I'm trying!<eos> The stars will soon be gone.<eos> Carina!<eos> Henry, look, the island is there!<eos> You found it!
This was the worst pyramid scheme since the actual pyramids.<eos> - Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen. - Paul Schaffer:<eos> Yeah. And they say that her favorite dish there is the veal scallo-Ponzi.<eos> Listen, I have something to tell you that's really important.<eos> I have your money! I can get it to you.
They're taking everything.<eos> They even said to me, "We're gonna need your underwear and nightgowns."<eos> - Who said that? - US Marshals.<eos> What would they want your underwear for?<eos> They're gonna sell it.
Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.<eos> You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that...<eos> Or I'll have to put an arrow through your lard-loving thigh.<eos> You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?<eos> That's right, Jack, and they gave it to me.
- Okay, bye. - All right.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> - Now you're breaking it.
I have to say you really made me earn this.<eos> You think you know more than me about reality?<eos> I'm only a writer, right?<eos> I'm gonna show you reality.<eos> You build it.
When you close your eyes... Do you dream of me?<eos> I don't dream at all.<eos> No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.<eos> I found perfection here.<eos> I've created it.
Don't you know that you're the one that I've been waiting for all of this time?<eos> Now pick up the shovel. Pick it up!<eos> Pick up the shovel!<eos> Go on.<eos> Just take it.
- Steven, stop!<eos> - Leave me alone!<eos> Another precious moment.<eos> There was joy, too.<eos> His madness swept it away.
Old, selfish.<eos> I do not understand, "woe".<eos> I was to give you my kidney last week.<eos> Most likely it does not suit me.<eos> I used to give it to you anyway.
Hey, phone's free if you want.<eos> You good?<eos> Yup. Yeah. Yup.<eos> Hey, bro, you know, we're finally gonna get a chance to get these guys.<eos> Then we can finish the pump station, fix it, go home.
I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.<eos> Shops, businesses, neighbors, family.<eos> Friends was just one more class of victim.<eos> In the morning, when you were gone with my money, I was furious, but also I thought,<eos> "'Course he's taken it.
He's really shot up...<eos> What the fuck are you talking about, Murphy?<eos> Aye, carry on, Spud.<eos> Finish your story.<eos> 'Cause we're all dying to hear it.
- Mom, just for a minute.<eos> Can we see the island?<eos> What do you say, Mom?<eos> It's not every day you get to see a deserted island.<eos> Why don't we just check it out?
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
There it is!<eos> Shit, it's not here.<eos> Oh! Come on!<eos> Man, it's all burnt up!<eos> He's still got it in his mind.
Let's see that.<eos> Aah! Damn thing cut me!<eos> where's your card?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Styvesan told the boss that you did have it.
Styvesan told the boss that you did have it.<eos> He said that you said that it was your best card ever.<eos> So, tell it!<eos> Ask the woman.<eos> She saw it.
Taking this.<eos> See? We're expendable.<eos> They fired Irv.<eos> This school's gonna fuck me?<eos> I'm gonna fuck it!
So here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna frame Strickland for a crime he didn't commit.<eos> Wait. What? You're gonna do what?<eos> Something occurred to me as I was getting dragged down a flight of stairs by a horse on meth.<eos> I get some meth, right? I stick it in his classroom or some shit.
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you<eos> Or anything that you do<eos> Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<eos> I heard you got a new man I see you takin' a pic<eos> Then you post it up Thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
Even before the lightning, they would not go near it.<eos> Of course they were.<eos> They know what happen to those who disturb the relic.<eos> Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the stories, brother.<eos> Or else you would not be so eager to remove it.
Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the stories, brother.<eos> Or else you would not be so eager to remove it.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Before we have such a fine gold box to keep it in.<eos> Other foreigners tried to take it.
- We are soldiers of Christ.<eos> Yet you would run from a mere scandaious?<eos> In the name of St. Matthias. Whose relic we are honored to bring to the feet of the Holy Sea, I bless and purify this water.<eos> In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> I scatter the demons that are tainted it, and consent them to everlasting hell, where they shall be bound in firing chains, and crushed under the heel of God Almighty.
Hello and welcome.<eos> I'm Landsat field supervisor, Victor Nieves.<eos> This is my colleague Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.<eos> Our expedition takes us to a place every nautical trade route known to man has avoided for centuries.<eos> As our satellites show, the island is surrounded by a perpetual storm system, allowing it to remain hidden from the outside world.
I know!<eos> So what are we going to do?<eos> This is the edge of the island.<eos> Weaver, get up on those rocks and fire a flare.<eos> With any luck, Brooks will see it.
I want to show you my favourite room.<eos> No, let's go in here.<eos> So you've had another one of your little meetings?<eos> Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.<eos> Confession is good for the soul, providing you can delete it.
The file!<eos> See! I was right.<eos> No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.
Go, go!<eos> Launch initiated.<eos> I'm launching my Forever Puppies, and there's nothing you can do about it!<eos> No!<eos> Baby Corp stole all the love from me... and now I'm going to take it back from them.
- Yeah, have a seat.<eos> Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "This is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.
Now, we can all agree that this sentence,<eos> "This is a wall," is a truth claim.<eos> This wall is real.<eos> I see it, you see it.<eos> We can touch it.
If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.<eos> This information seems pretty important to you.<eos> Don't worry. I'll get it for you.
He got in the upper cupboard again. And I am not going another day with a leaking pipe.<eos> It soaked the pantry floor, and we're gonna get that black mold, Frank!<eos> Did you call them?<eos> Yes. They're very busy.<eos> They know all about the leaking pipe and promise to have it fixed by tomorrow night.
That would mean that he... somehow miraculously survived a plane crash... in the Himalayas... and that, for some unknown reason, he waited 15 years to come back with no shoes and a tendency toward violence.<eos> I know...<eos> We'll get to the bottom of this.<eos> Either way, this is the right thing to do, you know?<eos> This guy... whoever he is, he needs help, and we've made sure he's getting it.
I'm not gonna just walk away.<eos> Not without a fight.<eos> Joy, this isn't a fight we can win.<eos> Well, that may not be true.<eos> If... if I can put together a solid strategy, will you at least consider it?
You said you had this under control.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I just...<eos> - I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.
- Yeah.<eos> I really screwed things up with him.<eos> I don't want the same thing to happen with you.<eos> When my parents died, I... I always felt this need to find a family.<eos> At first, I... I thought it could be in K'un-Lun.
Xiaoguang!<eos> Hi, I am Xiaoguang.<eos> Do you remember the treasure your father was searching for his entire life?<eos> Here is the treasure map.<eos> Doctor brought it from India.
Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun.<eos> Before I learned of the substance.<eos> And before I started the organization.<eos> And she was intelligent, kind...<eos> And death took her from me before I learned how to defeat it.
But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera, but actually just one of these?<eos> This camera needs no wires.<eos> It transmits this image via satellite.<eos> I set up that camera this morning.<eos> I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit, nothing.
- Beets are in season.<eos> - Looks delicious.<eos> Any trouble giving the horses glucosamine?<eos> Um, I saw a vet and...<eos> And he said they don't really need it, so you decided to give it back to me.
Jesus.<eos> - You'd think all the pressure would blast us through.<eos> No, it's just squeezing me further into the stuck!<eos> Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.<eos> - Just rip it off.
- No, no, no.<eos> - No surrender.<eos> No man left behind.<eos> We got to get to the top of that slide.<eos> And raw-dog the shit out of it!
- What?<eos> If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here.<eos> You said you couldn't rip through it.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But Sherman can chew through it!
Is doing cocaine every morning your routine, Frank? - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Frank, how's Wolf Cola doing?<eos> I'm selling it to the Jews in Boca Raton. They're slurping it up like candy. They're...<eos> I'm telling you, they're addicted. If I recall, Wolf Cola used to just be, like, a money laundering front. Well, it was, but I'm selling it now by the truckload.<eos> I mean, they can't get enough of it.
So, technically, that ticket is mine!<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.<eos> Miss Reynolds bought the ticket with Mr. Reynolds' money.<eos> But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.
- 50/50 split?<eos> - ...out of the way!<eos> - Nothing for the man<eos> - who paid for the ticket?<eos> - I bought it!
!<eos> I got the crate.<eos> So what?<eos> !<eos> Open it.
Sleep well?<eos> I did.<eos> This boat is really beautiful.<eos> This is from my yard in Seattle.<eos> You built it?
- Can I have a piano?<eos> - No.<eos> Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?<eos> You know I have a book called: Fundamentals of Decision Making.<eos> You can borrow it.
- Girl Scouts?<eos> - No. Then what did she do with all that time?<eos> She loved the mathematics.<eos> It was her passion.<eos> She preferred it to all other things.
It's very very honorable thing you're doing.<eos> Therefore.. I am here to help.<eos> Unofficially, of course.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> If there's another weapon's facility, find it and destroy it.
We are all to blame.<eos> I am not.<eos> But maybe I am!<eos> Please.<eos> If you believe that this war should stop... if you want to stop it... help me stop it right now.
Hello?<eos> He killed her. Warning, warning.<eos> Temple power system failure.<eos> Power dropped off a cliff.<eos> -But what drained it?
Works for me.<eos> You like to read?<eos> I got a good collection on psychology.<eos> Just finished reading The Human Animal.<eos> I'll send it over with some of my favourites.
We're gonna stand up, you ready? Come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> Shit just got real.<eos> You, put your gun down, put your gun down.<eos> Take that cocaine, put it in our case and shut it.
There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.<eos> He's come from the river. He's in the garden.<eos> If it's someone you fuck, please check if he came from east or west.<eos> In the east, there is cholera.<eos> You can catch it from fucking.
It seemed like forever.<eos> - When... - Oh.<eos> I'm going out, Lucy.<eos> I-I see the mailman. I'm gonna collect the mail.<eos> But he'll bring it in.
Beverly?<eos> Do you want to have dinner with me?<eos> Hawk.<eos> Electricity is humming.<eos> You hear it in the mountains and rivers.
- Hear, hear. - To love.<eos> Yeah, things definitely got a little tense when our mothers started discussing the seating chart.<eos> Tense?<eos> Uh, my mother almost threw a centerpiece at Ella's head.<eos> No, Diane said that she knocked it across the room by accident and I, for one, I believe her.
Let's lose Fox News.<eos> Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.<eos> - Already written it.
- So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.<eos> - Already written it.<eos> - When?<eos> It's already written.<eos> Did it last night.
- Already written it.<eos> - When?<eos> It's already written.<eos> Did it last night.<eos> Needs a little flesh on the bone, but basically it's written.
If we're gonna win the trust of this country, we can't be seen to accept that there's a whole chunk of it we can't handle.<eos> We're here to provide security.<eos> I say the first order of business is we secure that corner of the country everyone else seems to think we can't control.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.
I wanted to talk to you about the petition thing, about the play.<eos> There's been some concern about it being appropriate.<eos> There's a petition to stop the play?<eos> That play was kind of like a lifeline for Madeline. You know, it tethered her to a purpose.<eos> I signed it.
I'm in a rush.<eos> - Man's in a rush. - Yes, thank you.<eos> Here's the terms.<eos> Wrap stays on the car for ninety days. Yes.<eos> You take it off before that, you have to pay us the money back.
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't even breathe.<eos> But, how do you explain to a small child that he has to take care of himself, because his mom wants to lock herself in her room and cry?<eos> But I have a trick for when I'm very sad to lift me up.<eos> Anti-depressants?<eos> I take any sad song, and transform it into a salsa.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you were only using him to seduce the grandmother of the girl he likes?<eos> I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Where is Hugo's camera?<eos> I promise I'll get it back to you.
I can't believe that I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Where is Hugo's camera?<eos> I promise I'll get it back to you.<eos> So, you were the one who stole it.
Go on.<eos> His mom conjured him. To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?
We need Parrish.<eos> So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore," she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void. So she filled it with her son.
Every time.<eos> No. We just need more time.<eos> No.<eos> The longer this thing stays open...<eos> The bigger the bust when you finally shut it down.
Where do you think he'll go?<eos> Depends on whether or not he takes the money.<eos> - If he doesn't take it...<eos> - He did.<eos> He took it.
A decision has been made.<eos> You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.<eos> I will take you to our border.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then you will step over it.
You can't hurt me.<eos> I'm protected by the wizard.<eos> But he's not.<eos> He's protected by magic. And the wizard hates magic.<eos> Can you break it?
Close your eyes.<eos> Now tell me, what do you feel?<eos> Hatred.<eos> For The Wizard and the man who killed my family.<eos> Absorb it.
Now tell me, what do you feel?<eos> Hatred.<eos> For The Wizard and the man who killed my family.<eos> Absorb it.<eos> Take it with you.
But this isn't about me. It's about what's best for oz.<eos> What's that?<eos> I'm sending you home.<eos> Whatever you did to get here, tell me, so I can send you back.<eos> Well, let me just, initiate the sequence, if I can remember what it is.
We need to hurry.<eos> You... you know how this works?<eos> I built this machine. - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, to get home to you, then the wizard took it for himself.
Tell me.<eos> She's a prisoner...<eos> Of the beast forever.<eos> No.<eos> And only you can stop it.
- How much?<eos> - Mm.<eos> A cache of gems.<eos> Spain is willing to burn Nassau to the ground.<eos> The only way Rogers can prevent this is to find the cache and return it, which means if we were to find it first, we could dictate what happens next.
I was always told that you were the one without fear.<eos> Was I misinformed?<eos> It ain't fear to want to do a hard thing smart.<eos> He wants this fight.<eos> Let him have it.
Increase them how?<eos> The Underhill plantation.<eos> It's the largest and richest of the interior estates, and it's home to well over 200 slaves.<eos> It's well-defended.<eos> Until now, I haven't had the manpower to take it.
In Gandhi's non-violent struggle, the call for self-rule echoes throughout the country.<eos> But another soldier of this battle for freedom,<eos> Subhash Chandra Bose, is dismissive about Gandhi's non-violent ways.<eos> He believes that freedom has to be fought for, not sought after.<eos> It will be attained by fighting fire with fire.
I can't risk Julia's life knowingly.<eos> Mr. Billimoria..<eos> Please trust us.<eos> - This one.<eos> This is the frame, take it out.
Your turn.<eos> I'm.. An untouchable.<eos> That scar on your back?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> How did you get it?
You're gonna be Francis Llewellyn Poncherello.<eos> That's a fucked up name.<eos> That's a lot of names.<eos> Well, that's too bad because we already built the bio.<eos> What are we gonna do, go and change it?
They'll have to give me Springer's job because there's no-one else with all the information.<eos> Information that would allow the SS to take over the nuclear experiments from the Army?<eos> Do you realise, this bomb, it could really work, if we put enough resources into it?<eos> The Army don't believe in it because it would make them and their troops redundant.<eos> SS leadership is the only way it will come to pass.
A genial fellow, presumably dead now.<eos> His sister was a beauty, raven-haired and... a little wild.<eos> Late one night, she showed me their priest hole.<eos> Catholics, you see.<eos> And being good Catholics... they put it to good use.
He would've never done that when we were together.<eos> Never!<eos> But for Bonnie, he's Mr. Fucking Sacrifice.<eos> Why don't you bottle up some of that anger<eos> - and put it to good use?
I wanted to believe that tape meant a lot of things.<eos> That our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> Then I saw the picture.<eos> I saw Skye's face.<eos> You saw it, too.
Everything that's known about the tape is in there.<eos> It'll be more of a help to you than I can be.<eos> A man never quite measures up to his work.<eos> The images on the tape, they were her story.<eos> She wanted it to be heard.
You have one.<eos> Be glad.<eos> It will be the war you die in.<eos> Tell the believers and the non-believers: tell them we've taken the spring.<eos> They can have it back when they pray for it.
Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years, and it wasn't until recently it was perfected<eos> by my own flesh and blood.<eos> My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group.
Oh, you know I miss those.<eos> Dots and dashes, secret code.<eos> There was drama in there.<eos> Someone gave you an envelope, you got anticipation.<eos> What's in there? So you'd open it very slowly.
No note?<eos> Nothing?<eos> No.<eos> He got a phone?<eos> He left it in his room.
But then I went before the court.<eos> So we had to moved it up to the California Supreme Court.<eos> Fornication in a public place, that was the charge.<eos> And I said, "Man, I'm not sticking my dick in these women."<eos> I'm moving it to the side.
Attendance alerts?<eos> You need to make sure you are marked present by all teachers, and the first two weeks, they have to note your participation.<eos> But why am I on these?<eos> I have good attendance.<eos> Someone wants to make sure you keep it that way.
So you could help me touch just one person?<eos> What? I doubt it.<eos> People like you don't make selfless moves.<eos> Oh, my God, dude, this shit is crazy!<eos> "Today I am wearing lacy black underwear with the sole purpose of knowing that I am wearing it."
I needed to be someone new.<eos> Have you ever felt like that?<eos> I wasn't going to be invisible anymore.<eos> I was going to start brand new.<eos> I was going to cut away the past... and leave it all behind.
- Sure.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Gary?<eos> Listen, the Bakers considered our offer to settle.<eos> And they've turned it down.
Never ever become a therapist.<eos> Now please, piss off before I top myself.<eos> And according to the local council, the river was last dredged in 1994.<eos> Obviously that doesn't necessarily mean this went in the water after then.<eos> The last dredge could've just missed it.
when it comes to those who are wanting to be alone.<eos> I thought our efforts would be quiet enough to fall beneath your notice.<eos> You're the one who opened the door.<eos> Tripped my wire.<eos> Thought I caught it in time.
It might.<eos> Yeah, I'll show you.<eos> All right, here's the first one.<eos> Cross it over your hand like that.<eos> Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up, and back through, then...
- What can I do?<eos> - Make him an offer.<eos> - I'll make him a verbal offer.<eos> - Write it down.<eos> So you can shop it.
So hot.<eos> This is how I'm gonna die.<eos> Oh, God, moisture.<eos> Oh, God, the moisture...<eos> Dial it back, God.
This is how I'm gonna die.<eos> Oh, God, moisture.<eos> Oh, God, the moisture...<eos> Dial it back, God.<eos> Dial it back a little bit here!
Which, hard to leave a...<eos> But good news, you're here and we're in the black now.<eos> Stussy Corp and well your firm was nice enough to...<eos> Mr. Ehrmantraut, your broker, he... he arranged for your firm to lend us that money last year.<eos> We're happy to say we're ready to pay it back in full.
Lief Ericson saw her when he was driving home.<eos> - Where's her head? - It's gone.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Then why did you ask?<eos> We think it's been taken.
I need to speak to Munk.<eos> Hey. How was Vuko?<eos> Cool.<eos> In fact... I was thinking, now that we've sold the boat... we can afford to move there.<eos> You sold it?
Oh, and she just blurted it out, right?<eos> No, but err, she's been having an affair with him for years and it would be bad for her if her husband found out.<eos> I see.<eos> Woah. You really are, you're just so pissed off at everybody, aren't you?<eos> I gave my life to that job, I want to know why I lost it!
I'll find him there and secure his assistance.<eos> I must strongly advise against it, against you and the governor being gone in this moment.<eos> We are so very close to winning this war and finally bringing Nassau out of the dark.<eos> But I fear we cannot complete the victory on our own.<eos> We're going to need help, and this is the only way I know how to get it.
Gogetthebook!<eos> Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!
People used to steal 'em.<eos> Anyhoo, he looks through it, and then just tears a page out.<eos> Which, it's a public book, which... Meant for everyone.<eos> So, I raise a ruckus.<eos> Can I see it?
They're having a Santa conference.<eos> Not sure why they chose here.<eos> Any valuables in the bag?<eos> Not really. Mostly flannel.<eos> Think I'll get it back?
- What?<eos> What are they? - A mild sedative. Something to stop the engines racing.<eos> Now... I want you to picture an island.<eos> Tropical island, somewhere warm. South Pacific, perhaps.<eos> Can you see it?
I gave you the wrong coin.<eos> The one I gave you was my lucky coin.<eos> Well, you can't afford to be too careless with a lucky coin.<eos> Something like that, you wanna hang on to.<eos> Tell you what, I'll give you your lucky coin back when you tell me how you plucked it out of thin air.

Hey, did you give Pernell my cell phone number?<eos> No.<eos> Well, he left a message for you.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> Want to hear it?
They come every day.<eos> Tammy leaves seeds for them.<eos> Mind if I... $471 and 26 cents.<eos> What was he doing with all that cash?<eos> You want it?
Some stars shining and dark shadows around them.<eos> That's like thirst and water.<eos> Right next to each other, without ever becoming one.<eos> If they did it would make the most glorious planet.<eos> Do you know what it would be called?
And this way, at least, my death will achieve something.<eos> Just promise you'll look after them, and never leave them.<eos> I promise.<eos> I don't want to be buried with the winners.<eos> A war can only end well if it's lost.
Well, for the last several years, I've been thinking about the summers I spent here.<eos> You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.<eos> And the tire swing.<eos> It used to break every summer, and every summer Grandpa would fix it.
I'm telling you, Vince, he's here.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, you know that stakeout I insisted on?<eos> I left Cole on it.
I'm not on his side.<eos> Sekou's facing 15 years in prison here.<eos> You're on a side.<eos> You gave him $5,000, which you're saying was for a man in Africa, a jihadi.<eos> And if that's what the money was for and Sekou took it, tell Simone and tell me, and we'll listen.
I'm of Bebbanburg.<eos> Yes, you are. You are.<eos> Is it your intention to build an army?<eos> Oh, last night I was still a slave.<eos> Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.
Fiske?<eos> It is true, Lord, we heard it from traders.<eos> Where are these traders?<eos> We heard the same story three times, five times...<eos> We heard it three times.
He was friends with Michael.<eos> Hey, John, I read your book.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.
Okay.<eos> You did it!<eos> On the seventh-year anniversary of the Sudden Departure,<eos> I believe the rains will come, and with them a great flood.<eos> I have to sing to make it stop.
I have $20,000 in cash strapped to my body.<eos> - Lock the door.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I borrowed your duct tape.<eos> They would've seen it if I walked through the scanner.
Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?
Why?<eos> Anemia, glucose, potassium, heavy metals, and pregnancy.<eos> Well, I'm definitely not pregnant.<eos> Right. Your IUD.<eos> You'll need to have it removed before you go through.
He coming, too?<eos> No.<eos> He gave me something for you, though.<eos> He says he's sorry he didn't put you in his fucking book.<eos> Who torched it?
Of course I do.<eos> And this one time, they brought us to a baseball game, and I was too young to get the rules, so I...<eos> I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.
I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.<eos> But then the ball went into the aisle... and this usher ran down and grabbed it and he picked it up, and he just squeezed the air out of it.
Will you stay?<eos> I can't.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Got your lighter.<eos> You can keep it.
So, right now in this moment, what do you want to do?<eos> How?<eos> How would you see it done?<eos> One of you surrenders himself and remains here to ensure these terms are honored.<eos> You send someone to retrieve the cache, and once it arrives, I take possession of it.
Move.<eos> Put your hands behind your head and move over there.<eos> Hands above your head now.<eos> You have a gun around your waist.<eos> Put it on the floor and slide it over to me, slowly.
I just heard from Keith.<eos> An operation Eric Carter is running has turned up a promising lead.<eos> We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help.<eos> CTU's launching an operation.<eos> Keith's asked if I'll oversee it with him.
This is where I do all my reading.<eos> I don't use the ballroom at all.<eos> You'll have to redo the floors.<eos> Laundry room.<eos> You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.
Greeting your mother.<eos> I'm here to talk about buying the boat.<eos> That was my granddad's boat.<eos> I know.<eos> You sure you wanna buy it?
No one.<eos> I summoned only the two of you.<eos> My daughter... is everything to me, as I believe she is to you.<eos> But that cache is critical to the success of the war we're about to begin.<eos> And worse yet, if it were to be dug out of the ground under cover of night, it would do irreparable damage to our allies' trust in us.
The men said it sounded to them like the voice of God... warning them to stay away.<eos> It's an open question how much of this story Avery invented.<eos> But what is undeniably true is how undeniably effective that story has been in achieving a result.<eos> Captain...<eos> It's no accident that Billy chose it.
Is that all right?<eos> We found him.<eos> I don't see the chest.<eos> Track marks go back 200 yards.<eos> He dragged it here.
Two hundred yards, give or take.<eos> More.<eos> He never would have got this far ahead of your men carrying that chest.<eos> The chest was never here.<eos> He left it behind.
More.<eos> He never would have got this far ahead of your men carrying that chest.<eos> The chest was never here.<eos> He left it behind.<eos> You think they'll figure it out that we dropped it down here?
He never would have got this far ahead of your men carrying that chest.<eos> The chest was never here.<eos> He left it behind.<eos> You think they'll figure it out that we dropped it down here?<eos> We need to get it in the ground. Come on.
Even as shitty returns, the outflow of institutional money, and the rise of quant funds have lighted the way to our demise, we have willfully refused to change.<eos> In the great expanse of time, we are already dead.<eos> I know it even if you don't.<eos> But in this microsecond that we are still breathing air, I'm gonna fight the inevitable.<eos> If you have a card in front of you, pick it up, hold it in front of your face.
Well, the place is cleaned daily, isn't it?<eos> Usually, but we've been a bit short-handed this last month.<eos> So how many people used cubicle two after Miss Palfrey died?<eos> Nobody.<eos> We shut it up, out of respect.
Today the Pilgrim capsule, with its valuable Mars soil samples, completes its eight-month return from Mars.<eos> Preparing to receive these samples has been the purpose of our mission these last few months.<eos> But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged.<eos> At 0630 UTC, Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course.<eos> Rory Adams will spacewalk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule, and he will grab it with a remote arm.
The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts, with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space.<eos> My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewall, so, please, honor them for giving everything to this cause.<eos> Mars life-forms should be considered hostile.<eos> Do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capabilities.<eos> Now, we did not learn how to restrain or eliminate it, but if this creature ever reaches Earth, use every available resource to destroy it, or you will risk all human life.
My friends who got separated and I just...<eos> I can't let them fight The Beast on their own.<eos> You want me to come to Fillory with you?<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like, if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast. - Payment is due.
Good evening, gents.<eos> John! Right. Now that we're all here, let's get on with it.<eos> By now you all know my obsession with time travel.<eos> Yes, how is your novel coming?<eos> Have you finished it yet?
It's something from my future, I assume.<eos> Why didn't you write more in this letter?<eos> Trust me, I've been racking my brain.<eos> Clearly, I needed to convince myself to trust Vanessa, but there is a danger to knowing your future.<eos> You would be tempted to alter it.
Talk to me.<eos> I can see that you're upset.<eos> I'm telling you, if I had been in that basement, this needle here wouldn't be in evidence.<eos> Nope.<eos> I would've shoved it down his throat, made sure it punctured every one of his organs on the way down.
I don't know.<eos> I...<eos> I mean, I do remember things. I-I remember watching Cam propose to you, how happy you looked.<eos> I remember that you used to carry a cigarette behind your ear to remind you of your father.<eos> I remember... how proud you were when your book was published, even though I found it to be rather mawkish.
Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Will do.<eos> Why are you holding a plant?<eos> Oh. Uh, it's for the new office.<eos> You like it?
We missed you at the crime scene. - You okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah. Never better.<eos> - Is that the victim's skull?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Angela just finished scanning it so she could do a facial reconstruction.
I'm just not that hungry, that's all.<eos> So, Dr. Brennan, how's the, uh, audiobook career coming?<eos> Don't encourage her.<eos> Very well, thank you.<eos> I finished recording my audition and sent it in to my editor.
The diameter of the hammer's head suggests it was the same one used on Margaret Kwan.<eos> The size of the fractures are identical.<eos> However, the extent to which Mike Reiss was tortured far exceeds what was done to Margaret Kwan.<eos> Margaret's torture appears to have been an effort to obtain information.<eos> Once the killer had it, he quickly ended her life.
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?<eos> I'll make sure everything's okay back here.<eos> Tom, what the hell happened?<eos> Two gunmen ambushed the safe house.<eos> How the hell'd they find it?
Like contact solution?<eos> Well, uh, that could suggest a double red blood cell donation.<eos> Double red cell?<eos> Yeah. It's a rare type of donation.<eos> I do it myself, but you can only give every four months.
Booth?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, I gave your bag to Arastoo.<eos> Oh, my purse?<eos> I-I thought Michelle had it.
It was... It was a genius move.<eos> But you made it very clear during the generals that you did not want my help.<eos> I didn't need it.<eos> San Benito county begs to differ.<eos> You had it right in your hand, and you let it go.
There's another message?<eos> Before I hacked the server, someone else went in and manually deleted a message off the tip line.<eos> - What does it say?<eos> - Well, we don't know yet.<eos> I'm trying to recover it.
- Well, we don't know yet.<eos> I'm trying to recover it.<eos> Frankie Vargas passed away before he was able to inhabit the office he was elected to.<eos> But his achievements, his selfless work, and his dreams shine a light forward for all of us.<eos> And even though we don't have the message, we do have the cellphone number of the person who left it.
You don't have to introduce me to your little posse.<eos> Just tell me where you got the dress?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The dress.<eos> Where did it come from?
What is it?<eos> It's you.<eos> You mean, you guys have been sitting on this...<eos> The game showed up a couple of days after the blind school.<eos> We've been hiding it at Spencer's.
Ali's baby.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.
No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> They put it back.
The girls are just easy targets.<eos> Please, look me in the eye and tell me that Hanna is not in any kind of trouble.<eos> She's not.. In trouble.<eos> Sheila, thatthat swing has been hanging from that tree since we bought the house.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to take it down.
- Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Are you absolutely sure about this?<eos> Mona has the game.<eos> She not only has it, she's accessing the guts of the thing.
Some, um... fatherly advice on how to deal with having a father that's, um... you.<eos> Is this blood freaking you out like it's freaking me out? Yeah, yeah.<eos> Let me, uh...<eos> Scofield said that it would deliver me. Both of us.<eos> All I have to do is just get it to him.
Well, if I was the owner, wouldn't it make it my money?<eos> Chief is dead.<eos> I got shot.<eos> That is our money.<eos> I don't want to sound like your mom, but where'd you last see it?
You understand?<eos> Before you know it, you'll deserve to survive.<eos> I hope so.<eos> The youth that inherited the earth.<eos> And they have 6 months to save it.
How do you know that?<eos> Call it faith.<eos> Faith might work with Comanches, but not with those bankers downstairs. They want hard evidence.<eos> You got anything real? Anything at all?<eos> Phineas, if you had the money, would you invest it here, in oil?
- You were a baby. I didn't hold you enough. I didn't bond with you.<eos> And, of course, that's true. I didn't know about postpartum depression.<eos> - I don't think that's it.<eos> - Well, anyway...<eos> I spoke to Jean Williamson about it.
Why?<eos> Your test was compromised.<eos> They need you back in on Monday morning.<eos> By compromised you mean...<eos> I dropped it, accidentally.
It was my probation officer's idea -- always leave by nine o'clock or two pints, whichever comes first.<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing.<eos> I won't bother next time.<eos> That sculpture...<eos> Did Caroline Andersen make it?
You asked for a map of this place.<eos> Bajie always delivers.<eos> You sure this is accurate?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I got it from the oldest Picker in here.
Yeah, Rip yarded us in.<eos> You remember his speech?<eos> I know you don't. You were too busy running your mouth.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> You just said it word for word.
Oh, I can't believe you did all of this in three days.<eos> Am I reading this right... did you get the rehearing moved up?<eos> Yeah. Those are three possible dates, pending your and Kevin's schedule.<eos> The soonest I could get is the 4th.<eos> You moved it up almost three weeks.
Go fish.<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> Give me the blade.<eos> You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?<eos> Just give it to me!
They only want Ramal.<eos> Our best chance of saving Sid is getting out of here.<eos> Make them forget about him, start chasing us.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now pick it up. String the cord and pull it through.
- Exactly.<eos> We're seriously screwed here.<eos> Unless I can make this one bullet count.<eos> What?<eos> You sure as hell made it count, kid.
That's the point, no one knows him.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> You play his game.<eos> You wear your own mask.<eos> As soon as you get a chance to get away with Mike, you take it, disappear.
Ohh. Just what I needed.<eos> Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you fallin' asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah. It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even... Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?<eos> No matter how good they try to be,<eos> Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
That's what Valentine wants.<eos> You know that if you touch that sword, he can destroy the entire Downworld, including Simon.<eos> No, Valentine needs an energy source.<eos> He needs lightning.<eos> He's got it.
So much for sunny California.<eos> Wh-we're done here, we need to go to the 1600 block of Vine Street.<eos> - Why, pray tell?<eos> - It's where Frank Sinatra's star is on the Walk of Fame.<eos> I have always wanted to see it.
I'm saying you're feeling something, and in the wake of your partner's demise, that's perfectly normal.<eos> I don't do feelings.<eos> Run the test, fix my brain.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> Sara asked us to find any physical descriptions of the spear that might help us find it.
Thanks for believing in me, H.R.<eos> Hey, I've been looking for the right time to tell you.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Right before H.R. died, he asked me to give you a message.<eos> Tell... tell Cisco... this took strength, and he gave it to me.
Okay, there's no question that it's him, and that explains why I was afraid of him and why I left.<eos> Well, it makes more sense than this.<eos> Okay, except the prosecution is gonna ask to see the DNA report, and they're gonna see that a third set of DNA was tested, and that could lead them to Doug Harvey.<eos> - And if they found out how you got that toothbrush...<eos> - I found it... in his garbage bin on the street.
Where's Walker's man?<eos> Curtis and Rory are keeping eyes on him.<eos> I think she means protecting him from me.<eos> Oliver, I still think it's a mistake not pushing this scum bag for the location of the sale.<eos> We don't have to. We're gonna have it within the hour.
Bomb's not here.<eos> Walker was headed for the hangar.<eos> Odds are that's where the nuke is.<eos> Felicity! Why the ruse?<eos> Why sell a nuclear weapon once when I can steal it back and sell it to another rebel sucker?
And he said those would be your exact words.<eos> - The bomb is in countdown mode.<eos> - What? ! It's wired with a failsafe.<eos> We must have triggered it when we entered the hangar.<eos> - Can you disarm it?
Fortunately, for us we have both friends and money.<eos> As I assume your presence here means that our, uh, ahem, arrangement has, uh, borne fruit.<eos> The shipment was routed to this location.<eos> The BIC codes are inside.<eos> All you have to do is retrieve it.
Mom, come on, that's not... That's not really a thing.<eos> I mean, like, it should be private.<eos> Well, in our family it's a thing.<eos> Simon's father started this tradition 13 years ago.<eos> And now we keep it alive in his memory.
Jace?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Where is he?<eos> I can only direct you toward the correct path.<eos> You must walk it yourself. Ithuriel, please.
It's because I've always admired your courage, and your honesty.<eos> It's the stuff that great leaders are made from.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> What did you send to Imogen?<eos> The Clave is keeping a massive secret of their own, and I threatened to reveal it.
Filled up around her. Froze solid.<eos> It's her.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Blue hoodie.<eos> She was wearing it when she disappeared.
It's not a bio-toxin, or some genetic toolkit.<eos> It's alien.<eos> You still want to destroy our sample? Yeah.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> Miller wanted to destroy it, too, you know.
Make sure you tell them that.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Fixing the martian flag.<eos> You're defacing it, Picasso.
And they're beaming the data here.<eos> Naomi: It's an abandoned communications relay.<eos> Miller: At least some of the people responsible for Eros are gonna be there.<eos> If we want answers, we have to take that station.<eos> It's floating dark, barely registers on radar but it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.
I must go.<eos> Your clever Mercy lured the waif out with the voice of her dear departed mother.<eos> Nothing incites a mob to violence faster than a threat against a child.<eos> Shh! Quiet.<eos> We are trying to restore your reputation, not blacken it.
She was hardly the only victim of Mary Sibley's lust for power.<eos> And I knew when I saw her sparkling like an unpolished diamond in this den of iniquity, that I had to free her from the cruel circumstances this heartless town had condemned her to.<eos> You are a good and godly man, Magistrate Hathorne.<eos> I am.<eos> Surely love is where we find it.
And I knew when I saw her sparkling like an unpolished diamond in this den of iniquity, that I had to free her from the cruel circumstances this heartless town had condemned her to.<eos> You are a good and godly man, Magistrate Hathorne.<eos> I am.<eos> Surely love is where we find it.<eos> And we have indeed found it.
Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?<eos> We're not poets, Tarly.<eos> Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.<eos> This is your moment.<eos> Use it wisely.
This man deserves our respect.<eos> Fuck respect.<eos> My gift to you.<eos> We'll be telling this story, Shadow.<eos> You can tell it however you like or don't like.
This Friday or not at all.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.<eos> I'm not a fan.<eos> I shan't be holding back.<eos> My audience expects the truth and I give it to them.
Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Get his gun.<eos> Grab the gun!<eos> Give it to me.
Stop!<eos> Get his gun.<eos> Grab the gun!<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to him!
I'm supposed to kill you.<eos> Which leaves us... where?<eos> That's up to you.<eos> I need someone to replace me on the Court.<eos> Someone who can find out what the weapon is and how to stop it.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be.<eos> Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> No.<eos> Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.
The first time you felt the rage after your parents' death...<eos> - Do you remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The rage from that day continues to burn inside of you, feeding on your pain, blinding you from everything else, and, if left unchecked, will one day consume you.<eos> We need to remove it before that happens.
Your uncle's autopsy.<eos> Ballistics came back negative. No match.<eos> But there were microscopic tears along the entry wound, made postmortem.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Someone removed the bullet that killed your uncle and replaced it with another one.
If she did come to you, the only thing she took away is that Mario was totally and completely insane.<eos> Any last requests?<eos> Yes!<eos> My badge.<eos> If I'm gonna die, I want to die wearing it.
The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange... it's gone.<eos> Maybe Lucius took it.<eos> You're the only two with the combination, right?<eos> No.<eos> Lee has it, too.
Yeah, it's growing on me.<eos> And this rifle is growing on me.<eos> Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning of what this bad boy can do.<eos> How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?<eos> Barry stole it for me.
Can't lose her, Cisco.<eos> Please tell me you found a way to change the future.<eos> We found a way to change the future.<eos> Did you really?<eos> No, but Caitlin and I did find a way to map it.
So, where's Julian?<eos> He's taking care of some family matters in London.<eos> Just so you know, we are just friends.<eos> Yeah, the friend zone.<eos> I know it well.
My mom used to always say that musicals have the power to make everything better.<eos> Did it work?<eos> ♪ Can't say how the days will unfold ♪<eos> ♪ Can't change what the future may hold ♪<eos> ♪ But I want you in it ♪
♪ Keep runnin' home ♪<eos> ♪ Home to you ♪<eos> ♪ Can't say how the days will unfold ♪<eos> ♪ Can't change what the future may hold ♪<eos> ♪ But I want you in it ♪
- So, we're building a cannon...<eos> - Right.<eos> Bazooka... thing.<eos> It's a sort of trap.<eos> In order to turn it on, we need something to power it. Something extremely powerful and regenerative.
But you have to stop holding' it over my head.<eos> You know I did it for you.<eos> I know you did.<eos> Now sit yourself down.. 'Cause I made you a grilled cheese sandwich.<eos> I burned it, but now you can't say I never made you a meal.
We got into a heated moment and threw something out the window.<eos> Maybe he should help you look for it, then.<eos> Oh, he took the morning off from work.<eos> Damon: Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know why I want it.
Maybe he should help you look for it, then.<eos> Oh, he took the morning off from work.<eos> Damon: Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know why I want it.<eos> 'Cause whenever I have it, I just feel... Better.
I could've just as easily called Damon.<eos> He has the third piece of the bell, the striker.<eos> What's ths striker?<eos> It's an iron ball.<eos> My sister had him fetch it from the Maxwells.
I got called into a fight at a coffee shop, these two guys almost killed each other.<eos> I feel like Mystic Falls just isn't as safe as it used to be.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Is that ancient Tupperware?<eos> Elena, Bonnie and I made our own time capsule when we were 11 and buried it right under this tree.
Jana tried to get me to smuggle for Burt, too, but I refused.<eos> Then why were you running?<eos> On Jana's last flight, a package went missing.<eos> A package?<eos> So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?
Yeah, well... the guy had a reputation to protect.<eos> You know? One person steals from him, everyone else thinks they can, too.<eos> All right. But then who has the package?<eos> How... how did you find me?<eos> I'm sorry I took it. I was desperate.
In fact, I'm asking you to illuminate the truth for him.<eos> If he's going to make an informed decision about Chlo... about his future here, he needs to know the facts.<eos> Right?<eos> I said please, right?<eos> If this information is as upsetting as you're making it out to be, I'm not interested in being the messenger.
Sam?<eos> Hey.<eos> I can't see.<eos> Did you get a plate?<eos> Yeah, I got it.
Listen, it's not Cass' fault that Heaven has these crazy rules about Nephilim.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> You think... Her name was May, and she was beautiful.<eos> I find that doll disturbing.<eos> Her father gave it to her.
Your daughter.<eos> You think... Her name was May, and she was beautiful.<eos> I find that doll disturbing.<eos> Her father gave it to her.<eos> She loves it.
But now look at you.<eos> You're just sad and pathetically weak.<eos> So now...<eos> I'm gonna help you.<eos> I'm gonna cure you of your human weakness same way I cured my own -- by cutting it out.
I don't know you, and I ain't looking to take any orders from anyone.<eos> Especially some limey paper pusher.<eos> I'm not quite sure you understand, mate.<eos> No, I think I do.<eos> So no offense, but you can take your offer... and you can shove it up your ass.
My name is Dean Wi...<eos> Winchester. My name... my name is...<eos> My... My name is... is...<eos> Gideon Loughlin's address was in his accountant's file.<eos> If the book is there, I'll find it.
We're happy where we are.<eos> So if you want the crown, it's yours.<eos> Otherwise...<eos> Hell, ye...<eos> I'll take it.
Sometimes literally.<eos> And yet, I never slaughtered you, ketch.<eos> Well, we were having a lot of sex at the time.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I've been studying the American situation and how to fix it for years.
Hey.<eos> Where's your big bro?<eos> Right here.<eos> Ooh. Sweet toy.<eos> Yeah, I got it off an old -- new pal of mine.
Who are the flowers from, Trish?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They were left on the front doorstep.<eos> There's a card.<eos> - Do you mind if we take it?
- It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?<eos> When I found it, yeah.<eos> I thought it was something a customer maybe dropped.
20 minutes, Nish said.<eos> Right, come on. Let's get in and rattle his cage.<eos> You searched the whole place two days ago.<eos> That bag wasn't there.<eos> You want us to believe you see a suspicious bag inside one of your sheds, pick it up, leaving your fingerprints and DNA. Scratch around inside.
Then, uh, where's the football?<eos> - Run.<eos> - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Shoot her!<eos> Shoot her!<eos> We threw it back over the fence.
Is that really the closest?<eos> Yes, absolutely, for sure.<eos> Jacquelyn, can you please bring in a very large ruler?<eos> Jacquelyn?<eos> Guess I'll get it myself.
It's Uncle Monty's handwriting.<eos> He must have copied it down during the movie.<eos> We were right next to him.<eos> If he got a message, we would've seen it.<eos> Not if he had some secret way to receive it.
Take the week.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Aaron told me himself.<eos> He shared the information with Speaker Hookstraten... She leaked it to Abe Leonard.
I'm the only one around here who doesn't really do the numbers.<eos> My skill is taking people and making them more of who they are.<eos> This place has some serious fucking problems.<eos> But whatever Axe Capital actually is right now, I know what it's supposed to be at its best.<eos> You're gonna help it get there.
All right, it sounds like you're already on a boat.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Bosch, what the fuck?<eos> I think Woody Woodrow stashed his money there and Dobbs has been tracking it.
It's perforated the colon, severed the iliac artery.<eos> Hang more blood.<eos> All we've got.<eos> The artery's too damaged to repair.<eos> We're gonna tie it off at both ends and bridge-graft the opposing iliac to keep the leg from going ischemic.
I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape? He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?<eos> Because he knew Ernie, bless him, would tell me about it and I would come over to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
Your treat.<eos> We could, yeah.<eos> But, um, you know, dinner's almost ready.<eos> And the fish... I would have just had to throw it out.<eos> All I have to do is toss it in a pan.
And if you're not up to it...<eos> just throwing this out there... maybe you don't need to testify at all.<eos> No, I do.<eos> I'm the only person who can adequately explain the context of that tape.<eos> Otherwise, the defense'll tear it to shreds.
Without physical evidence, I felt that a recorded confession... if I could get one... was my best bet.<eos> On its own, I knew the tape would be somewhat flimsy, but it was a start.<eos> A foundation for a more ironclad case.<eos> I suppose that Jimmy must have felt the tape was decisive evidence on its own.<eos> Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it.
Uh, well, there's been a lot of fuss about it, but you and I have never really talked about this tape you made.<eos> We lost the opportunity when you burglarized my house to destroy it.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Um, and I was in the wrong there.<eos> But, still, I'd like to try and follow your story of why and how you recorded it.
Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly to build a practice that helps an underserved and frankly overlooked segment of our community... the elderly.<eos> You've heard from many of Mr. McGill's clients today.<eos> Every one of them came here gladly in support of their lawyer. Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<eos> He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<eos> He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare. Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.
I can't suddenly turn into...<eos> Hold on.<eos> Uh, repeat after me...<eos> Uh, "For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today<eos> "and have it on the air tomorrow."
So a kind of a payoff.<eos> Then you don't get hit with the taxes.<eos> You think you can make that fly?<eos> If someone came to me with this offer...<eos> I'd sure as hell take it.
I've read your file.<eos> You've got all the qualifications for detective and then some, so...<eos> Look, I really appreciate what you're trying to do here... all this technology... but it doesn't solve cases, cops do.<eos> You haven't met my technology. Just try it out.<eos> And you know, if I'm wrong, then I will leave you alone. But if you like it, you'll help me out.
All right, come on.<eos> Run along, now.<eos> I got writing to do.<eos> I'm working on my autobiography.<eos> What do you think I should call it?
Now you're gonna help us find her.<eos> How did my team access the facility?<eos> You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.<eos> Which shut down the network.<eos> I want you to get it back up.
I guess.<eos> How's the case going?<eos> You think he did it?<eos> Between you and me... he's kind of a kook.<eos> This is my first murder case, so as long as I just get it to trial, then it's good for my career.
- Going to find out who's trying to kill you and why.<eos> Don't want you meeting with anyone<eos> - until I know it's safe.<eos> - I can't not meet an Asset.<eos> You asked for my help, and now you're gonna get it.
What?<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'll take it and you won't regret it.
He has an extremely long reach, your father.<eos> And he's sunk every last penny that we have into this deal.<eos> Dad really is...<eos> Dad is a businessman.<eos> He saw an opportunity, and he took it.
If you'll kindly take your seats.<eos> I'd like to start the memorial with a few words about Jason.<eos> You are only going to make things worse.<eos> The last time I saw Jason, I was wearing this dress.<eos> I know it's impossible. But I swear, when I put it on, it... It feels like he's in the room with me.
You know, like, mother-to-mother?<eos> Oh, yeah, no.<eos> Please, Mom, she really needs our help.<eos> Fred. You try to hire my crew on the first day of construction?<eos> Opportunity knocks when it knocks.
Who are all these people?<eos> Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.<eos> They smell blood in the water.<eos> That's why they're here.<eos> They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
It's no wonder they've descended upon us like some biblical plague.<eos> "Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.<eos> The annual tapping ceremony portends each season's bounty."<eos> Now, I've performed this ceremony many times in my life.<eos> My son Jason, when he came of age, performed it as well.
Why do I feel like I'm suddenly left out?<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> We went to your dad's trailer to...<eos> To search it, Jughead.
We all did.<eos> Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.<eos> Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.<eos> That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Actually, Hiram and I have talked, and we'd like to buy you out.<eos> Fred.<eos> I've dragged you into a situation that you never wanted to be a part of.<eos> Make me an offer in writing.<eos> I'll consider it.
Go!<eos> Yeah...<eos> Got it.<eos> They say they're gettin' ready for the coming apocalypse, is all.<eos> They're causin' it, more like.
Sorry, I didn't have time to tidy up.<eos> I've been working on something.<eos> Really? What... what are you working on?<eos> I'm working on a suspense novel.<eos> I think in the right hands, when it's complete, It'll make quite a good little movie.
so what--what are we gonna do with...<eos> Where we gonna put her?<eos> - A spot in the woods, up the mountain pass.<eos> There'll be snow there, and there's that beautiful little clearing by the abandoned cabin.<eos> We found it there once when we were collecting foliage on an out-- - yeah, whatever.
We're sitting on our hands waiting for a miracle.<eos> We don't have to wait.<eos> We can use the Machine.<eos> No, it's too unstable.<eos> We can stabilize it, you and me.
You can put it to good use and take Charlie out for a nice dinner.<eos> Yeah, yeah, at least to a drive-thru.<eos> Thank you, guys.<eos> I love it. I...<eos> I'm gonna take it for a spin!
There is a growing resistance movement outside the colony.<eos> What if this was an attempt to recover our hosts' missing gauntlet and take it beyond our walls?<eos> I made contact with the pilot.<eos> I represent a resistance group based outside the colony.<eos> I'm here because the real war is about to begin, and that thing you stole, it's gonna help us win it.
Neither of you.<eos> Shelagh, don't make yourself ill with anxiety about this.<eos> I'm just afraid I won't remember everything.<eos> Things moved so fast during the accident.<eos> Your nerve didn't fail you then, and it won't fail you today.
And it's spilling out of me like milk.<eos> Somebody take him!<eos> Thank you for looking after him.<eos> Oh, he'll need his hankie.<eos> You keep it, Dot.
We are not machines and nor are our patients.<eos> District practice has variables that precludes such a rigid approach.<eos> We're treading a very fine line here.<eos> I am not certain that Sister Ursula is altogether fit to be making these decisions.<eos> Nurse Crane... Sister Ursula was matron at the Order's cottage hospital when it was closed for inefficient practice.
If you don't mind, and if I'm allowed to choose... .. I'd just like to be called by my name, which is Cynthia.<eos> 'There are so many secret wounds, so many types of hidden scar.<eos> 'Nadifa, in time, decided that her own little girl 'would not be circumcised.<eos> 'It was a bold step and it took courage... 'like every new journey.<eos> 'The soul, being stronger than we think, can survive all mutilations 'and the marks upon it make it perfect and complete.'
We can...<eos> Tom, please, p-put down the gun.<eos> - Why? - Just...<eos> Why?<eos> So you can pick it up and shoot me?
As we told you, we can't cover that amount within 24 hours.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's two federal agents here.<eos> Which means you wouldn't take the chance that there was a kidnapping and not have my money.<eos> So if you don't produce it immediately, I'm gonna walk into that lobby, and I'm gonna tell these people that I can't get my money out.
I write an address, and they just... obey.<eos> No question.<eos> No deviation.<eos> No pause to contemplate eternity... Or beauty... Or death.<eos> Even you, for all your protestations of free will, if a box comes with your name on it, you can't even imagine doing anything other...
At least you're home if Pasha needs you.<eos> Yeah, but I want work.<eos> You no like your work?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I do like it sometimes, I guess.
They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.<eos> They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.<eos> But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.<eos> The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.<eos> They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.
So why'd you switch?<eos> That's a story.<eos> I used to be a medic in the S.T.A.R.S. Unit in Raccoon City.<eos> I guess, in a way, I've always been interested in medical science.<eos> Then one day, I decided to make it my duty to stop people from abusing it.
I wish we could get to Rebecca first, but the priority is those tankers.<eos> So we got three things to do.<eos> One, blow up the tankers.<eos> Two, get Rebecca.<eos> Three, grab the vaccine and deploy it on the city.
Veteran detective points finger at a fellow officer and then recants, possibly under pressure.<eos> What's really going on in the Gunn case?<eos> LAPD cover-up?<eos> That's my story.<eos> Go ahead and write it.
No. He was here in the real world.<eos> But he experienced something... a disruption.<eos> Holden's connection with the Realm is stronger than I could have realized.<eos> Uh, about the machine...<eos> Holden destroyed it.
Do we really have to do...<eos> I said hold on.<eos> Sorry, I lost my wallet.<eos> Buy the boat.<eos> Buy it and we'll take a trip.
- Of course she's in.<eos> You got to pay her tab.<eos> Pay the tab.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,
The song.<eos> Don't wanna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Scarlett, it's just a song.<eos> You didn't have a problem when we cut it.
Don't wanna do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Scarlett, it's just a song.<eos> You didn't have a problem when we cut it.<eos> We sang it every night on tour, and it didn't bother you.
Absolutely not.<eos> 'Cause it worked!<eos> You got me!<eos> And I'm trying so hard to get over it, But singing that song is makin' it kind of difficult.<eos> And now we're gonna have to sing it over and over again. For however many months.
This has been such a great night.<eos> - Thank you, guys.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, look, this might sound crazy, but I'm just gonna say it.<eos> I see an opportunity and I would like to explore it with you, with Highway 65.
No, I'm afraid I missed that boat.<eos> (groans) Well, just as well.<eos> Save your body later in life.<eos> Yeah. (chuckles)<eos> So the reason we're here, since you didn't ask, is Mr. Wheeler is selling his company, and Rayna and I would like to buy it.
This is horrible!<eos> I mean, I don't understand.<eos> What is he trying to do?<eos> Well, he wants your attention.<eos> And he's getting it.
Well, it feels like... like you've sewn someone else's skin on top of yours, and you can never take it off without feeling like you've just been ripped apart.<eos> You hardly slept.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Honey, I thought it was gonna be easy for us to write our story.<eos> It wasn't easy to live it.
- I just listened to my session.<eos> And?<eos> So strange to hear me singing Rayna's song.<eos> Yeah, I can imagine.<eos> But you are singing it for her.
I just keep secondguessing myself.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe people would like Juliette's version better.<eos> Clay did. I don't know.<eos> It's like if I change it, then...
I'm having a good run.<eos> Glad to see you're back up and at 'em.<eos> Well, you know, can't keep a bad girl down.<eos> - There's a song right there.<eos> - Let's write it.
Because she's kind?<eos> Oh, my God, you are so naive.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> She saw an opportunity.<eos> And she took it!
You're thirsty and you come to a saloon.<eos> Which is filled with some of the meanest-looking characters you ever saw.<eos> And they don't like you.<eos> What's gonna happen?<eos> Then the meanest-looking guy in the bar takes a bottle of Bud, and slides it all the way down to you while all the mean guys watch.
You're close with Rayna's daughter, Maddie, aren't you?<eos> I got a song I think would be great for her.<eos> I'm happy to pass it along.<eos> She just doesn't think that it's quite right for her.<eos> What if I record the song and I put it on my album.
Oh... um, yeah, I mean, I love that song.<eos> It's just, it's Juliette's, really, I don't know if I could it much justice.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course, you can.<eos> We can sing it together.
Come to texas.<eos> You could. Play some shows with us or just come along for the ride.<eos> You're close with rayna's daughter, maddie, aren't you?<eos> Got a song I think will be great for her.<eos> I'm happy to pass it along.
That's the suit.<eos> I literally cannot breathe.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> Your first song is in a commercial.<eos> Think about how many people are going to hear it.
No.<eos> I just lost my phone.<eos> I can't find it anywhere.<eos> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Remember the last time that you saw it?
Well, you go over the Wall.<eos> There's a low point where the Wall cuts through the mountains.<eos> It's only about 150 feet high there.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Well, my drone here takes a line up, rigs it around the top.
And it went so well they've offered me a job.<eos> A job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's starting this new program, and...<eos> Hold on, did you take it?
I need you. Got it?<eos> Your phone... Answer it.<eos> Yeah. Patch me through to Webster.<eos> Call list is a mile long and growing.<eos> You want me to go over it with you now or...
Think about it.<eos> We'll submit it again.<eos> Olivia, there wouldn't be any point.<eos> This bill, with this language...<eos> We've dressed it up a hundred different ways, and no one's biting.
Less oversight.<eos> But why not, I don't know, drugs or weapons?<eos> Anything else they bring in they're going to take a huge hit on when they try to sell it here.<eos> Cash is cash.<eos> Yeah, but they still have to launder it.
All satellite maps of the island are blurred, but...<eos> Susan's compound is... down here.<eos> Boathouse... here.<eos> And the village is up here somewhere.<eos> They call it "Revival", but that's all I know.
Young William.<eos> I believe they teach you to knock before entering, yes?<eos> I've got your gun.<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> Wherever did you find it?
You can stay in my basement.<eos> It's a bit damp, mind.<eos> - There might be rats down there.<eos> - No! Maybe something bigger than a rat.<eos> Anyway, point is, I'll roll up my sleeves and give it a proper clean.
Hurricanes come home.<eos> Our fighters land after a brisk but successful encounter with hit-and-run raiders.<eos> These are some of the boys who've flouted Hitler's air offensive.<eos> In due course they'll stop it altogether.
Now, can we please focus on work?<eos> Go double time here into the middle eight and then...<eos> Good place for a trumpet solo.<eos> Nah.<eos> I got rid of it.
as stated in the manual, and we have a problem.<eos> Agreed?<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> Well, if it's relevant.<eos> You ever worked a case for two years, then had the DA kick it 'cause it wasn't a slam-dunk, because he was more concerned with his win-loss record than obtaining justice?
Who do you have on speed dial?<eos> Two karaoke bars and a masseuse.<eos> Well, I think that's way more interesting than mine.<eos> Ever karaoke?<eos> I have too much respect for music to desecrate it with my voice.
I've been better.<eos> I just heard back from Fowkkes.<eos> Holland won't take a plea.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad he turned it down.
Get you another coffee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This time go easy on the fucking sugar.<eos> The shot shattered his shoulder blade.<eos> They're piecing it back together with screws and plates.
Yeah, I cleared the case.<eos> Your mother was Marjorie Phillips Lowe?<eos> That's right.<eos> The case is still carried as open.<eos> I cleared it to my satisfaction.
Gideon, are you sure?<eos> I mean, this is a heater case with a lot of eyes on it.<eos> And we still haven't even finished our conversation from when you gave me the badge.<eos> Cool.<eos> Let's finish it right now.
They are experimental bikes, they were in a lab 11 hours ago, I told you they weren't ready.<eos> Brandt? I want you to do something for me.<eos> Little busy, right now.<eos> It's very important.<eos> I want you to take your body camera, pull it around behind you, like, as low as you can get.
Where's Wags?<eos> He's here.<eos> Continue.<eos> I want Wags to hear this.<eos> The Krakow play, your hostility toward him, what's really animating it?
Valedictorian, Phi Beta Kappa,<eos> Head of Crim.<eos> You ever get a "B," Kate?<eos> Third grade, in Art.<eos> - I did extra credit, got it up.
They can't possibly blame us.<eos> They have blamed us for less.<eos> In the meantime, we need to continue to do our jobs, which is to maintain order in this Colony.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk about.<eos> Everyone in my bloc saw the explosion, and I'm sure the Resistance will try to claim it for propaganda purposes.
My name is Noa.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Is it because of the attack on the RAP?<eos> I'm here... because the real war is about to begin.<eos> ♪ ♪ And that thing you stole... it's gonna help us win it.
I thought your mother was gonna tell us that Grampa died.<eos> Well, the meeting ain't over yet.<eos> The monks' philosophy is simple.<eos> Take every item you own and ask: does it still bring me joy?<eos> If yes, then you keep it.
The monks' philosophy is simple.<eos> Take every item you own and ask: does it still bring me joy?<eos> If yes, then you keep it.<eos> If not, you thank it for its service<eos> - and throw it away.
That's enough.<eos> Sir. We've received priority message for you.<eos> It from dawes.<eos> In the office.<eos> Play it here.
How are you feeling?<eos> Different... And the same, like... Like there's two of me.<eos> It's very confusing.<eos> A lot is. Nick, I'm gonna need you to give me that cloth.<eos> I want to take it to rosalee.
Okay.<eos> Be sure to set up the cameras, so you have a view<eos> - of the whole room.<eos> - Got it.<eos> And the only way you're gonna be able to hear us is with this earbud, but don't put it in until you're in the room.
Let's have it.<eos> Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine was working late at the lab last night when something went terribly wrong.<eos> The terribly wrong part is in here.<eos> Doesn't appear anything was taken.<eos> Her purse is by the door, probably where she dropped it, unopened.
Maybe that plays into this.<eos> On it.<eos> I know you love Juliette.<eos> But you have to end it and never see her again.<eos> You want the truth, you're gonna get it.
Question... once it's ready, how do we get it on Zerstoerer?<eos> What about dipping bullets in it, like we did with the Siegbarste, remember?<eos> We shot him with that poison, and it worked.<eos> - I still have the gun.<eos> - Maybe we should bring it.

Proper waves, these, eh?<eos> Oh, 'twill not be new to you, young master, but to I, the discoveries I've made!<eos> Course, ye'll know all about the Holy Well?<eos> No. What is it?<eos> 'Tis a hollow in the rocks by the sea, but the water's pure an' sweet, on account of it was consecrated a thousand year gone by Saint Sawle himself.
- I must prepare myself.<eos> - Verity... My dear, do not pity me. Pity Caroline.<eos> Her life with Dwight has barely begun and I've had six years of happiness.<eos> I have our beloved child.<eos> I never expected such joy, and if all is now lost, I'll be forever grateful I had it so long.
Perfectly so.<eos> I realise how long I've been stultifying in the countryside.<eos> I feel I can breathe again.<eos> And since we're in town sooner than planned, perhaps you'd care to join me on my next appearance in court.<eos> I shall endeavour to make it as entertaining as the first!
Say nothing now.<eos> Go home. Consider all I've said.<eos> Give me an answer when you're ready.<eos> Soon, then.<eos> I will give it soon.
Should I be ashamed of it?<eos> To be related to a thief?<eos> He is no such thing, as you well know.<eos> Geoffrey Charles... is a child whose emotions are easily played on.<eos> Your brotherinlaw insinuated himself into his affections, into this household, where he contrived to steal a valuable family item, hoping no doubt to turn it into ready money.
You are mistaken, my lord.<eos> I do not endorse bloodshed and lawlessness.<eos> But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?

And I'm sure he regrets it.<eos> But if you and he quarrel, it will distress me beyond words.<eos> For your sake, Mama. I'll be civil.<eos> The old smithy on the edge of Trenwith land -- who owns it now?<eos> I believe Ross purchased it for his brother-in-law.
Forgive me.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Is Westminster ready for Ross Poldark?<eos> Ready or not, change is long overdue.<eos> When next it's offered, I believe he'll accept.
- Right, he just happened to stumble across molestation photos online.<eos> Yeah, while booking a trip to Thailand.<eos> Did you pay the person who posted this garbage so that you could own it yourself?<eos> And then maybe trade the images with other perverts?<eos> Regardless of how you organized your collection, someone stole it, and you were paying huge sums of money to have it returned.
The owner just died, left his wife holding the bag.<eos> So?<eos> So that's why I need cash.<eos> I'm gonna buy this place.<eos> Take over the lease and run it.
Of course.<eos> You want a cup of coffee?<eos> Yeah, that'd be good.<eos> Look, I want to talk to you about your offer.<eos> You thought about it. - I did.
I was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded.<eos> - All this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin.<eos> I didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing.<eos> My café got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole.
You said I had the right to remain silent.<eos> Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> No.<eos> But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table.
Do I have to even answer any of these questions?<eos> No.<eos> But you do need to give us your phone.<eos> Put it on the table.<eos> Open it up, please, right now.
- Became the new me.<eos> - Todd, answer truthfully.<eos> Are you wearing my vest?<eos> - I am wearing your vest.<eos> - Keep it.
- The other guy?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> You know what? I heard your new song, "Mr. DJ." I love it.<eos> It's off the chain. You've gotta come on the show and do it.
♪ But in every place They said to his face now ♪<eos> ♪ Get out of here ♪<eos> - ♪ Get out, get out ♪<eos> I love this song.<eos> This guy's butchering it.
Gus and I, we can put together something. That would accomplish. Everything that mom would want,<eos> While preserving what you find most important. And what would that be?<eos> We still have the element of surprise.<eos> Plus, the prop guy from "badge of justice".<eos> Made a marijuana bale so real, we could sell it.
You help Ghost, you're protecting everybody.<eos> I will get you the money.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> And you're sure this is clean?<eos> Petar wired it from the security company, so on paper, it looks like reimbursement.
- How long to come back with a warrant?<eos> - 20 minutes.<eos> Yeah, we'll tear the place apart.<eos> He'd turn up every few weeks or so. Pocket full of jewellery.<eos> Where's he getting it from?
- 20 minutes.<eos> Yeah, we'll tear the place apart.<eos> He'd turn up every few weeks or so. Pocket full of jewellery.<eos> Where's he getting it from?<eos> - I just buy it and sell it.
ASA Kot is here.<eos> Would like a word. - Can I get a water?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We got a theory?<eos> 'Cause if so, I need to hear it.
They sleep rough, forage, go hungry.<eos> An army marches on its stomach!<eos> Bishop!<eos> Here I am.<eos> Have I not helped you gain power, and keep it?
It's been eight years.<eos> Any idea why the kidnappers would only get in touch now?<eos> It was all over the press.<eos> We had a software company.<eos> We sold it for $23 million.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.<eos> I graduate in five hours!<eos> We'll get you another cap and gown.<eos> That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.<eos> I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
You need the car.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How 'bout "nailed it"?<eos> I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.
It's yours.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How 'bout "nailed it"?<eos> I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.<eos> I also knew they'd never keep it if I gave it to them, so...
Don't I at least get to discuss this?<eos> We are not terminating this pregnancy.<eos> So how long would I have to do chemo for?<eos> That's up to the oncologist.<eos> Generally, it's given in cycles between one and four weeks long. Followed by a period of rest.
Okay, what is with you?<eos> No invitation to sit down?<eos> Usually I can't sneak past you.<eos> I'm just a little preoccupied.<eos> I... i got to figure something out fast, and I'm at a roadblock, And I can't find my way around it.
We'll have to put the procedure on hold.<eos> Why?<eos> Our patient just confessed to a crime.<eos> That means the gun is considered evidence.<eos> And since his father convinced him to withdraw consent, We'll have to secure a warrant to remove it.
His oncologist ordered straight through the hospital.<eos> No other way to get it.<eos> He's just waiting for his son to die?<eos> Mr. Moore.<eos> We are aware that your son was prescribed a new oral chemo, and that you have been withholding it.
- Help them please.<eos> - Bleeding head lac...<eos> Transected his temporal artery.<eos> Give me two hemostats.<eos> I've gotta clamp it off.
I'm so sorry, but I gotta put you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold...<eos> For your own good.<eos> What?<eos> Seventy-two hours?<eos> You wanted my attention, and now you have it.
Mr. president.<eos> We don't know who survived, but I've got our top agents searching for the Quinjet.<eos> Agent Burrows has the package, but we don't know if he was onboard.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let's hope for all our sakes that director Mace got it.
Probably a lot more than she's paying you.<eos> If you're making me an offer, get on with it.<eos> Looks like we got two choices here.<eos> Either I crush this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or...<eos> Or we could kill you and take it.
That guy hits really hard.<eos> Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...<eos> - Cyanide?<eos> Why would I ... - Or, like, a paper bag.<eos> You put it over my head, you suffocate me really quick.
Electricity is used to execute criminals.<eos> Does that mean we also shouldn't use it to power our hospitals?<eos> Not the same thing, and you know it.<eos> There's always risks involved in science.<eos> That doesn't mean that we don't pursue it anyway.
- me to slit my wrist. - Do it!<eos> Okay.<eos> - That's a lot of blood.<eos> - Did you cut the radial artery?<eos> I was trying very hard to miss it.
Well, that's simply not accurate.<eos> A defining human trait seems to be regret, or so I've observed.<eos> You even asked me to repair one regret for each person entering the Framework.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you, Doctor, exhibit poor self-control, and if you someday come to regret building the Framework, you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it.
This place... what happened here?<eos> For about 70 years after World War II, nothing.<eos> No one even knew it was here.<eos> But then, a couple years back, a brave agent named Billy Koenig gave his life getting me the location.<eos> It's taken all that time just to get it operational again.
And there are already two agents that fall into this category --<eos> Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson.<eos> The inhuman.<eos> She's hacked into the framework.<eos> The two are inside with memories intact, trying to dismantle it.
Simmons: I've seen this machinery before.<eos> It was designed to build elements from thin air.<eos> This -- this looks like it's creating something even more complex.<eos> That machine required an immense amount of energy.<eos> It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.
Don't move!<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
That was amazing.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> Have you looked at the language in this contract?<eos> He's expecting you to be the perfect girlfriend.<eos> You and I have a secret, so unless you want me to tell people about it, we better start talking about a new deal.
You've already met Katie's spirit.<eos> You need to honour her other half.<eos> The girl she was.<eos> This is soil from the fairgrounds, the last place where she was seen alive.<eos> I want you to keep it.
It's not going to be easy without your husband.<eos> Why don't you worry about your own husband?<eos> They need you to go back to Jezebel's.<eos> They've been trying to get a package out of there.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.
Damn, Mike, if you can't be straight with me, this conversation ends right here.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Finally. Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.
Newton believed light to be made of particles.<eos> Professor Godfrey was lecturing on the wave theory of light.<eos> And you came through the door.<eos> Well, a wave needs something to push against, does it not?<eos> - That's what makes it a wave.
We took liberties.<eos> We guessed.<eos> You were right, William.<eos> He found a man with similar features and killed him.<eos> So he removed the bullet from his own shoulder and placed it in the corpse.
Sure.<eos> They've made progress on biological limb replacements.<eos> I like to remember what I gave.<eos> Your offer...<eos> I thought about it.
Was there any signs of tampering?<eos> - Remote access?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> We've looked three times.<eos> He developed this machine, it only stands to reason he knows it better than us.
Whitford gave me a gun.<eos> It's just in case. Okay? Jesus.<eos> Do you know how to use it?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> I know how to load it.
Figure it out.<eos> What... What's in the package?<eos> I just know it's important.<eos> And don't open it either.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.
- Be nice, Suzy.<eos> Never know his name.<eos> White, brown hair, had a bad leg.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He broke it.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.<eos> Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.<eos> You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.<eos> I've never seen that book before.<eos> One of your coppers must have planted it.
But by lying to us, you're helping the bastard who did.<eos> Anything you've held back?<eos> Anything.<eos> Her bag.<eos> She left it behind.
Anything you've held back?<eos> Anything.<eos> Her bag.<eos> She left it behind.<eos> It was a tatty old thing... but I kept it... in case she ever came back.
Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Club soda?<eos> - I see, thank you.<eos> - I found it.
You didn't have to kill her.<eos> Sara wasn't supposed to die, not like that, not by you.<eos> There's no rhyme nor reason to any of this, Jax.<eos> History is war and slavery and holding your dead son in your arms.<eos> There's no point in protecting history, so we might as well just burn it all down.
A nuclear fusion bomb.<eos> They're going to destroy National City, and blame it on hostile aliens.<eos> How did Cadmus get their hands on it?<eos> Well, they didn't steal it.<eos> They built it.
Dad, you there?<eos> Right here, Alex.<eos> Standing by for your instructions once we get inside.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Anything happens to that bomb before you disarm it, the whole city could go.
I want you to figure out who's gonna outperform your data and who has already had his best year.<eos> Sitting with everyone so they can equivocate and explain away what's already been shown clearly - seems inefficient.<eos> - Taylor, I know you come from analytics, and I know that the numbers are where you live, but got to learn the other piece, too.<eos> There's a small group who can do the math.<eos> There's an even smaller group who can explain it.
Okay, so he spots Keith with the guitar or spots the killer himself who's taken the guitar from Keith.<eos> Follows him home.<eos> We know Woody found his targets at the mall.<eos> Why does the killer take the guitar to the mall?<eos> Try to resell it? Get it appraised?
Forever.<eos> Hope, open your eyes.<eos> You can't fall asleep.<eos> I'm gonna tell you a story.<eos> And you have to stay awake to hear it, okay?
There won't be an exchange.<eos> She needs Elijah to die in order to channel the energy from his sacrifice.<eos> She's already poisoned him with the rose thorns.<eos> She wants this bone by sundown.<eos> If she doesn't get it, then she's gonna come here and she's gonna take it.
That's the point.<eos> We don't understand this thing or how to stop it.<eos> But one thing is for sure...<eos> We need help.<eos> And I'm gonna go get it.
Tierra, of course, means land.<eos> As in all the hearts will defend it.<eos> Mmm. Watch yourself.<eos> And there's our bone.<eos> Now give it to me.
Can you hear that music?<eos> Is that coming from in here?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can still hear it. Can you hear it?
Show us a bit of respect, Julius.<eos> - Julius, don't be rude. - There are no more potatoes.<eos> Newton's second law of motion.<eos> You all know it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics,<eos> I need you to more than "know" it.
Anyone could see that he was driving towards a wall like Dale Earnhardt at Daytona.<eos> And what did you do to stop it?<eos> No.<eos> No, sir.<eos> If a crash is coming, I say you bring it.
Going silent.<eos> All right, we're here.<eos> Night vision.<eos> Go, go, go. Move, move.<eos> Gate's locked. I'm gonna blow it.
Well, it is very... you.<eos> This girl you saw;<eos> visions are often more figurative than they are literal.<eos> I've got a book on interpretations of Bhakti trances.<eos> I'll give it a look and see if there's anything we missed.
Can't we just enjoy the fact that I'm back?<eos> I missed you.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know how pissed the cops are gonna be when they see you on television before you've given them a statement?<eos> Honey, the only point of giving an exclusive is so you can tell your story to a worldwide audience before you tell it to anybody else.
You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Everything, apparently.<eos> Where'd you get a goddamn gun?<eos> I don't know. He brought it. That Humps guy.
"The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance.<eos> He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked."<eos> Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.<eos> You see, this is the thing about female prisoners.<eos> Men understand violence. They respect it.
Okay, I got to know where this one come from.<eos> I told you mine.<eos> Yo, you tell me, then we'll see about getting you some, uh, coffee.<eos> Tracy Loomis and I were best friends until she went through puberty before me and got more popular because it was rumored that she let David Rosen titty fuck her.<eos> So I named it after her because my vagina's a bitch.
It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.<eos> I can't let you leave with it.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> Good technique.<eos> I know it well.
And you said so yourself the night that you brought me in.<eos> Deliver the guy who masterminded the heist, and my debt is paid.<eos> That was when I thought it was impossible.<eos> Well, be careful who you ask for the moon.<eos> Some maniac just might bring it to you.
I should've just let those guys have the cash.<eos> You know, the money I gave you from the heist was for Cristina's college fund.<eos> There were other pressing matters at the time.<eos> Like keeping Miguel out of her life.<eos> All right, so if Miguel left town with the cash, who the hell's spending it?
Make sure SWAT finds a pound of smack in Quince's bedroom.<eos> And he implicates your brother for trafficking before the arrest report is filed.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> I'm looking for payback.<eos> And you thought you'd get it by banging through the door with no badge and a set of brass knuckles?
At least he fought his own battles.<eos> So she's on here?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Indictable evidence?<eos> You have it.
Especially not Woz's son.<eos> I didn't make anything up.<eos> Oh, is that what you're gonna tell Woz when he finds out?<eos> Because I doubt he's gonna be moved by your integrity.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as it's still there.
Ma.<eos> What's your first move, Mr. Beaumont?<eos> Well, you're in a strong position, so we're gonna use a negotiating tactic called demonstration.<eos> We're in a strong position?<eos> That donor's blood is only of value to you and only if you receive it soon, which means it's in their interest as well as ours to resolve this quickly.
Anything.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Whatever happened to my toy chest?<eos> - They lost it.
I'm a private investigator.<eos> In Chicago.<eos> Why would Dad hire a private investigator?<eos> What about my dad's envelope?<eos> Did... Did you send it to him already?
Thank you.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I called the pizza place.<eos> I ordered a pizza.<eos> I shook down the kid who brought it, and he sang like a canary.
There's your crown, sweetheart.<eos> Like a princess.<eos> What?<eos> You want this crown back?<eos> You fight me for it.
Yeah.<eos> The money's in the chase.<eos> I think I'm gonna roll credits over this mayhem.<eos> I think our match was good.<eos> I mean, I'm sure I'll hate it when I see it, but it felt good.
Out of the way!<eos> I got the tape!<eos> Sorry! Sorry!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got it! I got it.
I know that you expelled Kady and that you are not generally keen on granting asylum, especially to hedges.<eos> Yes, well, this is a special case.<eos> Julia and I have a past.<eos> Handle it however you want, but for the record, that girl will be safer at Brakebills. Mm.<eos> "How to transfer the energy from one being" "and transform it."
And Bellamy Blake? Come on.<eos> Of course Clarke and Bellamy should be included.<eos> Strong leadership is essential for survival.<eos> All right. You don't like the list.<eos> Consider it shredded.
Good?<eos> Good?<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> Now, that radiation shield is ready.<eos> Who's gonna help me put it in place?
Ischemic of hemorrhagic?<eos> We don't know if it's a stroke yet.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> There's no fuel in the tank, but we have plenty of hydrazine back in Arkadia.<eos> - We can have it here in a day. - Ok, Raven.
I've joined the women's league.<eos> I want to do something I can feel good about.<eos> My wedding ring.<eos> When I escaped, I couldn't leave it behind.<eos> I thought you would want it back. Unless there are too many bad memories from when it was taken?
Your father's driver dropped this off for you.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - For you, Bryan, anything.<eos> That coffee is terrible.<eos> How do you drink it?
Now, isn't this a literary club?<eos> I've written a book...<eos> "Steady at the Helm."<eos> Sure.<eos> I tore through it in one sitting.
I know things didn't work out the way we thought they would. And I know this is a bad situation for you.<eos> But I got to ask you to please not take it out on Marco's town.<eos> You know you've got a finder's fee coming to you either way.<eos> Come on, I don't give a shit about that.<eos> You can throw it right in if it changes anything.
And then we had to secure it in place.<eos> I don't understand ratchet straps.<eos> Er...<eos> There's water coming into the boat.<eos> - No, there was some in when I bought it.
- It's a good idea.<eos> - It isn't a good idea!<eos> Or, how's this for an idea?<eos> Let me just throw it out there.<eos> Why not take a cow, turn the middle of it into burgers and steaks, and then, instead of throwing the skin away, use it to cover the seats of your car?
It has made me murderously bad-tempered and intolerant of your fatuousness.<eos> Have you seriously broken your arm?<eos> It's fractured quite badly.<eos> - Don't touch it.<eos> - How did you break it?
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh!<eos> There's obviously been a catastrophic failure with the submarine.<eos> - No idea what could have caused it.
Oh, no!<eos> Oh!<eos> There's obviously been a catastrophic failure with the submarine.<eos> - No idea what could have caused it.<eos> - The monster's bitten it!
Legion!<eos> Fuck you, priest!<eos> - What is legion?<eos> - There are many demons in her all forming one strong union.<eos> We will break it.
How do you not know this?<eos> - Because I grew up a slave princess in a harem, and you grew up reading comic books and building robot dogs.<eos> Solid point, but wait, wait a minute.<eos> Only the Ferran know Ohron's location.<eos> How in the hells did you get it?
Wait a minute.<eos> What if when they went through, they created a kind of rip or tear between here and wherever they went?<eos> That's what the anomaly is, just one end of the tear.<eos> An interesting theory.<eos> If it's true, then as long as the tear persists, we may be able to use it to trace where they went.
Android, Five, how's it going down there?<eos> We've made several changes to the Blink Drive that I believe will overcome the damage done by the Ishida scientists.<eos> How will we know for sure?<eos> First we'll run a full diagnostic, followed by a series of simulations.<eos> If the instability persists, we should be able to detect it, long before we attempt a live test.
Oh, shit.<eos> So much for a walk in the park.<eos> What? This isn't my fault.<eos> She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed.<eos> Evidently, when Novina was forced to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
Is that supposed to mean something?<eos> It's where you'll find that data file.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> The only other person in the galaxy who could've accessed that box was Tabor.<eos> He's the one who cleaned it out.

Left me a good-bye message, his place.<eos> - And his contact list?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That transmission you got wasn't from him.<eos> Obviously, I sent it.
When her stasis pod died,<eos> I was able to rescue her digital consciousness.<eos> Whenever you go into a deep sleep, your consciousness gets digitally uploaded into a database designed to keep the mind actively stimulated, and avoid mental atrophy over long hauls.<eos> It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.<eos> So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
It gets downloaded back as part of the revival process.<eos> So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?<eos> Not at first.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I kept it on a separate storage device.
So instead of downloading this digital consciousness back into her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?<eos> Not at first.<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> I kept it on a separate storage device.<eos> And it wasn't until recently that I was able to figure out a way to actually upload it into the computer.
We've still got a crew member down there.<eos> We've got people down there, too, "Raza,"<eos> but it was an executive order...<eos> It's out of my hands.<eos> If you don't disarm the nuke, we'll have no choice but to take it out ourselves.
One sec!<eos> Did you already try the purple one?<eos> I don't do purple!<eos> I hate the jacket.<eos> I love it.
"a curious substance.<eos> "A, uh, viscous secretion<eos> "displaying otherworldly properties and marked photophobia."<eos> Where did Franklin find the substance?<eos> Uh, he found it from some colonists in Maryland.
All true, Mr. Williams, but your gun has dried blood on it, and...<eos> It's not my gun.<eos> Whose gun is it?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> I found it.
He hung up.<eos> Max, can we just go back to that terrible place we call home?<eos> That mountain lion is wearing my new blouse.<eos> - And here she comes! - [gasps]<eos> Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.
Sweaty but ready.<eos> All right, can y'all folks lock up?<eos> I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.<eos> My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.<eos> I got to talk to him about removing it.
It means a great deal, celebrating this victory with you both.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Enjoy the scotch.<eos> Sandicot's not getting the gaming license.<eos> The commission went another way, gave it to a town in the Catskills.
How do you know?<eos> She left me a note. "You lied to me."<eos> Fuck.<eos> How you gonna figure out what she's referring to?<eos> I already know 'cause it was the only one.
I hope so.<eos> Forgive. If you can.<eos> Axe is asking if you have the Klaxon research.<eos> I got it right here. Just haven't signed it yet.<eos> So, should I tell him he's getting it?
And where is your regiment, general?<eos> Cross the Hudson wearing rebel blue?<eos> Wandering where their commander scarpered off to?<eos> He had it coming. I know precisely who and what you are.<eos> Please, this is where we report the war, not wage it.
So...<eos> I take it the lobsters have gone?<eos> No, no, they're not gone.<eos> Wakefield moved his billet to Strong Manor.<eos> He threw up a stockade, he's calling it Fort St. George.
Yeah, they seem to love you.<eos> Okay. Maybe I came on a little strong.<eos> To get the best out of people, you need to get to know them on a personal level.<eos> Yeah, that line is underlined three times in your business book.<eos> You left it in the kitchen.
You sure it was him?<eos> Positive.<eos> This vision was different.<eos> Longer. Cleaner.<eos> Something about Ravi's blue juice made it extra potent.
I've come to ask you a favor.<eos> Why even bother hosting a gala?<eos> Tradition.<eos> They always used to have it here.<eos> Constantine and I would host it together.
Powerful enough to repel the Horseman.<eos> Your area of expertise.<eos> All I know is we have six hours until the sun sets.<eos> Can you remove the disc and return to the vault?<eos> I can examine it there.
Story for another day.<eos> We do not have long to prepare.<eos> You're thinking J Street.<eos> It is a cul-de-sac, so if we lure the Horseman in, we can use Banneker's disc to block his way out.<eos> But you said that it's enchanted, so how do we open it?
All you care about is what I can do for you.<eos> Oh, and you think Bajie's intentions are genuine?<eos> He'll abandon you the first chance he gets, just like he abandoned me.<eos> We're not leaving without the book, Minerva.<eos> Come and get it. I remember, when I was a little girl, you vowed to help me decipher this book's secrets.
Evie Beaumont.<eos> I'm her father.<eos> Well, can you check again, please?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> He wants revenge, and Michelle is his way to get it.
That's conspiracy to kill the president.<eos> That's the death penalty.<eos> Now, I want to believe that you have good reasons for all of this, but if you don't tell me what they are, I can't help you walk out of here.<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline, Hannah.<eos> Take it.
Uh... I'll go check on Mrs. Kirkman now.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Speaking of numbers, sir, we need to get 51 Senate votes in two days, which is not gonna be easy.<eos> The language of the bill is not ideal, as you know.<eos> That's why Senator Bowman picked it. He's trying to back me into a corner.
I'm not so sure about Iowa.<eos> But that's not the point.<eos> The language of this bill is so broad, my people tell me it's a slippery slope.<eos> I know.<eos> We're gonna fix it in the House.
Because I think you're doing the right thing, sir.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Today, I had a very productive meeting with President Kirkman regarding SB8180.<eos> I agree with him that sensible measures to ensure gun safety are long overdue and that expanding background checks makes Americans safer.<eos> So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill tomorrow and get it to the House, where Republicans, Democrats, and Independents...
Well, it's gonna come down to the wire.<eos> - I did all I could.<eos> - You opened the door.<eos> If this bill passes, it's probably gonna be because of you, and the President knows that.<eos> And if it fails...
You don't need to know why I'm looking for Lloyd.<eos> I met him a few times...<eos> Scary dude.<eos> Spent 16 years in Special Forces, completed more classified missions than anyone in his unit.<eos> In 2000, he inherited a fortune from his father's business, put it all into Browning Reed.
In fact, it was pretty awful.<eos> But it was the experience that mattered.<eos> That... I-I...<eos> Couldn't agree more. Music shaped my whole life.<eos> Leo's all about it, too.
He was with a group of music students from a high school in New Orleans that had just been named after his father.<eos> Now, he told me that their music program was gonna lose their funding.<eos> How familiar are you with the federal art grants that make these kind of programs possible?<eos> I remember that bill.<eos> The sunset clause was added to get it past some of my more conservative colleagues.
I met some high school students from New Orleans... Part of a music program funded by the National Endowment for the Arts.<eos> But, unfortunately, their funding's about to run out.<eos> Arts education is certainly something to look at as we approach the next budget.<eos> These kids can't wait that long.<eos> Their grant expires next month unless Congress re-approves it.
I need to earn your trust. Oh, not just me.<eos> All of NATO.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I would like to start with France.<eos> We began this dream of weapons reduction together. And I will need you there to finish it.
I'm waiting for word from my inside source.<eos> From Sandstorm?<eos> I thought you said they went dark before Jane showed up.<eos> They did. But before that, they sent me coded messages through this marquee.<eos> I still check it every morning.
Toby, after we installed the stint, we ran some tests.<eos> The arrhythmia was caused by a minor septal defect, which means there's a very small hole between two of the heart's chambers.<eos> Now some people may choose, uh, not to repair the hole, and treat it with medication. But I strongly suggest surgery.<eos> Let me explain to you exactly what's going on.<eos> Although this is a more serious surgery, I've performed it many times.
Okay. I'll bump you to 17k a year.<eos> I need more.<eos> It's a ten percent raise.<eos> You're already my highest-paid foreman.<eos> And finish this hellhole so I can sell it.
End of play. And lights up.<eos> Well?<eos> Anyone gonna... you know.<eos> Nothing. Ron? Was it that bad?<eos> I have to say, when Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, opposite the girl who wrote it,
Up ahead is the annex.<eos> That's where we have yoga, drumming classes, cooking classes, mindful eating workshops.<eos> And over here, is the horse's stable.<eos> So, where's the gym?<eos> Did, like, did I miss it or...?
We follow my plan, we're good.<eos> - All right, look, let's go over it.<eos> Bartender's an old guy. He's not the sharpest.<eos> Every night at 8:30, he starts to close out at the end of his shift.<eos> He opens the register, takes the cash out so that Ray and his guys can come pick it up later.
Sometimes they'll make good decisions.<eos> It's just a meeting with a director, okay?<eos> It's not like I'm gonna get the part.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I want you to get it.
I'll be right back. Who's that man?<eos> Jane, that satchel.<eos> It was in Chad's apartment.<eos> Radical gene therapy fails when the brain rejects the new DNA.<eos> It doesn't want to change, but my father discovered a better method, and I've perfected it.
Scare them away!<eos> Go! They are at my butt, hurry!<eos> Your meaty thigh alone can feed the whole pack of wolves for 3 years!<eos> Ashmita's in China and it looks like they found the location.<eos> So, the men are keeping a very close eye on them.
Look at you.<eos> You're pathetic!<eos> I've got friends who don't go in fear and trembling of the hunt.<eos> You wouldn't understand that, would you? No.<eos> Too busy doing their dirty work for them.
But that's if you're throwing from the mound.<eos> From here, it's more like 51 feet.<eos> Why am I doing this again?<eos> Would you say you have a problem with white male voters?<eos> I can make a stronger appeal to them, yes.
Extraordinary!<eos> I'm forced to ingratiate myself with that idiot Whitworth whilst the scullery maid strolls in on the arm of an heiress!<eos> Look at them!<eos> Struttin' an' swaggering', as if there be no war, men risking' their lives.<eos> Pay them no heed, my dear.
What, this kid was 16 years old when he did his first murder?<eos> You caught him?<eos> Please tell me you caught him.<eos> We can't discuss an ongoing case.<eos> These people... look at them.
I want you to have the associates.<eos> Whatever you said to Donna, you were right.<eos> - Rachel, just let me finish while I'm still able to get it out.<eos> I know I can be rough on them... but it's only because I want to see them become the best lawyers they can be.<eos> But I'm not in the best headspace right now, and if I keep taking my anger out on them, they will not become great lawyers.
In pilots, not criminals!<eos> Criminals are better than pilots.<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> My point is, criminals are trying to hide their stress.<eos> So if it works on them, it's gonna work on anyone, right?
He's accusing me of making overtures to influence Ohio state senators.<eos> When I did that NFL thing in Ohio, I also took some legislators out to dinner.<eos> Applebee's.<eos> That's where they wanted to go.<eos> I unduly influenced them with potato skins and hot wings.
Got it. Time for some cardio, Eric.<eos> Scoot.<eos> By the way, your NSA agent friend, Michael... Hmm? ...is really, really sweet.<eos> I love your ability to just make friends.<eos> Well, I have lots of friends, 'cause I have a super-secret method of making them.
Nate Baldwin, got off a really serious assault charge...<eos> I thought this was about Clay.<eos> And now his team, the Northern Devils, who were tipped to finish bottom of the ladder last year, have defied expectation quite considerably.<eos> Very good season.<eos> When the odds of the Devils making the semis was 1,000 to 1, a number of large online bets were placed on them.
No one's gonna beat your dumpling eating record.<eos> Someone's about to beat your dumpling eating record.<eos> Go. Go. Go.<eos> Who's eating my dumplings ?<eos> -And who's paying for them ?
A lot.<eos> All those innocent people.<eos> Dead, because of me.<eos> No.<eos> Not because of you, because of them.
I have 6,000 men.<eos> You have, what, half that?<eos> Not even?<eos> Aye, you have the numbers.<eos> Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?
Why this charade?<eos> And what are you suddenly trying to be?<eos> Ranjit?<eos> Look at these people.<eos> - Why? Amrita, look at them.
I love your smile.<eos> It lights up your eyes.<eos> - Where are the children?<eos> - Here you see amazing primitive savages.<eos> You can observe them, but we advise you not to go near them.
You think I'm being dramatic here?<eos> Do you really think you could just come here and tell me to come back and that's how it'll go?<eos> Those people, your people, they care about you.<eos> I know they do.<eos> And I care about them.
All right, look, man.<eos> It is innocent until proven guilty last I heard.<eos> So if you want to put security cameras all over the damn place, you go ahead and do that.<eos> But I'm asking you to let this go right now.<eos> We got people and reporters coming in from all over, and we need to be ready for them.
Move, move!<eos> We need to get away from this place now!<eos> She did good.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> Yeah, good thing we brought the very small plane to carry them.
How would someone find out?<eos> [Scoffs] How big's your checkbook? ♪ ♪ Thank you all for picking your top three choices.<eos> And while many of you will be placed in these programs, most of you will not.<eos> That's because today wasn't about you checking them out.<eos> It was about them checking you out.
You love her.<eos> I mean, she's the reason you won't help us track down these demons, right?<eos> I only ask 'cause there's some real end-of-the-world shit coming.<eos> And despite your fuck-if-I-care attitude, I know you care about your people.<eos> Imagine if they knew the truth, that you don't even wanna fight for them.
Here, the spacing is more symmetrical.<eos> The mouth is wider.<eos> The brushstrokes are loose in arches.<eos> These two were painted by separate people.<eos> So, you're saying Hexum stole someone's paintings and put his name on them and Jennifer helped him sell them?
Amy, still nothing?<eos> Mark, am I blocking your signal?<eos> No?<eos> Engine manufacturers equip their engines with self-diagnostic tools that wirelessly talk to the ground.<eos> Air traffic control should be getting updates from them.
Why do we need to take out the electricity?<eos> It's the citadel doors.<eos> Magnetic locks.<eos> Without power, open sesame.<eos> We'll have our people in before they know what hit them.
One of many. They control East Tijuana.<eos> All goods, all supplies come here.<eos> They're drug dealers.<eos> They deal with everything now.<eos> And they will hang you for looking at them wrong.
General Washington.<eos> It's my pleasure to introduce Mrs. Anna Strong, the signal of Setauket.<eos> Madam.<eos> It is my great honor to welcome you to this army that you have kept alive and whole through your good works.<eos> On behalf of those who will never know the true measure of your efforts, I thank you for them and for all the sacrifices you have made in the name of our cause.
Approach the bench.<eos> Counselor, according to these death certificates, both your witnesses are dead and ineligible to testify.<eos> Your Honor, that is ridiculous.<eos> My two witnesses are standing right there.<eos> You're looking at them.
I did do a paediatric rotation.<eos> Hardly likely to forget that, am I?<eos> [OTHERS SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY]<eos> Mum was right about the balloons.<eos> The boys just hit each other with them, then lie on them till they burst. Must be a breast-envy thing.
I hear the brothers have departed for these shores.<eos> Albert and Ernest?<eos> But I have not asked them.<eos> Nevertheless, they are coming.<eos> Uncle Leopold must have sent for them against my express instructions.
No... pathology.<eos> What?<eos> It's the patients.<eos> They come in, and you want to help them.<eos> You care about them, so you try to connect, and, just when you think you're getting through, they go back to what they were doing before.
Neither.<eos> Because it didn't happen.<eos> I-I don't know anything about an El Oso project.<eos> Then how do you explain the browser history on your laptop?<eos> Or the shoes in your closet with Zane's blood on them?
I need a favor from you.<eos> I need you to think about me.<eos> No.<eos> All right, I'll pretend that doesn't hurt my feelings.<eos> Look, I know your urges are strong and you can't control them, but you can focus them.
These... are my two victims.<eos> Do you recognize either of them?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure.<eos> Now, Henry, before you look at these crime scene photos, you should know that sometimes people look a little different when they're dead, and... you don't have to look at them if you don't want to.
Should we return to slavery?<eos> Jim Crow? In today's America, my gay friends can get married.<eos> In today's America, I can vote.<eos> 50 years ago... In Hollis Doyle's lifetime...<eos> That wasn't the case. In today's America, my parents don't have to recruit a white couple who worked alongside them at the cereal plant to apply for a mortgage because banks wouldn't lend to folks with brown skin.
This is all that washed up.<eos> You knew this would happen?<eos> The island is barren, save for berries and wild boar.<eos> This way is easier... and more fun.<eos> Sister, do not weep for them.
Without no injuries? You sure they're not infected?<eos> Are you damn sure?<eos> !<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Look, look at them.
Four, Nyx, anybody.<eos> Come in.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Look, you may have your reasons for not wanting to go to the authorities, but you can't take on the Dankers alone.<eos> If you've got friends back at the station, we should go back for them.
It's not me.<eos> It's really not me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What if he doesn't show?<eos> He likes to pull the strings, not dangle from them.
How is the Dark Army behind this... whatever this is?<eos> It's one thing to question your mind. It's another to question your eyes and ears.<eos> But then again, isn't it all the same, our senses just mediocre inputs for our brain?<eos> Come on.<eos> Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real world around us, but what if the haunting truth is, they can't?
Just the three of us.<eos> Your family always blames me for your issues.<eos> But let's be honest.<eos> You were using way before I met you.<eos> Because of them.
Let's get set up.<eos> Who was she?<eos> Her?<eos> Someone desperate.<eos> People out there... life pushes them hard enough, they'll sign anything.
They're normal, everyday folks who come home one day, open their mail, and they have a jury summons.<eos> They're like my fans?<eos> That's exactly what they are.<eos> They're the same people who throw panties on stage and cheer for you.<eos> And you got to see them like that.
Look at their planning. Look at their preparation.<eos> Look at their skills.<eos> Whatever they want, we can't give it to them.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Get them to include you in the trade, to speak for them so they don't get voiceprinted.
Actually, it's a two-and-a-half- hour drive in traffic.<eos> And Bishop and Quinn are totally capable agents who aren't always looking to "settle down," by the way.<eos> Wow.<eos> You know what, Nick, we gave them good leads.<eos> Let them follow up on them.
I thought there was only one tactic - to have at least one car be the hare.<eos> I said, "Look, I don't mind being the hare."<eos> "The moment that flag goes down, we need to be - bang - off,"<eos> tempting the Ford drivers to perhaps overdrive a little bit.<eos> If one could push them hard enough for long enough, then there is more likelihood, obviously, of being able to break them.
We were extremely glad no one was hurt during that.<eos> That had been our fear.<eos> All hostages came home, all rescuers came home.<eos> No harm, no foul.<eos> [Henderson] I remember looking at them thinking, "I know you.
You're gonna turn them all against Laurel.<eos> I appreciate your perspective, I ran Corzine's senate campaign in 2000, so I know what I'm doing.<eos> Okay, Steve, but I know this community.<eos> It's Steven, with a V, as in very gay.<eos> And when people disrespect my gay brothers and sisters, I rain terror on them!
I try to approach people with respect.<eos> I try not to speak to loud.<eos> Or move to fast.<eos> I want to be open.<eos> I want to feel open in my heart toward them.
With 15 minutes on the clock, your time starts now.<eos> It's worth noting that teams are allowed to come back to any task that they might have missed the first time around.<eos> Now, all the tasks down there can be completed in any order except the first one.<eos> Opening the hatch. Teams must complete that first task within 60 seconds.<eos> If they fail to do so, then a diver will be forced to do it for them for a five point loss.
♪ In the shape of us ♪ - We rolling?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Action.<eos> Just know, I watched five men trip over themselves<eos> Checking you out While you merely glared at them.
There's so much evil in one room.<eos> Your only chance of getting out of here alive is to surrender... Do you think I want to get out?<eos> How many people's lives began to end in this room?<eos> - My people's lives.<eos> - Your people? Nobody asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
Go to the fairy kingdom.<eos> Hide. Keep our people safe.<eos> You should never have come back, Mary.<eos> And yet, here you are.<eos> Ready to die for them rather than live with me.
- Shit.<eos> They were negging us. - Negging?<eos> - Negging is going negative. It's a manipulative sex strategy used by lonely chauvinists.<eos> See, everybody wants us.<eos> By shitting all over us, they try and bring our price down, but you shitting all over them counteracted them shitting all over us.
Arlene.<eos> Keys.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> - Don't-<eos> - Arlene, don't look at them, okay?
I don't care, I'm not going back to that place!<eos> You're just gonna end up back in juvie.<eos> OK, look, you don't see me running.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> My foster parents know I narc'd on them.
The Romans wanted us to say that we were led to our destruction by a reckless fool named Eleazar Ben Ya'ir, that our warriors cowered in fear as Flavius Silva ground Masada to the dust under his heels.<eos> But we have told you the truth.<eos> We didn't save ourselves to tell you a lie.<eos> We saved ourselves to honor our brothers and sisters.<eos> In telling their story, this is our kaddish for them.
I mean, maybe they'll use them for suicide missions.<eos> The numbers don't lie.<eos> This job, these are the best people.<eos> Have you read their files?<eos> Yeah, I glanced at them.
Ah, they always say that.<eos> Um, it's just... you know, when you gave me this job, you said I'd be doing medicine.<eos> Well, that list you just gave me sounds pretty substantial for a physician's assistant.<eos> I mean, five IVs means five patients.<eos> Why don't you be responsible for them and check their blood work?
Believe me, I'm at peace with my decision.<eos> I am with you all the way.<eos> Let's go to the overpass.<eos> I used to be afraid of train tracks.<eos> Now it feels good to stand on them. Go against my instincts.
His leg's bad.<eos> Think you can clear a path to the top deck and ready the chopper?<eos> An opportunity to kill more of these bastards? I love you're whole thing.<eos> You know that?<eos> Hold out for them as long as you can. They'll be right behind you.
I'm Peggy Carter.<eos> Why is Leviathan holding you prisoner?<eos> The acquired some schemata in the black market...<eos> A weapon they don't know how to build.<eos> They want us to build it for them.
I was hiding upstairs with Mom while she called the police.<eos> I was mostly worried about Dad.<eos> It felt like we were waiting forever.<eos> Ah, couldn't have been that long.<eos> He went downstairs and yelled at them and scared 'em off, right?
He shot him.<eos> Detective Joe West killed your brother.<eos> He will pay for what he did.<eos> So Clyde Mardon has a brother?<eos> And both brothers survived the plane crash, and then the dark matter released from the particle accelerator explosion affects them both in virtually the same way.
I think we already know what you're capable of, Doctor.<eos> You hurt a lot of people that night.<eos> So those doctors in there, they're good enough?<eos> The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them.
!<eos> - I've been fired.<eos> - [Mariana] This is our school.<eos> If we don't like something about it, we have to do something to change it.<eos> My foster parents know I narced on them.
The senator's husband and children learning her sexual preference from the front page of a paper, it's...<eos> Yeah, well, privacy is a myth.<eos> Personal info is the new commodity.<eos> I understand three other people had their information released.<eos> Well, Lomis had access to 300 phones and whatever was on them.
Him.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's the custodians.<eos> Greendale's custodial staff is running the underground paintball tournament probably with City College money.<eos> The people that clean Greendale don't want a cleaner Greendale, they want Greendale to be afraid of itself and reliant on them.
Look, if you had a question about your book, why not just walk over to the register and ask?<eos> Because while you were scaring customers off, I was working and observing.<eos> And it's clear to me that you would sell far more copies--<eos> People who have bought your book tend to call ahead instead of buying it off the shelves.<eos> So we either have it waiting for them behind the counter, or we ship it out.
Yeah?<eos> And how are you gonna do that without your magic, savior?<eos> Your parents are monsters, Emma.<eos> They banished me and threw you in a wardrobe.<eos> And now here you are, ready to die for them, because you're so perfect. The savior.
I don't mean to put you on the spot.<eos> I'm sure the whole town's heard about Nora by now.<eos> You don't owe me an explanation.<eos> You, uh, you have a description of these counterfeiters?<eos> Might help me keep an eye out for them.
Ok. Give me a sec.<eos> - Done! Done!<eos> - Ok, let's get out of here.<eos> The guards are back.<eos> We'll walk right into them.
That Catherine and her children were just for show, for politics.<eos> You said I shouldn't be jealous of them, and I wasn't.<eos> I loved my brothers and sisters.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Were you threatened by them
there wouldn't be enough to wake them, so I learned to control my bloodlust for them.<eos> These people made me feel human again.<eos> I'll fetch the last of the blood so we can revive them.<eos> Not only is she a ripper, she's an insane ripper!<eos> Or maybe she feels responsible for them.
The DoD dares to dream.<eos> One other thing.<eos> SECNAV wants us to make sure that this was not a hate crime.<eos> The two other soldiers are at the DEA's offices.<eos> Where's the agent who was in charge of them?
I don't remember him.<eos> My mother raised me.<eos> You should have seen the way I grew up.<eos> It was just me and her and three other families in a single apartment.<eos> If the families were too loud when I was trying to go to sleep, she would go scream at them.
They always die, like, ten minutes later.<eos> Oh, poor, sweet Jeffrey.<eos> When we met he was on a detour on his way back to Ohio from Miami where he ended up after being kicked out of the Army.<eos> I told him if you want to be a great killer, you must understand people.<eos> To hunt them, you must be able to get into their minds.
- No, I do.<eos> I reacted emotionally to your article.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> You know, these people are my family.<eos> I'd kill for them, but I shouldn't have said what I said about you.
I wish we never met.<eos> If we never...<eos> I can't tell you how hard it's been to watch my friends, my family, my acquaintances being dragged into the spotlight because of me, clients being investigated and harassed by the media because of me,<eos> loved ones potentially having to drain their savings to hire lawyers and face congressional committees because of me.<eos> I wish I'd never laid eyes on him because of them and what they are going through right now.
- I'm guessing...<eos> - because that was the promise we made.<eos> - none of your former CIA assets - ever kidnapped an American foreign service officer. - That was the deal.<eos> These men put their lives on the line, and they've been waiting for years.<eos> I spoke with their former C.O. He still vouches for them.
'It's better to end a story on a good note in case it cannot be brought to a logical end...'<eos> File the closure report.<eos> Fairly.<eos> Yes Sir.<eos> Though our investigation clearly points to the parents as Shruti's killers the evidence collected is not strong enough to file a chargesheet against them.
- Wait! - What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We don't know where we are, we haven't seen another car in an hour...<eos> Am I the only one who thinks it's not a good idea to go with a couple of weirdos?<eos> Look at us. Look at them.
They might be if negotiations were handled discreetly.<eos> Of course.<eos> Peace and prosperity.<eos> That's what I'm offering, Anton.<eos> I'm just glad you're not making me drink to them.
Why, because I killed your lover or killed many people?<eos> Are you innocent?<eos> Can you live without human blood?<eos> People fear you more than me.<eos> Why waste effort on them?
And it was this man right here's trailer that you were in.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And so that, of all places, you knew was important that you make sure that these Manitowoc officers not be alone.<eos> Correct.<eos> And so you kept an eye on them, didn't you?
The only surprise is that you allowed her to behave in such a manner... without even lifting a finger, lion slayer.<eos> What could I have done?<eos> I am Amphitryon the Conqueror... ruler of the realm, vanquisher of Argos.<eos> You are my son, and tonight you stood and watched... as your future wife made a fool of you and me... in front of our most formidable threat:<eos> Look at them.
That armed host will attack this mountain if we do not come to terms.<eos> And your threats do not sway me.<eos> What of your conscience?<eos> Does it not tell you our cause is just?<eos> My people offered you help... and in return you brought upon them only ruin and death.
How much do you want?<eos> Thirty thousand for the jewels, 70,000 for the cars.<eos> One hundred thousand dollars.<eos> None of these items will be reported stolen for a week.<eos> You can clean the cars, put a fresh coat of paint on them, triple your money.
They pay lobbyists to write the fucking laws.<eos> Let's...<eos> Hey, let's cross.<eos> Why?<eos> What, for them?
Even if we kill the Black Dragon and capture the gem, this gem can corrupt the most innocent.<eos> One thing I'm sure of, the Black Dragon gem must be destroyed.<eos> I don't think humans and elves can work together very well.<eos> And priests and witches.<eos> But you made a big impression on them.
And our drivers are approachable.<eos> Now, after you've done the math... and you've shown them how much they can save over the long haul... through proper maintenance... you need to get them to sign.<eos> But the problem is, by hiring you... they need to fire someone else.<eos> And that's never easy.<eos> So after you... show them the number... you look up at them... and stare.
Oh, no, no, they do, they do - on the technical side of things, they think I don't know my Tier IIIs from my PSTNs to my PABXs...and, let's face it, it is fucking boring.<eos> But I'm going to let you in on a secret now.<eos> I do know.<eos> Everything.<eos> But I don't allow them to know that I know because then I can look at them without them knowing that I really do.
Good evening to everyone, and to the people at home...<eos> Just a question... why these ladies are not in museums along with paintings of famous artists?<eos> That's right... we're in the Grotta Balena tomb...<eos> Among the descendants of the mysterious Etruscan people.<eos> We know little about them, we can't read their writing...
There was this man.<eos> He was starving, his family was starving. So he stole a goat from Massoud's land.<eos> He knew it was a death sentence, but... it was either that or let his family starve, so...<eos> When Massoud's men came for him, the man pleaded not for his life, but for that of his wife... who was innocent of the crime.<eos> Massoud looked at them... and he smiled and he said,
We're spoiled by Jack.<eos> Right, now, perhaps if you wait here...<eos> No, I'm coming in with you.<eos> Oh, Olivia, you must not get yourself worked up in a state.<eos> Being fobbed off by them is one thing.
All right.<eos> Later.<eos> What?<eos> Lou has a history, with boys in the band.<eos> She blows through them like the wind.
Turn note over."<eos> Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself?<eos> He had to send in his lackey?<eos> My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be.<eos> Successful people, Mr. Haverford, use their money to use others to work for them.
[John] Some people would...<eos> some people wouldn't. [Gouby] John... was this kind of crazy British... former-Special Forces guy who bragged a lot about how he had been in all these crazy situations, killed lots of people, and saying these horrible things about Congolese.<eos> [John] The people here are nice, but I tell you one thing, they've got bloodlust.<eos> They kill for the fucking sake of killing and they fucking hinge on it.<eos> There are lots of rebels... you look at them and straight away you think...
We got to get him to the hospital.<eos> Should we call Stiles's dad?<eos> I don't know. Is that going to just get more people hurt?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't think guns work on them.
Rong Rong Laundry<eos> I want these dry-cleaned.<eos> How much?<eos> And some new tenants, southerners, moved into the fifth floor flat. They're in sales, I think.<eos> Probably not a pyramid scheme, but I'll keep an eye on them, anyway.
You really think that one of these guys took a tire iron to the king?<eos> What?<eos> Too nerdy to kill?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, look at them.
You must ask yourself this. Do you wanna prevent acts of terror... or do you wanna stay in the dark and watch your country burn?<eos> That's all of 'em. Good.<eos> Get to work, boys.<eos> You got your hands on seven Samaritan servers.<eos> You find anything on them?
Um... ahem... well, M-Ms.<eos> Mayor, uh... I'm sure you're all aware that a violent hate crime occurred a couple nights ago to a member of the Guilty Remnant.<eos> While we conduct our investigation, I thought it would be in the best interests of the town if people remained in their homes after 8 p.m.<eos> I work nights! I'm sure we can make exceptions if you have to get to a job.<eos> So we have to change our lives because of them?
- That's not a solution.<eos> - You killed the others! It was a solution for them!<eos> - It was different.<eos> - I want to know the truth.<eos> Once I turn, I'm gonna go after them, right?
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Every case you won, every case, was down to the work that my men did.<eos> Good cops.<eos> Nobody knows their names, but everybody knows yours.<eos> And now you want to blame them and hold them up to everybody so that the only time people do get to know their names is because you think they did something wrong. Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.
I...<eos> It's not that far down.<eos> I'd maybe sprain an ankle.<eos> I could dive, land on my head.<eos> Or those two sweet marines would run over and try to catch me, and I'd fall on them and end up breaking their necks, and the lawsuits...
Mom, I'm looking.<eos> And, honey, I want you to know everything's gonna be okay.<eos> All right?<eos> Dad's gonna be fine.<eos> And... and people might say stuff at school, but just don't pay any attention to them.
Oh, my God.<eos> You're the Grimm.<eos> I'm also a cop who's concerned that your son might be hurting others or get hurt himself.<eos> After dispatching three Hundjagers at the inn,<eos> I learned one of the most important lessons in hunting them...
[Chuckling] I'm sure it wasn't the only one, though.<eos> Mark.<eos> Trent!<eos> Sorry if these guys seem a little edgy.<eos> I'm eyeing one of them for a promotion.
Previously on Haven...<eos> - Where's the body, officer?<eos> - There isn't one.<eos> These shadows were all that was left of them.
Fire!<eos> Stop, I said! I said stop!<eos> This is Agent Kallus, ISB-021, calling the Inquisitor.<eos> The rebels are through the main gate and headed south.<eos> Their ship will be waiting. Slow them down.
- She said the boys...<eos> - Can't read?<eos> They can't.<eos> They'll learn.<eos> Einstein didn't talk till he was four, but look at them.
They were always at it.<eos> I think he was asking me the question, Perkins.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Probably had something to do with the telegraph boys.<eos> He was always beating up on them.
They say they are here to deliver a letter of mourning.<eos> Is this not asking for trouble?<eos> Miss Er!<eos> People wait for the right time.<eos> The right time does not wait for them.
How hard's he working these guys?<eos> Real hard.<eos> But it's working.<eos> WB might be crazy, D, but he knows what he's doing.<eos> He's bringing them together.
This is for your benefit, Max.<eos> When he's Home Secretary, you're going to get the proper tools you need to do your job.<eos> And half the people in this city won't be shit-scared just to walk down the street.<eos> Of all people, I thought you'd have believed in that.<eos> Jane, I'm paid to catch crooks, not... get them elected.
You're hanging off the highest tower in Jakarta it's a thousand foot drop to your death so you call your three best friends for help<eos> they rush out to save you but they're afraid if they try to pull you up, they might be yanked over themselves so they step back.<eos> You fall... and live.<eos> But do you wish you never tested your friends, in the first place?<eos> Since now you know you can't count on them when it's a matter of life or death.
You tell me you didn't see it, it's because you choose not to look, or are you saying I lie?<eos> Whatever it was, it passed.<eos> Is that how you are with the niggers?<eos> Letting every ill thought fester inside them?<eos> Look at them.
But you do open up an interesting question.<eos> What right have you to your niggers, when you come down to the point?<eos> What right?<eos> I bought them.<eos> I paid for them.
- Say things?<eos> - When you were on a big ship together,<eos> - with all those people.<eos> - Rich people.<eos> You must have bumped into them when you weren't playing - like when you were coming off stage.
All good things can be had right here at the nest!<eos> Welcome!<eos> Lyle, do me a favor and buy those boys a round on me, all right?<eos> The cheap stuff.<eos> Keep an eye on them, as well.
The innocent. Not those who needlessly inflict suffering and pain!<eos> I tried.<eos> - No, you failed!<eos> Twelve jurors were supposed to decide his fate.<eos> They didn't, so now I am gonna do it for them.
So, anyway, he stayed in San Francisco.<eos> We came back here to live with my father in Mar Vista.<eos> House I grew up in. Trippy.<eos> I mean, where do the years go, right?<eos> Uh, look at them. My goodness.
Thanks, Mike.<eos> So... What are we gonna do now?<eos> We're gonna put a dent in the universe.<eos> Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who see things differently.<eos> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things.
It's too thin.<eos> But he was an intelligent man, and with his back to the wall, he was a genius.<eos> And he took the shoelaces out of his boots and made two loops and affixed them to the rope.<eos> And he could move these up when they weren't under tension.<eos> And then he could step into them and climb the rope and save himself.
No, you miss the social charm of a bunch of wiseguys sitting around in the shade.<eos> Huh?<eos> Come on, Stan, Have some respect.<eos> Those guys were my family.<eos> Even if I snitched on them, they were still my family and those were the best years of my life.
The lab's working on overdrive, trying to match the sunflower seeds from the shooting scene to Susan.<eos> What about the acid crime scene?<eos> C.S.U. found a plastic bottle about 5 blocks away from that halfway house with hydrofluoric acid inside.<eos> So they're running the bottle for prints and D.N.A., with the hope that they can match it to Paul.<eos> Yeah, but look at them.
What happens to these soldiers?<eos> Well we can't leave anything operational once we've shut down, way too risky.<eos> Terminate means terminate.<eos> I've got two CPS officers in the lobby<eos> I just need to call them.
Couple of Clover Hill swells.<eos> Lee Paxton and Gerald Johns.<eos> Think one of them could be Drew?<eos> I think Boyd thinks so. Can't figure any other reason he'd be cosying up to them.<eos> Do you mind keeping eyes on them while we try to get our shit together around here?
Crassus lays assault twice upon a day.<eos> Yet with but a handful of men.<eos> He seeks but time for his legions to narrow gap between us, knowing we will slow to protect those weakest among us.<eos> A strategy taking firmest hold.<eos> Tell your gods that Crixus pisses upon them.
Five years ago, those guys, they're running the door at a series of clubs.<eos> Now, a whole lot of hustle and fuckin' zero shame later... yeah?<eos> Revenue is up $50 million.<eos> Stop. 50 fuckin' million dollars.<eos> Look at them.
- You believe that?<eos> - Did you know that the--that psychopathic traits can be found In the most successful ceos?<eos> In the most effective politicians?<eos> Without psychopaths, Mankind wouldn't exist today.<eos> - Well, there's a lot of mankind that doesn't exist Because of them.
You tell her that your love for her is timeless, and that you would be honored to have her hand in marriage.<eos> There's only one problem with that.<eos> I'm afraid of horses.<eos> Like, very afraid.<eos> So? You're not gonna be riding them, you're gonna be driving them, like a car.
Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I blew you off.<eos> I do this.<eos> I push things away when I feel myself wanting them, 'cause that way I can't get hurt.
Thanks, Father.<eos> Yeah, and to answer your question, Detective, if I don't keep track of these kids, no one will.<eos> And it's Pastor, by the way.<eos> So you're just the light at the end of the tunnel.<eos> No, the light at the end of the tunnel is the train that's speeding towards them.
Some pictures I took in Central America and Darfur.<eos> It was impossible to identify all of them.<eos> And these soldiers?<eos> They were helping us.<eos> I was grateful at the time, but look at them.
So people would just blindly copy the mapmaker before them?<eos> With whatever new that's been discovered, But, yeah, for a long time, that's exactly how it was.<eos> So if there was a conspiracy to hide the valley, I mean, it couldn't take much.<eos> If the area's remote enough, Few people go back and re-map it.<eos> That is, until satellites started doing the work for them.
She's the artistic one.<eos> She took these photos?<eos> Of course.<eos> Me, I'm all about the money.<eos> I bring the clients in, she impresses them. Well, usually.
He's picking me up some breakfast.<eos> Cool.<eos> So how'd your date go?<eos> Well, you know what they say about young men. ( Giggles )<eos> That they have no money and when you go out with them, you have to pay for everything?
You don't mind, do you?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Come in.<eos> So, here's an issue.<eos> I've just got journalists and press photographers asking me about rooms, and I know you don't want to bump into them in the corridor and I wouldn't normally ask... It's just that my usual holiday bookings, they've cancelled, and I'm not gonna make it to next spring at this rate, so...
"These men, they'll have you sit on... on their laps. "And then you'll feel something poking you."<eos> And I can't remember the context of when she said that, but it just was, she had this, like, anger in her towards men.<eos> And now, I know exactly what she was talking about, but as a kid, I really... I knew what she was saying was dark, and a little not right.<eos> I've seen her more than once jump back in fear, you know, from a man.<eos> She said several times over the several years, men, all they were out to do is ruin you, stay away from them, be careful of them, you know, that all they want is sex.
Absolutely true.<eos> That's the bottom line on that.<eos> One of us will win this thing. When Brandon was there it was like a certified asylum.<eos> It's comforting to know Brandon was able to fly out of the cuckoo's nest and now we're just left with Phillip.<eos> They're outgunned. I looked at them, I evaluated. When i was looking at them, i was taking them all in, the men in particular.
It's still energized.<eos> Uh-That will work.<eos> Look, we'll have to look for them.<eos> Hope our diversion's still working.<eos> We're going to risk our lives for them?
Her phone's still here, but her car keys are missing.<eos> Our killer might have taken her in her own car.<eos> I'll get Brass to put out a broadcast.<eos> Blood says there was definitely a struggle.<eos> She must've walked in on them.
- It's not Lebron James.<eos> - Damn.<eos> Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think "No problem too small" is working.<eos> I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.<eos> I agree, we need something massive and attention-getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.
I know, ma'am.<eos> So what have you planned for them?<eos> I've planned, ma'am, like a series of activities.<eos> Like for juniors, crafts, games.<eos> And for seniors, I think of making them do a play. Wow.
Still, the advice is free.<eos> You're scaring the hell out of these people.<eos> What good is that?<eos> They're not gangsters.<eos> Look at them. They're a bunch of dentists.
Plus, it's-- the weather, it's...<eos> Sun shines or rain pours, it's warm during the day, cold as balls at night, but...<eos> After years of abuse, and living in fear, she finally did go crazy. She lost it.<eos> People would see her walking up and down the road crying.<eos> She'd scream at them for never believing her, never helping her.
I'm just gonna hit the popcorn button and see what happens.<eos> Luke loves me. I love him.<eos> We're gonna make this work.<eos> Honey, I just don't want you to get hurt.<eos> Young guys spook real easy, and you can't count on them sticking around.
Your son's at 51, isn't he?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'm very proud of him, which is part of the reason I'm here.<eos> I know the guys in that house.<eos> They're good firefighters in a community that depends on them.
- It's not Lebron James.<eos> - Damn.<eos> Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think "No problem too small" is working.<eos> I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.<eos> I agree, we need something massive and attention-getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.
- The twins haven't come back yet, And no one's seen them.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have sent them out there.<eos> - We're going with you.<eos> - No.<eos> They're my responsibility. - I'll find them.
I don't want to.<eos> Just say it. Please.<eos> I like when you fuck me.<eos> Come on, love, will you go and get the boys? Tea's ready!<eos> Well, we'll not wait for them. They won't have gone far.
Shouldn't you be talking to somebody your own age?<eos> That's it.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have any friends my own age.<eos> How have I got time to make them?
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.<eos> He wasn't alone.<eos> - Uh, you don't get to bring friends.<eos> - They are not my friends.<eos> Don't worry, no charge for them.
It's the only thing people think when they see me.<eos> That, and because I live the house where my parents died.<eos> Well, why still alive where they were killed?<eos> They sent me away, when I was 7.<eos> That house is all I have left of them.
A nuke just went of.<eos> I've lost dradis contact with the Syrius and the Base Star.<eos> Keep a grip, kid.<eos> Bandits right up our asses!<eos> We're gonna have to get behind them.
The Americans went to distant countries.<eos> To fight for freedom.<eos> The South Vietnamese people to shape their own destiny.<eos> We do not want the fight expands with consequences no one can overlook.<eos> We will not oppress them, or incite or abuse our power.
You help them by taking on their cases and by winning their cases.<eos> Don't get emotionally involved with them, don't sleep with them, don't kill them.<eos> Isn't that right, Mrs Sheringham?<eos> You can guide, you can advise, comfort.<eos> But you mustn't do it for them.
But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.<eos> Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.<eos> Yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.<eos> What's one more stranger among that lot?<eos> He was waiting for them.
Get in the truck, now!<eos> I'll say it the last time, I'm not making any kind of deal with that woman.<eos> Darren, you don't owe these cops anything.<eos> It is insane to throw this away because of them.<eos> It's not because of them.
But you're old enough to understand that people are gonna expect you... to be really great at sports.<eos> - Because you and Grandpa Dan were?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Now look, the important thing to remember... is that you don't have any responsibility to any of those people.<eos> Not to them, not to me.
Or kill others?<eos> Do you like art?<eos> It's called The Return To The Front.<eos> So these soldiers are going back to... hell, essentially.<eos> But look at them, Tom.
All of you. And wear only soft leather.<eos> Understood?<eos> Condottieri!<eos> Come.<eos> When the scouts ride ahead of the French army, we'll be waiting for them.
The guy's alibi is water, bloody clothes, and he's a runner.<eos> Definitely killed her. There.<eos> Gun was found on the scene.<eos> I'll work the cops, find out if there are any fingerprints on the gun.<eos> And there. Look at them.
Oh, Daniel you're such a romantic.<eos> The drug must have been something that affected the brain.<eos> I'm guessing some kind of selective dopamine agonist. That produces the sensation of being in love.<eos> Then Corvis incorporates some cognitive behavioral techniques.<eos> So the patient experiences those feelings, while having sex with a female and that behavior imprints, on them and creates a new normal.
in that mind of his but he kept it to himself.<eos> He played guitar.<eos> And one day this angel came down to see him of yours is great, we're really happy you found it, but could you like, spread it around a bit like the other musicians?<eos> Come on...<eos> And Larry just looked at them and said, "those other musicians"
Great, that means the pizza's gonna be black and white and three hours long.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> "Citizen Kane," "Marty," "Casablanca"--<eos> What do all these movies have in common?<eos> We fell asleep during them?
It's too late!<eos> You can't! Can you keep an eye...<eos> He'll go crazy in there.<eos> One of your officers shot and killed this man's father.<eos> He'll want to take his anger out on them.
Oh, yeah, I do.<eos> We're gonna seal the deal.<eos> Okay, there are four locations left on this itinerary.<eos> Bergens have been hitting the agenda in order, so we're gonna leave teams at all four places just in case.<eos> Wes and I are gonna look for them at at MOArt.
Let's go. We've work to do. - Nice.<eos> Three hours to go. Let's get to work. - Relax.<eos> We just got in the door.<eos> Richie, where's the peanuts?<eos> You forgot them, didn't you?
Living down here, I've had time to reflect.<eos> You know what I've come to realize?<eos> You like your reflection.<eos> I've seen that I've made mistakes.<eos> But that I can also learn from them.
It is good for men to love their present pains upon example.<eos> So the spirit is eased.<eos> Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.<eos> My good lords, commend me to the captains in our camp.<eos> Do my good morrow to them, and anon desire them come to my pavilion.
Is it the dishonesty or the polyamory that you take issue with?<eos> The lying.<eos> Okay, well, separate that out.<eos> These people are in a tough spot.<eos> Society is not ready for them.
Dr. Hank Lawson.<eos> I... I have a new phone number.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And, uh, when... when you get this message, you can... you can just call me back on that new phone number because... because I have some exciting new programs.<eos> They're exciting, and they're new, and you are gonna wanna hear about 'em so much that you're gonna call me back to find out about them.
That's great.<eos> And I wanna hear all about it.<eos> But first...<eos> Order waterproof brochures to hand out at beach clubs.<eos> Sorry. If I don't record my ideas right away... I've been losing them 'cause I've been getting a lot of ideas.
Here we go. 1:00.<eos> So those are the corner guys, the ones taking the orders?<eos> Yeah, except I think we might be cramping their style.<eos> Where are the runners, the kids who deliver the drugs?<eos> God, look at them.
And, each one of you is in this prison for a reason.<eos> But, these insects, whatever they are, they're marshaling to attack in force.<eos> And, when they do, they will destroy everyone and everything here, before swarming to Earth.<eos> Fight them with us, and I will personally testify on your behalves at your parole hearings, or do nothing...<eos> and wait for them in your cells.
Even just to change cops, like cops with a "k."<eos> - You could do, like, Keystone Kops.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That was, like, the comedy team from the silent era of films.<eos> Things that spill on them.
You'll have to get your trench restored by morning.<eos> Just make sure the men keep their heads down.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You three, over here!<eos> Go and tell B Company that I'll come and take a look at them, say 10 minutes. Keep blindside of that mound as you go.
But we can stop people exploiting that fact.<eos> We can stop dealers giving them bikes and arming them with guns so they can go around delivering their filthy drugs.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Simple.<eos> We grass them up.
We cannot control their fate.<eos> It's just, they're risking their lives to save just one.<eos> Do not underestimate the king's power.<eos> He represents hope and is critical to their success.<eos> I feel responsible for them.
Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Uh, my guys are "wrapping the package" as we speak.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Um, I'm looking at them.
- OK.<eos> It's just...<eos> I want to live a normal life for a while.<eos> Get to know people for who they are.<eos> Not constantly look at them and see if they'd make a great mark or not.
Fabric softener.<eos> My God, that is interesting.<eos> Do you know that the exact access to the unconscious mind that you're describing has been sought after since the beginning of civilization?<eos> The Greeks used to sleep in temple chambers, hoping to receive insight from their dreams.<eos> Even philosophers and scientists have recorded incredible breakthroughs delivered to them while asleep.
And it's only when our support systems look like they might fail us... ♪ And say they're still alive ♪<eos> If you're not at the hospital, you're here.<eos> You sleep here, you eat here.<eos> There are no distractions, no breaks. This is the Grey method, and it starts now. ♪ I was surprised you stuck around ♪<eos> That we realize how much we've depended on them all along.
Check him.<eos> Yeah. Apparently you're some kind of big deal.<eos> Ready to make a change, Julian?<eos> Go time, people.<eos> Can you depend on them?
Let's face it.<eos> They always put work first.<eos> "They"?<eos> Doctors who aren't me.<eos> And when it comes to counting on them for social obligations...
Enough, enough, enough! Knock it off, both of you.<eos> She's crazy. Her and her daughter.<eos> Eve, let's not make things any more acrimonious.<eos> Hey, you know what, don't talk to me about it.<eos> I'm not the one calling people up and lighting into them like some kinda psycho!
I have my old archery trophies at home.<eos> You could take a crack at those.<eos> - Archery?<eos> - I could see if my dads are free.<eos> You could hurl some anti-gay slurs at them.
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would I kill my own friends?<eos> Maybe they're not your friends, Rich.<eos> See, I think you blame them for everything bad that's happened to you.<eos> I think you blame them for faith breaking up with you.
Why do you think we sent those photos to them in the first place?<eos> It was Mary's idea.<eos> What do you want to do, again? I'm just saying...<eos> I could, like, fake like I'm dead, and you could take pictures to send to my parents.<eos> Man, you must be really pissed at them.
For generations, it was viking against dragon.<eos> The battles were ferocious.<eos> Then one day, everything changed.<eos> I met Toothless.<eos> Together, we've shown people here that instead of fighting dragons, we can ride them, live with them, even train them.
Maybe you don't know everything about your father.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Officers, into the tunnel, be cautious.<eos> You three, stay up here.<eos> Officer Song keep an eye on them.
We are two educated, successful, enlightened gay men.<eos> I guess we can't be held entirely responsible.<eos> We do meet a lot of black people. Right.<eos> We see them at work.<eos> We run into them at parties, except for our own.
So what? It wasn't exactly paradise?<eos> No, but we didn't have these disciple creeps selling us smack and rock in front of our school.<eos> Hey, you remember the Krasik kid?<eos> Yeah, she O.D.'d last month.<eos> Yeah, because of them.
It took him ten days to bleed out.<eos> I can't imagine the pain he must have been in.<eos> I can't believe he died with no one knowing what he did.<eos> For years, Tim Murphy was homeless, and he was forgotten.<eos> He was one of those people on the streets that we try not to look at, because the sight of them is just too painful.
By all means.<eos> If you were looking to make a lasting impression on the altar today, you succeeded. You look beautiful.<eos> Well, speaking of impressions,<eos> I can't tell you how many people have remarked on the one you've been making at the office.<eos> Well, seeing how most of these people remember me as the kid who got drunk and ruined your Christmas party, I'd say the fact that I can find the office impresses them. Oh, don't do that, Daniel.
We won't leave before then!<eos> Then please come this way.<eos> The x Guard's x Duty<eos> Gon and his friends have confronted the obstacles that they must overcome in order to meet with Killua.<eos> What awaits them at their destination?
Eat.<eos> It's not their fault.<eos> Are you blind?<eos> The Koretzkys killed themselves because of what Camille told them.<eos> My baby died because of them.
When I left out of here going to work this morning you wasn't no part of my plans, but here you is.<eos> Doesn't mean anything. Everything that happened doesn't mean something else.<eos> What's it mean then?<eos> Doesn't mean anything. You run into people.<eos> And maybe some of them are in trouble or whatever, but it doesn't mean you're responsible for them.
It's pretty. It's very green.<eos> It's really isolated.<eos> We could get lonely.<eos> No, we could have people out here.<eos> Impress them with our homemade jams.
Fool..<eos> ..look at them from the point of view of a scrap dealer.<eos> These kids are such scraps..<eos> ..who didn't even value themselves.<eos> Now.. now look at them..
Bandits attacked us, Your Highness.<eos> They took everything.<eos> We can't go back there; it's not safe.<eos> Can we give them sanctuary here?<eos> Find them rooms? I'll vouch for them.
You saw what happened when we went about passing healthcare.<eos> We had a revolt.<eos> We are free market kind of folks.<eos> We're capitalists.<eos> People should get what's coming to them in America, nothing more.
What else is new?<eos> Flying machines?<eos> Where's this Indian settlement?<eos> You would choose the boys over me?<eos> I'm responsible for them.
Well, I walked through fire with Eli.<eos> - If he trusted you, then so do I.<eos> - I'm glad to hear it, because I am ready to assume leadership of the Fifth Column, as Eli requested.<eos> There's a small group of trusted lieutenants from around the world.<eos> Eli relied on them.
He's right, Erica.<eos> I think there's a way we can cement this bond.<eos> We have no bond.<eos> I will give you the two men who killed the peace ambassadors.<eos> You can use them as scapegoats for your partner's disappearance.
There's a small group of trusted lieutenants from around the world.<eos> - Eli relied on them.
The service has been royally fucked many times.<eos> Usually by your government jumping on us like Rover with a hard-on, and we've always survived the experience.<eos> Oi, out!<eos> With respect, Minister, politicians come and go.<eos> I've counted them in and I've counted them out.
But our walls don't even touch.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Anyway, I do have plans.<eos> You sure?<eos> 'Cause you haven't mentioned them out loud.
It's against my medical and personal ethics.<eos> Doctor, the two men brought in with the orphans were S.A.S. agents posing as aid workers.<eos> We think the orphanage was being used by the Taliban to recruit children and in essence use them as weapons of war.<eos> Those two agents went in there to rescue two dozen children at that orphanage.<eos> But found it virtually empty and an ambush waiting for them.
It's this year's latest fashion.<eos> This is called Doodle do Wine<eos> It'll make you hiccup!<eos> Doodle-do!<eos> My parents like you to look at them when you speak.
Now, if you'll excuse me, it appears I'm running late to drink a bottle of wine in my bathing suit.<eos> Pierce, wait.<eos> You know, I've been coming to this school for 12 years. I've never been friends with anyone here more than a semester.<eos> Probably for the same reason I've been married seven times.<eos> I guess I assume eventually I'll be rejected, so I, you know, test people, push them, until they prove me right.
Nobody.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> No!<eos> The cops will be laughing at us trying it clip each other all the time.<eos> Doing their job for them, we are.
Mr. Gordon.<eos> What a fantastic surprise.<eos> And excellent job on the costumes.<eos> I bet you're the only Irene Adler in the place.<eos> Look at them.
What?<eos> Bastards!<eos> Bastards!<eos> This world is full of uncivilized people.<eos> Don't pay them any attention.
"Let's hide our grief and tell everyone our wishes."<eos> "Buddy, don't forget, this place is very cool."<eos> "Listen, listen, let me say."<eos> "We will never forget these days."<eos> "We will think about them tomorrow."
He thinks they're married, and his parents think they're married because I told them they're married.<eos> I told them they're remarried because they're sleeping together.<eos> Oh, jeez. Now I've put that in my head, and it's only 8:00 in the morning.<eos> Well, just tell Frank that they're not married and you don't want them to come over and meet his parents.<eos> You lied because you-- you were just so embarrassed by them.
Here you go, expenses.<eos> Kentish Town, please, mate.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Back when I was working... some mornings, I'd be driving to the job and I'd look out and see all these people doing ordinary things, you know?<eos> Waiting at a bus-stop, buying a coffee, buying a sandwich and I'd, like, look at them and I'd think,
Did you say Argentina?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Look, it's an enormous break for the case, but, look, there's still no sign of the big fish, so why don't you and Gabriel sit tight?<eos> You're likely to spot some more middlemen 'cause I'm looking at a bunch of empty containers here, so, odds are, more cars are gonna be leaving the lot.<eos> We'll wait for them here and follow up with the two suspects we just apprehended.
You're the only one who knows the right thing to do.<eos> - Amanda had a theory about that.<eos> - Don't care. Liar.<eos> She said you need people but you don't trust them.<eos> You withhold information to keep them dependent on you but make their choices for them so they can't disappoint you.
According to Lester Brown's "Earth Policy Institute" it would take under $ 200 billion dollars a year to restore the earth's environment and meet global social goals.<eos> But this stage isn't the endgoal of the liberty perspective.<eos> While stage one has lot of the compassion, typically associated with liberal-democratic agenda, stage two reflects much of the wisdom of the traditional conservative worldview.<eos> In stage two we shrink government's role, to protect the individual liberty and storing things we share in common, like ecosystems and the airwaves we use to communicate.<eos> As the system gains integrity and will move to sound currency, people will have enough money to have more control over everything that affects them.
Having absolutely no idea what's going on.<eos> All my dad said was he was going to help my mom, and then nothing from either of them.<eos> Yeah, that's rough.<eos> It could be anything, you know?<eos> Sixers could have ambushed them.
The knights are like brothers, yet they fight and quarrel like foes.<eos> It started the moment we found her.<eos> But look at her.<eos> She's just a girl.<eos> How could she affect them this way?
Sure. What?<eos> That is if I'm not obstructing your view.<eos> Would you like me to move.<eos> I can move.<eos> No, you're fine. I had enough time to look at them.
- That's true.<eos> - It was his flaw.<eos> He wasn't greedy, and he wasn't evil.<eos> Those investors knew what he was doing, and it was exactly what they wanted him to do.<eos> But he paid the price for them.
- Regardless, families like the Marks set their assets up this way - to protect them from divorces.<eos> - Motherfuckers!<eos> Okay, could you just not...<eos> These people play hardball.<eos> If you want a settlement, you're gonna have to think of a way to motivate them.
- Is anybody in there?<eos> - Please, help me.<eos> - Pull her out.<eos> - We should wait for the paramedics.<eos> - How can we call them? - Get it off of me.
I'm hopeful that three of their party being dead will take the starch out of them.<eos> You display great poise.<eos> It's just a turkey shoot.<eos> There was one time, in New Mexico, we was being pursued by seven men.<eos> I turned Bo around and taking them reins in my teeth rode right at them boys, firing them two Navy sixes I carry on my saddle.
Nuclear rods.<eos> Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.<eos> Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.
Still believes that all survive to prove?<eos> Almost all.<eos> It is still a fool, then.<eos> Batiatus paid these men?<eos> Very little the appearance of them.
I just finally learned how to speak his language.<eos> Cryptic clues, slogans and code.<eos> Here's $50,000.<eos> That should be enough to get your parents to the States.<eos> And when they get here, they'll have decent jobs waiting for them.
As for the vault, we're standing on it.<eos> Vesta decoded this sequence from a puzzle across town.<eos> It was encoded on manhole covers.<eos> Really tough to get, but we got it.<eos> So I'll just name off the signs And you step on them as I go, okay?

If anyone understands doing whatever it takes for your dream, it's me.<eos> Yeah, some girls, you know, wouldn't be cool with somebody that they're getting close to just taking off.<eos> Well, that's not me.<eos> You have to follow your dream.<eos> But I guess some guys, you know maybe would wonder if a girl would wait for them.
You speak pretty good English for someone who needs a translator.<eos> We both know that I don't need a translator.<eos> Then why do you have one?<eos> Because I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of.<eos> It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.
- Because you're...<eos> - You're crap.<eos> It all ties up, if you think it through...<eos> Except, what about the old couple?<eos> The police can't pin anything on them.
Captain, we've lost contact.<eos> Try again.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Captain, Lee Myung Gook.<eos> Still haven't ripped through them?
The one girl in the universe to whom the Doctor tells everything?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So what's his name?<eos> Now, which one of these men would you really choose?<eos> Look at them.
You a man, Tyrel?<eos> Bet you think you're a real man.<eos> I got news for you.<eos> You're not a man at all.<eos> 'Cause real men, they don't let women fight their battles for them.
- The apocalypse... - Hey!<eos> I'm Dean Winchester.<eos> Do you know who I am? Dear God<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> Listen, I need you to pray to your angel buddies and let them know that I'm here.
Now, where can we plug this in?<eos> OK, let's start class.<eos> Now, the Internet is like a series of spider webs that connects us to each other.<eos> Oh, except that the webs are invisible. Oh, and the spiders are nerds.<eos> - Ooh, look at them all.
You're done.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> Um, I was wondering, do you have a study group?<eos> Oh, hey, uh... Actually, I'm just pledging sigma chi.<eos> The brothers are making me take notes for them.
And people like you, you're gonna scare them away.<eos> You're gonna force them to leave.<eos> That's why you did it.<eos> That's why you did it.<eos> The V don't believe in fighting... so people like me have to do it for them.
So, Mike told me about your problem.<eos> I had a buddy pull some paperwork.<eos> Turns out Mr. Lei rents a place on star island.<eos> So, here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Next time these guys head out for grub, we stage a mock ambush on them.
I want to be president because-- I don't know.<eos> I want to beat Blank, and I want to get into Brown, and, well, the truth is every morning I wake up, and I think, "Who are these people?<eos> Why am I the only person who cares about anything that matters?"<eos> And then every morning I remember, they're idiots.<eos> They have teeny-tiny little pea brains that can only process information in the form of a tweet, a ring tone, or a status update, and if they're not going to think for themselves, they need someone like me to think for them.
Yeah. Go, Kat.<eos> The truth is every morning I wake up and I think, "Who are these people?<eos> Why am I the only person who cares about anything that matters?"<eos> And then every morning I remember they're idiots.<eos> Theyhaveteeny-tinylittlepea brains. that can only process information in the form of a tweet, a ring tone, or a status update, and if they're not going to think for themselves, they need someone like me to think for them.
- It's OK. - Silence!<eos> Mara, doing it a few times doesn't mean you're dating.<eos> So what? Anyway, his pals told me he never calls.<eos> And you believe his pals?<eos> Just look at them.
Oh, come on, Phil!<eos> These guys are the best.<eos> They're going to do things tonight that'll blow your mind.<eos> Really? Really?<eos> Look at them. They're young, they're keen. And all they want to do is show you a good time.
- And you shouldn't.<eos> But the people in our agency who are talking to you Are clearly unhappy with the status quo.<eos> Maybe I could help them.<eos> I've given these people my word.<eos> I would go to jail for them.
Ok, you wanna drink, you're gonna drink here on my watch.<eos> You wanna drink till you puke or pass out or start a fire,<eos> I will be here to protect my kids.<eos> I've been on my own this whole goddamn time.<eos> Well, except for the guys, thank God for them.
NCIS!<eos> Mr. Mason, if you're in there, please open up.<eos> Lock is broken.<eos> Kidnappers appear to have gotten here first.<eos> Looks like Mason was waiting for them.
That must kill you.<eos> So what do I do with it once I get it?<eos> Return it to the rightful owners.<eos> Give it to the Russian museum.<eos> The person who wants it will take his eye off you and put it on them.
It's just ... this whole thing with Jess, it's making me do things I wouldn't normally do.<eos> But, you know, she's worth it.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> Do you have friends?<eos> I... I mean, I guess I just, I never had time for them.
I told you this was going to Happen.<eos> We've wasted enough time on Those losers.<eos> Their failure is our failure.<eos> I've made a request to general Shaak Ti that the domino squad Be allowed to repeat the final<eos> Test. Why do you care about them?
Where? I'm right here.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Yeah, you're my little...<eos> Come on, baby, bring it.<eos> I'm touching you with rose petals because if anybody else touched you, I would take their nuts and put 'em in a beanbag and then let fat people sit on them. Okay, baby, you don't have to get upset. Okay?
People of the court, these guys are total dildos.<eos> This is a waste of court time!<eos> Perhaps I can help us all to put an end to this.<eos> Mr. Murderface and Mr. Wartooth do not contribute on a writing level so they do not receive writers credit, residuals, etc.<eos> I've submitted all contracts signed by them that show this.
What are you getting at?<eos> Do you think she wish to see you in your endless killing spree?<eos> There would be no end to revenge.<eos> You would just make your sister miserable forever.<eos> My friends do not want me to avenge them, they want me to stop you.
The key to their survival lay in their past.<eos> Their centuries-old protector had returned.<eos> He was born again:<eos> Liu Sheng.<eos> Born in another form and country their protector awaits them.
It's a hostile act.<eos> I don't have any siblings, my parents are dead, my wife and child are dead, so why can't I join my family?<eos> What about Jeff?<eos> What about your other friends?<eos> Why should I be forced to stay alive for them?
Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hell.<eos> I beat 'em like they stole something from me.<eos> All you gotta do is utilize your speed on them, and they...
Shit. Wait a minute, guys.<eos> - What? - Down there.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> How did these bastards find us?<eos> LT, we're against the mountain here, and the only way out of here is through them.
— Woe, ataman!<eos> Cossacks look for you!<eos> Lyakhs have been reinforced! Fresh troops have come to their rescue! Lyakhs have been reinforced!<eos> Cossacks don't want die without looking in your eyes!<eos> They want you to gaze upon them once more before the hour of death arrives.
And he kissed me, and I felt my tears on his lips.<eos> The snow came down thicker and thicker, and with it came this wonderful peace.<eos> After I left your apartment that night, I felt strange.<eos> Like people on the street, especially the guys, were all staring at me.<eos> But then I began to look at them.
I'm cheryl, by the way.<eos> You're gonna try to have sex with jack?<eos> I have to.<eos> I have 15 employees.<eos> I'm responsible for them.
I'm just saying rest first.<eos> Then maybe speak to that scruffy gang of yours.<eos> I said terrible things to those men.<eos> The bravest, most loyal men in England. I didn't want... any more blood on my hands.<eos> The truth is, I'd die for them.
Then it's Hood I need to destroy.<eos> I need to get to his weakness, exploit his vulnerabilities.<eos> Which are?<eos> His friends, that odious little gang.<eos> The idiot cares about them.
Marco, the new concierge.<eos> Cute, huh?<eos> After Stefano I said:<eos> "No more good-looking men."<eos> You have to be beware of them, they drink.
- No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - 'Cause they don't want any.<eos> Well, how do you know that if you didn't offer?<eos> Because when they're working for me I make decisions for them, and I've decided they don't want any fucking coffee.
You asked the mutants for help, the most pathetic and unfortunate people, who bear the burden of this balance.<eos> But they didn't want to change anything.<eos> -Why, then?<eos> - Because people should be free.<eos> Who are you to decide for them?
Guess the blonde was more interesting. The blonde?<eos> Oh, yeah. 5'4", long hair.<eos> What a rack.<eos> Why do guys always say that?<eos> It's not like you can hang a coat on them.
I mean, you would have done the same thing, right, man?<eos> Just... what happened next, sir?<eos> So they told me to get out the car.<eos> So I did, only they didn't know I was armed, you know?<eos> So right away, I point the gun at them. I told them to back off.
He is Bhairava.<eos> Salim bhai, 2 teas please.<eos> - Serve 2 teas.<eos> Look at those police horses. How beautiful!<eos> If we get on them ride... any girl will fall for us.
And this is me and Jack at Buckroe Beach.<eos> Now, I know your parents didn't let you drive out there with that boyfriend of yours by yourself.<eos> - No, no, they drove. - Okay.<eos> And then they tortured us the whole way there and then wouldn't leave us alone for one second.<eos> You know, he's probably going to dump me because of them.
Look, sex scandal: 87 percent chance she goes to these sources.<eos> Serial killer scare: 90 percent she contacts these sources for confirmation.<eos> Government secrets and health scare intersects: Ninety-five percent chance she goes to these sources.<eos> Look, look. Right there. She's emailing them right now.<eos> I am answering for them.
It will happen.<eos> Stay here and watch how it happens.<eos> He's our guest, take his luggage.<eos> - Yes boss.<eos> I wanted to kill men here but now I'm getting welcomed by them.
It doesn't matter what I think.<eos> You made your decision.<eos> Surgeons step up, Sam.<eos> They don't question. They don't doubt.<eos> They don't let other people decide for them what is right or what is wrong.
When I was 1 4...<eos> I was raped, and got pregnant.<eos> My parents insisted that I abort the child, of course.<eos> From then on...<eos> I felt I'd rather hurt people than be hurt by them.
We tie this... this in with Brzezinski.<eos> Brzezinski said in Two Ages... Now this guy was way up with the NSA. He was a... he's a master geo-politician.<eos> He works, and admits that he works, in 20-50 year periods to do with geo-politics in other countries.<eos> But he said himself, "The public will shortly be unable to think or reason for themselves."<eos> He was meaning by that the form that... the... of... of information that was given to them, the type, the... the formulas that were in use then, in the 1970s.
Now, at that time, sports was something that children, school children, were into. Adults became adults, and got on to adult things. So it was unimaginable at the time that people could actually believe that there is even a need for adult sports and entertainment, never mind having arenas built across the world.<eos> But he said we can do this and foist, basically, a sports culture for the males using a tribal system.<eos> We're all tribal to an extent; that's why we even bother to vote for a tribal leader. This is well understood. That's why we're supplied with these leaders.<eos> And because the... the average man was to become more disengaged from his own destiny as the expert class arose, it was decided that... that the males would get the... their... their outlet basically, being... gradually becoming helpless as... as males through sports. Therefore they'd have a tribal team they could identify with; they could cheer them on as they were winning.<eos> In their own personal lives, they were getting nowhere; they were getting disenfranchised, in a sense, as experts took over decision-making for them in all kinds of fields.
By coming together as communities, by getting to know our neighbors, we defeat the social engineers.<eos> We're programmed today perfectly just like machines.<eos> This is the best day of my life!<eos> We tie this... this in with Brzezinski.

And free to become chained to another master.<eos> Me.<eos> How?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Richard, the madman that first put the spell on them was named Canton Rahl.
E.M.S.,whatyouthink?<eos> youbettergethim lookedat, you hear?<eos> okay.<eos> allright. And these little children, they fast, boy.<eos> Somebody got to keep an eye on them, You know what I'm saying?
I'm keeping my back to the media thanks to our friend Lance, and the Pope is sending me personal messages and none of them too polite.<eos> You sit watching films and all you can say is "not them"?<eos> That's right.<eos> Because we've been busy too.<eos> I've pushed them through the full array of psychotropic tests.
Best not to think about it.<eos> Best just to get on with the job in hand, which is destroying the enemy before they're even born and have a chance to threaten us.<eos> We're expecting any resistance to be light, as the ancestors of our enemies have yet to evolve any thumbs, or indeed spines.<eos> But that does not change the fact that they may one day evolve into a species that may pose a threat to us.<eos> And for that reason we are going to rain down a fiery death upon them, that will turn the surface of their planet into a radioactive desert because we are the Planetary Peace Corps and that is what we do!
Hold your arm up.<eos> To the right.<eos> A bit more.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Don't archaeology professors normally have someone to do this sort of thing for them?
And my hand shakes when I write.<eos> Because you don't sleep anymore.<eos> Yes, I don't sleep anymore.<eos> Your friends from the faction don't call anymore.<eos> Pray for them, Livia.
I can't take you losing those boys again.<eos> They have been a primary thorn in my ass for months.<eos> - So, victor...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Glue your eyeballs to them till i get there.
One year ago they worked in the evidence room.<eos> They did it.<eos> They gave the syringe to my Dad and expected it to disappear.<eos> And then it turned up in court.<eos> If my Dad had told about them, they would go to jail.
I thought you didn't get back until tomorrow.<eos> - Yeah, but I rapped up early. - Hm'hm.<eos> Where're the kids?<eos> They went to a baseball game.<eos> You wanna wait and have lunch with them?
Always normal.<eos> Are you like them?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Are you ashamed?<eos> Yes, ashamed for them.
Tony is her husband, she has responsibility to him.<eos> Mom, can you please just?<eos> And what about his responsibility to her?<eos> To those kids? Look at those boys.<eos> Look at them.
And when... anxiety and fear and pain bubble up from below, how can that be dealt with, except by looking at it?<eos> Except by analyzing it?<eos> We don't run the show, Paul.<eos> I sometimes think that therapists can start to imagine they're like writers, you know, that they can control the outcome.<eos> We don't live their lives for them, we don't even live them with them.
And plans are important, aren't they, Matthew?<eos> I understand.<eos> I understand. The very fact that you say you understand means you have no idea. Then why don't you try to explain it to me?<eos> I have been explaining. Each of your colleagues has been an explanation.<eos> They experiment, and I experiment on them.
He thought everybody loved his movies.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - No!<eos> Nobody loves documentaries.<eos> But people do find them restful.
Kahlan, I just want you to know that I really appreciate you looking out for me.<eos> Well, if you'd listened to me, that boy would have been executed.<eos> You saved him.<eos> After living under Rahl for so long, people have forgotten what a hero is.<eos> But you stood up and fought for them.
We need this inventoried.<eos> Down to the last bullet before we ship out.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> They got wild dogs roaming around the camp by the shitters.<eos> They use shotguns on them.
Hey, shut up.<eos> Here we go. Everybody, gather up.<eos> An intervention, it's sort of hard to describe, but, really, it's a coming together.<eos> It's a surprise party for people who have addictions.<eos> And you get in their face and you scream at them, and you make them feel really badly about themselves.
There's something very sexual about low, low bass.<eos> Theat sort of affect you down here.<eos> It's just a way you can feel it in your body.<eos> It's something like for a party, for a crowd, they just dance to it.<eos> Sometimes you won't even know what the bass lines are doing, but it does something to the crowd, it's like soundwaves hitting people and affecting them.
School evidently didn't manage to offer me more noble values.<eos> But sometimes there's not such a difference.<eos> I work at night here.<eos> I did that there too.<eos> There I had to take out old men's piss, and here, for a change, they want me to pee on them.
I'm not ready to die.<eos> I want a life. Lizzie and... I want to see things get better first, you know.<eos> Zero's just a myth.<eos> Why do you think he hides behind that name?<eos> He only helps people so he can bleed them dry longer. You must be able to see that.
Oh, no.<eos> Please, no.<eos> Oh, Christ!<eos> He's pulled a Pocock. What is it with me and young men?<eos> I always push it into them too soon... and too hard.
And I am about to get married.<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Why are you doing this to me Sia?<eos> Rags please, please don't say anything more.<eos> my parents have gone through hell I don't think I will be able to forgive myself for doing this to them.
We cannot give him a princess we don't have.<eos> He could have accepted our help- instead, he issued an ultimatum.<eos> - And took two of our boys!<eos> - We have little choice.<eos> Our duty is to lead our people, not to be led by them.
Ah, do you want to tell me why?<eos> Yeah, back there, it was absurd to believe... in anything.<eos> In the sun we did not believe.<eos> And yet you, here of all places, you believe in miracles.<eos> You not only believe in them; you depend on them.
Hey!<eos> Look!<eos> He's calling his friends.<eos> That's funny.<eos> - Look at them.
And for Winther.<eos> I traffic documents.<eos> And do different jobs for them.<eos> I follow orders, like you.<eos> You turned them in. Didn't you?
She's with other people, Kyle.<eos> It's better protection.<eos> She'd better be worth it.<eos> She is.<eos> We can crawl across town down here without them ever seeing us.
Of course we can.<eos> There's ample precedent for it, starting with the declaration of independence, you hack.<eos> –Mr Cooper... –I am still judge Cooper, especially to you, sir.<eos> And if you were a decent judge, you would understand that the jurisdiction belongs in federal, not state court.<eos> –And if you were a decent judge, you'd know that the federal courts, wanting two bites at the apple to quash this, would first kick it right back to state, hoping you'll do their work for them.
If these four Cylons want to come to you, they're free to do so.<eos> I will not stop them.<eos> Do you agree with this, Admiral?<eos> Agreed.<eos> Well, then I will await them on the baseship.
- Hey. Everybody needs to calm down, OK?<eos> - Jack, these people are lying to us!<eos> - I know they're lying.<eos> But sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them.<eos> And when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
Mom? Dad? Well yes, let's eat.<eos> I'll have Alexandra serve the salads at once.<eos> Hi, hon, it's me.<eos> Just calling to check in and wish you luck this morning.<eos> I know it's your first final, and I know you're gonna knock their socks off or their bow ties or whatever it is you knock off professors when you're trying to impress them.
Astor?<eos> Sweetie, what's the matter?<eos> Mom's acting all weird and stuff.<eos> - What kind of weird?<eos> - She keeps talking to people on the phone about my dad, then she starts yelling at them.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is that exactly?<eos> An intervention is, well... we sit her down in a roomful of people that love her.<eos> Everybody goes around the room and, you know, starts to share with her how much her addiction has affected them negatively.
I feel great.<eos> Forgot how much I hate it here.<eos> There's so much noise in this time period.<eos> So many people.<eos> Look at them.
- Mr. Commander, may I ask you for what purpose we are actually commandeering all these buildings throughout the country?<eos> One half of this training facilites will become training camps.<eos> - I see!<eos> - The other half will belong to me.<eos> And when the time has come I will earn money with them.
And,uh,harding,the guy who owned the sporting goods store he explained away his print on the uh,murder weapon.<eos> We got to put somebody else at this crime scene.<eos> But I've been through half of this debris already, and it's given me nothing.<eos> What about these shards of glass?<eos> It's,um... it's possible that somebody could've put a print on them when they were entering the store.
She seemed lovely, right?<eos> - She was a delight.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We get outside, there was a group of tramps, two of whom she knows by name.<eos> She starts screaming at them,
Humanity will defeat you.<eos> The answer to 1984 is 1776.<eos> Bilderberg is an elite organization and the way it works, - the protocol of the meetings is, the staff, after they're vetted out, - they're told exactly how they're supposed to behave themselves, -<eos> meaning they can never address the attendees, they can never speak to them - unless they are spoken to first, they can never look them in the eye. They have to approach them from the right side (right-handed people) - and the left side (left-handed people).<eos> They can never look them straight on. And needless to say, all the information that is being spoken - during the conferences is under no circumstances allowed to come out.
And then you could do the surgery to fix my face?<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> You know how famous people, everywhere they go people are watching them, staring?<eos> They never have a chance to just be, you know?<eos> And people stare at them because they're beautiful, but, me they just stare...
You!<eos> Mark my words!<eos> I'll get even with you one day!<eos> Karma will linger in their minds, waiting for the right time to bring upon them their own consequences.<eos> Luang Poo, how long will that take until the karma will bring upon them their own consequences?
So which is it?<eos> Is Leo Sasha? Or is Pinnacle a disinformation agent?<eos> It is not the fittest, but the most deceptive orchids that survive.<eos> Most orchid species depend upon their ability to misrepresent themselves to insects.<eos> They deceive them into landing on them and then spreading their pollen to other orchids.
-And you guys seem great.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You have lovely friends.<eos> My best friends.<eos> I'd give my life for them.
Safe.<eos> This convoy trusts me with their lives.<eos> These people don't need pipe dreams.<eos> Maybe that's exactly what they need.<eos> Look at them, Claire.
Are they royal born?<eos> No.<eos> Do they inherit the office of prophet?<eos> No.<eos> The prophets are called directly by God and through them God's will is revealed.
The guys were at the door.<eos> I just let them in.<eos> What a bunch of losers!<eos> They're handicapped.<eos> Just look at them.
Fucking unbeliviable!<eos> Where are those two geniuses now?<eos> Deni, they split.<eos> They are probably not coming back.<eos> We'll wait for them by the car!
Indeed they were hunting.<eos> They were hunting for white scalps.<eos> I am a friend of the Great Father, President Grant.<eos> And I want to tell you, he did not wish for there to be war between us again.<eos> The Great Father is the chief of all your people, chosen by them.
I get free haircuts.<eos> I'm not taking the fall.<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> We're gonna arrest these two little dipshits, okay?<eos> And we're gonna pin it on them.
And you guys seem great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You have lovely friends.<eos> My best friends.<eos> I'd give my life for them.
And you know what?<eos> These people seem to like it here.<eos> They actually seem to enjoy this existence.<eos> So, why should I fight it?<eos> -Why should I die for them?
I lod him.<eos> Everybody loved him.<eos> But things happen in this world,Johnny.<eos> Good people make bad decisions.<eos> Or sometimes those decisions get made for them.
Hell, when I first heard there were alien worlds and races out there, I freaked out.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid of how advanced they might be.<eos> Afraid of what their intentions were.<eos> Afraid they might come into my world and kill me and I'll be honest with you, their are worlds and races out there who do mean you and your people harm, but we're not one of 'em and you're lucky you ran into us before you ran into them.
And here comes the next float, honoring uninjured veterans. - Yeah!<eos> - We rock!<eos> Our wives stayed with us.<eos> - Think fast! - We did!<eos> Mom, how come when we see these guys on the street corner you tell me not to stare at them, and today that's all we're doing?
No.<eos> Once my consulship is over, we're gone.<eos> But it's so far from Rome.<eos> They have dressmakers and jewel merchants in Odessa just like here.<eos> Once you're gone from Italy your enemies will no longer fear you and you will be powerless to strike at them.

Well, good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Kenji?<eos> You don't think people really need parents, right?<eos> Then why would we want to take revenge on them?
- You're the one who's done all this?<eos> - All this?<eos> This experiment.<eos> You murdered those people.<eos> You allowed those bugs to feed on them.
Beat up for a story.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'm not even writing on the Kings and Shadows.<eos> My piece is about students paying other students to take their exams for them.
Well, a lot of good Resistance people lost their lives.<eos> I said knock it off. All right?<eos> Sorry, Dee.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I have more of a reason to be mad at them than you do.
Might not wanna go there, cash.<eos> She's a relationship coach.<eos> Figures.<eos> You're the type of girl who wants to be liked,<eos> The girl who feeds her construction guys, when really, she should be yelling at them.
What?<eos> I trained him.<eos> I train all the new wardens.<eos> You blame yourself for the kid?<eos> I'm responsible for them.
That's the stone ghost army! The stoned guys army?<eos> Stone ghost!<eos> If these things are on the move again, it means he must be nearby.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Charge straight through them! We'll be fine!
Why can't we do the same? We just can't<eos> You're over reacting, Miss Fong<eos> We need students to keep the school going<eos> I'm putting you in charge<eos> Please keep an eye on them
Cat puts this on her buttocks too!<eos> I don't!<eos> Try it!<eos> Why were you with those boys today?<eos> Miss Fong asked me to keep an eye on them
While vigor, and not only vigor, is up<eos> And the mood is right.<eos> Listen, I have no time to behave like a stupid romantic.<eos> I could offer you a date and take you to an expensive restaurant present you gifts on every occasion<eos> meet your parents, make an impression of an intelligent boy on them and some time later, when they go away on a trip, you'll invite me home to fuck like normal people.
We're looking for the prince.<eos> If we don't find him, the kingdom will be lost.<eos> And can I remind you of something?<eos> We're being chased by the bad guys.<eos> Correction- surrounded by them.
If there are any more attacks, we shall put our guests... to death and raze this entire land.<eos> Take the horses.<eos> - When would you strike?<eos> - At once.<eos> - Throw everything we have at them.
When the heck did we get old?<eos> Hell, I've always been old, Ben.<eos> You know what, though?<eos> I don't mind. I mean, if my muscles ache, it's 'cause I've used them.<eos> If it's hard for me to walk up them steps now, it's 'cause I walked up them every night to lay next to a man who loved me.
We put up a flag.<eos> The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.<eos> We had our picture taken doing it.<eos> The real heroes are dead on that island.<eos> We'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them. Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Weyland?<eos> Thomas Beckett was the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury in the early 12th century, sir.<eos> In 1170, he was murdered in front of at the high altar at his cathedral.<eos> Exactly.<eos> He knew that the knights were coming to slay him, but he chose to wait for them unto the sight of God.
She was only eight when she wrote this part.<eos> Apparently, her mother was an Itako.<eos> Itako? What is that?<eos> It's a kind of channeler.<eos> People believe they can talk with deceased loved ones through them. But...
Our destiny calls to us.<eos> I'm very sorry, Mother, but I cannot go.<eos> I believe there is a reason for me to stay.<eos> Ariel, be warned.<eos> If you choose to stay, your fate will be inexorably tied to the humans and the Shadows that will soon fall upon them.
I like your smile. - Thanks.<eos> You didn't tell me what you do.<eos> I work hard.<eos> I help people.<eos> I bump into them, pick up their bags and drop them to their vehicles.
He went nuts, is what happened.<eos> He attacked the psycho and went crazy.<eos> - He dreams. People walk. Sleeping people.<eos> - He dreams them.<eos> - Dreams through them.
I looked everywhere. All the places we used to hang out as kids. She was nowhere.<eos> Just that one glimpse, and that was it.<eos> - Can these be engraved?<eos> - What?<eos> These soaps-- can I have them monogrammed?
- Nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Men suck.<eos> - They do suck.<eos> You can't count on them.
Yes.<eos> I'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.<eos> When my parents first heard I was gay, they kicked me out.<eos> They said I'd debased the entire family and that they couldn't love me anymore until I changed.<eos> But Andrew, he said that I should be ashamed of them because they were too stupid to know how great I was.
Kurt? I have a duty, Tony.<eos> Please don't try and stop me.<eos> - The seed's been treated. - Treated with what?<eos> Transmissible between humans.<eos> Look at them.
Bye.<eos> - You're back!<eos> - Ohh! God, Babette, you scared me. Yeah, it's my voice.<eos> It frightens the hell out of people. I don't know what to do about it.<eos> Well, you could start by not hiding in people's houses and leaping at them when they come home.
Well, you were crowding the plate.<eos> I blame myself for not telling you to back off, but um...<eos> I took it out on your coach.<eos> I told him to meet me in the parking lot.<eos> - My point is that... when you care about people, and feel responsible for them, it can blind your good sense.
Does he like it?<eos> Yeah, he likes that he's good at it.<eos> You ever go to a great doctor?<eos> Those guys are the same way.<eos> You depend on them to save your life.
So they could go out there and have some torrid, unabashed, monkey sex.<eos> As much as they could.<eos> You know, sounds pretty good, right?<eos> That sounds great. Yeah, Dwight?<eos> I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Adam and nate, jonathan and yul holding strong with 30 pounds each.<eos> At 15 pounds got brad and cristina, candice and sundra.<eos> With ten pounds each ozzy,jessica and rebeca, stephannie.<eos> they're struggling, you guys.<eos> they're struggling. Keep your eyes on them.
And between them, they owned half our territory there.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - You're a genius.<eos> Sir, the governors of Gaul and Spain are rebelling against you.<eos> They've written to all the senators, claiming to have 100,000 men behind them.
Have you considered, even for a moment, that you could be wrong? That you misinterpreted what you saw? That you are ruining my brother's life and mine over nothing?<eos> I have kids, OK?<eos> Better safe than sorry.<eos> As long as you're safe, what do you care who's sorry?<eos> So I'm cooking dinner for Ian's parents tomorrow night, and it's the first time I'm meeting them, - so I sort of want to impress them.
It's all in my meticulous hand<eos> Mam and I were very young when the war suddenly ended and this new statute terrified us<eos> Terrified you?<eos> we tried to imagine what kind ofworld were these slaves let out into were they ready for it?<eos> Or more correctly, was it ready for them?
Look, I think these people might be able to help us.<eos> Possibly, but it won't be a quick,<eos> "hullo-how's-your-father" job with those giants, no.<eos> They aren't succinct, like me. No.<eos> You've got to come in low, share an observation about life, a bit of banter about erosion or grit, open them up a bit, and then you're in.
Now, after finding Callo and Lei dead today doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure that Curtis is eliminating his accomplices one by one.<eos> Doesn't matter what he told Galt and Harrington. He's planning on finishing them off tonight.<eos> Never think of the repercussions.<eos> Suspect's mother, father, brother.<eos> How your decision affects them.

You never gave a shit before. - You never gave a shit!<eos> - Okay, hard-ass, what's your plan, huh?<eos> You're in charge now!<eos> - Tell me what we're doing.<eos> - Catch up with these soldiers! Hook up with whoever else isn't dead, and we get back at them.
- There, in full view?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yeah, they don't give a shit.<eos> The guards come out.<eos> We're waiting for them.
Oh, man!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> It's a friggin' den.<eos> One of the things I've heard about Mr. Treadwell, and you can see in a lot of his films, is that he tended to want to become a bear.<eos> Some people that I've spoken with would encounter him in the field, and he would act like a bear, he would "woof" at them.
I'm not sure who the father of my baby is.<eos> I know it's one of three guys, but I'm just not sure which one.<eos> God, I forget what it's like to be a normal teenager, you know?<eos> All my friends ditched me.<eos> Their parents say I'm a bad influence on them which is so lame because they're all having sex too.
- Don't let him out of your sight.<eos> I'll send Bugs down with a couple boys.<eos> Come on, fellas. Let's wipe up the floor with these kids!<eos> The kids play a swell game.<eos> Keep a good eye on them.
Robert Smith.<eos> Let me check his profile.<eos> None of these guys seem like they would have a problem getting a date on their own.<eos> We do have a screening process.<eos> After all, we are vouching for them.
Do you mind ?<eos> I'm sorry. I meant that metaphorically.<eos> Well, I'm speaking to a guy, OK, and he means metaphysically.<eos> Yeah, see, that's the thing.<eos> Men just keep using their little heads to do all the thinking for them.
Oh, god.<eos> I told them this was gonna happen.<eos> Told who?<eos> Those fraternity boys?<eos> I know you don't want to tell on them, I do, but this is serious.
Where'd you find it?<eos> On a mummified hand in a safety deposit box, I'm afraid.<eos> Sounds like scavengers.<eos> Grave-robbers.<eos> I've had more sites ruined by them than I care to remember.
All I'm sure of is... I don't know.<eos> Guys at Abu Ghraib got court martialed.<eos> Not for nothing nobody else did.<eos> If he wanted to get his ass in the sling, that's his business.<eos> Somebody would have to write them up anyways.

Hmm. Well, the keys are here.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> Come on.<eos> Get outta here, you guys.<eos> Look at them.
We are the same.<eos> We're not the same.<eos> You kill innocent people.<eos> Innocent?<eos> Is that what you call them?
What do we do?<eos> Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.
This is nuts!<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> How could this be kidnapping?<eos> Well, the parents are pretty P.O'-ed.<eos> It's hard to blame them.
Well, I choose not to believe in supernatural nonsense.<eos> Do you not see what's behind us?<eos> - Drop them!<eos> - Si.<eos> Drop them!
- Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - Why are you here? - I want to learn how to write.<eos> - I don't teach people how to write.<eos> - What about your students?<eos> I teach them what not to write.
Because of the tombs proximity to the Thames half the space is flooded, is that right doctor?<eos> There are even more coffins submerged under water.<eos> The tomb appears to have been built during the second Crusade which means it's filled with the bodies of crusader knights who invaded Egypt before returning to England.<eos> It has also revealed a treasure trove of secrets about London's history.<eos> Clear them out, please.
But that doesn't matter now.<eos> They are good kids and they took a wrong turn.<eos> And we're gonna get them back on track and they're gonna move on with their lives.<eos> Can we go home now?<eos> We need to hear them out.
Please, man!<eos> I didn't mean to do... Hey...<eos> - Hey, man, don't do it, man. - Don't do it.<eos> Saddam Hussein had these two fucked-up evil sons, mass murderers.<eos> During the Iraq War, Strickland killed them.
And if the others return first?<eos> It is our duty to try.<eos> They're so many.<eos> We can make a diversion.<eos> Draw them away.
Look at that.<eos> The way they tell it, for thousands of years, the people on this island lived in fear.<eos> That's a hell of a long time to be scared.<eos> And then, one day, the damnedest thing happened.<eos> Some of the things they were afraid of started protecting them against the things that were eating them.
You don't know that.<eos> You'd be surprised how long people wait.<eos> Ah, truth is, I don't expect them to be waiting.<eos> I'd be fine either way.<eos> I just want one last chance to see them.
Your parents aren't going to take us anywhere.<eos> You're right. They think we hate each other.<eos> Hate is a strong word.<eos> It's the right word, but still.<eos> We have to convince them that we're actual brothers.
Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie.<eos> Police.<eos> That reminds me of that call I have to make.<eos> Police.<eos> You want them to come in here?
Guards! Get them!<eos> Freeze, Batman!<eos> Hey, kid. This is a training exercise.<eos> These guys are my bros.<eos> - Go ahead and take a couple of them out.
Go on, Scuttler.<eos> Go. - Batman, no. No!<eos> - Don't do this! Abandoned?<eos> No.<eos> No, I was trying to protect them.
It's called da jue zhan.<eos> A grand duel.<eos> The Hand's version of a challenge.<eos> Their best fighters against me.<eos> If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.
Professor Chen. You successfully found the Magadha treasures en route to the Tang Dynasty.<eos> Another feat for archaeology of China and the whole world!<eos> To unearth cultural relics and treasures is our job.<eos> Did you catch those raiders?<eos> Our police intercepted and arrested them on the highway.
What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed.<eos> Only if we do it alone.<eos> No.<eos> Look, these people took everything from me.<eos> I'm gonna take them down, one way or another.
The Black Sky has always been your prophecy, your vision.<eos> - And you have failed.<eos> - I don't agree.<eos> She is essential to our success.<eos> You must talk to them.
I'm not the god of war, Diana.<eos> I am the God of truth.<eos> Mankind... Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.<eos> And I, the only one wise enough to see it... was left too weak to stop them.
I am the God of truth.<eos> Mankind... Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.<eos> And I, the only one wise enough to see it... was left too weak to stop them.<eos> All these years I have struggled alone... whispering into their ears. Ideas, inspiration for formulas... weapons... but I don't make them use them.
Oh, you're so sexy when you're quoting Scriptures, boy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But the fellas... they ain't comfortable with making this record.<eos> Well, you a natural born boss.<eos> It's your job to make them comfortable.
The soldiers are coming. Hurry up!<eos> Come on, chop chop, let's go!<eos> Men, regroup!<eos> Tide's about to turn, James.<eos> Go and get them, put them on the ship now.
I thought she would live a Cinderella life.<eos> Have you read "Grimm's Fairy Tales?"<eos> The irony hasn't been wasted on me.<eos> Apparently, Alex had some issues.<eos> And when she was still young enough to forget them her parents left her at an orphanage.
But, that's just me.<eos> Then, why did you give me the job?<eos> I think I'm just drawn to helping less fortunate, damaged, sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.<eos> Why do you think I have so many cats?<eos> They need me, but I need them.
Or not.<eos> Nope, not easy at all.<eos> Attention, all passengers, the train will be arriving in 12 minutes.<eos> Me?<eos> You want me to stop them?
Stop thinking you're so special!<eos> What?<eos> Did I hurt your feelings?<eos> - Only the people you love can make you angry.<eos> So angry, you want to strangle them.
I tried to see what was inside.<eos> But you wouldn't allow it.<eos> Then you came at us, sword drawn.<eos> Ten men, you killed.<eos> Cut them down like they were nothing.
I've seen enough!<eos> Release him!<eos> No.<eos> Your men were right about me.<eos> I killed them.
I'm not leaving this to chance.<eos> They can see her.<eos> Grab her!<eos> Liar!<eos> Keep them back.
To your father.<eos> All her waking hours.<eos> She said no to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You can't just enjoy people when it suits you, use them up and toss them aside.
The Wizard sent her to kill me.<eos> Take her life and your heart will be free.<eos> Stop Glinda.<eos> But you have your giants.<eos> Use them.
The guns are ours.<eos> The people of Ev, they know I've been generous.<eos> And now the Queen will know how grateful I am.<eos> Perhaps this payment will help the girl come to her senses.<eos> Let them in.
Stop.<eos> I prepared these men to follow Long John Silver upon his return.<eos> Now, if you assume that in his absence, that role now reverts to you... then you assume wrong.<eos> See, my men know your name, but you weren't the one who recruited them into this.<eos> You weren't the one who led them in those midnight raids in the Western plantations.
They've wiped it clean.<eos> So much for the heat of anger.<eos> Like I said I do not know these people.<eos> Well, that's a shame.<eos> Cos I'd like to think you'd have helped me try and get them.
- Two kids.<eos> Caught them breaking into 294.<eos> Breaking in?<eos> Well, that's new.<eos> You want me to take them down to the Sheriff's Office?
The new gods.<eos> That's why we need you.<eos> That's why we need spring to fight them, to show them who we are.<eos> Oh, they will worship you.<eos> They will... worship you if you make them pray.
Like, you're awake but you're still dreaming.<eos> You want to wake up and get out of there, but you can't.<eos> To a certain extent, we all have these... so-called waking dreams.<eos> In my waking dreams I'm chasing people.<eos> I'm killing them.
It's a total cliché.<eos> I wasn't gonna take it there. Well, you didn't have to.<eos> Believe me.<eos> We hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents.<eos> When they died, I couldn't bear to let them go.
You should publish this.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No way. This does not leave the safe space.<eos> People need to see this.<eos> It will change them.
I mean, they get along fine.<eos> I don't know. It seems like they're bored or something.<eos> Like the only thing they even have in common anymore is me.<eos> Parents always think we don't pick up on that stuff.<eos> Not only do they not see me, they don't see me seeing them.
All right. Sasha, Jesus, can you get back to the Hilltop on foot?<eos> Yeah. Tell Maggie we're not giving up.<eos> Go! Here.<eos> We need every stick, every RPG.<eos> They're gonna cut them off.
What?<eos> We're gonna fight The Saviors.<eos> You should join us.<eos> No. The Saviors killed your fathers, your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.<eos> I thought we got rid of them.
Negan's coming soon.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Three trucks probably.<eos> 20 Saviors and him.<eos> I can slow them down, bring some trees down in the road, buy a little time for you guys to get ready.
Yeah, well, like it matters.<eos> They barely tip me.<eos> - Talk to them.<eos> - I do.<eos> Listen to them.
I see.<eos> Woah. You really are, you're just so pissed off at everybody, aren't you?<eos> I gave my life to that job, I want to know why I lost it!<eos> Munk will have discussed it on email with his superiors.<eos> If they have acted improperly, I can force them to re-instate me.
We count three sets of boot prints on the approach. We got a stolen crotch rocket in the trees. Plus some kind of homemade ramp we think caused the upend.<eos> You saw the vehicle on the way in?<eos> The yellow deal flipped on its top?<eos> Couple of bystanders probably slowed to do the Christian thing, then recognized the debacle for what it was.<eos> Second vehicle, panel van maybe, chases them for 2 miles, runs them off the road, finishes the couple execution style.
My brother?<eos> No. Mr. Varga.<eos> No.<eos> No. See if you can find out what happened to the old pictures.<eos> Make sure they don't throw them out.
Not shy, bored.<eos> I'm afraid I lose interest in most people fairly quickly.<eos> Hi, can I have water, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> I begin to tune them out and then the conversation falls apart.
He's been expecting you.<eos> He's at the river.<eos> Suau, go with the Lieutenant.<eos> We have two great enemies: lice and pornography.<eos> Plagues of war, as Napoleon called them.
Really, what can you do with asses like that?<eos> I wish you had given me a chance to talk you out of it.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I knew your arguments already, Saul.<eos> I didn't need to hear them again.
Well, why are you doing that?<eos> This... signing your god.<eos> We were asking his protection, Lord, from the horsemen.<eos> If they're not men, what are they?<eos> Please, to speak of them may summon them.
- You do.<eos> - Why? - Because there has to be a reason.<eos> - Why? Everything in my life I've done for a reason.<eos> - Why? - To help people.<eos> To... to guide them. To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.
It's the seventh anniversary of the departure, and there is reasonable expectation out there that the world's gonna end.<eos> So, we're gonna fire our nukes at the Russians and they're gonna retaliate, and then that's it. We're all torched.<eos> No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed that nothing fucking happened.<eos> We give the people what they're too chickenshit to do themselves, what they elected us for.<eos> We give them what they want.
I let them go just like I always do.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is that they didn't come back. Did you give them the seed that I gave you?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And... And you didn't feed them right before you let them go, did you?
You think I'll commit men and sail with you?<eos> To fight an insurgency on your territory, force my men to decipher friend from enemy, amongst that sort of confusion?<eos> My friends are all besieged within Fort Nassau.<eos> My wife is there.<eos> I'd beg you to spare them, avoid the fort entirely.
And what about the example you're setting right now?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Isaac, these men... - They respect you.<eos> - Yeah. They revere you.<eos> But you're losing them.
Isaac, these men... - They respect you.<eos> - Yeah. They revere you.<eos> But you're losing them.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> You'll end up making them do something they'd never think of doing.
And put out a full interagency alert on Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> They killed my men.<eos> And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.
They killed my men.<eos> And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!
And they almost killed me and my wife.<eos> We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them. For you.
They're at the gate.<eos> Yeah, I'm not seeing their clearances on the network.<eos> Hey, we had a power loss on one of those servers.<eos> That's what they're here to fix.<eos> You want me to let them through, I'll need your override.
Hey, we had a power loss on one of those servers.<eos> That's what they're here to fix.<eos> You want me to let them through, I'll need your override.<eos> It's Apple, Charlie, seven, seven, nine.<eos> Escort them to engineering. - They'll take it from there.
Sir, I thought this was a good plan.<eos> You thought it was a good plan to help her turn herself over to these monsters?<eos> No, I...<eos> Listen, that, that wasn't supposed to happen.<eos> She was gonna get them to release you, and then draw Naseri out so that I could take him down.
Carter, there's a van driving up to the house.<eos> Four targets.<eos> They're armed.<eos> Get down.<eos> I see them.
Recite her crimes, then execute her while the world watches.<eos> - You should've stopped her.<eos> - I thought this was a good plan.<eos> You thought it was a good plan to help her turn herself over to these monsters?<eos> She was gonna get them to release you, and then draw Naseri out so that I could take him down.
About what?<eos> He said he wants to make a deal.<eos> Follow me, please, Captain.<eos> Those men at that table are among the wealthiest in the Pennsylvania Colony and critical suppliers to my husband's business.<eos> They consider character to be of paramount importance in choosing their partners, and so my husband has gone to great lengths to assure them that our family's sordid beginnings are long since behind us, and you just stood in front of them
- Weapons... were found inside the house... a soldier who was dead before the fire consumed him.<eos> I'm asking if she died fighting.<eos> What is that?<eos> Terms.<eos> When this is through, you'll present this to your people and advocate to accept them.
Chances are good you've seen the last of him.<eos> You killed a friend of mine.<eos> Her name was Charlotte... and you did it for reasons that had nothing to do with her.<eos> There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.<eos> I wanted to ask them.
What?<eos> They got tickets... for littering.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yep.<eos> Then Dean Peterson suspended them for three days.
Where?<eos> When you got shot.<eos> I wish I was there.<eos> Maybe I could've... protected you.<eos> You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
Obviously all I have is Maggie's letters to Mom, not the ones Mom sent.<eos> Seems like mostly she's trying to get Maggie to come back and patch things up with Audrey.<eos> It's pretty fucking sad, if you ask me. Whatever.<eos> I still wanna read.<eos> Just do us both a favor. Make sure Audrey doesn't see them.
"No way."<eos> But he turns off the road, gets out, and he leads me into some weeds, all right?<eos> Now, these weeds are taller than the both of us in some spots, right?<eos> So we're working our way through the weeds, and out of nowhere, it opens up, and there we are in this little clearing.<eos> And that's when I see them.
It's fraud.'<eos> 'Look, don't come back here.'<eos> Rohan.<eos> I hate to hear these people.<eos> Why are you listening to them?
Because she had to.<eos> You brought flowers?<eos> Is that why you wanted to see me?<eos> To welcome me home with flowers?<eos> I couldn't give them to you in the hospital.
That's a big question.<eos> Yeah, but you guys are so perfect together.<eos> You're gonna be one of those high school couples that gets married after college, and they have kids, and it's so cute.<eos> I'm sure his parents must love the thought of you as a daughter-in-law.<eos> Actually, I haven't met them yet.
So why am I hearing about secret conclaves, sigils scribbled on the walls?<eos> Sounds like someone's stirring up trouble.<eos> Marcel, these out-of-town vampires got you a little bit paranoid, man.<eos> All right, look, I'm asking you, especially this week, handle your community.<eos> Keep them in the cauldron.
We can still pick up a few things first, right?<eos> Sir, that's everyone we could find.<eos> Stationed 10 guards at the temple door.<eos> Are you sure you don't want me to stay?<eos> You lead them home, Major.
- Well?<eos> - You're not gonna like it.<eos> When you destroyed the City of Light, there were a thousand Azgeda warriors inside the city of Polis.<eos> Good timing.<eos> Only way to remove them is by force.
We should be leaving with the others while we still have time.<eos> They know where we live.<eos> If we run, they'll follow.<eos> There are 8 other clans.<eos> How do we get them to join us?
Take it.<eos> The clans will follow you.<eos> That's what you want.<eos> I want what's best for my people, same as you.<eos> Then help me save them.
Anorexia.<eos> That's when Dad started drinking.<eos> It's the same with Davy's parents.<eos> You... lose a child, you never really come back from it.<eos> So on Tuesday, you took them to their son's memorial on the cliff.
- Er, just after lunch.<eos> - Did you stay with them?<eos> - No, I had to get back to the Visitor Centre.<eos> Then I was stuck there till we closed at five.<eos> - Did you see them in the evening at all?
Accessed at 5:57.<eos> It's an emergency contact form.<eos> Davy Andersen.<eos> She's gone to see his parents.<eos> We need to call the Andersens, warn them.
Or have you forgotten about that already?<eos> You're the one who told me not to burn it all down at once.<eos> Who knows what might rise from the ashes?<eos> These people, they don't know how to live free.<eos> We have to teach them.
Reaper One-One. Roger that.<eos> Request containment fire.<eos> Shots away.<eos> Squirters are static at this time.<eos> Got them.
Of course he loved you.<eos> How could he not?<eos> But he also wanted you to open that door in the prison for him.<eos> I mean, true game theory, everything, everyone is a contingency.<eos> You meet people, you bring them into your life and you keep them percolating until the moment you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.
Those detectives are here.<eos> Could these drugs hurt the baby?<eos> No.<eos> They have you on Dilaudid because it's safe for pregnancy.<eos> Send them in.
What did he, uh... What did he ask you to do?<eos> Uh, he said he was looking to find the contact information for the people who were stalking his wife.<eos> So I did a data dive and gave him what I could find.<eos> How?<eos> They hacked your phone and lifted the data, but in the process, left a very slight electronic signature that I was able to track back to them.
Police went to shit when they sold out contracts to a private company.<eos> Crime's down since we went private.<eos> That's 'cause people are afraid.<eos> Good.<eos> Fear keeps them in line.
We don't have much time.<eos> You did it.<eos> Yay for me.<eos> All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?<eos> I got them.
- Because I haven't.<eos> - Luke.<eos> What happened at the Citadel?<eos> Valentine's men infiltrated.<eos> We tried to fight them off. They...
You shouldn't be here.<eos> How else was I supposed to find out the truth?<eos> You killed all those people.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> You killed them.
Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.<eos> Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> We have them all in custody.
Now you must make one more choice.<eos> Save pills or save hostages.<eos> Spartan, Wild Dog, get the hostages.<eos> I'll handle the Bratva.<eos> Kill them.
Actually, fun fact, the previous lair used to be underneath a nightclub.<eos> - Curtis. - Right. Sorry.<eos> And you said Felicity's down there, too?<eos> According to the last position logged by her tracking nanites.<eos> What do we need to get them out?
Let's hope so, old friend.<eos> Now, gentlemen, we have less than 48 hours to save Salem.<eos> With respect, Mary.<eos> It's the people that matter... not the town.<eos> So why not lead them out of here?
Cheer.<eos> Brave men, all of you.<eos> Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe.<eos> Cut the throat of a mother of five.<eos> Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.
We have to go.<eos> Now. We gotta run!<eos> Run!<eos> I've never had a runaway before.<eos> If my paddy rollers haven't retrieved them by nightfall, consider yourself hired.
The mother who dreams of strangling her child.<eos> The husband who wants to stab his wife.<eos> All they want is someone to tell them...<eos> "Do it.<eos> Kill them.
The answer is an individual.<eos> Duh!<eos> I expected more. But then, none of the others did very well either.<eos> - The others?<eos> - Oh, you'd know them.
Until now.<eos> Why now?<eos> Because now you've been asked to join the Court.<eos> Now I'm not alone.<eos> Now... you can help me destroy them from within.
Ah...<eos> Please. Don't let me fall.<eos> We can discuss this in a civilized manner!<eos> Oh, that's rich, coming from the likes of you.<eos> Who's about to poison thousands of people and turn them into raving lunatics!
I know that we will face it together.<eos> Gypsy just vibed me her location.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I don't think the literary critics on our Earth would know a real sci-fi romance best seller<eos> - unless it bit them in the...
Actually, I asked for the job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Through my connections.<eos> Anyway, our boss gave Stefan new orders.<eos> And now, we're supposed to push people to make evil choices, and only then do we kill them and send their souls to the devil.
Hmm.<eos> Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... that you're using dark magic.<eos> Did he?<eos> I've studied angels all my... very long life.<eos> I use their magic to fight, to hear them, to stay alive.
She say anything about her boys?<eos> As I've said many, many, so many times, we don't need them.<eos> We already have the best Winchester.<eos> Yes. But that's not your call, is it? Or mine.<eos> The old men want them on board.
Wait, what?<eos> Seriously?<eos> How?<eos> You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues. One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.<eos> We treat them more like terrorists.
Um, no.<eos> That's not why we come out here.<eos> We come out here to commune with nature, not watch people get eaten by it.<eos> Okay, first of all he -- he doesn't eat them.<eos> He chases them up a tree, and they cry.
It's over.<eos> The grand experiment recruiting American hunters has failed.<eos> Utterly.<eos> What would you like me to do?<eos> Exterminate them.
Alicia?<eos> What are you two doing here? Mom!<eos> Sam and Dean Winchester, meet the great Tasha banes.<eos> The kids have told me very nice things.<eos> Alicia basically made them come just in case you were in peril.
Who do we talk to first?<eos> For the tape, I am showing Mr. Lucas exhibit AH141.<eos> Why have you got a set of Trish Winterman's house keys?<eos> She left them in the taxi.<eos> But you didn't think to give them back to her?
But you didn't think to give them back to her?<eos> I didn't get round to it.<eos> Like you didn't get round to giving back the others you had locked in your garage drawer.<eos> I didn't know where they lived.<eos> You drove most of them home!
It's an ingenious design of which I can take no credit.<eos> Carpentry was a hobby of my late husband's.<eos> If the cargo is staying for more than a night or two, I try to familiarize them with everything so that they feel comfortable moving through the common spaces.<eos> After all, they didn't brave the dangers of the journey north to be imprisoned in an attic.<eos> You're not worried about your boarders seeing them and giving you up to the authorities?
How are you?<eos> Clara told me soccer practice went well.<eos> So you'll probably be starting this weekend.<eos> I met some new people today at work.<eos> Complete weirdoes, which means you'll probably like them.
And I want you to know that if you hate me for making this tape without you knowing, I hate myself more.<eos> But you have to, have to believe me on my mother's life that this is the only tape.<eos> There are no copies.<eos> And now that I've had time to think about it, I decided that the right thing to do is to give you and not them this tape.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.
Now they kill me too.<eos> Found out about what?<eos> That I was trying to defect to CIA.<eos> Two CIA officers were killed.<eos> - Langley says you set them up.
I talked to one of your Scouts.<eos> I know you fired the gun. Which makes you both a liar, and a public menace.<eos> So what if I did?<eos> I was doing the Adventure Scouts a favor.<eos> Somebody has to teach them how to stand their ground. The way this town is going...
And I didn't give her a Sticky Maple.<eos> That is all you had to say, you ass.<eos> You like shaming people, Chuck?<eos> - Whoa, hey...<eos> - You like dehumanizing them?
Our lives are in your hands.<eos> Torr thee sah-myrr o'Farrells?<eos> We will follow your customs, yes.<eos> Fetch water for our guests.<eos> Let's let them be.
- after mother died.<eos> It was all too much.<eos> - Are you still taking the meds?<eos> - no, no, I... Haven't for a while now, actually.<eos> I really don't think that I need them.
If you can't be bothered to recycle, I will.<eos> I buy half my groceries with your empty beer bottles.<eos> Street hockey kids asked me to play goalie.<eos> They think I'm weird.<eos> You scare them.
I buy half my groceries with your empty beer bottles.<eos> Street hockey kids asked me to play goalie.<eos> They think I'm weird.<eos> You scare them.<eos> I've heard them talking.
He)/--' _ Hey---<eos> Your coffee's turned into cold coffee.<eos> Where are you?<eos> The coffee shop.<eos> And I'm done pulling my hair and using them as noodles in my coffee...
Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.<eos> And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders and Northern fools than meets the eye.<eos> Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.<eos> Instead, she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates, some of whom are on this island with us right now.<eos> While you're our guest here, you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.
Not burn him alive alongside his son?<eos> I am her Hand, not her head.<eos> I can't make her decisions for her.<eos> That's what I used to tell myself about her father.<eos> I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.
And I'm gonna track it with the manufacturer, see if I can identify a point of sale.<eos> But I need it dusted. Where'd this little cutie come from?<eos> Hey, you know what, don't even tell me.<eos> I promise, it won't come back to bite you in the ass.<eos> If there are any prints, you won't be able to use them.
You know, it's typical addict bullshit.<eos> Like going over there was gonna solve anything.<eos> Guys from his old unit?<eos> I don't know, I guess.<eos> You know, I didn't know them.
Where is she now?<eos> With him.<eos> She was playing you.<eos> You dragged people into that basement, human beings.<eos> You tied them up and you...
You tied them up and you...<eos> All I did was pick 'em up, that's it.<eos> How did he know where to find them? Who they were?<eos> He just knew.<eos> Had a bunch of names and sent me out to get them.
Thanks so much for coming over so quick.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> I was just saying to Mr. Claybourne that most of these people are actually harmless.<eos> If we handle them right and we have some patience, we can get him to go away.
I can't undo it.<eos> I think you might have made up for it now.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think I'm doomed to make the same mistakes.<eos> Never able to see them before they happen.
Older than him, though.<eos> What about their drones?<eos> Well, the top of the Wall's a dead spot.<eos> They launch from up there, but their sensors aren't activated immediately.<eos> You might see them, but they won't see you.
I was... bringing my kids to see their grandparents.<eos> - How are the kids?<eos> - They're fine.<eos> God, I miss them.<eos> Can you send them my love?
If she's telling America to unite and support the Republican ticket... and her husband... that will send a signal to the Democrats to get on board.<eos> Plus, you're glamorous, attractive, in love...<eos> The perfect couple. That's political money.<eos> That's a political lie.<eos> People like to see you two together. It makes them happy.
He goes dark sometimes.<eos> Falls off the wagon and then back on and then off.<eos> No, Abby, this isn't... This... t-this isn't that.<eos> There are people.<eos> - Don't recognize them.
They called it the phoney war.<eos> A war where nothing happened.<eos> But now, across this green and pleasant land, young men are preparing to see just how real war can be.<eos> I'd call them brave, but only time will tell how true that is.
No, you didn't. But it's who you are now.<eos> You took those kids under your wing.<eos> You put them on the run. Now you have to lead.<eos> - They're not ready.<eos> - So get them ready.
They're counting down to our extinction.<eos> Will, I made a promise to you that I was done with the resistance.<eos> I can't keep sitting on the sidelines, not with this hanging over our heads.<eos> You don't know what we're doing to those people...<eos> The resources we're throwing into finding them.
No, no, give him the good stuff!<eos> See?<eos> The thing that Martin knew that they didn't was, that in a bar fight, the man with nothing to lose, was the man to bet on.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> And if your men try to stop me, I'll fucking kill them too.
That was Molly's bed, was it? Bed Ten?<eos> Measles, we were in for.<eos> When Molly started to get sick, I... I rang on the bell.<eos> It rang and it rang, but nobody came.<eos> By the time I got them back onto the ward, it was too late for Molly.
So how do you we do this?<eos> Blame the north precinct attack on bonaparte.<eos> How does that work?<eos> Corrupt cops under bonaparte's control got greedy.<eos> They went after him. He went after them.
There's unrest in the district.<eos> There's always unrest in the district.<eos> Since the fencing of common land... taking back a meeting house... shutting down a mine while still in profit.<eos> Only my influence has prevented a repetition of the attack which occurred on your house last year.<eos> If Drake Carne hangs, the people will rise up and I will be powerless to stop them.
One sec.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey, sweetie. - How you doing? Mama's home shh.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> Those men back there... How'd you get them to stop? I told 'em to.
They were black.<eos> One of them had a red hoodie.<eos> Then I saw two black guys running away.<eos> - They went into the trees.<eos> - Can you describe them?
Stay away from the church!<eos> You don't believe their story.<eos> They haven't been eliminated as suspects.<eos> Still waiting on the DNA results.<eos> At which point, you'll release them.
At which point, you'll release them.<eos> No. Hey.<eos> Look, Father, even if the boys didn't kill Zoey, and that is a big "if," that means the killer's still out there.<eos> And if the killer thinks we're hanging it on those boys, maybe he'll let his guard down.<eos> You can't hold them for a murder they didn't commit.
No. We won't, ok, but Harper's right.<eos> We try diplomacy first.<eos> If that doesn't work, we come back with reinforcements for the slaves after we take home the machine, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're moving them.
We'll thrive.<eos> Nice speech.<eos> Sometimes hope is more important than truth.<eos> Your dad would be so proud.<eos> You wanted workers. You got them.
Who are you, by the way?<eos> I've come unarmed.<eos> Just like Jesus into the temple.<eos> Trudy prayed with these people, Bernard.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.
So?<eos> You know dr. Latham.<eos> He's a robot.<eos> Creeps people out.<eos> He'll just make them feel worse.
What's going through their heads, how this job is affecting them.<eos> I worry about these people, Daniel.<eos> I worry about them.<eos> I know you do. I know you do.<eos> I wish I could protect them.
Yeah, as always.<eos> I just want you to understand that I only wanted... To prevent this very thing. I know.<eos> You're trying to protect...<eos> To protect you.<eos> We'll find them.
The sick son of a bitch who kidnapped my people and seems to have more than a few skeletons in his closet?<eos> Do you not recognize these men?<eos> Should I?<eos> Yes, you should.<eos> Because you had them killed.
Everything is his S.H.I.E.L.D. The government, behind you, director, behind Nick fury, stark, all of it, stands agent coulson, quietly pursuing his alien agenda.<eos> Conspiracy theories...<eos> From the man who literally mounted a conspiracy to have men in masks kill inhumans.<eos> I'm closing the door he opened...<eos> Allowing alien races to infect our world and convincing men like you to protect them.
They could be anywhere on the planet.<eos> Which is why we have to go in.<eos> - You mean... go in?<eos> Hack in... - Hack in.<eos> Plug ourselves into the Framework so we can find our people, and we can wake them up and figure out where their bodies are being kept.
Really, what's our other option?<eos> Shoot to maim ... stomach, spine.<eos> It's imperative we pull the data from their heads.<eos> Don't let their faces cloud your judgment.<eos> The best way to ensure that we can save them is to find these machines pretending to be them and take them down.
We had a deal.<eos> You promised me if I stayed on the island, out of your way, you'd leave us alone.<eos> Drop the indignation, doctor.<eos> This island's no-fly zone was breached an hour ago.<eos> We both know you're harboring subversives. And I'll find them soon enough.
This is how movements die.<eos> Don't say that, sir.<eos> Well, if history's taught me anything, it's that good intentions don't translate into action without a steady hand to guide them.<eos> The patriot brought all these people together.<eos> His death might tear them apart.
From school.<eos> I just couldn't believe they were doing it, that it was actually happening.<eos> But it did happen.<eos> Didn't it?<eos> And who led them on?
I didn't just lose Tara.<eos> I lost a chance at being a father.<eos> And those associates have always been my children to me.<eos> My children.<eos> And the truth is, I've been neglecting them ever since they got here, but that ends this morning.
He said if I did as he asked he would leave me.<eos> But he didn't.<eos> And just what did the Devil say to you?<eos> He told me that I would be visited by two men.<eos> That I was to invite them in then cut their throats.
There's one of these in every town.<eos> This is what they do to people who fight back.<eos> It's the only thing I can do.<eos> The US government has people in Canada.<eos> They can help you find them, maybe even get them out.
Question is, what exactly is bothering you?<eos> Is it that he's doing this in the first place or just that he didn't talk to you about it?<eos> Both.<eos> We have an agreement with these people, DeAnn.<eos> And we put a lot of work in to get them out of his life and build a better narrative.
Thank you.<eos> - Please find who killed her.<eos> - We're doing all we can.<eos> They're devastated.<eos> I just hope we're doing the right thing by letting them go.
Sarge, I think I know that man.<eos> The other day on the Pembridge, he slammed his door on me.<eos> Sarge, do you know them?<eos> Clifford Bentley's lads.<eos> Yeah, I know them.
No, no, don't, no!<eos> Winn, you okay?<eos> - Jewel thieves?<eos> - Nabbed.<eos> I nabbed them.
That's why I told you to get my sister.<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter who's to blame.<eos> We just need to get back to Earth.<eos> Aliens brought those people to this planet, and we're gonna find out why and save them.
Well, that should get my former teammates' attention, and when they travel back in time to save him, I'll be there waiting for them with open arms.<eos> Well, not too open, I hope.<eos> No, have no fear, Mr. Thawne.<eos> I have no lingering attachment.<eos> In that case, kill them all, collect their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it to me.
I must give credit where credit is due.<eos> I have a new colonel who's most impressive.<eos> One might say he's ahead of his time.<eos> If you two are done yapping, I'd like my last meal.<eos> Take these men to my tent, and have them well fed.
- I have to protect him.<eos> - Alex, listen to me.<eos> I am not gonna let anything happen to Jeremiah. I promise.<eos> But you are putting all of your focus on him when you should be focusing on the aliens we are trying to find.<eos> And when we find them, you risk making a bad call, putting him in danger.
There's that famous Kryptonian exaggeration.<eos> Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.<eos> Because you stole them from their families.<eos> We liberated them from greater hardship.
No, I didn't.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Daxam is a wasteland.<eos> Our people are scattered across the universe.<eos> We need to bring them home.
No, he's right.<eos> Why bother trying to talk a guy down when Supergirl can just swoop right in and force him down?<eos> Seventeen hours of "What do you want, how can I help you?" good old-fashioned hostage negotiation wasted.<eos> You're not upset that I caught the bad guys and got everyone out safely, are you?<eos> I would have gotten them to free the hostages. Maybe.
Honestly, I'm hoping that with some direction and some motivation, they can just pick it up without my having to...<eos> Yeah, it would be nice if a pep talk did the trick.<eos> But analysts are too important. Their responsibilities are too built-in.<eos> You can't afford to be carrying someone who isn't pulling his or her weight.<eos> So, do them the long-term favor of ripping off the Band-Aid and getting them one step closer to where they're headed and what they should be doing.
We don't ask why.<eos> Is there anything you want to tell your parents?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like if you, like if you could talk to them. What would you say?<eos> Would you say you love them?
Would you say you love them?<eos> We're gonna give them something!<eos> We're gonna give them a message.<eos> Give it some thought.<eos> I'm not gonna let you torture them.
Once you're paid off?<eos> Why would you say something like that?<eos> Do you want me to leave?<eos> I don't know what I want.<eos> But I do know that people leave me when I like them.
It's draining the life out of these kids.<eos> They're freezing.<eos> Mom, I'm so cold.<eos> Vincent, what the hell is this?<eos> That witch, he used their personal items to bind them to the spell.
It is just as eternal as she is.<eos> And I'm telling you right now, if I tweak that spell in just the right way, I can lock her in the book and put the Hollow down for good.<eos> So where is it now?<eos> It's still with the acolytes.<eos> I used this page from the book to track them to the place where she was reborn.
And I'm telling you right now, if I tweak that spell in just the right way, I can lock her in the book and put the Hollow down for good.<eos> So where is it now?<eos> It's still with the acolytes.<eos> I used this page from the book to track them to the place where she was reborn.<eos> That's where you'll find them.
Freya informs me your mate Vincent has a plan.<eos> Just one tiny problem.<eos> I don't trust him. All right, Vincent helped me keep the peace for five years.<eos> He knows the Hollow's power, and he is our best shot at coming up with a plan.<eos> I have a plan of my own. We find this thing and its acolytes, we slaughter the lot of them.
He was a good man.<eos> He... he only did good things in this world.<eos> Gary was a father.<eos> He had two grown sons.<eos> I never met them, but I... I know he loved them.
The creature's head is almost a mile away.<eos> I assume we're now at the other end.<eos> These men..<eos> why do we trust them?<eos> - Hired them all myself, sir.
As were all the others.<eos> Where are they?<eos> In the house.<eos> What?<eos> Where? We haven't seen them.
We build networks, Fill them with eyes.<eos> We see where the germans are strong, where they're weak.<eos> Allied and resistance networks, A free flow of information. So we know where to land our blows.<eos> You understand my fellow comrades won't be. Easily convinced.<eos> Then convince them, alex.
- What do you mean, they don't exist?<eos> He's gone to a lot of trouble to cover his birth identity.<eos> A lot of trouble.<eos> - His real parents must be somewhere.<eos> - Well, let's find them, Kenny.
- Mm.<eos> But... who'll look after him?<eos> Who does... the funeral?<eos> Right. Guests at the party.<eos> Have we found them?
On my own head be it.<eos> Could you get here from the reception, kill that lad and then saunter back in ten minutes?<eos> I reckon it's possible, yeah.<eos> Might be tight, but it's possible.<eos> 'I know a lot of things about a lot of people... .. and I can make them pay.'
Guess you're real committed to your team, huh?<eos> All it took was a little rain to get your ass back in here.<eos> What the fuck happened to all the guards?<eos> Gloria been kicking their asses!<eos> She been sending them shitheads to the Poo all day.
It's what she does.<eos> Trust me.<eos> These past few days, we could've hung out together, playing house... taking advantage of the only moments of relative freedom that we're gonna have for years.<eos> But, instead, she had to go do something else.<eos> All I'm saying... is you can't tell people to go and then blame them for leaving.
And we have no idea where the attackers came from.<eos> Casualties from the Zone?<eos> Eight human dead, 10 subhuman.<eos> The Authority deleted their details from the system when they were arrested in preparation for...<eos> So the rest of them are loose somewhere in the city along with whatever the hell that thing was that attacked them.
How can you kick a kid in the face?<eos> You can if you think he's a monster.<eos> They're stronger, faster.<eos> Warriors who've survived hundreds of thousands of years.<eos> We call them subhuman, but biologically, they're better than us.
So bitches be calling all the shots around here?<eos> You want to redeem yourself with me, start by following orders.<eos> Orders like, "Hey, Harlee",<eos> "pool hall down on Bushwick is running small book and dice.<eos> Go down there and sign them up for protection."
Enough to cover for him?<eos> He has nothing to do with this!<eos> Harlee, did you lift my shell casing?<eos> My fingerprints are on it.<eos> That's why we don't touch them.
Not here.<eos> There's a press perimeter around the corner.<eos> Captain McManus will be around in a few minutes with an update.<eos> Any distinctive marks on their vehicle?<eos> Look, I didn't see them.
No crime scene tape.<eos> We made it here before the neighbors noticed the smell.<eos> Your respect for the dead is really something, you know that?<eos> I respect the dead by putting away the people that killed them.<eos> Why didn't Woz just call it in when he found them shot?
Are you so damaged, you had to hire the daughter of a dead woman to ease your conscience?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I think about Shiloh every minute of every day,<eos> Every time I work a case, I am back there, trying to fix it, trying to get her back.<eos> But, Freddie we got people walking around Manhattan with bombs in their bodies, and, broken as I am, I'm the only one who can save them.
Zara, tell Freddie Woods to send Larry Walker to me... right now.<eos> Open up.<eos> Evacuate all personnel.<eos> What is happening?<eos> Mr. Walker, in just under five minutes' time, bombs that have been planted by your daughter in the stomach of innocent people are going to explode, killing them and potentially many others.
Stop targeting. Over.<eos> Riley, respond.<eos> Negotiating with these people is a waste of time.<eos> We have the high ground. We have the guns.<eos> We should just take them out.
You might have to kill someone you know.<eos> The rendezvous is set.<eos> Your contacts are expecting you.<eos> We'll do you proud, sir.<eos> Sending them into the field?
No, no, no, no, no! Please don't!<eos> Thank you, franz.<eos> Sir, I did my duty. As a soldier, but as a person, as a human, I can't believe you refused to even try to save.<eos> Those agents. You know exactly what will happen to those boys.<eos> And I won't risk more men dying trying to save them.
Whatever it takes.<eos> "Whatever it takes."<eos> Sinclair just sent two men to their death,<eos> And still, "whatever it takes"?<eos> He sacrificed them to save us.
It was a town meeting.<eos> Wait a minute. What makes you think you're part of this town?<eos> Living out here, shitting in the woods. Talking in circles.<eos> Listen to me. I know these people.<eos> I serve them, I love them.
Now, if you're keeping something from me that could stop all of this, so help me, I... What do you wanna know? Everything.<eos> Why are you out here?<eos> All the people here... are they like you?<eos> Recovering, yes.<eos> And who freed them?
The Excellent or that Porsche?<eos> - That Porsche.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it's better in every single way.<eos> To prove my cynical colleagues wrong, I invited them to go for a drive.
Go.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> If there's repo in town, I have to warn people.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You warn them some weird shit's going on in Rat City.
You two gonna solve all that with your shitty cologne and sexual tension?<eos> I smell great.<eos> Make a Warrant. Pick some nerds.<eos> Take 'em for a spin, see if they're field ready.<eos> If you like 'em, we tell them what's really going on in the RAC.
We're either running or we're owned, but we are never equal;<eos> we are never them.<eos> So, wha... what is this?<eos> Some sort of poetic identity theft?<eos> You literally take the skin off your owners' backs, you impersonate them, and you steal their money?
His death is unfortunate.<eos> His death was regrettable but, ultimately, necessary.<eos> I still have enemies within the court, but they've lost their direct claim to the throne.<eos> They're disorganized and without purpose.<eos> It's only a matter of time before I uproot them.
And if a bunch of... self-serving outlaws are willing to help your cause, maybe that could inspire you to make an effort.<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - While you and your buddies sit around a table arguing, people are dying.<eos> Provoking Ferrous Corp - isn't the answer.<eos> - You already provoked them, the moment you declared your independence.
Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.<eos> What?<eos> Where's Turrence?<eos> So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.
And I've been talking about wanting to do something that'll make difference, and here's my chance.<eos> There are other ways to help.<eos> You're right.<eos> The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.<eos> I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.
I believe we can arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement.<eos> Great!<eos> The missiles, the payment, and your crew member have been deposited in a clearing 1.42 kilometers northeast of this location, as agreed upon.<eos> And your crew members have been deposited in a clearing 1.63 kilometers southwest of here, as agreed upon.<eos> I'm afraid I had to restrain them.
You risked everything to bring justice for those 10,000 people who were killed on Hyadum12.<eos> But if you don't get the word out to your friends in the outer colonies, the death toll's gonna be 1,000 higher than that.<eos> Since when did you start giving a damn?<eos> Since you convinced us.<eos> You want to fight for the little guy, protect them from the corps; This is your chance.
Why is he sad?<eos> He thinks that he's alone.<eos> But the funny thing is, he's wrong.<eos> He's got lots of friends.<eos> But he feels like he's let them down.
[man speaking in Afrikaans] I've found that fire. When you really think about it... it is something that brings people together.<eos> At night it gets cold and dark.<eos> If the fire is small it's hard to get warm, but the bigger the fire is, the warmer it is.<eos> So fire makes people huddle around, to talk and tell stories.<eos> The glow of the flames draws people in, bringing them closer together.
Are you offering me that?<eos> I'm not fucking insane.<eos> But you would have taken it.<eos> I do something that's valuable.<eos> I strip people naked to the elements, and then I help rebuild them out of solid fucking rock.
But you're the one who killed my men.<eos> You are the one who made the children orphans.<eos> You are the monster.<eos> Your soldiers are dead, fritz.<eos> We killed them.
You are the one who made the children orphans.<eos> You are the monster.<eos> Your soldiers are dead, fritz.<eos> We killed them.<eos> And we're going to keep killing them and pushing you. Out of our homes.
- I want to help people.<eos> - Love that.<eos> As long as it's help plus kicking ass.<eos> Because you need to whip this team into shape.<eos> They're very talented, but they're just missing a you to motivate them.
Copy that, 1309.<eos> Conrad, what's going on?<eos> Five suspects entered with assault rifles.<eos> Two cars fled the scene.<eos> Brandt and Goss are in pursuit of them now.
Yeah, but I don't recognize any of them.<eos> They're all just rando dudes.<eos> - Rando dudes into kinky-ass...<eos> - When we get back to the station, get together with Jimmy.<eos> Well, we need to get those rando dudes sketched before you forget them.
A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.<eos> Which one of you is Aethelred?<eos> Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.<eos> He sent me to kill the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.<eos> After taking Sigefrid's hand, I banished them.
If these rogues are Aethelstan's men, then they are his worry.<eos> Until they decide to blockade the river, Lord.<eos> Then Wessex will be starved of trade.<eos> Aethelstan shall deal with them.<eos> He must kill them.
Until they decide to blockade the river, Lord.<eos> Then Wessex will be starved of trade.<eos> Aethelstan shall deal with them.<eos> He must kill them.<eos> I believe we must kill them.
The once proud and brave Earl Guthrum... he now calls himself a Christian!<eos> He now calls himself "King Aethelstan", but he's Nothing but Alfred's hound and he shamed us all!<eos> He has shamed every warrior that has gone before us!<eos> He has shamed the gods!<eos> And the gods call upon every man gathered here today to avenge them!
I just didn't want him getting in trouble with them.<eos> Did he have any mates here?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I've seen him mucking about with a couple of guys on and off.<eos> - Can you point them out to us, love?
Well, it looks like it.<eos> These workers do you proud, don't they, love?<eos> Hm?<eos> Make you decent money.<eos> I can see why you'd want to protect them.
What about the agents that sabotaged the Czarna refinery?<eos> A calculated move to keep their trust.<eos> When you wouldn't tell me which refinery Professor Voigt I tracked down the information myself.<eos> - How?<eos> - Your vehicle logs. so I sent the agents to Czarna where I could capture them and keep Professor Voigt off their radar. surely they will send more to replace the ones you captured.
It's the loneliest job in the world.<eos> - Mr. President. - What is it?<eos> Sir, there's been a complication in Naruba.<eos> We just got intel that 15 American humanitarian workers have been taken hostage by Kalame's militia.<eos> Apparently, he's holding them in several different vehicles in his convoy.
Sometimes you have to decide between a bad choice and no choice at all.<eos> If I were to do this... how would it play out?<eos> Through a man named Austin Silwamba, a mid-level diplomat in Zimbabwe. He's a CIA asset that I've used in the past.<eos> You authorize him to broker a deal allowing our people to be taken to safe passage, to an extraction point.<eos> Then you chopper them out.
This is a chance to prove your value to the team and get you out of this cage.<eos> Don't you want that?<eos> Of course I do, but...<eos> I don't remember these people.<eos> You remembered them this morning, just by looking at a photo and listening to an engine motor.
I know we're not Shelly and Miguel.<eos> No.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need to take the time to remember the newlyweds that lived here.<eos> Yeah. 'Cause I miss them sometimes.
Anders covered it up.<eos> He made it look like an accident.<eos> And Vanessa has no idea about any of this.<eos> Explains why her parents were so charitable.<eos> Can imagine the guilt was eating them alive.
Any sexual assault?<eos> None.<eos> Home invasion victims are often blitz attacked. But not here.<eos> No defensive wounds, no blunt-force trauma.<eos> Then the unsubs likely used the gun to control them.
See you in the morning. Wait, I won't.<eos> Olivia.<eos> What?<eos> Lem's friends... You trust them?<eos> I don't know them.
Brandi's real name is Stephanie Wetherbee.<eos> She was a runaway from Philadelphia who hadn't seen her family in over 10 years.<eos> So we found her mother and fixed that.<eos> Oh, baby. We found Regina Franklin's parents in Tampa.<eos> I offered to fly down and talk to them personally, but apparently her mother has a cousin who lives here, so we flew them up instead.
You want the job?<eos> Wail in agony.<eos> Okay.<eos> The men never died.<eos> She harvests them for food.
Tell them that everyone should have a chance.<eos> We're England.<eos> We can be great and majestic.<eos> Remind them of that.<eos> Inspire them.
The monsters like us.<eos> Amber!<eos> They like you?<eos> They... They call us beacons.<eos> They say that we lead them here.
And we'd be abandoning those workers. They're victims of Dr. Orwell, too.<eos> Our parents wanted us to be safe.<eos> We don't know what they wanted. Not anymore.<eos> We don't know why they were in Paltryville. We don't know why there were so many things they never told us.<eos> But we do know how we remember them.
Sam!<eos> He's in there.<eos> He was on guard with the others.<eos> I don't think he's gonna survive.<eos> The Witness's men hit us hard before we drove them off.
Mr. Cole!<eos> What happens next happens last.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> These people are you family.<eos> You've known them a lot longer than I.
One day before this photo was taken, an American journalist living in Surabaya died in a car accident.<eos> Rumor was he used to be a CIA operative who went inside the Islamic Front.<eos> I think Dayana and Mike Murray were the kill team sent in to take him out.<eos> Can we get back to the part where Ryan's not a bad guy?<eos> Okay, you said that the terrorists are interrogating the hostages and then executing them.
I forgot something.<eos> I'll be just a second, okay?<eos> Whoa. Slow down, Alabama.<eos> I hope I didn't take you away from your marks.<eos> I lost them.
Is there a reason why Green Gables is so secluded?<eos> A reason? My family wasn't inclined toward idle chatter.<eos> Do you miss your parents terribly?<eos> They lived good, Christian lives.<eos> You can't begrudge God for bringing them home.
This isn't right.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are the prisoners?<eos> Probably dead already.<eos> I thought your source said they had them, that we'd get them back.
- Where do we start?<eos> The forest spans for miles.<eos> No, not the forest.<eos> I know exactly where they will be.<eos> I sent them there.
I need to speak to the Brigadefuhrer alone.<eos> This is now your top priority.<eos> You need to capture those spies.<eos> - I'll dispose of them.<eos> - No. I want them questioned.
There's not enough fuel to get back.<eos> Who said anything about getting back?<eos> Your friends are taken care of.<eos> They don't need you to keep them alive in the bunker.<eos> But you will need them if you go there.
Yesterday, we were right.<eos> Today, we have to live with being wrong.<eos> We're back on the Ark.<eos> Killing our own people so that... so that we can live.<eos> Locking them up.
Fight! Fight...<eos> Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Your people need you.<eos> Listen to them.
Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Your people need you.<eos> Listen to them.<eos> They wanna fight.<eos> How do we stop them now?
That was many lifetimes ago.<eos> Really?<eos> You gave that up for this?<eos> Well, this is not all that different.<eos> People come to you in need, you provide them comfort.
No, it was your firm.<eos> Look, if you want to stay on as an emeritus, we can discuss that.<eos> And lose my equity?<eos> What is to keep me from taking my clients out the door with me?<eos> Where would you take them?
Yes?<eos> It's... what I said.<eos> Ms. Tascioni, where is this going?<eos> I just have a few more questions.<eos> Did you ever meet with Reddick/Boseman clients in order to steal them away?
- Is that the official definition?<eos> - Well, it should be.<eos> Hello.<eos> - I hope you haven't given either of our rooms away.<eos> They're still available, if you need them.
So I needed to be controlled, is that it?<eos> What the hell am I, Lucifer... a pawn in some plan of yours?<eos> No, I wouldn't put it like that.<eos> Of course you wouldn't, because that would actually require you understanding how you affect people.<eos> - How you hurt them. - Aah!
This is ridiculous.<eos> You have experience with emotionally fragile men, don't you?<eos> You're self-aware today.<eos> No, I meant Dan.<eos> Anyway, tell me, how do you stop them from overthinking everything?
If we can get into a car, even if it isn't working, at least it'll be safer than staying here.<eos> My friends have a car.<eos> It works.<eos> What friends?<eos> We met them at the police station.
What would we do?<eos> - Forcibly round up...<eos> - All the teachers.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then we would bring them to a room like this.
Now, rather than seeking a greater understanding of the world, like the Masons proper, the Arma Mutata sought to change the world for the better.<eos> Sounds like fanatics.<eos> "Fanatic" is too kind a term.<eos> The Arma Mutata believed the instruments for this great change were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> They sought to raise them by bonding them to human hosts.
Not if we get there first.<eos> And-and do what?<eos> The Horsemen are unstoppable.<eos> Dreyfuss is the key.<eos> He summoned the Horsemen, bound them to himself.
Yes, I can.<eos> I just need your help getting him back on the reservation, before Thawne finds out.<eos> We have bigger problems.<eos> What if Heywood's only the first of his old teammates Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for?<eos> I knew we should've killed them all.
Should they raid, we shall not be overrun and importantly we shall not feed them so much as a single grain.<eos> Wessex is fortified.<eos> Once the harvest is gathered, the fighting men of the fyrds shall be free of labour, should they be required.<eos> Should they be required, Lord?<eos> ! Mercia requires them now.
I thought you were on their side.<eos> A program can't take into account human emotions, people covering for others, people forced to do things they didn't want to.<eos> We're not doing good here.<eos> So what are we supposed to do now?<eos> We get them arrested.
Hello there!<eos> You first.<eos> - 'I'm sorry?<eos> ' - Well, all your crewmates are dead.<eos> So, either you're extremely lucky or you killed them. Which is it?
Right up there, up above us.<eos> Are you sure your friend will be with them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Basically, he always ends up being boss of the locals.<eos> Usually by annoying them.
Let me in! Amira!<eos> Open the damn door!<eos> So that's what you're about?<eos> Rescue people one minute, then just...<eos> - Just torture them the next.
He doesn't exactly give off an upper-management vibe.<eos> I'd say more of a huffed paint at critical developmental stages vibe.<eos> The place is wall-to-wall undead.<eos> Where did all these new zombies come from?<eos> And where's Don E. getting brains to feed them all?
Because I was ashamed, Emma, and scared of losing you and everything that matters to me.<eos> And you really think that would happen after everything we've been through?<eos> You tell me... how am I supposed to sit across from your mother and father at the table and look them in the eye after what I've done?<eos> I'm not saying it would be easy.<eos> You know them.
Burov will sacrifice himself before betraying his country.<eos> He can't be turned.<eos> How does he feel about his parents?<eos> What?<eos> Would he worry about taking them down with him, if things go bad for him?
I can't imagine.<eos> I went through the house.<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, it would make sense that he's out with those kids if-- if he's trying to work them against Pasha, but... 3:00 AM just seems a little late.
From Dyatkovo.<eos> I betrayed my country.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> I betrayed my people.<eos> Friends, neighbors-- I killed them all.
Laurie is also pregnant.<eos> Jian-Yang, are you drinking creamer?<eos> It's half-half.<eos> Which brings us to our one final, crucial question.<eos> What value can we offer now to the user to entice them to download the app and opt in to our network?
We're gonna keep walking until the AIC shows themselves.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've constructed this misdirection.<eos> You lot want to know who the terrorists are.<eos> You've goaded them into action for the chance of catching them.
Annie.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Looks like you're off your meds again.<eos> I don't know those people.<eos> I don't know them.
No, Adam!<eos> Well, hello!<eos> Sophie, you came!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sophia, if you see your brothers, send them my way.
Go and invite the guests.<eos> The food is still hot.<eos> Tell them to start helping themselves.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do we have to feed them too or can they eat on their own?
Mount Pleasant... is that, like, upstate or something?<eos> I just moved here from Pittsburgh, so...<eos> Cut the crap, okay?<eos> We know you ran away from two members of the Mount Pleasant Citizens Patrol last night.<eos> You led them through the woods to the Metro North station on the other side.
Except when you're talking about models.<eos> Models exist to be on covers.<eos> I think that's an oversimplification.<eos> I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.<eos> Something, something that makes them stand apart.
I think this is gonna be a lot of fun.<eos> We have to stop him.<eos> My son.<eos> Whatever you are, if I am what you say, don't hurt these people.<eos> Hurt them?
Whatever you are, if I am what you say, don't hurt these people.<eos> Hurt them?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> I froze them so they wouldn't hurt themselves... or you.
He'll compliment anyone who's payin' him.<eos> Yeah, that's the thing. Neumann's Hill won't let me hire him as my vet.<eos> Not sure how to break the news.<eos> What was your move for firing people?<eos> Generally, I just pissed them off till they quit.
I'm not here to kill anyone.<eos> I hope you mean that.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> They're scared.<eos> I mean, you're scaring them, Laurel.
The gods will give us a sign.<eos> They love us.<eos> Will they try to kill you again?<eos> Possibly.<eos> I will stop them.
Again, I place you in the hands of the gods.<eos> Take care of my mother.<eos> She needs you.<eos> Farewell, Torvi, mother of my children.<eos> I pray to the gods that I will see you, and them, again.
Who am I?<eos> The answer is words.<eos> Very clever of you.<eos> Have you ever wondered whether your nobles are happy?<eos> You force them to live under your roof, the only way they can survive is to get a foothold on the crazy ladder of favor and promotion.
You... you haven't turned?<eos> You're not working for them?<eos> No, of course not!<eos> I've spent the last six months planning, and also recruiting all these chaps.<eos> Deprogramming them one by one, talking some sense into them.
That was the AIU Tech.<eos> He said the blood on the dashboard of Severide's Mustang came back inconclusive.<eos> So, we still can't clear him from being behind the wheel?<eos> - No.<eos> - If we can figure out who this crew is selling cars to, we can find them.
I'm sure you hear this all the time, but I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Nice try, nice try.<eos> But we found the car and the bodies you left with it.<eos> And if you add your drug charges onto that, you're looking at the end of your days as a free man.<eos> Okay, look, all right, I've been smuggling drugs onto the island, but like you said, my game is all about avoiding cops, not capping them in the streets.
No choice, old boy.<eos> You see, I suddenly remembered I need a bit of a hand getting that ruddy ship off the ground.<eos> And who better to ask than the Ice Queen herself?<eos> Call off your dogs, Your Majesty.<eos> Call them off!
No more lies... and you can go with him wherever you like.<eos> - Now, Donald, don't...<eos> - Stop. I admit I'm a little overprotective.<eos> A little?<eos> No matter what I do, these boys will get into trouble, so maybe you could teach them how to get out of trouble.
You crazy bastard. In an opencarry state.<eos> You are one beautiful baby.<eos> You're a natural.<eos> Not like the other boys.<eos> I had to teach them everything, every single thing.
- We got to get it back.<eos> - Okay, but how?<eos> They probably outnumber us ten to one.<eos> Their soldiers might be fanatics, but they're also untrained amateurs.<eos> We can beat them if we fight them on our terms.
Yeah, it's just... you're risking your life when shooting him on sight would be a little bit easier.<eos> Who the hell ever said... "easy" and "right" were the same thing?<eos> Look, I'm not saying that I'm some sort of hero or anything.<eos> I've killed several men.<eos> But the thing is that I see them every time I close my eyes.
Let me get my drink.<eos> Hello, Sebastian.<eos> I thought maybe we could... grab a drink together, clear the air.<eos> I'm feeling like I could use some friends tonight.<eos> Yeah, so you can destroy them later?
Someday I'm gonna do the same thing to you.<eos> I'm sorry for what I did to you.<eos> Don't let me see you again.<eos> The bigger the conspiracy, the bigger the people involved.<eos> Then we'll expose them all. All the way to the top. As high as it goes.
I mean, I know that this is normal for you.<eos> This isn't normal for me.<eos> Sweetheart, this isn't normal for anyone.<eos> Guy must have helped over a thousand vets.<eos> He literally got them back on their feet.
Look, guys, check this out.<eos> Do you see what I see?<eos> The victims could be dead-ringers for the people in these photos.<eos> This unsub wants to do more than mock these people.<eos> He wants to destroy them.
Where is she right now?<eos> Headed north on the Palisades.<eos> She must be meeting with Edith to get the cash.<eos> Patterson, get a team out there now.<eos> We need to intercept them before they pay that ransom.
Patterson, get a team out there now.<eos> We need to intercept them before they pay that ransom.<eos> Hey, look who I found.<eos> They climbed down the damn chimney.<eos> I told you to not let them out of your sight!
Character speaks for itself.<eos> People want a president they can trust.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> They want a president they know.<eos> And I know them.
We're going to a concert.<eos> I got the tickets online.<eos> Easier than buying them at the venue, I guess.<eos> What is the venue, uh, by the way?<eos> You can't buy them at the door.
You better hurry.<eos> Got you.<eos> Let's go, Hauser.<eos> You guys up on the top, you have to wait until they surface before you close the hatch, turn the valves, and seal the well.<eos> If you don't, you're gonna kill them.
Tell them to start with the Airbnb.<eos> You know, I don't always meet the guests that stay at my properties, but these two young men were very polite.<eos> They had to extend their stay for a funeral... poor things.<eos> And I know it was a little cramped in here for the two of them.<eos> When they first got here, I tried to move them to the big two-bedroom upstairs, but they said they wanted the fireplace.
_<eos> Sorry. Bad habit I've developed recently.<eos> Harley killed two more Fillmore-Graves soldiers yesterday.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Lured them into a minefield.
Let's.<eos> Well, it's not an ideal jury, but pretty solid, considering Liberty guessed our strategy, and used all her strikes on risk-averse jurors.<eos> This case is about control, risk and fear.<eos> Everybody's afraid of something, usually something they don't understand.<eos> I understand spiders, but I'm still afraid of them.
And this could be very bad for a lot of good people.<eos> We agree on that much, don't we?<eos> I can be useful to you.<eos> I can pull strings.<eos> I could give you access to resources if you need them.
Male and female.<eos> So I find people rarely exit rooms via windows when they're not fleeing for their lives.<eos> Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer paid them a visit, too.<eos> That's one possibility.<eos> The other is that they were worried that someone would catch them with this.
- Well... - Brett, what's going on?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I am batting about a zero with men lately.<eos> Good men, bad men, all men.<eos> I'm either pushing them away, or they're pushing me, and then I look at you, and I think,
I just have to reconfigure the coordinates.<eos> Do you think Mason is gonna be able to track us?<eos> Not after what I did to his computers.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I've lost them.
What do you mean, you've lost them?<eos> They've jumped.<eos> They're no longer in...<eos> - Nothing's responding.<eos> - Get them up.
When they jump back, we can track their general area.<eos> Well, that's a start.<eos> Get teams ready to roll.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> You said you had them.
Okay, except...<eos> It's an Algiz.<eos> An ancient ruinic guardian symbol.<eos> He wasn't trying to summon something to attack his friends.<eos> He was trying to protect them.
Let's put a stop to all this stupidity right now.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one is going to touch those students.<eos> We just need to talk with them.<eos> I know I can reason with them.
"Kimball Factory:<eos> A Kiddie Sex Den."<eos> And the essence of the story is what?<eos> That people threw parties at the abandoned factory to lure underage teens to engage in sexual acts.<eos> They'd get them drunk and high?
One of his clients tipped him off.<eos> We're gonna find out which one.<eos> Three clients filed to cash out immediately after the short.<eos> All three of them will be at a GIP party tonight.<eos> You're gonna find them, work them, get their reasons for cashing out.
The possibilities, I'm afraid, are endless.<eos> But the gist is this:<eos> Kotite and the others were in the wrong place at the wrong time, seeing or hearing something which, three years hence, required their assassinations.<eos> Okay, so, short of building a time machine, how do we figure out what that something might be?<eos> I've reached out to some friends at Scotland Yard, asked them to dig up records of what was going on in and around the court at the time of Kotite's trial.
That didn't come up in any of our research.<eos> Well, of course it didn't.<eos> It was a best kept secret at the firm.<eos> When he was on his meds, he was one of the finest legal minds on the planet.<eos> When he was off them... well, let's just say he was prone to outbursts.
And now, despite dedicating every resource at my disposal to finding him, he has completely eluded detection.<eos> Dembe's timing is impeccable.<eos> And his most deadly attribute is patience.<eos> Which is why Aram's abduction presents two trails.<eos> And clearly, two very motivated parties to follow them.
Keep your Interdictor cruiser back until I order otherwise.<eos> Why not just attack now with overwhelming force?<eos> I could...<eos> Because I know these rebels.<eos> I've studied them.
I unsealed every cadet's criminal record after I heard about what happened.<eos> I know Noah believed in these boys, Dwayne.<eos> I know you probably do, too.<eos> But you can't tell me none of them are capable of murder.<eos> You can't prejudge them from their past.
It looks like my work's paid off.<eos> I don't see any bruises.<eos> Yeah, Ryan told me about our friend, Sebastian.<eos> Oh, yeah, hey! I did all right.<eos> I'd say some instincts came back when I needed them.
Are you saying that Roller's killers are dead?<eos> Who... Who did this to him?<eos> Dirty mothers.<eos> Ran some highend realestate office across the state, dealing drugs ­out of every one of them.<eos> Someone's conscience got the best of them and they tipped off the police.
Indeed, they have.<eos> They've doubled their output of greenhouse gases, increased the rate of deforestation, ravaged the planet.<eos> You said it yourself, Pamela, and I quote,<eos> "Humans simply will not give a crap<eos> "unless we force them to."
I am not destroying the world.<eos> I'm saving it.<eos> Saving it from the takers and the users.<eos> We've been surrounded by men like that all our lives.<eos> But we can change them, trim them, shape them like a good gardener.
Okay.<eos> "Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass," huh?<eos> What happened to "professional courtesy"?<eos> Huh. You should hear what I really wanted to call him.<eos> Our jobs are to put people in jail, not get them out.
I'd say a treasure map fits the bill, wouldn't you?<eos> Pirate treasure in New York?<eos> Piracy was actually a vital part of the Colonial economy.<eos> Many a privateer roamed Manhattan's streets squandering their stolen doubloons on wine and wenches.<eos> And never a place to turn away a good customer, the city welcomed them with open arms.
There's been no ransom call, and Bryant has no obvious enemies.<eos> If you ignore the nine million vets trying to get help at the VA.<eos> The guy does seem to be living the good life.<eos> Dude owns, like, 12 Brionis.<eos> How do you think the vets would feel if they found out the guy telling them no was walking around in $7,000 suits?
When the Vietnam War was over, officially, some us stayed in Southeast Asia, unofficially.<eos> When the military pulled out, they pulled out fast.<eos> Left people behind.<eos> Operatives with non-official covers.<eos> Our mission was to rescue them.
Operatives with non-official covers.<eos> Our mission was to rescue them.<eos> But our government made clear that we were on our own.<eos> We had to come up with all the money, for equipment, fuel, bribes, ransom.<eos> Whatever was needed to bring them home.
I suggest you and your non-friend leave before I call the police.<eos> I'm a federal agent.<eos> And yet, I have seen no identification, no badges, guys, uh, not even a warrant.<eos> All I see is two men who have come into my place of business to harass me with... what I can only assume are phony documents.<eos> Get rid of them.
Can it take a bullet?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Hey, are you out of your minds?<eos> What the hell were you gonna plan to get through those cops?<eos> You think you're just gonna ram right through them?
- You know where everyone is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get me a pen and a paper and I'll write down the exact location of the hostages.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, if we can just delay them.
My husband doesn't talk to me.<eos> He doesn't tell me anything.<eos> And when we do talk, it isn't about work.<eos> How about these people?<eos> You seen any of them around Cole?
No, Epi, no...<eos> When my parents were short one time too many...<eos> He hanged my mother and my father...<eos> From this tree.<eos> I found them like that.
Alice knows that she's caught.<eos> If the other Collaborators react like her, they'll want a deal.<eos> They want freedom.<eos> They'll protect their power and their money.<eos> We have them against the ropes.
I appreciate that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, what is the name again?<eos> You can make it out to Kidnap Solutions LLC.<eos> People pay you to kidnap them?
Why would...<eos> Why would I do...<eos> Why would anyone do this?<eos> Why would I hire you to do this to me?<eos> These psychos pay you money to torture them?
Why would Scratch choose Lindsey?<eos> I mean, her ties to Reid are distant.<eos> Walker and I, we kicked it around on the flight, and we imagine that Scratch was digging further into Reid's past and he saw that Lindsey had become a contract killer.<eos> Realized she could get to him in a way that he couldn't.<eos> It may be logistical, too. Scratch has never run out of drugs before, but now he's a fugitive and might not be able to get them.
- God.<eos> It's disturbing how happy you are right now.<eos> Though it is more of a Jeremy thing.<eos> So why is Lucado sticking you in here with this when you should be out sticking it to supernatural nasties?<eos> Because she doesn't need dead humans, she needs the things that get them dead.
The socialite?<eos> Her taste, personal network, and dinner parties are legendary.<eos> Everyone from Janet Yellen to Jay Z.<eos> She's a power broker.<eos> She can summon influential people in a room and get them talking, even when no amount of official diplomacy has worked.
She was being blackmailed this whole time.<eos> After the G20, she started looking for a way to get out, and that's why she accessed the cache.<eos> She was trying to hack into U.S. passport control, looking for a means to disappear with her family undetected.<eos> And we're gonna help her do exactly that.<eos> In exchange for safe passage, Rebecca's gonna provide us with the identities of the collaborators and the information and the evidence we need to bring them to justice.
We want to make sure we can make this case.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> We own these guys.<eos> Why don't we just grab them?<eos> You could certainly question them, but short of a confession, it's a very high bar to prove rape
It's a horrendous precedent.<eos> These hackers are putting people's lives at risk.<eos> They're compromising their care.<eos> You can't reward behavior like that.<eos> Besides, you pay them now, what stops them from doing it again or holding the hospital next-door hostage?
You are talking about Hans's abduction.<eos> You are telling me Reddington was behind it?<eos> The idea was simple enough, to make it appear as if Hans had been kidnapped, to send Werner a ransom demand.<eos> $10 million or his son would be killed.<eos> At that point, I would intervene, talk to the brutal abductors, convince them they should release Hans unharmed.
It's black rain!<eos> It will still be a good death.<eos> The king is dead.<eos> You were right when you said that<eos> I used to think that people were basically good, if you took them out of this world and showed them the way of peace, the darkness would fade, just like the darkness in me faded.
We can do it right now.<eos> Theo uses technology to spy, to control people down the line.<eos> He can listen to anybody at any time.<eos> So, why would a guy like that play fair when it comes to his fellow Collaborators?<eos> You think he's spying on them.
13 Reasons Why was a really special story to me, especially when I read it for the first time when I was 14 because people were just really mean in middle school.<eos> And it really did change my perspective on how to treat people, because you really don't know what other people are going through.<eos> [Luke] High school can be a tough environment for an individual to grow and to come in their own.<eos> [Langford] One of the big differences about 13 Reasons is that we're treating the audience like young adults, not as teenagers.<eos> We're treating them as people.
Doesn't that bastard go to school?<eos> Why's he here at this hour?<eos> His pops died at sea, and he lives with his mom.<eos> This town is full of hooligans like him.<eos> I'm the only saint here who hires them.
The corpse will be transported to a warehouse near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.<eos> Once on site, - it will be inspected by my people.<eos> - You have people?<eos> Once they're confident we're in good hands, they'll transport the body and are not to be followed.<eos> Stay with them.
Good to see you too, sweetheart.<eos> So, the twins, they'd be six, seven now?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Terrific age.<eos> You can just start to mould them.
I do send cards.<eos> Yes, your secretary's very efficient.<eos> Well, whatever the reason, it's great to be talking now.<eos> You still haven't arranged for me to meet the twins.<eos> I'd love to get to know them properly.
Well, they're very keen on athletics.<eos> You'll be happy to know that Emma's got the zone trials this Thursday, and Liam would have been there, but he hurt his ankle, so...<eos> Sports stars in the making?<eos> Well they didn't get that from you.<eos> I'm free to meet them whenever it suits you.
Eddie swore it was safe and I would have done anything to keep the boys playing like that.<eos> I know what it means to win.<eos> I was one of them once.<eos> Winning's like a drug too, you know?<eos> I let them down.
- OK.<eos> Look, the success of this entire operation depends on us being as hard as them.<eos> We can't we can't beat these people by showing fear and running for cover.<eos> It just won't cut it.<eos> So, do you want to beat them or not?
I did, but by the end of the call, they were in tears.<eos> They really love you, Sofia, and... they wanna try and change things.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> But hey, this is on you, too, okay?<eos> Things you were doing to hurt them, it only hurts you.
I want to heal people.<eos> I want to learn.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> You are definitely different to most humans I have met in recent times.<eos> Maybe I can teach you to like people again, or at least tolerate them, or stop putting them on sticks.
- That is what I thought I'd be delivering to my new employer.<eos> - This is exactly what Harvey needed.<eos> How the hell did you get this?<eos> - What I do is an art.<eos> I find out what people want, what they're afraid of, what makes them tick, and I use it.
That's an impulse killing.<eos> It's emotional.<eos> That's why this doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, maybe she just lost it.<eos> I mean, people keep things bottled up, and then something sets them off, and some poor shit takes the brunt of it.
But there's no way you can pay him 100 million yen, right?<eos> I can.<eos> I was abandoned by my parents... when I was three.<eos> The orphanage was run by a married couple.<eos> The children were forced to call them Mother and Father.
We'll sleep under the stars.<eos> We'll build huts out of leaves and sticks.<eos> Hunt goats, skin them. Then roast them on a fire.<eos> I don't like goats.<eos> They won't like you much if you roast them on a fire.
Come here.<eos> Um, Tom is here, and David, and Josh.<eos> And David.<eos> Did I say David?<eos> Yeah, I know, because I invited them.
Gloria, please, listen to me.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I know it's dangerous, but I have to do it for Bianca and for her father.<eos> Just give me a minute, please.<eos> It's like you get close to people, you know them.
Would've ruined the ball for anyone who witnessed it.<eos> I am very sorry i lost the pleasure of dancing with you, though.<eos> Did you happen to see four gentlemen pass this way?<eos> In top hats?<eos> You saw them?
Your husband says he's working late.<eos> Well, what kind of work are we really talking about?<eos> Hey, Jezebel, sin.<eos> Come and join the more than 150,000 satisfied customers who have all used iStalkU.<eos> Let your loved ones know you care by never letting them out of your virtual sight.
I'm sure you've heard the old saying:<eos> "Tragedy brings folks together".<eos> I can assure you the verity of that statement.<eos> It was the tragedy that bound this town.<eos> It is one last tragedy that will set them free.
We need to have the Irish cadets.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Yes.<eos> The Irish cadets, for the funeral.<eos> Jack loved them.
I'm sorry?<eos> Yes.<eos> The Irish cadets, for the funeral.<eos> Jack loved them.<eos> He saw them perform in Dublin last summer.
It was never going to be you leading that squadron.<eos> That's not the way the world works.<eos> You know he's royalty.<eos> Bridges to office.<eos> You know the last thing I said to my parents was I hated them.
She knows that they are coming.<eos> We got eyes on the target, tally-ho.<eos> That's what we came here for.<eos> All bombers, open bomb bay doors.<eos> Get them out of there.
I, am the sole survivor.<eos> I am so sorry to hear that.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> My system holds the key to superior technology.<eos> And there is a hidden planet where I teach refugees from other fallen worlds how to build weapons that will defeat them
Don't worry about her. I need you right now.<eos> It's a balcony.<eos> Well, she has to learn.<eos> There's bars.<eos> I'd sue the fuck out of them.
What?<eos> I'm up. I'm up.<eos> This song is such an awesome way to start every morning.<eos> It's a nice way of showing the gods how much we appreciate everything they'll do... once they take us out those doors to the Great Beyond.<eos> God, I love them so fucking much.
Say this.<eos> Miss Smith...<eos> You know, I've been working a long time, you can see that.<eos> And all those years, I've seen a lot of people come and go.<eos> I've seen people chasing what they think will make them happy, money, titles, whatever.
It's what makes it so hard for us to have this conversation because you have never felt it.<eos> So I have a proposal for you.<eos> Put together your institutional players, the guys who rep the big money.<eos> Whoever needs to kick the tires on this thing.<eos> I will take them on a little trip up the river.
Because that oil is a monster.<eos> Like the mean, old dinosaurs all that oil used to be.<eos> So, for 300 million years these old dinosaurs have been getting pretty tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and tighter...<eos> We get it, we get it, just do two "tighters".<eos> Because they have miles of earth and ocean pressing down on them...
And in your head the man who did it was inhuman.<eos> A monster.<eos> It wasn't a man though.<eos> The cops said that dogs scratched up the screen door.<eos> And he chased them off into the woods.
It isn't just Longrigg.<eos> You know how delicate relations are with Russia.<eos> If their Foreign Minister picks up the phone about this, we can't ignore him.<eos> What, so we're still taking orders from the Kremlin?<eos> Where are you hiding them?
You tell me, Medina.<eos> Men kill each other for any number of reasons.<eos> Money, power... Fear.<eos> Nine men would die that day at the Ravenite, but for none of those reasons.<eos> No, they'd taken something from the man who was killing them.
He stopped the defilement of our humble community.<eos> And we should thank god for that.<eos> - If I'm doing god's work, then why do I feel like such a sinner?<eos> - These boys believed that what they were doing was acting on behalf of the holy spirit to save us.<eos> So who are we to judge them?
- I guess they don't understand love like ours.<eos> Maybe they never will.<eos> - Well, isn't our love the same as theirs?<eos> - It is.<eos> - Maybe someone should teach them that.
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.<eos> You're here.<eos> You mean I'm from here?<eos> My parents are here.<eos> I have to get to them.
For what must be the millionth time, it's not destiny.<eos> Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just so nervous because I'm gonna meet my parents.<eos> I haven't seen them in I don't even know how long because...
- Dory!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> My parents...<eos> I... I lost them.
Must be nice.<eos> What? No! No, my parents are back in quarantine?<eos> They're being shipped to Cleveland?<eos> But I just got here!<eos> I've got to get to them.
Dory?<eos> Do you think my parents will want to see me?<eos> What? Why wouldn't they want to see you?<eos> Because...<eos> I lost them?
- Wait, what is that?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> There were no messages from our galactic party crashers during the first 10 days.<eos> But pretty soon, they had a name.<eos> We called them "the Others."
We've improved it.<eos> Made it mobile.<eos> The idea is to allow our soldiers in the field to instantly differentiate between friend and foe.<eos> You look at the enemy through this and it lights 'em up green.<eos> We can see them before they know they've been seen.
Look, they never treated me badly, Gayle.<eos> Being careful about bringing somebody into your family, that's admirable.<eos> And look at me.<eos> I mean, they were right to be worried about their daughter's future.<eos> I don't blame them for that.
Fear rises to your head, Gonzague.<eos> There's gonna be seven of us in that little hunter's lodge, thanks a lot.<eos> We are fleeing like gypsies, and we live in Paris!<eos> There is a Reign of Terror in Paris.<eos> Sans cullottes report aristocrats and execute them!
I want to defend my homeland, Sergeant.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Keep running.<eos> Hunt down terrorists.<eos> Well, let us know when you find them.
I can only imagine how hard it is to face that level of violence.<eos> No.<eos> We like going lethal.<eos> I mean, isn't that what you're paying us for, sir?<eos> Take the fight to America's enemies and send them straight to hell?
That's my guess.<eos> It's gonna take a few banks to get there.<eos> Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?<eos> They don't know anything yet.<eos> You take them to the funeral?
People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years, but they don't do it no more.<eos> Well, maybe your people did.<eos> Your people did, too.<eos> A long time ago, your ancestors was the Indians... till someone came along and killed them, broke 'em down, made you into one of them.
It goes against reason, William.<eos> It's not logical.<eos> If you had seen the shells and the blood that day, you'd know the only explanation for our victory was some sort of divine intervention.<eos> And what of the men and boys who died around you?<eos> Was it the hand of God that put them in the grave?
Those are lies they use to turn you against each other.<eos> When you set aside the hate they force you to carry, that's when you know love is our true nature.<eos> Do you see what's happening here?<eos> Mark my words, Messala, this is the poison.<eos> But that man offers the people something more, and calms them with compassion.
"Buildings tower.<eos> "To know the source of such things is to know our place in the world."<eos> We're guarded by a plan unknown to us, but...<eos> Friends, these gentlemen are from the federal government.<eos> I'd suggest you listen to them very carefully.
You just figured that out now, Goodwin?<eos> Robinson.<eos> Multiple markers to the south.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Draw them in.
Gabe, go on up front now.<eos> I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.<eos> Go on. I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!
Oh, I'll make some tea or coffee.<eos> And I'll make myself scarce.<eos> Yes, that would be good.<eos> I think I'll...<eos> I think I'll leave them to it.
Who says you failed?<eos> I'm not sure anyone in the world could ever persuade that man, once he'd set his mind to something.<eos> You can't change who people are.<eos> Then what can you do?<eos> You love them.
He's gonna have left time-bombs, trip-wire emails, the whole lot.<eos> You gotta clean it up.<eos> You can't just, you know, disappear this guy.<eos> We have guys, you know, we have cleaners.<eos> You know, that's what we call them.
You gotta clean it up.<eos> You can't just, you know, disappear this guy.<eos> We have guys, you know, we have cleaners.<eos> You know, that's what we call them.<eos> State Department, CIA, has different names for them, but we call them cleaners.
You got it all wrong!<eos> We're just like you guys.<eos> We hate humans.<eos> Yeah!<eos> That's right! Hate them.
So, my obnoxious teammates actually helped me on this one?<eos> -I think they did.<eos> - Shit!<eos> They're good for something after all.<eos> I was definitely messing with them, but I meant what I said.
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.<eos> My family always just called them Night Howlers.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.<eos> I use them to keep the bugs off the produce... but I don't like the little ones going near 'em... on account of what happened to your uncle Terry.
I couldn't leave her like that.<eos> Wait.<eos> I wanna stay.<eos> Lemme help you.<eos> If we don't make it out of here... those people are gonna need somebody, somebody to lead them.
If you stay, come back, you will go to jail.<eos> You get it?<eos> Oh, Mr. Sloane.<eos> We normally would welcome you to Master Po's humble home, but it's clear that you're here with dubious intentions.<eos> But when Michael Corleone was sitting in the restaurant across from the two men who attempted to kill his father, many argued that he was wrestling with his conscious to whether or not he could kill them in cold blood.
Yeah, apparently, he travels with a different bimbo every week.<eos> I wonder which one of us gets to play the bimbo.<eos> Hey, can I get in?<eos> At the soothing sound of the slots you slip into a serene state of slumber and sleep.<eos> Jack, for a moment, they will think you're Hannes, so lead them out and keep them busy.
That's the people that will help you reach the people<eos> Who stay in the hotel or in the restaurant.<eos> Those are the people you need to know.<eos> As I said, these bankers were all corrupt.<eos> Darkweb wanted to punish them, so he wanted to push his shoulder to fight for the cause.
One cut was when a card was canceled, And if a duplicate was used, the terminal would recognize Which is a forgery and warn the cashier<eos> We assume that risk as long as we do not try the card.<eos> Like I said, we were just making money, a lot,<eos> And the problem with that is that money does not change people.<eos> Show them as they are.
Everything was different.<eos> But I guess there was always something that never changed.<eos> It killed me to know that she would be sitting and waiting for me, And I never showed up.<eos> I missed my parents.<eos> I wanted to see them so much.
Deadly.<eos> Can I get him back?<eos> My husband?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wherever that thing comes from, it takes them with it.
- Who brought this news? The guards?<eos> - Your guards are missing!<eos> Some simpleton reported it.<eos> Who did you put on the detail?<eos> I want them found and lashed.
One, I suspect, could be a disciple.<eos> - Forgive me, Tribune.<eos> - Take some chicory.<eos> In time, the stomach numbs to these things.<eos> - Now bring them in, one by one. - Sir.
An unfortunate dilemma.<eos> For both of us, Tribune.<eos> I want his body here by tonight.<eos> The disciples are key.<eos> We find them, we find him.
Not because of you, because of them.<eos> They tried to kill you, sir.<eos> And they killed all these people, just to make everyone else a little more afraid.<eos> Well, fuck that.<eos> And fuck them.
- I forgot.<eos> What do you got there? Pictures?<eos> - This is my grandparents' house.<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> You know, the only time I really visited them was when I was little.
He's a quiet one.<eos> - Got many friends?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> A boy needs friends, you know.<eos> Jesus had 12 of them.
Hi, yeah, we need your help right away.<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> A fucking psycho has my parents!<eos> Please calm down, speak clearly... and don't use profanity.<eos> He's gonna fucking kill them!
So what? What happens after that?<eos> The enclosure just magically stops?<eos> Exactly.<eos> It ain't like politicians really listen to the people anyway.<eos> So we're gonna make them listen.
Soriano conned everyone, including us.<eos> When the Russians took Berlin at the end of World War II, two soldiers entered the bunker and found the ashes of Hitler and Eva Braun's bones.<eos> What are you talking about? Are you wasted?<eos> The soldiers were sent back to Moscow and all their bones were broken. They wanted to be sure the soldiers didn't invent the suicide story.<eos> Then, just in case, they sent them to Siberia. They never believed there were only ashes left.
So what happens to this family?<eos> Can you fathom what happens to this family?<eos> How do think the kids feel when they find out dear old dad isn't dear old dad and it's the guy down the street?<eos> How do you think dad feels, that these five little boys that he still loves dearly, when he finds out they're not his bio children.<eos> But he can't tear away, 'cause he loves them.
"I mean, literally to grab them by the hair "and smack their face against the wall," he wrote.<eos> I then discovered that Paul elam's famous "bash a violent bitch" article was written in response to this article by jezebel called...<eos> The article cited a study that revealed 70°/o of non-reciprocated violence was perpetuated by women.<eos> The author then went on to say that she conducted an informal survey at the office and the gist of her findings was that many women had physically assaulted their man, and it was interpreted as either being funny or he was asking for it.<eos> I couldn't help but see the hypocrisy in a major feminist website making light of abusing men, and mras stinging back only to have the media paint them as the abusers.
I don't think Bruce is your cup of tea.<eos> Lady Belborough, then.<eos> I should like to know all my neighbours.<eos> A matter of fact, I'm having a mask ball here tomorrow night.<eos> - You should invite them.
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived and I told them to wait for you in the war room.<eos> Fighting like dogs, no doubt. - I'll handle it. Thank you.<eos> - All right. Go on, then.<eos> Right, right. Come around, come around. No!<eos> Listen to me. We're gonna wedge them in. That's what we do.
Stop right there!<eos> Where are you taking these prisoners?<eos> - These are prisoners.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where are you taking them?
Where are you taking these prisoners?<eos> - These are prisoners.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where are you taking them?<eos> I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.
I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.<eos> - He's taking us to...<eos> - Quiet!<eos> And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again!<eos> - We'll take them from here. - That's okay.
- He's taking us to...<eos> - Quiet!<eos> And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again!<eos> - We'll take them from here. - That's okay.<eos> If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I'm sure.
I can't believe we let her go to New York.<eos> She's 16, Seymour.<eos> We don't even know who she's with.<eos> We don't know who her friends are.<eos> Well, she likes them, they like her. That's what's important.
That's why they've worked for me for 40 years, because they're so exploited.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You don't even know what you're talking about.<eos> You own your people.<eos> You own them, you use them, you sleep with them, and then when you're done--
What Merry blew up with that bomb of hers was nothing less than his life.<eos> He never got past the Rimrock Bomber, a girl who perhaps didn't deserve anything from him, who wasn't on the same playing field as him or anybody else.<eos> At this time, please rise for the mourner's Kaddish.<eos> You come at people with an open mind and yet you never fail to get them wrong.<eos> You get them wrong while you're with them or you tell someone about them and get them wrong again.
Mike Collins is the least technical in outlook of the Apollo 11 astronauts, but the most philosophical.<eos> If he does not love machines, he does love wine, and books, and roses.<eos> A man who has known all three pilots for many years says if he were forced down on an island, he would want it to be with Collins for the quality of his personality.<eos> Another said he would prefer Aldrin, because with his intelligence he would soon be converting sea water to fresh water and otherwise logically attacking the problem.<eos> But both agreed in the final analysis, that they would hope it was with Armstrong, because, somehow, he would get them off of it.
Unfortunately, we didn't make it.<eos> We developed the films but didn't have enough money to print the photos.<eos> -Do you still have the films? -Yes.<eos> -I've got them at home somewhere.<eos> -I'll need them.
Do you agree with me?<eos> I see you don't.<eos> You think there should be trial, lawyers, search for evidence and proofs so that an innocent person does not suffer, God forbid?<eos> And at the time, the system continues to take care of criminals.<eos> It builds new prisons, feeds and clothes them.
You think there should be trial, lawyers, search for evidence and proofs so that an innocent person does not suffer, God forbid?<eos> And at the time, the system continues to take care of criminals.<eos> It builds new prisons, feeds and clothes them.<eos> This imitation of punishment only encourages the criminals.<eos> It convinces them of their impunity.
Or the burglar who killed Komarova over a cheap lamp?<eos> Are you protecting them?<eos> I am talking about the mental hospital convoy and the guard of this detention facility.<eos> It was you who made them kill themselves. Am I right?<eos> You poisoned them, as well as me, with your preparation?
We have to stand by until there's an order.<eos> Just go back, OK?<eos> Are you gonna kill all the normal people?<eos> Come on, sir, take your boy and go away!<eos> Send them away.
Load the sacks of Gold onto the bullcarts!<eos> Sarman, despite knowing everything I continued to serve Maham. Now I want to serve Mohenjo Daro.<eos> Tell us. What must we do?<eos> The traders from Sumer have left with their carts full of Gold.<eos> We must stop them!
We are not food.<eos> The people of Earth are not your enemies.<eos> Yeah? Yeah.<eos> Watch this.<eos> We were sent by the Supreme Leader to eat delicious humans and dip them in ranch dressing.
They're not monsters, okay?<eos> The only real monster in this city is Shredder and the two mutants that he's created.<eos> Bebop and Rocksteady.<eos> If you think anything coming out of your mouth is gonna add to her credibility, you are sorely mistaken.<eos> Shredder mutated them with the help of Baxter Stockman.
I'll not have my kin die for nothing.<eos> And what are you to do?<eos> I'll take Claire to safety.<eos> Then I'll turn back... back to Culloden, and fight till it's done.<eos> I'll guide yer men to safety and set them on the path home.
Hope it's not a letter to a wife.<eos> It's not. It's a real-time tactical record of the donnager battle, right down to the millisecond, with full sensor logs and analysis.<eos> This must've come directly from the cic.<eos> They also got hi-res images of the attacking ships.<eos> Were they able to identify them?
I got so fucking hammered last night, I don't remember anything.<eos> Yeah, you disappeared after we hit the Volcano.<eos> Danny said he saw you talk with some guy in a $10,000 suit although I don't think Danny would know what a $10,000 suit looks like.<eos> Neil, your house, there's so many people.<eos> - You want me to kick them out?
Everything is dependent upon that gold, and right now it is sitting in a fort with no guns and full of holes.<eos> Charles is gonna agree to Jack's plan.<eos> In a month, the fort will be whole.<eos> Made so by slave labor?<eos> Has it not occurred to anyone that if Jack has not been able to persuade men to repair the fort, it is even less likely he will be able to persuade them to defend it?
I'd like to think on it.<eos> What's there to think about?<eos> If B.B. King had come to me, he would have never died... at the height he was.<eos> The Carconi brothers are coming to tear you down.<eos> They're coming, and -- and I don't have any ideas about how to stop them.
You've made promises and I'm holding you to them.<eos> I've brought some friends.<eos> Music lovers.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I'm watching them carefully.
Those men out there, they've seen horrors.<eos> Their bodies have been smashed, their minds torn to shreds.<eos> They need joy.<eos> They need... music.<eos> You can heal them, Bunny.
Damn!<eos> It's so big!<eos> God, that means he fucking loves you!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Don't untangle them!
Well, perhaps he was just under the weather.<eos> Yeah, and perhaps he was workshy.<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss, I suggest you find a Seaman's Mission.<eos> Men give you their lives, Mr Gibson. At least respect them, even if you won't protect them.
Just breathe, breathe through the contractions.<eos> Tell them I love them.<eos> You'll tell them yourself. Because you're staying with us.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I can't protect them.
Rone, 17 Feb QRF is being alerted.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> The only Quick Reaction Force I want is my guys.<eos> No. Contact 17 Feb QRF.<eos> Send them!
You should really be very grateful to me.<eos> You could so easily be dead by now.<eos> And you still could be, madam, easily.<eos> No, you're going to regret sending your guards away once Jamie gets here.<eos> I didn't send them very far away.
The DA can take it from there.<eos> Get him round-the-clock protection until he can testify against Cottonmouth.<eos> I'm dying back here. You're still thinking about Cottonmouth?<eos> Yeah, you should be, too.<eos> If he's got as many cops working for him as you say, he'll have them in the streets looking for us.
I always liked her.<eos> I couldn't stand Etta.<eos> What a bitch!<eos> We have lethal rounds, Cage<eos> - We will use them.
It's amazing what the mind can accept if it's wrapped in a familiar package.<eos> All these people.<eos> They have no idea what's coming, do they?<eos> No. No, we can't risk mass panic.<eos> How'd you get them to come here?
He killing all the witnesses now.<eos> For real, like, he is killing them.<eos> But the crazy part about it... is the police never found the money... or they didn't find the weed.<eos> He killed all the witnesses.<eos> Killed them all, man.
Something that happened out of sequence... You're trying to make it happen in real time, give it a certain kind of analysis.<eos> - So you put criminals in jail?<eos> - No.<eos> In fact, I, uh, kind of do the opposite.<eos> I ... try to keep them out of jail.
Copy.<eos> Alpha team, stay with the male. You are clear to engage.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.<eos> We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.
Alan Snyder.<eos> I'm the proxy governor of our little block here.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> To turn crisis into opportunity. Even the most successful men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.<eos> It's what they do afterward that defines them.
- What... what is this?<eos> I... I saw you die.<eos> I had no idea that it would feel like this.<eos> The years I spent operating on people.<eos> Opening them up and stitching them back together again.
Previously on AMC's "Hell on Wheels..." Fifty thousand dollars... now.<eos> Where's the money, New York?<eos> I am between transactions.<eos> We need to find a way to pay them, or we will be hip deep in blood.
But it's in the past, it's out of our hands.<eos> We need to control and I mean control... What happens next.<eos> From the inside.<eos> You think it was ranchers behind this?<eos> No, no. Thomas paid them off.
- And a complete disaster.<eos> - Why?<eos> Opening day, cars pull up onto the lot and they start honking immediately because no carhop comes up.<eos> You place your order!<eos> - We try to explain to them the walk-up window.
But when they say "Mayor of Brentwood," I know what they mean when they're saying that.<eos> I want you to know I never left anybody behind, Johnnie.<eos> I did what I had the right to do.<eos> I manifested myself out of a messed up situation.<eos> And don't think there weren't people back from where I came from hanging onto the back of my shirts the whole time with their hand out, trying to get me to drag them up, too.
- Quiet.<eos> Spend all day in this mess and then you get home and...<eos> That is wonderful. Mmm.<eos> Court is now in session.<eos> Detective, in regards to taking Mr. Simpson's shoes, you did not book them into evidence that night.
Okay, uh, I am relieved that this incredible part of the nightmare that occurred on June 12, 1994, is over.<eos> My first obligation is to my young children, Sydney and Justin, who will be raised the way that Nicole and I had always planned.<eos> Then when things settle down a bit, I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers who slaughtered Nicole and Mr. Goldman.<eos> They're out there somewhere.<eos> Whatever it takes, I will bring them in.
We speak the Common Tongue.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> - You met with the slavers today.<eos> I did.<eos> Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.<eos> What is dead may never die.<eos> What is dead may never die.<eos> Where are my niece and nephew?<eos> Let's go murder them.
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.<eos> They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family?<eos> I may not know the North, but I know men.<eos> They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.<eos> If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.
Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.<eos> Have been permitted?<eos> That's rather a tortured way of putting it.<eos> They demand to see you, Your Grace.<eos> Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.<eos> A pincer move.<eos> They won't be able to hit us from the sides.<eos> Good.<eos> It's crucial that we let them charge at us.
Hunters, move out.<eos> Cormac, guard the camp.<eos> I'm going after my friends.<eos> I have to follow.<eos> As soon as I find them, we'll come and help you get Genewen back.
We even spread a few ourselves, hoping to intimidate our enemies.<eos> But Pykon was a military outpost, nothing more.<eos> My parents might disagree, if I could dig their bodies up from beneath your floor and ask them.<eos> I know you hate Elves, but we don't murder prisoners of war.<eos> If your parents were prisoners here, we would have released them when the war ended.
You belong here, Eretria.<eos> With us.<eos> I'll take my chances with the Trolls.<eos> I can take you to your friends.<eos> Thanks, but I'll find them myself.
I don't want to pressure him.<eos> You have to tell him, Xoan adores children.<eos> A few months after the birth, we took you to your grandparents,<eos> So they met you and Xoan.<eos> Two years later, I went back to see them.
You have followed the river a long way... just to get fucked and die.<eos> - State your business.<eos> - Doing yours.<eos> Hunting spies.<eos> - And taking them where?
First they defy the king and sell slaves from upriver without permission.<eos> Now they're taking our own to sell for guns.<eos> Brother, it's too dangerous to be this far from Juffure.<eos> Especially for our sons.<eos> The Koros can take them as hostages and hold them for ransom.
So, Kalabi Koro chose someone else?<eos> I turned him down.<eos> If he even exists.<eos> My parents want to arrange a marriage for me.<eos> I turned them down, too.
They're a law unto themselves.<eos> You can never quite grasp who they are.<eos> Like gripping wet soap.<eos> I've done my research.<eos> Perhaps you know them as the, er...
When all we're trying to do is save the country from revolution.<eos> Are you political, Mr Shelby?<eos> Because these odd fellows believe that the time is coming soon when everyone must choose a side.<eos> Are your people coming, or are they not coming?<eos> Mr Shelby, you will learn that these men are far too grand for the clock to govern them.
Mary, I want it so that Charles is never left on his own.<eos> Understood?<eos> Sir, I should call a doctor.<eos> There will be some men coming down from Birmingham.<eos> And you put them up here in the house, you put them in the front
Understood?<eos> Sir, I should call a doctor.<eos> There will be some men coming down from Birmingham.<eos> And you put them up here in the house, you put them in the front<eos> - and back of the house and you feed them...
The only Poles I like were in the Warsaw ghetto.<eos> There's not one of them left.<eos> Shit, my landlords.<eos> I'm in trouble if they heard us.<eos> If you agree, we're going to ignore them.
Hello, Jim.<eos> Please step aside.<eos> THEO: This is the name of the man who killed your parents.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> No! Tell me who killed them!
He knew what he was doing, and he did it anyway.<eos> I'm begging you not to follow his path.<eos> You want to know if I wish my parents were alive?<eos> Of course.<eos> Would I give anything to have them back? Yes.
Of course.<eos> Would I give anything to have them back? Yes.<eos> But my father fought and died for what he believed was right.<eos> And if necessary... so will I.<eos> Take them.
Freeze, get it done.<eos> Jeez, relax.<eos> What's with him? Quiet!<eos> Quiet yourself.<eos> Why do you have to kill them?
[camera clicks] Time of death: 8:26 p.m.<eos> Now all I have to do is sign as the coroner.<eos> You are disturbingly good at this.<eos> I grew up forging report cards.<eos> If people knew how smart I was, it would have been harder to control them.
Next.<eos> We traced the call to Central.<eos> There are many jewelry shops out there.<eos> CIB is heading over there now.<eos> Why did they let us find them?
I wanted to boogie and so did Michael.<eos> He got up and started dancing on the table and this security guard came up and tried to take him down, so I punched him the fuck out.<eos> And then this other guy comes up and Michael hit him.<eos> He hit him so hard, his hair fell out.<eos> And then these two Korean twins came on to us so we took them into the manager's office and we started pumping away at them.

All but you.<eos> You do not feel you are where you belong.<eos> The men above would fight to protect us.<eos> I should be among them.<eos> If we are to lead them into this war, we ought to show that we are willing to lead them through it.
Well, baby, when you're the person enforcing the laws, you don't get to make a lot of friends.<eos> Not a lot of people like me.<eos> People like you.<eos> No, I know it's hard to believe, but they don't.<eos> I just expect a lot out of people, and for whatever reason, it pushes them away.
Not selling anything.<eos> Now what can I do for you, McLeod?<eos> I'm going to lay it out for you straight.<eos> A couple of hundred apple pickers will be on strike by this time tomorrow.<eos> As soon as they strike, the owners are gonna kick them off their land for trespassing.
It can't last.<eos> You should have more faith in your fellow man.<eos> They'll get itchy and they'll start fighting.<eos> We'll help them stay on the right path.<eos> We'll whip them into shape.
Right. Right.<eos> I just think that there's a chance we're walking into something bigger.<eos> I don't think I'm cut out for that shit.<eos> Burton's tough as nails, and chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm...<eos> Look, chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it.
Good to go!<eos> Don't pay any attention to that pendejo.<eos> You're going to have a great time.<eos> Can I borrow your camera?<eos> Yeah, but... if you drop it, you got to go down and get it.
And where we're going, Eden... it doesn't exist.<eos> Her nurse got it from a comic book.<eos> You understand?<eos> It's not real.<eos> It is for Laura.
Cool.<eos> Not cool.<eos> Pee in that cup!<eos> This to remind me of my screw-up?<eos> No. [sighs] Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it and... you know, the frame's straight and the engine still runs.
That K'un-Lun needs protection.<eos> It's where you belong.<eos> And look what a mess you've made here.<eos> I've seen this world.<eos> I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.
See you guys tonight! Moon Island on me, yeah?<eos> Oh man! Sorry brother, I know. I'm sorry.<eos> Why did you steal the diamond?<eos> You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else?<eos> You archaeologists, don't you want an item from the past to see the light again, so people can treasure and preserve it?
Oh man! Sorry brother, I know. I'm sorry.<eos> Why did you steal the diamond?<eos> You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else?<eos> You archaeologists, don't you want an item from the past to see the light again, so people can treasure and preserve it?<eos> The present buyer will surely treasure it because he paid a huge price for it.
They are fighting a good fight.<eos> You're doing it, too.<eos> Not like them.<eos> And even Jessica.<eos> There are people who run from the fire, and there are people who run into it.
Why?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Why would I feel that way about him, after meeting him only once?<eos> The son of the same father as the woman I love...<eos> Why does a soldier know that a nigger bowing low has a dagger in his shoe and is reaching for it?
Else.<eos> If he doesn't kill anyone else.<eos> All that matters right now is getting through the rift.<eos> Then you're out of luck.<eos> The rift burns anything that tries to pass through it.
The difference is that we don't have money or nice shit except a stroller.<eos> What other nice shit do we need?<eos> You're being a dick, and you're missing the point.<eos> Why don't you tell me the point?<eos> The point is that that is a $1,000 stroller, and we can't afford it, and so to have it feels fake to me.
- What?<eos> I-I wanna buy your gun.<eos> How much?<eos> It's not for sale.<eos> I figure you paid $700 for it.
Mr. Berenson wasn't in the meeting, but his report called the evidence conclusive.<eos> Really? He used that word, "conclusive"?<eos> According to Mr. Adal, he did.<eos> So you didn't actually see the report yourself. No.<eos> - Ask for it. Read it.
16 weeks.<eos> I don't, um... when?<eos> Seven years ago tomorrow.<eos> I was lying in the doctor's office, staring at the ultrasound.<eos> Looking right at it.
- It clearly was once.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> I'm gonna go down there. I'm gonna talk to it. No.<eos> You're not.<eos> We're going to shoot it, and we're gonna keep on shooting it.
Do you have any other ideas?<eos> Put in a request for a maritime mission.<eos> Take out a vessel ourselves.<eos> Alec, the ship is glamoured. It won't show up on the sonar.<eos> Well, it can't hide from us if we run right into it.
Don't sell yourself short.<eos> Not everybody can start a band when they're 18.<eos> Well, that band totally imploded.<eos> I mean, you wanna meet my new band?<eos> 'Cause you're looking right at it!
But first I have a gift for you.<eos> This tattoo of yours.<eos> To be an American and named a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary.<eos> When you look at it, it must--it must remind you of such a victory.<eos> Now, when you look at it, you'll think about our time here together and the secret that you confessed to me.
But you told me to atone for what I did as Spartan.<eos> And if that's true for me, it it 100 times truer for the Green Arrow.<eos> You don't get to just walk away from this, man.<eos> The hood is who you are.<eos> You don't think you deserve it?
Okay, all right, wind it in.<eos> As far as we can tell, the shard is made of near-frictionless material that's in a constant state of flux.<eos> So while it's utterly motionless on the outside...<eos> It's constantly moving on the inside.<eos> Yes, it's as if it's being affected by some sort of external source, much like the tides are affected by the phases of the moon.
- Pretty good?<eos> Baby Jane is the number one picture in America.<eos> Well, actually, it's more like number eight so far this year.<eos> No.<eos> For what we spent on it, it's number one.
Jason always adored the drive-in.<eos> Southside trash.<eos> They've been doing that since the opening credits.<eos> Hey!<eos> You know what happens to a snake when a Louis Vuitton heel steps on it?
You're unbelievable.<eos> But I'm not wrong.<eos> You are... Wrong.<eos> Congratulations on your promotion, Marcus.<eos> You earned it.
I... was just gonna call a cab.<eos> I have to go pick up my car.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> It... it was stolen.<eos> They just found it in a parking lot outside of a bar, but I... I need to go pick it up now.
I... make up your own mind.<eos> There's something.<eos> About the castle.<eos> He... he made some kind of joke.<eos> He put a curse on it.
The deadliest fire in the universe.<eos> That's definitely good.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> The only way we can.<eos> We run through it first.
You know, I happened to have taken a rather big romantic risk recently.<eos> And I gotta say... It pays off.<eos> Maybe he's worth a shot.<eos> Armek's ship is in low-Earth orbit.<eos> I can transmat up to it from here.
The House of Clios.<eos> Sounds like a horror movie.<eos> Or a Greek tragedy.<eos> What is it about this painting?<eos> You're always staring at it.
I just wanted to get the ball rolling.<eos> But even then it didn't work because you only sold it for four grand.<eos> It cost you 14.000 to make so you cost our production company ã10.000.<eos> No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it.
- It is the great deceiver!<eos> Do not always believe what you see!<eos> - But, look at her her!<eos> - Please, untie me father.<eos> - Kiss the holy cross and swear on it by the almighty. Ah! - Where'd she go?
Great work, everyone.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> Where's the champagne?<eos> I have some Macallan in my office.<eos> Well, let's get it!
She can help find anything.<eos> I bet she could help find Project Utopia.<eos> Can you contact her?<eos> I have her number on my phone.<eos> Let me go get it.
But he's lost his way.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> I bought a car here right before you were born.<eos> Pontiac Catalina.<eos> Paid $300 for it.
I want you to read my script.<eos> The one from this morning?<eos> No. No, another one.<eos> I've been trying to get it made for years.<eos> Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.
- Are you kidding me?<eos> - Princess Eleanor...<eos> The man has a mohawk.<eos> The King of England has a ferret on his head.<eos> He canceled the dedication of my father's monument and then drove his car through it, drunk.
You were not demoted.<eos> From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending?<eos> - It looks like that.<eos> - April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.
I don't know.<eos> Whoa.<eos> We must be right on top of the Talisman piece.<eos> I'm guessing something doesn't want us to get it.<eos> We need a distraction so I can get eyes on it.
I know what you're thinking...<eos> ghost phone.<eos> However, Josh thinks the killer might have it.<eos> Dwayne, I need you to find this phone.<eos> So I've been calling it daily.
H-His name was Kip.<eos> Kip Tully.<eos> We weren't buddies or anything, but I know that he lived in the city, too.<eos> We would both take the train to Mount Pleasant.<eos> We would change into our costumes in the woods and then use it as a shortcut into town, just never on the same night.
- How?<eos> - You wanna know the real trick?<eos> - Fear isn't real.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Fear isn't what's actually happening. It's just your reaction to it.
Ryan drove.<eos> Ryan drove the Mustang.<eos> I followed.<eos> And we were heading north on Ashland, and then just... this minivan came out of nowhere, ran a red light.<eos> Ryan smashed into it, so he bailed.
I guess family is nothing but trouble, right, Scrooge?<eos> Everybody out!<eos> - But we're...<eos> - Out! Well, what are you gaping at?<eos> The curse is only activated if you ring the gong three times and... you already hit it two times, didn't you?
Anyway, besides you just being a good kid, I can tell the respect you carry around.<eos> You sure as hell know how to do your job.<eos> You in line for a promotion soon?<eos> No clue, I just do what they say.<eos> Well, you deserve it.
Impressive.<eos> But I don't see his individualized home instruction plan.<eos> I made some changes to it this morning.<eos> It's in the bedroom.<eos> I'll go get it.
- Vivica something.<eos> You got a couple of properties with code violations.<eos> I fixed all those.<eos> And the house from this morning was 100% up to code.<eos> Yeah, except you took out extra insurance on it two months ago.
Thank you.<eos> Okay, fine. Have it your way, but you're doing it without me.<eos> David: She gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah. She just needs to cool off.<eos> In the meantime, why don't I take that piece of wand back to my vault, see if I can cast a locator spell on it.
How are you gonna deal with Withrow?<eos> Diana's never gonna put him on the stand.<eos> That would be a bad move.<eos> What even is her strategy?<eos> Find a large bus, throw a Withrow employee underneath it, and then your problem is solved.
Are you hurt?<eos> Do you need help?<eos> I broke my bike.<eos> It was my birthday present, and I broke it.<eos> They can't afford it, but they knew how much I wanted it.
Nah, I'm only kidding.<eos> I'm in construction. Oh...<eos> Still, I thought it'd be better you know, for the photos in the media, you know, of you with Clay's bat, rather than with me, if you know what I mean.<eos> Still, I did say that I would buy it, so listen, ah, there's 10 there... you keep two for yourself, all right?<eos> Yeah, I'll come pick it up in a couple of weeks, after all the photos.
We could go through the whole thing.<eos> I can bounce your head off the floor like a fucking bowling ball.<eos> But let's just make it easy.<eos> Put yourself on that train, Gary l.<eos> Or we're gonna have to put you under it.
It's freezing.<eos> I'd loan you my coat, but someone forgot to return it.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Shall I pop in and grab it?
It was amazing.<eos> I love him so much.<eos> I love him so much.<eos> The Pacific ocean was larger and more inspiring than Karen had ever imagined.<eos> Looking upon it, she thought of all the countless waves which had crashed along the beach throughout history.
Well, okay, that's quite the gesture.<eos> Yeah, we'll keep it off the floor.<eos> Nice car.<eos> What happened here?<eos> That car was dead when we got it, someone gutted the engine completely,
The film is in the projector. Repeat, it's in the projector.<eos> But we already checked that.<eos> - Spliced in.<eos> - What?<eos> It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film.
He even gave me this ring.<eos> I call it my magic ring.<eos> It's not an engagement ring but I just know that he's gonna pop the question soon.<eos> - When we first came here I showed you my engagement ring, remember?<eos> I can barely stand to look at it anymore.
It's gonna sound like bad news at first, but I promise you it's good news in the end.<eos> I'm leaving the agency, and I'm moving over to Universal to be VP of production.<eos> I feel super sad about leaving you, but it's gonna be so much better for you in the end because I'll be in a much stronger position to help move your projects forward.<eos> Have you gotten to read my script yet?<eos> No, but I wanted to be totally focused on where I was first instead of giving it a sloppy read while I'm in the middle of a major job switch and the phone is ringing off the hook and I've got, like, 5,000 e-mails
♪ ♪ - What is happening?<eos> - I'm defusing the situation.<eos> dancing captain. Must capture image of a lifetime!<eos> Oh, why is my phone always dead?<eos> I paid $13 for it.
You think you work hard?<eos> Try scraping Chubby Checker's vomit off the inside of a toilet stall.<eos> By the time it's the early '60s, I get to start my own record company. Then I built that company into a record label.<eos> I had a golden ear, a silver tongue, and a pair of brass balls.<eos> But the problem became my nose and everything I put up it.
Bresson's phone.<eos> You've found it?<eos> No, but something interesting.<eos> We got its serial number from the online registration and the store where it was bought.<eos> Eryka Klein bought it on her credit card.
You just hit my car. You talking to me?<eos> Check out Mr. Magoo here.<eos> Yes, sir. You see that car that you parked your piece of shit next to?<eos> That's mine.<eos> You just ran into it.
- His kids have been out to play on our land.<eos> - I guess I trust him alright.<eos> Can't always see the numbers.<eos> Well.. I guess I'll give you that sandstone.<eos> - We'd wanna pay you for it.
I've got starboard watch below, caulkingthegunports.<eos> The pumps are keeping up with the water-line, but given what's ahead of us, I don't imagine that'll last long.<eos> Heave,lads!<eos> He'll be withdrawing soon.<eos> He'll drive us into the storm, but he'll want no part of it himself.
So, once again, he is able to conjure the reality he desires just as it was in Charlestown. And just as it was in that storm.<eos> There is no denying a man with that kind of power.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're saying Flint conjured that storm?<eos> He conjured us into it.
If I'm the mole, I must have a wire.<eos> Here.<eos> Check my purse.<eos> There's a gun.<eos> Notice I didn't reach for it.
We regret a lot of things as we head on forward.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My mother wasn't sick.<eos> When I turned 19 I got some money together and I bought my first car.<eos> An old wreck, you know, but I worked for it and paid for it myself, without anyone's help.
Welcome to Smart Phones Is Us.<eos> How may I help?<eos> I'm wondering if I can ask you some questions.<eos> Mm-hmm?<eos> I think maybe my phone isn't working right, 'cause guys don't send me pictures of their junk on it.
Jean?<eos> Chris.<eos> I'm gonna get an establishing of the trailer.<eos> - You wanna check frame? - No.<eos> We don't need it, we need to shoot this guy.
If you don't tell me where Reese is, I'm gonna do more than just point.<eos> Don't know, don't care, but I can't let you leave with that hard drive.<eos> Why?<eos> What's on it?<eos> All I know is it's dangerous, and my boss is paying good money for it.
Vanessa.<eos> And where is she?<eos> When did we lose her, Ethan?<eos> She was standing in a quiet room, gazing up at a cross.<eos> She reached out, took it from the wall... and put it in the fire.
For the next two days I'm gonna unshackle the house from the world.<eos> You mustn't leave the circle.<eos> No food, no water.<eos> Focus on the stones I've given you.<eos> Fall into it.
A decision is awaited.<eos> It's been proven that... the only game that counts in India is cricket.<eos> Indian fans have smacked down this wrestling league... and it's safe to say that this sports franchise... has seen its last days.<eos> I'm sorry for your losses... and I take full responsibility.<eos> I know Pro Take-Down was my brainchild... but each one of you believed in it.
Now, shut your eyes and listen to the gramophone.<eos> Do you hear the stylus cutting into the wax?<eos> Yes.<eos> Concentrate on that sound and nothing else.<eos> Listen to it.
Can't you tell by all my colorful Post-it notes?<eos> So, you're giving up.<eos> You know, when I wanted the show back, you fought me tooth and nail, but now that it's a little weirdo and dick for brains, you're just gonna hand it over to them?<eos> This show is our baby.<eos> We got to fight for it.
Lydia, please shut up and let me save your life.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Gonna ram the wall.<eos> Gonna ram it with my car.<eos> Just smash through it.
Take your time.<eos> We already paid you.<eos> I gave you all of my money for that drop fee.<eos> Yeah, and i dropped it, all right?<eos> Now i'm picking it up again.
Enough is enough!<eos> That's your son-in-law!<eos> And my husband! I know how families work, Lois.<eos> All right.<eos> Yay! Lois, how much was your flight and which card did you put it on?
Next thing I know, some guy phones me, says the debt's been sold on and that all I have to do to cancel it, is steal a car.<eos> They told me where to leave it, and where to pick it up again.<eos> It took longer than they said.<eos> When I did eventually pick it up again... ..the gun was on the back-seat.<eos> I thought they'd come back for it.
One, two...<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Mr. Kim Woo-Jin?<eos> I'm Kim Woo-Jin.<eos> I've come across a precious object, would you take a look at it?
Now!<eos> - Spoons.<eos> - Where's the TV?<eos> What the hell do we need a TV for?<eos> Go and get it.
- Absolutely.<eos> Let me just, uh...<eos> Oh. Dearie me.<eos> I seem to have left it in the car.<eos> Detective, would you mind going to fetch it, please?
Astra played us.<eos> Jimmy Olsen, intrepid photographer.<eos> I just didn't realize how intrepid.<eos> My security system isn't state of the art, it is the art.<eos> Who helped you get past it?
There you are.<eos> - You shouldn't have bothered.<eos> Just breathe. The drug will take her soon.<eos> Narcan. Heroin antidote.<eos> All the agents looking for you have it.
It's about time.<eos> It's throbbing like crazy.<eos> All right. Well, sit down, and we'll get started.<eos> I thought you liked pain.<eos> Only when I ask for it.
Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.<eos> If you want your hat, Sheriff... you're gonna have to come and get it.
You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!<eos> He came into our office, and I specifically remember him looking at it and saying "huh."
You've seen the King's condition.<eos> Why did you not inform me?<eos> - There has to be peace.<eos> - Yes, there does.<eos> But it is not your place to ask for it.
I'm not more than a few minutes old and my mother is already dead, her forehead slick with sweat, and cool with the pallor of icebox butter.<eos> I am tied to my mother's body by a terrible rope that is a shiny, twisted midnight blue-black.<eos> The doctor is holding me up to the light.<eos> But now I am dead.<eos> And yes, I left the world just as I came into it.
Let's... let's do this.<eos> So, look at the vent.<eos> Okay, pick a spot and focus on it, and see if you can melt it.<eos> And a bird hit me when I was flying.<eos> No, you... you hit it.
They get mean and take everything away, I know.<eos> Essentially, yeah.<eos> They have their reasons.<eos> But that's what happened to the manuscript.<eos> For some reason, I didn't deserve it.
Stop, Schmidt.<eos> Hey, we got you a little gift, yeah?<eos> - You didn't have to do that. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, I left it outside in the hall.<eos> Well, go get it, you moron.
- Help me!<eos> - Oh, you'll be fine!<eos> The ship will have blown up long before you've been strangled to death!<eos> - And what's plan B? !<eos> - I have no idea, but it's going to be a very big relief when I think of it.
Fuck.<eos> That's it.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - What?<eos> The hard drive has been damaged, like I said, like some kind of waves passing through it.
I'm saying that someday you're going to face the character and fitness committee of the Bar, and I seriously doubt they're going to admit somebody who did that.<eos> Are you trying to intimidate a witness?<eos> Because yes, someday I will face that committee, but tomorrow they're going to be hearing about you.<eos> I'm your only way out of this mess.<eos> Just give me the people who are actually responsible for it, and I'll see to it that both you and Mike can practice law for the rest of your lives.
I know I can do it again.<eos> I want to stop him, Harry, for good.<eos> So let's go over the plan again.<eos> Okay, Caitlin will distract Jay so that you and Harry can hit him with the boot.<eos> Cisco's gonna open the breach, and we're gonna put him through it.
What do I do?<eos> Die... in a fart... Brown cow.<eos> What?<eos> Yowsers. Blunt.<eos> God, it's like we climbed into it.
I think there's another full bottle in here. Maybe it'll be okay.<eos> Candy?<eos> Where's your trivia genie costume?<eos> In my car.<eos> Get it.
Hey, what is going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know I was the walking dead until I tried to go through customs.<eos> Where'd you get this passport, sir?<eos> I applied for it.
She broke your heart, I get it, but just because she did, doesn't mean that Fiona will, too.<eos> Sorry... I have to go prep a deposition, but you can keep all of this.<eos> I'll let you know if I find anything else.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> She has a nice butt, okay. You don't have to stare at it.
Sorry.<eos> She had a pretty bad accident.<eos> Her collarbone might be broken.<eos> - Mm. - So, I mean, how did it happen?<eos> A car stopped short, I hit it, and Supermanned over the handlebars.
He even charged one convent 50 Florins on a loan for a new hall to provide meals for the poor.<eos> Third!<eos> Tyranny.<eos> Cosimo de' Medici has great wealth.<eos> And with it, has bought power.
A future filled with friends and family.<eos> You'd even be there.<eos> The world I've always wanted.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I would like very much to fight for it.
I'm having a dream.<eos> We're all at a Temptations concert.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's funny.<eos> You joke, but there's a very sad story that goes with this suit. Oh, I bet.<eos> If you paid money for it, it's definitely a sad story.
What are you gonna do?<eos> Be a distraction.<eos> Hey, Gared, this is Pree's place.<eos> But I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll fight you for it.
Your children are at serious risk.<eos> We feel vaccinations pose a serious risk as well.<eos> That is not true.<eos> Doctors are about intervention. I get it.<eos> But left alone, the body has a perfectly good immune system, and once you start injecting it with foreign proteins and preservatives, you can't help but change that.
Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna get you home, okay?<eos> Hold it.<eos> If you know where my product is, go get it right now.
He has friends in jail.<eos> Why am i not surprised?<eos> -So, this -- this tourist, This guy who just came up to you on the street, You invited him up to your grandmother's house<eos> And sold him her revolver?<eos> No. I had him wait, and i went back for it.
a little bit of success Can bring out the worst in other people.<eos> "just a small bit of good fortune really can alter Even the best of relationships in ways they can't survive."<eos> Bit of a philosopher, your hitman.<eos> Well, i have to admit, captain, this is truly a great exclusive.<eos> Well, you earned it, peter.
We got addresses, shipment dates, kilo amounts, two of the locations are just outside of Juárez.<eos> We had heard rumors that Epifanio has stash houses in that area.<eos> Well, we sent the addresses to our people to check them out. I mean, we'll know soon enough.<eos> You said she has an entire book.<eos> What does she want for it?
Did you only hire me so I'd help your investigation into Annalise?<eos> So you do still talk to her. So it is true?<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> This office is not investigating Annalise Keating.<eos> And why I helped you get this job is because you deserve it.
Feels bad about the D.C. blowback on us.<eos> Maybe she just needs more time.<eos> Right now, case is all that matters.<eos> Get on that surveillance footage, will ya?<eos> I'm on it.
Well, I can't find a reference of it anywhere.<eos> Like, none.<eos> Historically speaking, this doesn't exist.<eos> Well, this is right in front of us, so I'd say it does exist.<eos> And we know that Damien Darhk and the Speedster are willing to kill for it.
When I last left 2016, that young woman did not exist.<eos> I do not want to lose my daughter.<eos> This amulet looks a lot like the one we recovered off the Nazis.<eos> - There's gotta be a connection.<eos> - And we know that Damien Darhk and the speedster are willing to kill for it.
How am I supposed to pay any bills when you froze our assets?<eos> Stef: Honey.<eos> You can keep dragging me back to this house, but it's not getting cheaper.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> (sighs) We can't afford it, Lena.
You talk about what a great president you are, and yet you whined and cried about how much you hate the job every chance you got.<eos> Do those people out there who love you know how many times you tried to walk off the gig?<eos> How privileged and entitled do you have to be to think of the most powerful office in the world as a prison?<eos> Unlike you, Fitz, I want this.<eos> Unlike you... I earned it.
- Looked great.<eos> - Do you know how much it cost?<eos> Well...<eos> Bruno did steal the car for you to rebirth, Rachel... so, I mean, technically... it cost... nothin'.<eos> We'd sold it for 20 grand. Oh!
I think about one waterfall.<eos> Always the same one.<eos> Describe it.<eos> It's about 50-feet high, it splits into three streams.<eos> People can walk behind it.
Let's put 'em back where they belong.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> - All right, I'll see you.<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> Yeah, um, I got this phone, it's new. I want to see how much I could get for it.
You know, I watched a lot of kung fu movies, kind of all up in here "Matrix" style.<eos> Ah. Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> Training starts tomorrow.<eos> Yup, sounds good.<eos> Choose your target, keep your eyes locked on it, and then throw.
I know I was supposed to wait until the actual George Washington statue turned pink, but it was taking so long.<eos> Get in here.<eos> So how was pledge week?<eos> 'Cause the vibe downstairs is kind of weird.<eos> I was looking forward to it so much, but I just... it wasn't like how I remembered.
- Um... But at number one... is 880 people using it on someone called Clara Meades.<eos> - Who's she?<eos> - Clara Meades.<eos> Okay, um... it looks like she was at a demo, and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial.<eos> - Pretending to piss on it.
- Me?<eos> Jacob, your casino might not be in my town, but it is not lost on me the importance it has on the economy of this county.<eos> So, what are you offering me?<eos> You get right to the point.<eos> When dealing with the big chiefs of the white men, I've learned it's best to cut through the bullshit early, or you're likely to drown in it.
We needed them for our...<eos> Urine tests.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> You peed on my catch phrase?<eos> I don't know what's funnier-- you got a catch phrase or that we peed on it.
Ebony?<eos> Don't even get me started on ebony.<eos> When I see ebony, all I want to do is put my hands all over it.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - I want to live in it. I want to smack it and hit it, rub it down. I just want to eat it.
Tyler... he wanted a little bit bigger cut, right?<eos> So you take a baseball bat... crack him in the head with it.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hey, Officer, do you mind if I grab my wallet?<eos> I don't want you, you know, shooting me as I reach for it, so...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Dennis...<eos> Fucking phone is gone.<eos> You dropped it in the urinal last night. How the fuck did that happen?<eos> Uh, you said "fuck this phone" and then you dropped it in the urinal, and then you took a piss on it.
Then, a year later mom visited me in Goa... with my new baby brother, Kiddo<eos> I was jealous<eos> Because he got to be with mom all the time, and not me then mom said that I would be away from them for 'just a little longer'<eos> so I was still fine with it...<eos> I remember asking my mom if she got my last letter she said that it was so beautiful that she put it up on the refridgerator... so that she could see it every day
You own this place, right?<eos> Used to.<eos> Banks own most of it, now.<eos> Beth and I bought it when we got married.<eos> Spent most of my inheritance on it, fixing the place up, and now, ten years later, everything's out of date again.
The good ones are hand-cut in Mexico.<eos> That was a good one.<eos> She'd asked me to talk to John, try and help change his mind.<eos> And how'd she get your cellphone number?<eos> She'd asked me for it when they were dating.
Can you help me with that?<eos> _<eos> Sure. I'd be happy to.<eos> I'm buying a yacht.<eos> And, uh... I would love to take you on it.
You know this area!<eos> So, help me navigate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Right after I get my birthday cake.<eos> I'll get it.
What smoke?<eos> That massive ball of smoke in front of us, up front.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> My hay fever's really bad.<eos> No, you can't see it because you're trying to looking at it through a cow's butt hole.
- No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Temperatures and pressures.<eos> This is a racing machine.<eos> Look at it.
It can drive them to break.<eos> Did they teach you this type of thing at Quantico?<eos> No.<eos> I only got to experience it in the real world.<eos> Extreme temperatures can push someone to the brink, then past it.
AwayKay carries insurance for just such situations.<eos> Guests we paired you with did all this damage, so we'll cover all the costs.<eos> Really? You see this rug?<eos> It's an antique.<eos> Are they gonna give me 50 grand for it?
Now...<eos> Billie Carter.<eos> Have you given a statement to the police already?<eos> - Yes. - Is that your signature?<eos> So, in here, you say that you knew the value of the item was over $900... and you knew you hadn't paid for it.
If anything, the security measures here are even more daunting.<eos> It's likely this is a bizarre ruse, designed to provoke precisely the actions that you've taken.<eos> I guess it's possible, but we don't really have a choice about how to respond.<eos> It doesn't matter whether the attack is real or fake.<eos> What matters is the public believes it's real.
Sir, time for medicine.<eos> Three times a day, i'm tired of these pills.<eos> All I want to know is who killed my father. Same here.<eos> That fire took too many lives.<eos> My team was dismissed because of it, we have to crack this case.
What?<eos> What are you talking about? You only watch what you eat when you're afraid you might have to take your shirt off.<eos> No, she's right.<eos> As long as I've known you, you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.<eos> It's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
Jack made my life hell while I was working with him.<eos> The way he looked at me, the-the things he would say.<eos> I wanted to make sure that he could never do that to anyone again.<eos> I was going up against a company, they had deep pockets, I needed help.<eos> If you think that he was really set up by somebody who could profit from that lawsuit, you should talk to the people that actually paid for it.
Stay in your lane, bucko.<eos> Right, Santiago?<eos> The arch sucks!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss and you were so excited, but the truth is every time I look at it I wanna die and take you with me.
Now we have to stop on every floor. ( Maniacal laughter )<eos> Sean.<eos> ( panting ) Hey, Star, check it out.<eos> I'm getting my first chest hair.<eos> It's pretty small, but if you look at it in just the right light...
- Hey. - Hey. I just talked to Crawford from organized crime.<eos> Apparently, the gals skepu are major gun-runners on the east coast.<eos> Their leader's got an office in the back.<eos> Also, great chest hair.<eos> Ah, Genevieve calls it "the plume of Boyle."
I finally judged humans' expiry date is over.<eos> If we put up with it again, I felt every conscious creature will be gone in our solar system.<eos> That makes two of us, right?<eos> I carefully picked a wandering asteroid and modified its orbit.<eos> There were quite a lot of humans who stupidly longed for the gift and prayed for it.
Throw it!<eos> Do it!<eos> Now!<eos> Throw the lance!<eos> Why didn't you throw it?
We're not perfect, I mean, we have our differences and our disagreements.<eos> I love motorcycles and she hates them.<eos> Our house isn't fancy.<eos> But it was a labor of love.<eos> You know, working on it and renovating it and Laurel put a lot of thought into every detail, you know, the light fixtures and the tile.
It sounds kind of innocuous, but then I digged...<eos> - Elizabeth.<eos> Elizabeth. - Wait.<eos> The symbol in the living room...<eos> It's called "The seal of the Left Hand Path."
I'm sure as shit not gonna pull the trigger myself.<eos> This is yours.<eos> You get to decide what happens.<eos> In two days, I'm gonna start the machine, and I'm gonna open the wormhole.<eos> But it's now up to you what goes through it.
But they're not common criminals.<eos> They just don't see themselves that way.<eos> They've taken Ozaki's ideas to the extreme.<eos> They think they're crusaders with a worthy cause.<eos> They're more than willing to die for it.
Invent the Edsel twice, you don't get any more drawing boards.<eos> Tell me what the plan is.<eos> You have to tell me the plan, because I don't know.<eos> You're walking around like you've got "can't lose" cards.<eos> The plan will reveal itself to you when you're ready to see it.
- Do you like it?<eos> - Of course I like it, its beautiful.<eos> But I have a car...<eos> Where's my car?<eos> I told Taylor to fetch a decent price for it.
And the only reason that they would do that... is if you have something that they want.<eos> So, I've been trying to think about what that could be, and the only thing I've come up with... is the Union Allied pension file.<eos> Did you keep the file, Karen?<eos> No.<eos> As soon as I asked my boss about it, he took it away from me.
You can't just come here and say the same thing every meeting.<eos> Those lovely creatures deserve a state-of-the-art facility.<eos> Sorry, gentlemen, I'm gonna stop you right there.<eos> The first thing that I explored when I came to town was a whale watching centre.<eos> There's no place for it.
No reb, I ain't never heard of it!<eos> You bust out?<eos> Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.<eos> Maj. Marquis had a bright idea.<eos> So bright... You got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before.
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.<eos> You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man?<eos> Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.<eos> Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John, a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me.<eos> - I might let a whore piss on it.
But I have to do these sort of things now.<eos> Makes me seem more human.<eos> And you have to be a little human when you're the president.<eos> He couldn't even afford to pay for his own gravestone.<eos> I paid for it out of my own scholarship money from The Sentinel.
I'm sorry.<eos> Please do not be frightened.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ~ Where does he keep his rum?<eos> ~ Has he sent you for it?
Yeah, he was.<eos> He's crazy.<eos> I'm just doing some chores in the barn. I'll be in in a minute.<eos> Something happened to your computer.<eos> I spilled some biscuit batter on it. I tried to clean it with cleaner.
Avoid the common passage it would take us through and the temptation to hunt a prize.<eos> You spoke to Flint?<eos> He approached me.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Why attempt to scuttle the idea before any of us have even arrived at it?
I'm sorry.<eos> I think I forgot the pesto.<eos> Will I still be able to write?<eos> Shall we look at your scan?<eos> I've been looking at it.
Big Head!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry, guys. Hooli phone?<eos> I didn't even know the ringer was on.<eos> No one's ever actually called it before.
He got busted on the way, put the loot in my tank because my car was at your place that night.<eos> Stupid hiding place.<eos> True.<eos> Why didn't he just bury them at a construction site?<eos> Whoa, mate, what'd you fill it with?
Er, no.<eos> "My dearest Ned.<eos> "It pains my heart to say it to you, my love, but..."<eos> But what?<eos> ".. but I have spoiled our wedding china "by spilling a pan of jam upon it."
Bajirao Mastani<eos> Mapping out your meeting with the Nizam?<eos> Ensure you wear this when you go.<eos> Bajirao, this ring has cost us dearly.<eos> We have paid for it twice.
I hope you are learning politics from the king.<eos> Yes.<eos> I wish you learnt some politics as well, Mother.<eos> Meaning?<eos> The man for whom you hold this flame, doesn't deserve it.
She knows what I am.<eos> So she has to die.<eos> Two club sandwiches... extra bacon, fries, with a side of fries, and a chocolate milkshake.<eos> How was your second lunch?<eos> Well, I think I earned it.
Yeah, well, in this job, you've got to be ready for anything.<eos> Women's washroom is down the hall.<eos> You've got to leave your sample in the collection box.<eos> Where's the suit?<eos> I spilled coffee on it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> See you, bye.<eos> Gave it to the taxidermist.<eos> Vincent, when livestocks die, we're supposed to dispose of them.<eos> But Tavrani asked for it.
I want to make it clear--he's not.<eos> You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.<eos> So grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain.<eos> Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene.<eos> Look at it under your telescope.
Ooh, a brand-new camera for a perfect shot of the moment I reunite with Bobby.<eos> I am counting on you-- [ Cellphone chimes ] [ Gasps ] Oh!<eos> It's time!<eos> It's good to be back.<eos> I love playing golf, but I don't love going halfway around the world to play it.
Babe!<eos> What's up?<eos> Dinner!<eos> Dude, you need to get her a real ring.<eos> Yeah, no, definitely. I just, um... I mean, she can't have it in prison, though, 'cause she'll get, you know, shanked for it.
It'll take an hour... tops.<eos> We'll be right back on track.<eos> What is up with you right now?<eos> I mean, usually, it's me who's overenthused about terrible situations.<eos> Every goal is sweeter when you have to work for it, McNally.
Did you get everything?<eos> There's more in the car, but he kept the PC.<eos> He said that's not yours, that's the house computer.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> What's a house computer? I paid for it.
Excuse me...<eos> Sorry, we're a little lost and, er, we had an accident.<eos> So, have you got a telephone that we can use?<eos> What do the Swiss call a telephone?<eos> They call it a telephone.
Why didn't you say anything?<eos> It's the element of surprise.<eos> That's kind of the point, isn't it?<eos> It's in my glove compartment.<eos> I can go get it if you want.
No. But I'll learn.<eos> And it will be my children's home.<eos> They will belong there.<eos> You should search for your own home, too, one day.<eos> You're looking at it.
- Money?<eos> - Money that she stole from me.<eos> Oh, that money. What a shame.<eos> I was told the horse was a dead cert.<eos> Put the lot on it.
- You gonna do something?<eos> All right. Fine, Kevin.<eos> No more fucking talk. No more fucking talk.<eos> He made a big mistake.<eos> And now we're all paying for it.
Are you leaving already?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'll come by tomorrow.<eos> Mom, the cake?<eos> You didn't even taste it. I went all the way to the Kosher shop to get it.
Let's be honest. These are a little douchey.<eos> How long is this sentence of yours?<eos> When do you get your license back?<eos> Three months, and the hospital could be gone by then.<eos> Oh, I heard there's this activist nurse who's fighting to keep it open.
You're going home right now.<eos> Father, may I have my penny back now?<eos> I'll keep hold of it until this matter is settled.<eos> But it wasn't my fault!<eos> I was reaching for it first.
I was sent out to buy more champagne.<eos> I still don't know why Miss Heloise wasn't modelling it.<eos> It was custom-made for her.<eos> It fit her like a glove just the day before.<eos> She didn't model the corset because she was too fat to fit into it.
Good day, Miss Tennant.<eos> I wonder...<eos> Do you recall exactly why Miss Heloise chose not to model that corset?<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> Nicolette tried her best but she just couldn't squeeze Miss Heloise into it.
Anyway, he's going on tour for a while.<eos> So I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing.<eos> - You figure out tuition?<eos> - No. No, I got an idea, though.<eos> Is it an idea that could land you in jail?
Yes.<eos> See, the cross is blood-stained, painful.<eos> It loves and forgives and demands.<eos> But what does it demand?<eos> That we profess it to this dark world.
You know where else is real nice?<eos> Portland.<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> I grew up here.<eos> This property's all I got, and I put a lot of work into it.
It will never work.<eos> Romans don't build for nothing.<eos> And what about that stone wall?<eos> Doesn't makes any sense.<eos> We can climb over it.
- Trimingham says he's got your prayer book. - Oh!<eos> - You left it behind.<eos> How careless of me.<eos> Please thank him.<eos> Why don't you go back and get it?
Oh, 'cause that's just... [Laughing] I mean, that's a little too forward for me.<eos> Yeah, no, no, April's literally never asked a man out in her entire life.<eos> That may be true, but you don't get anything in this life without going after what you want.<eos> You didn't wait around for someone to offer you this fabulous store.<eos> I'm sure you had to fight tooth and nail to have it.
It's the least guarded entrance.<eos> Well, someone's gotta at least take out the guys guarding it.<eos> All right.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Get it out of your system.
Yeah, me too.<eos> I could go for Newman's.<eos> No!<eos> No...<eos> I hate this whole "whoever chooses lunch, pays for it" thing.
Nonsense.<eos> Why would the gods care anything for our truth?<eos> No...<eos> This must have something to do with the ring.<eos> May I take another look at it?
- Exactly. No more.<eos> No más.<eos> I made a decision.<eos> He's gonna focus on his work, I'm gonna focus on mine.<eos> If I want to get this draft of my book done before the baby comes, I need to get on it.
The best way to do it is from the safety of your own home.<eos> All you have to do is "spear phish" him-- a socially engineered attack.<eos> Send Evan an e-mail with a fake link from his bank or something, wait for him to click on it, and then boom!<eos> Full access to his laptop and any device that connects to it, like his phone!<eos> Okay, so how you know he's gonna click on it? And when?
Must be nice.<eos> You should come, dude.<eos> Thanks, man, but no, I don't think I can.<eos> My dad's all over me right now for failing these two classes.<eos> Says I got to make up the semester, I got pay for it myself.
I should read it then.<eos> You should.<eos> My copy is in the barn at the old house.<eos> We set up a bit of a playhouse there.<eos> Come with me. We'll fetch it.
They just go along blindly ruining the lives of everyone in their path.<eos> I'm sick of pretending it doesn't matter.<eos> How long have you been in business?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I want to know that if I write you a check, you'll stick around long enough to earn it.

You sure we can trust him?<eos> Positive.<eos> The crocodile truly has changed.<eos> He gave me a long-winded explanation about a portal.<eos> About how it brought the, uh Snow Queen into this land... which I don't recall.

I'm calling the cops.<eos> It's about your son.<eos> What do you know about my son?<eos> Look at your computer.<eos> Look at it.
_<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. How you doing?<eos> You're getting suspicious with this electronic device in your face, huh?<eos> Staring right at it. What... What do you see in there?
It's all good.<eos> You have an understanding with a 24-year-old defensive lineman, Spence.<eos> That's not something we can bank on.<eos> If we're gonna bring this to Anderson and prove to him that you belong here, he needs to see a fucking authorization form.<eos> Now go get it.
Look, I know I'm the new guy in town.<eos> I get that. But I've been wearing 18 since day one.<eos> It ain't day one for you no more, is it?<eos> - No, it isn't. - Hmm.<eos> - How much you want for it? - What I want for what?
- Louisville. - Mm.<eos> Lot of hipsters out that way, huh?<eos> Yeah, we got a lot where I'm from, too.<eos> I guess that's how it is nowadays, huh?<eos> How much you pay for it?
- empty subtitle empty subtitle - What's happening to me?<eos> Why am I so...<eos> G-g-g-give me my jade!<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I guess superstition is real if you believe in it.
where's the turkey?<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Shit, I knew we forgot something.<eos> I'll go get it right now.
Slow.<eos> Steady now.<eos> - Go there. - Hmm?<eos> Against that post.<eos> Put your hands on it.
Scientology loves to use this word "end phenomena."<eos> Every level has an end phenomena, you know, that you attain, and tom cruise shows that.<eos> That video with him in the black turtleneck sweater?<eos> A scientologist is someone who can look at the world and really see what it is.<eos> Not only look at it and see it, but be able to go, poof, and be effective, and do something about it.
Good looking out.<eos> I mean, how'd this girl get my number anyways, man?<eos> - I gave it to her.<eos> - What the fuck you do that for?<eos> - She asked for it after you split.
Therefore, effective immediately, I am suspended from duty.<eos> You gave a full report of our investigation<eos> - to the Governor's office?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They requested it last night, and I sent it over.
Language.<eos> - Well, how long you out for?<eos> - The estimate says two days, which probably means four.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> Go back up and get it, please.
We got to go.<eos> Humanichs are on the way.<eos> Evacuation tunnels down the hall.<eos> Look for a panel by the heating vent.<eos> Take this phone, only I can call it, and I will.
But DHS agrees with your assessment this is an act of terrorism.<eos> POTUS has given us the go-ahead to raise the NTAS Alert level to Imminent Threat.<eos> So, Doctor, what do we know about this virus?<eos> It's a mutated strain of the avian flu.<eos> About six weeks ago, a farmer in the Davao region of the Philippines came down with it.
You see, there's a very big price for me back East.<eos> I give you my word, I can get you in and out of the city in 72 hours.<eos> Yeah. You know something?<eos> There is nothing that I want more than a decent plate of pasta.<eos> But I ain't gonna die for it.
Okay, wait, just...<eos> see for yourself.<eos> Every file, every crime that he has committed is on this drive.<eos> Please, just...<eos> just look at it.
I've been drinking to try to forget.<eos> But it only helps until morning.<eos> I love my country.<eos> You understand?<eos> I really wanted to fight for it.
Until I moved on to the furnace.<eos> Uh, Andie's grandmother left her a clock, and I, uh... I want to get it fixed for her.<eos> Aw, so she can see how wonderful you are.<eos> That's sweet. Yeah.<eos> The jewelers, they won't even open it for less than 500 bucks.
- Oh! Just a what?<eos> Say it!<eos> - [gasps] You!<eos> Hey, I'm the one who fronted us that dollar to get her name tag.<eos> Thanks to me, someone's gonna pick her up, look at it, and say, "Oh, you must be lost, little... cat."
And by ordnance, you mean...<eos> Dynamite, TNT, mercury fulminate.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, it's unstable as hell.<eos> You breathe on it wrong and they'll be scraping up what's left of you.
Try to test my strength and I fought with all my might?<eos> ?<eos> Took a page out this chapter, just to reconcile my life?<eos> ?<eos> You hate that Lucious going through it?
It's gonna be okay.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> I found this necklace.<eos> It was Lucy's.<eos> I remember asking her about it, 'cause it's got this thumbprint on it.
Kutzler was new to the command, reported there five months ago.<eos> Prior to that, he spent 18 months at Walter Reed, recovering from injuries sustained in Afghanistan.<eos> Click the thing. Kutzler's Seabees unit was on a humanitarian mission in the Punjab Province when they were ambushed.<eos> And while they were pinned down waiting for air support, an enemy grenade penetrated their ranks.<eos> Kutzler threw himself over it, saving the lives of two of his men.
Yeah, it doesn't have to be.<eos> If it's really love, you do everything you need to do to get back what you once had.<eos> You're talking about the painting, right?<eos> Of course I am 'cause we don't owe him that anymore.<eos> - Go get it! - Okay. Go get it.
- Yes, you are.<eos> What is the option?<eos> - Admit the facts.<eos> Don't look away from the aborted fetus.<eos> Look at it.
You could've brought the screwdriver.<eos> You had it last.<eos> Would you like to go get the screwdriver?<eos> No.<eos> Would you like me to get it?
My mirror's dropping out.<eos> Eat my dust, Chevrolet!<eos> Oh, my God, no!<eos> The hearse is mighty.<eos> Look at it go!
No danger of that.<eos> Right.<eos> I guess I meant to say I didn't want you to drive off.<eos> Anyway, I got to thinking that this cross was a little too close to the road.<eos> I was afraid somebody might knock it down.
I know where it leads once it be opened.<eos> Satan himself waits to torture me for eternity.<eos> Now, what has convinced your mind of such a thing?<eos> Isaac the Fornicator.<eos> Many years have passed, but a sin is a sin, and I am doomed to pay for it.
Mr. Fife should make himself comfortable.<eos> So don't you want Diane here and not me?<eos> No.<eos> This is the feed tube from Carsten Pope's printer.<eos> - Look through it. - Sure.
Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna go train now.<eos> I tell my guys to identify their fear.<eos> Seek it out.<eos> Run straight through it.
Listen, which one of you is sleeping with the model?<eos> I know one of you said you were, but I don't listen when you talk.<eos> [muffled] She is.<eos> This is a massive ad campaign, and I don't know how else to say this, but I need his penis to look bigger.<eos> It gets nervous when you shine a light on it.
Thank you.<eos> And? I think Dr. Dix put a dent in her denial.<eos> She wants to go to rehab.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> Says she can't afford it.
This brothel is independence.<eos> Income.<eos> And that is safety in a very unsafe world.<eos> What if we take this money and invest it in the business?<eos> If there's one thing you can count on, year after year, it's that men want sex and they'll pay for it.
Guard!<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Did you or didn't you steal the inhaler?<eos> Your Honour, my daughter is six and she has asthma.<eos> Now by law her inhaler should be free but instead the chemist wanted 80 quid for it.
It is bad. You're gonna have to cauterize it, 'cause my arms are not nearly long enough.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Find a thin piece of metal.<eos> I see a pen.<eos> Okay. Reach for it slowly.
We've talked about Daniel, right?<eos> Yeah, he's the one with the visions, right?<eos> Exactly.<eos> But God didn't just grant him that gift.<eos> He had to work for it.
Bring down the plane?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic, and the threatening texts you sent from this phone.<eos> That is not my phone.<eos> It was in your purse, paid for with your credit card.
You could stay here, if you must.<eos> Something's killing the animals?<eos> I see your pub's called The Black Dog.<eos> Legend round these parts.<eos> We call it Old Shuck.
Her keys, wallet and cell are all still here.<eos> So it wasn't a robbery.<eos> - Any weapon in sight?<eos> - Does the rock count?<eos> She went down, hit her head on it.
'She'll send them to the lawyers.'<eos> 'I believe that if it wasn't for that video game, 'Devin Moore wouldn't have killed those cops.<eos> 'Rockstar Games gave him a cranial menu that popped up 'and offered him the option to kill the police officers, 'shoot them in the head 'and flee in a police car.<eos> 'What we're saying is that Devin Moore, in effect, 'was trained to do what he did.<eos> 'He bought a murder simulator and he played it for hundreds of hours.
- I can't be sure. Uh...<eos> - Look, man, we don't care if you didn't ask for proof of ownership.<eos> Yeah, this was the guy, right here.<eos> Yeah, he brought in the watch.<eos> How much he take for it?
What?<eos> Haven's on the edge of chaos, and you want to throw in the supernatural equivalent of plutonium?<eos> If people knew that Kira was alive, they'd go after her.<eos> We'd never be able to keep the aether a secret.<eos> They would scramble for it hoping that it would be a cure.
The controller crystal.<eos> What makes him think I have it?<eos> He knows that you have it.<eos> The crystal isn't here.<eos> Then go and get it.
Just got back from Tanzania.<eos> Recording the mating cry of the baboon.<eos> Awful bloody things. They throw shit at you.<eos> That's it.<eos> An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless an external force acts upon it.
Walk me through this.<eos> Maybe we've let people assume your client is going into the Witness Protection Program.<eos> You see, Twizz, we hid out where the stashed gun was found last night.<eos> What?<eos> And when Big Hazard went back for it, we surprised him.
Sorry.<eos> Anything else?<eos> The .22-caliber pistol you have registered to your name...<eos> Is it in the house?<eos> May we take a look at it?
~ Is this you or him?<eos> ~ It's mine!<eos> ~ Hello, hello.<eos> ~ Britain's most popular classic.<eos> Look at it.
Where's the computer, Dad?<eos> Did you not hear what I said?<eos> It's gone.<eos> No problem.<eos> Our IT investigators can get into it by the back door.
What's it like? - I did see it.<eos> But I can't really describe what it looked like.<eos> It's more how it felt, which is old and pained, as if it once had great power but lost it.<eos> And the entire planet is a wasteland. How that came to be,<eos> I can't really say, not in any scientific terms, but my sense and certainly Will's heartfelt belief was that the creature is the one responsible ... that it caused the desolation.
I need it to save my kingdom.<eos> You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - If I knew where it was, I wouldn't have sent someone to fetch it for me.
You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - If I knew where it was, I wouldn't have sent someone to fetch it for me.<eos> Who did you send to find it?
Oh, you made it! I wouldn't it for the world!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love your ring.<eos> It was birdperson's grandmother's.<eos> She fought a squirrel for it.
As soon as Maria Ostrov is elected,<eos> Russia will attack Western Ukraine.<eos> There are good people in this country, Dmitri.<eos> People who want peace.<eos> They're working for it every day.
They all believe that this is where people will ascend to Heaven when the day of judgment comes.<eos> They all want it, but they don't want to share it.<eos> FANTHORPE: Temple Mount has been a holy place for many, many generations.<eos> And there are strange religious traditions, rumors, legends of what lies underneath it.<eos> And the idea is, there is something so precious underneath it that God himself intervenes to protect it.
The knife...<eos> I have the cop's knife.<eos> The knife?<eos> This will at least clear your name.<eos> I'll hide it in the exam room, come get it.
What's back there? Let me see!<eos> - It's all right, Garrison.<eos> What about that one in the glasses? - She's kind of hot.<eos> - She's not hot.<eos> She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper 'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Hello, Amy.<eos> It's Sheldon. Yeah, I-I know that we're broken up, but I'm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you'd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock.<eos> Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.
Then he said, "That's wrong, sir.<eos> So I pulled a gun on him... you guys know I do that from time to time.<eos> Then he took the gun, and he put it in his mouth and said, "Pull the trigger, 'cause I would rather be dead than not share this pork product with the people I love."<eos> And as I cocked my gun, he calmly walked over, picked up the three remaining bacons, marched straight out the door and delivered them to you guys, tied up in a bow.<eos> 'Cause when Todd gives you bacon, he puts a bow on it.
Well, then let's just stop right here, okay?<eos> I-I don't want special treatment, but I don't want to get turned into a political football by Guerrero and Potter.<eos> You are my son, but you're also a member of this department.<eos> And we have a whole system set up to prove guilt or innocence.<eos> If we ask other people to trust it, we have to do the same.
She dreamed about the adventures she could have with two red shoes."<eos> The little girl in that story never stops whining about those red shoes, does she?<eos> You wrote the letter.<eos> I hadn't read it since I was 14.<eos> But looking at it now, it's clear those weren't his words.
Look at us, brother and sister, separated from our mum...<eos> Oh, you're so good at that.<eos> Hey, what do you think about inviting Haley and Dylan to the wedding?<eos> I love that idea.<eos> And I love you for having it.
I can't believe it!<eos> Oh, whew! Oh, I'm in pain.<eos> But I'm alive!<eos> That burner phone's in here somewhere.<eos> Keep calling it.
I know it can't be easy on you.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> You are?<eos> Restaurant looks great.<eos> It's gonna be a big success, and you deserve it.
Oh, here he is, right there.<eos> Blue whales only surface for two to three minutes at a time before diving for up to 15 minutes.<eos> It's a narrow window for everything to come together.<eos> There's a bit of tricky maneuvering here for John.<eos> And he's got to try and get the boat ahead of the whale, but not in front of it.
You have something to tell me?<eos> Something you need to know.<eos> There's a part of me always that comes to the show as a fan and in just a few scenes,<eos> I really have a lot of rich material to play.<eos> When I see the pilot, I'm just reminded about all the hard work that went into it, all the mistakes, all the potential.
What is so goddamn important? This "something" that has come up.<eos> There's been a possible hit on Banir.<eos> Over the last year, five requests for deferiprone - which is not too unusual...<eos> - No, it doesn't affect the anemia. It's just the iron deficiency.<eos> Right, but the same source... the man requesting it was Kenyan, but the doctor is in Bucharest University Hospital, a research hospital.
I think a lot of big stuff must have washed through here.<eos> And when the house did, I think that's the tree that finally stopped it.<eos> I just got this really weird feeling, Ryan.<eos> I drew this.<eos> I dreamed this. And now I'm standing in front of it, like I'm the reason it's here.
Let's get you back to bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here you go. Estelle made you some stuffed cabbage for later.<eos> There's this new drug in Paris.<eos> Kessler's lover is flying out to get it.
If anybody has a clue how to get us out of this mess, now would be a good time to speak up.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> The forest is a harsh judge.<eos> It will give everyone adequately..<eos> You need to know how to listen to it.
Or you want just to do this thing?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'll need a painting of the same year.<eos> Same size.<eos> And uh. When I find it. Whatever it cost.
Off, on.<eos> Off, on.<eos> Now, let me put this right under your thigh.<eos> That<eos> That way you can always get to it.
Come on.<eos> I need it.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> So, the heart rate monitor will say if he's in trouble, right?<eos> Yeah, and Dr. Katz is watching it very carefully.
Anyway, uh, be well. Oh!<eos> I heard about Matt LeBlanc getting that big pilot over at NBC.<eos> What?<eos> What? You didn't know?<eos> Supposedly, they're building a whole night around it.
There are far less noble fates, my friend.<eos> Not for me, there aren't!<eos> If there is no Camelot... there is no Guinevere and no Lancelot... then I'm nothing.<eos> I'm just a sad lump of misshapen wax. Stop looking at my nose!<eos> - I wasn't looking at it. - You were, I saw you.
- I wasn't looking at it. - You were, I saw you.<eos> You were like this. "Hmm, hmm." Staring.<eos> - I wasn't like that.<eos> - You were!<eos> Don't look at it!
Your colleagues respect you and what you do.<eos> Oh, I think they do.<eos> I hope so.<eos> And respect's very important.<eos> It takes a lot to earn it and it can go just as fast.
But you can tell because his hair is barely moving.<eos> And if he was really flying, his hair would be, like, you know, flying around his face and everything.<eos> Yeah, you are totally right.<eos> Hey, where's your inhaler?<eos> I got it.
So you're threatening that if I don't...<eos> - I'm negotiating.<eos> - You're threatening to stop selling to me.<eos> That's your choice.<eos> The true price of any item is what somebody's is willing to pay for it.
So it's your responsibility to keep it sharp, clean, not to lose it.<eos> - Can you handle that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is a good knife.<eos> It'll last you a long time if you take care of it.
If you got someone pregnant, I would also want to know.<eos> Probably every newspaper would want to know, 'cause all of a sudden, some dude's mouth would be pregnant.<eos> My God, you guys, stop it with the crazy jokes.<eos> Why do you care what he needs to know or not?<eos> You are the one who has to get this procedure, pay for it, wear the fucking pad with the big wings, okay?
Hey, Frank.<eos> Hand me last week's maintenance log, will you?<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> The 11-25 train was traveling northbound on the main track.<eos> The 40-94 was traveling southbound, heading right for it.
If he were here, he'd agree with me.<eos> Three days with the Urca's schedule, three minutes with whatever the fuck this is.<eos> I'll remind them.<eos> Before you go, just one question.<eos> Harebrained as this test was, you had to be quite certain I was the thief to even think of it.
There was a rock at the bottom of the trench where Catriona was found.<eos> The jagged edge was in her skull.<eos> The rest of it - all hundredweight of it - was buried in the peat.<eos> Believe me, Jimmy - that's not a rock that anyone hefted and threw.<eos> So you're saying she fell on it?
No it hasn't.<eos> See here?<eos> These are my initials.<eos> I'm the manager.<eos> When the voucher's been used, I mark it with my initials and Then it's processed.
No, from his brother.<eos> And there are no witnesses to him setting the fire.<eos> We found him in a flaming house. Are you saying he didn't do it?<eos> Odds are, he did.<eos> It's just that most arsonists don't stand in the fire to watch it burn.
A spider bit me? Yes, well, I'm so sorry.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> - Phone?<eos> - I gotta make a call.<eos> Well, I'm afraid the doctor stepped on it and broke it.
How can you have been waiting for me... When we never met?<eos> Well, it's simple, isn't it?<eos> You know that I have the secret of immortality.<eos> But the elixir of life is not for anyone.<eos> It must be deserved.
Cheers!<eos> What do they actually do up there for so long?<eos> Mysterious, fragrant things that can't be rushed.<eos> I just put a suit on.<eos> Maybe you should have given it the once-over first.
I'm lucky if I can squeeze out of this tent.<eos> Ladies, when you're finished with your touch-ups, please remember to check the list by the stage.<eos> Spencer, what happened to your veil?<eos> Oh. I think I must have left it inside<eos> Go get it, please.
Thank you.<eos> Put them on a truck and take them to Kholmsk.<eos> Comrade Commandant?<eos> A Japanese repatriation ship is leaving from Kholmsk tomorrow.<eos> - Make sure they're on it.
It is pisselet killing.<eos> Now you can make it.<eos> I can die with peace of mind.<eos> Your new motorcycle stands at dealer.<eos> Go and get it.
Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!<eos> Ziegler! What you do is horrible... ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.<eos> Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.<eos> ! You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.
East coast?<eos> Vermont.<eos> Yeah, she was a maid there for 34 years.<eos> Boss died, and he just left it to her.<eos> Wow. Well, he knew that nobody was gonna take care of it the way she did.
So, so, I'm sure you know these sorts of things happen all the time.<eos> How many times have they happened to you?<eos> I have a document here, very simple.<eos> Basically it's your incident report.<eos> - Can I look at it later?
Hmm? Zack asked me out, and I said yes.<eos> Is that gross?<eos> No, it's not gross. What are you talking about?<eos> You're single. He's hot.<eos> I say... You want to ride that pony, get on it.
What's the matter?<eos> Aren't you well?<eos> My cousin telephoned earlier.<eos> She's expecting, and she's in agony with heartburn.<eos> The midwife said she could be given an antacid, so I came to fetch it.
That's how we ended up with the kid.<eos> Should I keep going?<eos> There's some red flags, I admit.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm not capable of change.<eos> Just give me a target to shoot for. I'll hit it.
Of course it does.<eos> I protected it.<eos> Well, technically, the castle doesn't belong to her.<eos> It was Snow's before she took it.<eos> Well, to be fair, I married into it.
Your father never went to Jessica to set a meeting with me.<eos> Then I assume that next time I call you directly, you'll pick up the phone.<eos> Logan, let me give you the ABCs of me.<eos> I don't take meetings. I set them.<eos> And my respect isn't demanded. It's earned.
- I'm not saying bergen didn't do it, but if he did...<eos> - He was clever about it.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> The Daniel Douglas file, the one in my safe...<eos> I want you to look at it, see if there's something we've overlooked, a thread we haven't pulled on yet, something that could give us some answers.
The Red Queen's reign is over!<eos> I'm the master of Wonderland now.<eos> Enjoying the view, father?<eos> Now you can watch me sit on the throne you didn't believe I deserved.<eos> A throne is made when the man who sits upon it is worthy.
Sometimes they even make shrines.<eos> Yuck.<eos> How long we have you guys for?<eos> As long as you need.<eos> Yo, our monitor works better if you don't slobber on it.
♪<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> We cut open your veins and my arteries and created a vacuum, which allowed my own blood to replenish yours.<eos> Do you mean to say your blood flows within me?<eos> I realize I'm not your ideal candidate for blood brother, but the procedure was too dangerous I couldn't let anyone risk it.
!<eos> What the hell are you confessing to?<eos> The diamond!<eos> The...?<eos> I know by rights it's communal property in a divorce and it's worth $200,000 or $300,000, but that ring belonged to my grandmother, and she didn't deserve it!
- We all done in here?<eos> - Yeah, so done.<eos> All right, yeah, looks good.<eos> Hey, Daphne, show Callie where the trash is.<eos> - I'm lookin' at it.
- How much do you want for the kitchen table?<eos> Oh, hey. They're here to see the bed.<eos> It'll just be a few more minutes.<eos> Yeah, and the kitchen table's not for sale.<eos> Well, how much are you willing to pay for it?
But, I did get you one other present to take your mind off all this.<eos> Aww, you are the sweetest man in the world.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Well, it's not here.<eos> We have to go get it.
You know how great it would've been if you... just would have tried the salsa classes with me or sat through that boring movie?<eos> So you admit it was boring.<eos> Of course it was boring.<eos> It was an old, pretentious French movie.<eos> Then we could have gone and hated it together, then come home and made fun of it together.
Yeah, about that...<eos> I don't hear any choppers, Carlos.<eos> I can't do it, Seth, you brought too much heat.<eos> No, no, what we did was make us all a hell of a lot of money, okay?<eos> Some of which can be yours. Now, you want it, you're gonna have to come and get it.
You're gonna hear from my lawyer! That's what!<eos> Grab Billy.<eos> Is your phone in your chair?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, I'll just call it.
Mrs. St. Patrick, hey.<eos> Which one of you lovely ladies wants to get on this dick?<eos> We're about to cancel Christmas on this motherfucker.<eos> I can't keep it.<eos> I tried... but I look at it and I think of you and us and everything that didn't happen and can't happen and won't happen.
Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?<eos> The botched laser show?<eos> Larry still can't see purple.<eos> That was Larry's fault.<eos> He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
What about Jordan's friends?<eos> Would they know where she is?<eos> She doesn't have a lot of friends.<eos> She spends most of her time in front of her computer.<eos> Do you mind if we take a look at it?
Oh, good.<eos> Guys, what are you doing here?<eos> Come in.<eos> You caught me before my first run of the day.<eos> I call it my "beat the sun" run.
Exactly.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Whoever had this burner number barely used it.<eos> What's that number? [Clears throat]<eos> She called it nine times in the last four months.
If you're a board member, you're assured of a cushy working life.<eos> - Is the world so simple?<eos> - For us it is.<eos> But I must continue.<eos> My card is at the bar, I'll just go and get it.
I wondered if I might ask you a few questions about the man that mugged you.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Did the file open up all right?<eos> Yeah, no, it's come through fine, Mr. Pelfrey.<eos> I'm just looking at it now, actually.
Nicole's at the doctor's.<eos> It's only a couple of blocks away.<eos> She should be here soon.<eos> I remember this park when I was a kid.<eos> You couldn't even walk through it.
I'm better.<eos> "We met that night, Tixy.<eos> Just him and me.<eos> "We hadn't said it was a date, but it definitely was a date. "<eos> "By the way, "his arse is so beautiful that sometimes, "I have to stop myself from crying when I look at it. "
Excuse me, have you seen this man?<eos> _<eos> Sebastian, what are you doing?<eos> I cloned Antti's drive.<eos> I can see anything that goes through it in almost real time.
"Knowing this, "Franklin... built... "an aurora prism<eos> "and hid it inside of the tablet.<eos> "If the prism... is ever exposed to sunlight, "it projects an aurora banishing Moloch before he is born."<eos> If we get that tablet and find the prism...<eos> And shine sunlight through it onto Katrina, we can save her life.
I digress.<eos> My point is, times have changed.<eos> A truly successful mix now involves a certain element that I admit I am less familiar with.<eos> African-Americans and Latinos have begun to have real purchasing power.<eos> They're dictating the marketplace, not just influencing it.
Sort of.<eos> I can't find this key.<eos> Have you ever seen it?<eos> No.<eos> All I know is he was really worried about it.
They dropped me off blocks away for some stupid reason.<eos> You still have your morgue credentials?<eos> Yeah, but, uh, we haven't found the gem yet.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> Tess and I will go get it.
Oh, so you admit you own the car that hit me?<eos> - When?<eos> - Just now!<eos> - My car is parked. - Terribly.<eos> My poor bike ran right into it.
I love it.<eos> Henry... that girl is humiliating us.<eos> She's a thief. She's looting the castle.<eos> There are rumors that you have gifted her an entire estate.<eos> She deserves it.
At this point, I usually ask,<eos> "How did you get into this business?"<eos> Well, I was at IBM for a few years.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> - Yes. And I saw that they have got a great product, but they don't trust it.
The people will.<eos> People like her.<eos> People who are brave enough to stand up for what they believe in.<eos> It is a beautiful country.<eos> I wish you could see it the way I do.
Of course he could.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, that sounds like the best option.<eos> What about my house?<eos> With the equity I already got in it, It should be more than enough.
She's at the airport.<eos> My phone's in the car.<eos> She's probably been calling.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go grab it right now.
I only helped Slider carry it into the shop for a small cut.<eos> That's all.<eos> I swear.<eos> What about this kit, Justine?<eos> You pawned it at the same time that you pawned the other stuff from the robbery, which means that you knew that Alice wasn't coming back for it.
I've spoiled the painting for you, haven't I, with Mr Bricker?<eos> That's why you're selling.<eos> Yes.<eos> But not in the way you think.<eos> Every time I look at it, I am reminded that I didn't trust you and I feel so angry with myself, I want to be rid of it.
It's a long story, but the short answer is a cell at the Fairfax police precinct.<eos> Please don't freak out.<eos> But if you just give back the necklace, this will all be over.<eos> The necklace that you told me to pawn?<eos> - I got 20 grand for it.
This is a medal of outstanding service from the N.Y.P.D. For your invaluable help with tracking down our witness.<eos> What's gonna happen to Jason's sister, anyway?<eos> She's agreed to testify, and with her help, our three victims, along with many, many other people will finally get justice.<eos> Then maybe you should give this medal to her.<eos> I didn't do much to deserve it.
All right.<eos> The bomber could have had a car waiting for him, but a co-conspirator, it increases the odds of capture.<eos> Now there's a bus stop a street over, but that gives people too much time to see his face.<eos> The plaza was full of people fleeing.<eos> I mean, it was far too crowded for anybody to even get through.
WeChat!<eos> A clip?<eos> What's that?<eos> You are really stupid!<eos> You can listen to it if you press on it
Hank?<eos> I figured it out.<eos> Hank, I figured out the code.<eos> Sonya. They know you got the ledger.<eos> They-they questioned me about it.
I need you to make the whole thing go away.<eos> You can't exactly release the kraken and just call it back, Neil.<eos> The I.R.S. doesn't work that way.<eos> Look, give me your 401k.<eos> I'll invest it.
This group of scientists, who I'm trusting enormously, own this colossal magnetic sucking machine called an FMRI... which they are going to put me and my brain into.<eos> They will then show me images of this high-sugar, low-fat milkshake and then feed me the milkshake through a special megastraw.<eos> Then they'll take some photos of my brain and show me how it reacted.<eos> Wow.<eos> Now I'm gonna climb into my own brain and see what effects sugar just had on it.
Rub a dub dub.<eos> Uh, I think I have your shoe.<eos> Oh. - That's where that went.<eos> Yeah. - Fun. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, if you want it back at all, you can always drop by later and pick it up.
Chief Inspector Thomas Brackenreid, Toronto Constabulary.<eos> I have news of your husband.<eos> - But first, I need to take a look at his automobile.<eos> - Oh, I sold it this morning.<eos> Oh, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out how little I got for it.
Haan seems to have made enemies of nearly all his friends over the years.<eos> - Because of all his philandering?<eos> - Philandering, back-stabbing, reckless business dealings... according to the widow, he's a right piece of work.<eos> I need to take a good look at that automobile.<eos> Really, though, you must know how much they paid for it?
So long Alain struggled.<eos> But this year, he has 20 years.<eos> And still I keep this - a reminder of how proud he made me that day.<eos> And as long as you carry that picture, you'll carry your son with you.<eos> Look after it.
Yeah.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Use your elbows.<eos> And keep your nostrils closed.<eos> Don't breathe on it.
"You can't take care of your kids." It's...<eos> And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don't know...<eos> I don't know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it's dry humping.<eos> There's no dancing.<eos> The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it... and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go... That's what a private "dance" is, right?
Sure.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> I just wanted you to know that... ..I brought your earring back.<eos> I wondered where I lost that.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to... bring it in or whether you wanted to come and pick it up.
You do?<eos> 'Yep.'<eos> Is there something on it?<eos> There's some pictures of them hanging out, and a video, 'but I can't get it to play.'<eos> Well, if you e-mail it to me, I might be able to get someone to have a look at it.
Clarence loved her, Eadie.<eos> He didn't kill her.<eos> Can you get the original report?<eos> Not officially.<eos> I can't request it.
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Hutchison.<eos> Your son hasn't woken up from surgery yet.<eos> I'm not sure when or if he ever will.<eos> I think I left my phone in the car.<eos> I'll get it.
To trick-or-treat.<eos> Nicky, what are you going as?<eos> I am going as Miss Anxious College Applicant.<eos> What's that costume?<eos> You're looking at it.
Hmm, it's looking like he prefers brownie to Blonie. Okay.<eos> Look alive, people.<eos> We nee to break into the Clouspinners' lair.<eos> Liam, you nee your phone, so you can talk to Karma.<eos> Shane, you nee your phone, so you can stare at it pathetically until uke texts.
Until a week ago, Luisa was drinking tequila, kissing strange women, and dancing naked.<eos> I was lost, but, your honor, I stand before you here today, ready to accept any punt that you deem necessary.<eos> Judge: This isn't a sentencing.<eos> You just have to answer the petition.<eos> Oh. Well, then I answer it.
One layer is enough, Jay.<eos> I loved that you were having fun with us.<eos> A happy husband -- that's what is sexy to me.<eos> So you don't think I look like Ben Franklin?<eos> Oh, yes! That's who it is!
But when I went to print it, the file was gone.<eos> Money laundering?<eos> That's my guess.<eos> I guarantee Barnwright monitors their whole system.<eos> As soon as you opened the file, they knew you were looking at it.
You did.<eos> I'll get the drinks.<eos> So, hey, um, did you find anybody to buy your motorcycle yet?<eos> Uh, well, your dad and I are still fixing it up.<eos> How much are you gonna ask for it?
There's no point even discussing speed, and I wasn't going to.<eos> I was going to say... I don't think your car looks very nice.<eos> -HAMMOND: No. What?<eos> -It doesn't. Because it doesn't look very nice?<eos> Look at it, it's all angles and...
- Precisely. - It's embarrassing.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I am single.<eos> I see.<eos> But if Marcus wants my number, he can ask me for it.
Alec was out of control, okay?<eos> His habit was up to 2,000 a week.<eos> And those were friend prices.<eos> One day, he offered me his police gun.<eos> Said it had a street value of a thousand bucks, so I took it.
Oh, yeah!<eos> There it is - not just A V8 - the definitive V8.<eos> Is it?<eos> Ford Mustang, the Mach One.<eos> Look at it. It's a bit...
~ Jump out. ~ Nobody jumps out of a car, nobody hovers, nobody leaps out.<eos> ~ He's quite grumpy. ~ Nobody pops.<eos> ~ Back pain does that to people.<eos> ~ It does.<eos> ~ It puts them in a bad mood. ~ It does.
Don't.<eos> Detach.<eos> Okay, I am nosing down.<eos> Approaching the event horizon.<eos> Portside, dipping down beneath it to go through it.
A butcher knife with Rusty Berkhart's fingerprints on it?<eos> I'm certain.<eos> As certain as you were.. That you did not participate in this search.<eos> And if the lion comes..<eos> Daddy roars at the lion. And chase it all the way back to the jungle.
Maybe I should give her the cross.<eos> I mean, I'm the one who fixed it.<eos> No!<eos> You can't do that.<eos> OK, what will you give me for it?
"I, I, I." Everything out of you is "I".<eos> You even understand the concept of a team?<eos> Might be a cliche, son, but there is no "I" in team, and there'll be no "I" in this team.<eos> This ain't no team, this is a crew!<eos> And obviously, I'm better than anyone on it!
It can only be undone by the one who put it there.<eos> I have no idea who put it there.<eos> You wrote it.<eos> Your mind remembers the inverted image.<eos> You just have to look at it differently.
How do you know that?<eos> We know.<eos> Maybe that's... It's 50 grand a month he's been taking out of his apartments in Detroit and putting it away.<eos> So the building cost me 100 grand.<eos> I put about 40 grand worth of materials and appliances in it and have it reappraised for 200 grand.
- Yeah. We can study in my room.<eos> - Lead the way.<eos> This is - This is really nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I try to keep it clean.
This person...<eos> they lied about everything.<eos> But just because the lies are shocking and they attract a lot of attention... it doesn't necessarily make them true.<eos> It was very important for us to... to check the facts and to question the facts... until it was evident that I was innocent.<eos> And once we've proven my innocence, we went back to that proof... over and over again, and looked at it with a fresh set of eyes.
What horse?<eos> We give him the horse right after we bury your mother.<eos> You mean, you think you swapped my horse?<eos> My horse?<eos> Five months hard work... clear near 40 acres of Quick's field to earn it.
What the hell are you gonna do with a compressor?<eos> I need it to paint. Are you still working, Woody?<eos> No. He just needs to replace the compressor that Ed Pegram stole.<eos> Why don't you just go down and get it from him while you're in town?<eos> David, let's go get it.
We're going back to Billings, okay?<eos> We might make a couple quick stops first.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> I don't understand what's happening with your car.<eos> Well, they made me a real good offer for it.
They come here and think they're better than us.<eos> I know because I was.<eos> Listen, farmer.<eos> The big boss is called Buddha.<eos> We call it " Smiling Buddha " .
You ever been to the cyclone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna go?<eos> Got my bike.<eos> Come back for it.
Is there a point to all this?<eos> Because there really needs to be a point to all this.<eos> Right.<eos> You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?<eos> You might want to start looking at it again.
We can always rely on you.<eos> To Lists.<eos> To Lists.<eos> Did you get my wire?<eos> Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see ...<eos> Please pass the salt.<eos> You see, by acting or thinking in a certain fashion, in the hope of preventing a sequence of events or influencing it.
I'll do something real.<eos> I promise! Your word is as worthless as your diploma.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> The diploma?<eos> Well, what if I go earn it?
And then, when she's in her 20s, I'll ask her out.<eos> And she'll realise Linus is the one.<eos> And I'll marry her.<eos> Mum, look, someone's dumped their bike.<eos> They'll be back for it.
As a little girl I made a sign for the door of my room.<eos> Cigarettes Not Allowed.<eos> Little Brother Not Allowed.<eos> Grown-ups Not Allowed.<eos> Then I drew a line through it.
Go...clear out.<eos> I'll call police, you'll get the stick.<eos> Will you call police?<eos> Crows are crowing over there, have you complained against it?<eos> Goods train is rattling out there, did you lodge complaint against it?
But I didn't know if there was, like, werewolf traces left in me, so I didn't want to give you a seizure.<eos> I can't drink that, because there's no way of knowing whether the donor had the virus.<eos> The virus?<eos> So it is in the blood supply.<eos> Why are humans not affected by it?
You took my camera.<eos> It's a Canon.<eos> The lens alone is worth more than my...<eos> It's worth a lot.<eos> You... probably don't care, but I've been saving for two years to get it.
Please don't touch!<eos> That was fun.<eos> Did that horse belong to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The ball knocked it over and it broke.
But I like your taste in music.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> Bye.<eos> You still want your album?<eos> You paid for it!
If you think about it, it's not that far off with Reagan in the White House.<eos> They want to control everything.<eos> I never thought about it that way.<eos> You make me look at the world totally different, Miller.<eos> Like i'm seeing it for the first time.
The procedure seemingly went well with no incident.<eos> "Seemingly"?<eos> Would you walk us through it, please, doctor?<eos> Certainly.<eos> After I... actually, before we get to that, um, I assume Ms. cash was informed as to the risks of the surgery, and she consented to it?
No, I'll take my scooter.<eos> See you there.<eos> That portrait of me was really crude, but precise.<eos> I hung it in my room,<eos> I look at it every day and remember What a bitch I am.
Yeah. Around back.<eos> By the washrooms.<eos> See anybody using it last night?<eos> Haven't seen anyone use it this century.<eos> Mind if our technician takes a look at it?
And word will spread.<eos> So next time we do the powder trick it won't just be The Garrison that'll bet on the horse, it'll be the whole of Small Heath.<eos> And you know what?<eos> The horse will win again.<eos> And the third time we do it we'll have the whole of Birmingham betting on it.
He's sent an empty text.<eos> Maybe he wants a meet.<eos> Whose phone did he text?<eos> A new number.<eos> I never came across it before.
They can identify our nipples from 40 feet away through a wool sweater, but they have no idea what our rings look like.<eos> So why not try this?<eos> Because I'll know.<eos> Oh, I love that ring.<eos> Burt worked so hard to get it.
So why not try this?<eos> Because I'll know.<eos> Oh, I love that ring.<eos> Burt worked so hard to get it.<eos> And it's always been there for me, whether I needed to look at it to remind myself how much he loved me or pawn it to pay for groceries.
What's "scratch"?<eos> I need to pawn this.<eos> You white folks and high cholesterol are gonna be the end of me.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you I didn't steal the ring?<eos> I paid for it with my medical research money.
Mm-hmm.<eos> You? Yeah.<eos> Apparently you're not a couple unless someone's in pain.<eos> (both laugh) ZOE: I didn't know you wanted to see this. Heck, yeah.<eos> I've been interested in it for weeks. I-I...
Shit!<eos> Oh, I'm fine, by the way. Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, Fe.<eos> Your blow is abysmal, by the way.<eos> I'll be lucky to get 10k for it. What?
I'm Katja.<eos> Katja Obinger, Beth.<eos> Yeah, I get it, the German, okay?<eos> I've seen your birth certificate.<eos> Ja, you asked for it, for proof.
It's only a matter of time before the Pyrates figure out a way to get to him.<eos> We have no choice but to move the cross.<eos> Not just for our sake... for the sake of all humanity.<eos> Laila's following the clocks to the cross, and we can't do anything to stop her.<eos> I can't believe the entire flight home from Germany, he had the clock in his hand, and he didn't even look at it.
I'm sorry, but, uh... well, that's impossible.<eos> I hear you like to get... sauced at biochemistry conventions and brag about how you're gonna win the Nobel Prize for the work you're doing here, research that has been entirely funded by my late husband's money.<eos> I have made you rich, soon to be famous.<eos> I want that medicine.<eos> I paid for it, and I want it.
What are the odds of that?<eos> It's not a club anyone asks to join.<eos> Nope, but here we are.<eos> What does that say about us?<eos> Maybe when basic instinct says to run away from a fire, a few run towards it.
I never had that chance, so what does it matter?<eos> Because I do.<eos> What do I want?<eos> I wanna give this office back.<eos> I didn't earn it, I don't want it, and if there's a chance it'll help Harvey forgive me, I'm gonna take it.
Going somewhere?<eos> Gotta see a guy about a suit.<eos> It feels weird.<eos> Well, get out here and show me.<eos> I could just use my med uniform, maybe throw a tux jacket over it?
You're gonna have to do a little housecleaning first.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means someone in the fbi Is passing notes with the shepherds.<eos> The raid yesterday--<eos> They sure seemed ready for it, didn't they?
We're not gonna pay you to clean the house you live in.<eos> All right. Then I guess I'll have to wait on that car.<eos> What about another vehicle?<eos> It's got 8 wheels and seats 50?<eos> I pay for it with my tax dollars, as well as everybody's health care that rides in it?
What are you saying?<eos> That I'm too stupid for it?<eos> Chris, we're over here.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That I'm too stupid for it?
Come on, Walden, look at you.<eos> You're-you're a disgusting blob.<eos> I mean, can you even see your penis past that gut?<eos> My penis is like Santa Claus.<eos> I don't need to see it; I just need to believe in it.
But we can't trust anybody, okay? We cannot trust anybody.<eos> You've just gotta let me do this. So what I need...<eos> I need his phone number, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, let me get it, hang on.
So we'll leave the car parked at my place and you can call and schedule the time to use it whenever you want.<eos> Schedule a time?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Who's going to pay for the maintenance. And the tags and everything else?<eos> Well, I'm old-fashioned, and, you know, I'd make Sam get a job so she could pay for it, but it'll probably end up being you.
Hello, Sergejevicz.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> 50 years ago, my father helped build Culture Park and he never mentioned anything about a bunker.<eos> That's because it is a military secret.<eos> I'm surprised, you've worked here for over 15 years and never seen it?
I like capitalism.<eos> I love competition.<eos> I'm more competitive than you.<eos> - I don't think so. - I think so.<eos> - Settle down. - No, settle up. 'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won.
You are gonna get her fired trying to sneak in your own product placement!<eos> She is an actor, not a race car.<eos> Oh. You had to play the race car.<eos> I feel like an idiot in this costume.<eos> It makes me look like a total...
Wow. Good luck driving that around.<eos> Look at your headrest, it's melted.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> That car is going to be nasty inside.<eos> I wouldn't know the full extent of the damage until I tried to drive it, but I had faith.
I don't even know what to say.<eos> By the way, I love having a girlfriend!<eos> It's so much fun!<eos> All right, just a heads-up-- finale of "The Bachelor" is on tomorrow night.<eos> So if you want dinner, you're gonna have to drive and get it yourself.
Harry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still got that letter?<eos> Let's burn it now.<eos> Go and get it.
Here.<eos> You all right?<eos> What's that, a letter to Lucy?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Take that dish, they're waiting for it.
Just never found it out.<eos> Well, you did forget that your contraceptive injection ran out round about the 14th.<eos> And now you're eight days late.<eos> So...piss on that.<eos> Thanks for the tip, cos I was going to dump on it.
And knowing her, the whole thing would backfire and become some cool trend.<eos> It kind of already is.<eos> You wanna make out? Eh, I have gum.<eos> What I really need to do is find Dalia's biggest weakness and ruthlessly exploit it.<eos> There is another path... I mean, if you're open enough to explore it.
Can we agree to that?<eos> So, Gainsley's mine caves in and a judge orders him to set aside a fund to pay the families of the victims.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A $3 million fund. That's a lot of bread, even for him.<eos> Yeah, and it's all gone.
Can I have a word? - Look, found a snail.<eos> - Found a snail.<eos> What, on the table?<eos> No, in the garden.<eos> A magpie was looking at it, so I saved it and brought it in.
Yeah. Around back.<eos> By the washrooms.<eos> See anybody using it last night?<eos> Haven't seen anyone use it this century.<eos> Mind if our technician takes a look at it?
You come for me, I'm fine with that.<eos> I'll match you bite for bite and in the end, we'll see who's still standing, right?<eos> But you need to keep away from Mary.<eos> She's off limits.<eos> But what's the point of knowing your weak spot if I don't get a chance to... poke it a bit?
You can go in by the side entrance.<eos> Question.<eos> Yes?<eos> Our gift.<eos> Well, there wasn't room for it.
Slow down! That sweat suit's not for sweating in, okay?<eos> This is crushed velvet.<eos> If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart.<eos> This looks dope.<eos> Let's pay for it.
Sure.<eos> Give your number.<eos> Uh, I don't know my number.<eos> Who doesn't know their own number?<eos> Uh, I don't ever call it.
We're in. Oh, my god, this is everything.<eos> Names, places.<eos> All their administrative files.<eos> I need to see what you're seeing.<eos> Gabe, even if I had a flash drive, It wouldn't hold a fraction of this data.
Tomorrow you'll be gone, and...<eos> No, tomorrow I'll be famous.<eos> Hot hostage who got rescued?<eos> I'll be on chat shows.<eos> Denmark only has one chat show, but I will be on it.
Dreaming.<eos> Why would I dream about you going through my stuff?<eos> I don't know that, Danny, okay?<eos> It's your dream.<eos> Take responsibility for it.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> You're that doctor from the TV!<eos> Wow! You looked so much taller on the big screen.<eos> For you, a free key chain.<eos> Thank you. I earned it. JONAH:
I can't now.<eos> But it doesn't mean that I won't be back.<eos> Every girl deserves a cowboy, right?<eos> This movie of yours is gonna be a hit.<eos> Because if the only way I get to see you is up on that screen, I'm gonna see it a million times.
Yeah, it's all the stuff he's been leaving around my apartment.<eos> He's getting way too comfortable, so...<eos> Sell it all!<eos> Yeah. You probably can get a couple of bucks for his passport.<eos> Yeah, he paid $80 for it.
I've got a feeling about her.<eos> So, how do I do that then?<eos> You impress her, obviously.<eos> See that table?<eos> I'm gonna jump it in one.
- Nothing personal.<eos> It's politics, Dillon.<eos> Of course it's personal.<eos> I always knew there was a glass ceiling.<eos> I just didn't realize I would be cutting my own throat breaking through it.
That's true.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Honey.<eos> - Um, I'm on it.
I really can't wait to get out of here.<eos> Just ten more hours, and we'll be popping tents... and we'll be sleeping under the stars.<eos> Being mauled to death by bears.<eos> (Door buzzes in distance, telephone ringing) - Pretty sweet new system. - (Beep)<eos> I mean, I'm looking forward to getting certified on it.
My house is near Bordeaux.<eos> There are fig trees in the garden and, um... hirondelle.<eos> Long tails... came back each spring, to make their nest.<eos> Swallows.<eos> I stand outside the house and look at it.
He made me promise that if anything ever happened, I would burn it before his wife could see it.<eos> Look, I'll tell you what I told the last guy--<eos> We don't release personal effects.<eos> What do you mean, "the last guy"?<eos> Apparently, that journal must have been pretty hot, because a guy came in here 20 minutes ago asking for it.
Someone please turn the sign on the front door to "closed."<eos> This could take a while.<eos> He's gonna need another shirt.<eos> Where's his bag?<eos> Um, I'm gonna get it.
Hey, Jack...<eos> Something you need to see.<eos> That's nasty.<eos> Deputy says the car's been parked overnight.<eos> No one's claimed it.
Is someone feeding these things?<eos> - Heads up. - This part of the fence, now!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna give! It's gonna give!<eos> Everybody back! Come on, back, now.<eos> The fence keeps bending in like that, those walkers are coming over it.
We're just friends and we're having some fun.<eos> It's not like we're getting married.<eos> Oh, my God, they're throwing the bouquet!<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> She dove for it.
- My politics are private.<eos> But that presentation isn't.<eos> Now, are you gonna hide your dawdling behind your outrage?<eos> You'll have your work and you know it.<eos> You can go in there and take credit for it like you always do.
That never happens, especially not with a liberal-arts subject like sociology.<eos> It's so competitive.<eos> Did you have tenure?<eos> - Why? - It must have been difficult being married to someone who was about to have tenure before you.<eos> She deserved it.
You're a smart man, agent Warren.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> Just remember, man, you won't be living here forever.<eos> Well, they had my phone at lost and found.<eos> Someone must've spilled something on it, though.
I cannot do that to my daughter.<eos> Every life that Freya has lived has been cut short.<eos> She's never been married, she's never had a child, never grown old.<eos> I have to give her this day.<eos> She's waited too long for it.
I do believe this was a real woman, Sir Selwyn.<eos> There's no need to protect my feelings, Mrs Darcy, I'm well aware of the superstition, and its origins in my own father's behaviour.<eos> No.<eos> I saw her myself, in the woods that day.<eos> In fact, she'd lost her bonnet and had returned to retrieve it.
Uh, hard to say, exactly.<eos> Yeah. Sex has always felt --<eos> I don't know -- good, you know?<eos> I mean, really, really good.<eos> But, uh... Sometimes, it just makes you feel bad, you know?
Oh, yeah. He played the jock--Marco--right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> So... you have seen the show.<eos> Just caught it by accident once.
Married?<eos> To the tennis instructor?<eos> Mm. Look at my ring.<eos> He picked it out himself.<eos> Did he pay for it himself?
Probably right after you poisoned him. No, I did not.<eos> I did not poison Titus. I already told you that.<eos> Hey, you're in a lot of trouble, Mr. Jeffries.<eos> We can't help you if you don't level with us.<eos> Okay, I did buy the fetish suit, and I did put Titus in it. But I did not kill him.
Shit.<eos> What about the reserve tank?<eos> It's jammed, boss man.<eos> Hey, we're sitting ducks out here.<eos> Let's go after it.
- See ya.<eos> Hank, can I borrow the flag stand?<eos> You're not really asking 'cause it's already in the cart, right? So...<eos> Hank, can I borrow the flag stand that I already have in the cart?<eos> Yes. But if one of your dog clients does something on it, I'm gonna want a new one.
Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be alone tonight.<eos> And this'll be fun-- like a slumber party but, you know, for broken people.<eos> What about my car?<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> We'll, we'll get it in the morning.
We can rest all we want after we get the pixie dust, do whatever your heart desires.<eos> Just wait. You'll see.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Oh. It's just like dust.<eos> You never know the power it contains just by looking at it.
How-how's Nathan holding up?<eos> I want to see the report.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> The background report I had you run on Dahlia. I paid for it.<eos> Now I'd like to see it.
He goes in, he finds his father on the floor bleeding from a head wound.<eos> All right, well, Ezra had the means, he had the opportunity.<eos> Wait a second, though. If Ezra stole the sword, why would he stick around?<eos> And no one, not even David, said that he had it on him.<eos> Well, maybe he stashed it and came back and got it later.
Sam?<eos> Sam, it seems we have your centrepiece for you.<eos> It is over a hundred years old. My father inherited it.<eos> To be honest, as much as I cook up a tale for the customers, I always thought a watch was just a watch.<eos> I know I asked for something magical, sir, but that'll have them queuing up just to take a look at it.
A Do you know the myth of Sisyphus?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> In mythology, he rolls a boulder up a mountain, non-stop.<eos> But the boulder always rolls back down.<eos> So, he goes back down to get it, goes up and down, up and down.
That's a bad idea.<eos> I might have a better idea.<eos> Look, Eddie is coming back.<eos> If he was ditching his car, there are easier places to abandon it than at an airport.<eos> We should put it back and watch it, and when he comes to pick it up...
What do you mean, you don't have it?<eos> Where-Where is it?<eos> Go away!<eos> I think that only works once.<eos> Just throw a shoe at it.
Pardon?<eos> You told me to call you over.<eos> I'll call you sometime, so just come.<eos> Is that movie even going to be crank in?<eos> You can make it only if someone invests.
Say something, buddy.<eos> Let's get them!<eos> Let's go.<eos> The ship!<eos> Come on, we've got to catch it before it hits open water!
You didn't have to involve her in all this.<eos> It was her idea.<eos> Tell him.<eos> They're asking for the ransom all at once.<eos> When it's paid, I'll pick it up.
Seriously, I think she's had enough to drink.<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> The lady wants a drink, she's getting a drink.<eos> The thing is, the lady doesn't actually need a drink.<eos> I paid for it, she's drinking it.
I accidentally spilled wine on her carpet.<eos> -Right. Who gives a shit?<eos> -She does.<eos> She's got this thing about her carpet.<eos> The way the sunlight hits it at a certain point in the afternoon and....
You heard what Goldie said.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> I see you.<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> - Come and get it!
You should get that back to Daryl, huh?<eos> Freeing that prisoner... More important to you than Carl.<eos> Andrea. Hey, did you try pumping the gas pedal?<eos> I think it's been parked too long.<eos> You gotta tap it three times...
We, uh<eos> - I think we're Team<eos> Yeah. 'Cause we wanna see what's gonna happen down here.<eos> 'Cause we wanna see what's gonna happen.<eos> So we got Roner perched on a blob, and there's two fat Elvis Evel Knievels jumping onto it, and he's gonna shoot off the blob on top of the building.
So you sent me the pizza?<eos> Yeah, that was me.<eos> Okay, that was you. That... That was very nice.<eos> Well, did you get my note?<eos> Yes, I'm looking at it right now. It's right in front of me.
You know, I don't know who's worse... a man who kills a son in front of his own father<eos> or a man who gets paid to make sure he gets to kill some more.<eos> Just for the record, I never wanted to become the man that you think I am.<eos> I happen to believe in this adversarial system of justice of ours.<eos> I happen to believe in it with my whole heart.
I'll see you in Terre Haute next summer. "<eos> So you just ditched Wallace Avery for a total stranger's half-baked promise?<eos> How very good are you?<eos> See that tractor?<eos> I'm going to hit it.
So ... I'm a bit nervous.<eos> But this is kind of like the big blow out. The confirmation that:<eos> Yes.<eos> FEZ is real. It's exists.<eos> It's going to come out, and you'll be able to buy it and play it one day.
- Yeah, but you can read.<eos> - Yeah, I can read.<eos> Nice.<eos> Do you want another one?<eos> I won't spit in it this time.
You dirty minx.<eos> It cost me plenty to get you out of that dark dungeon.<eos> Now you owe me, so listen up.<eos> Sure thing, love. But first, you mind running me through your security system?<eos> You're looking at it.
It's Heather Hills time.<eos> Don't go over there.<eos> I'm not. She's coming to me.<eos> Rodrick did have a plan.<eos> Unfortunately, he came up with it himself.
I'll handle O'Sullivan.<eos> Wait.<eos> That's for luck, "Stan".<eos> - This is my ice!<eos> - Come and get it!
Well, I hope I'm the rock.<eos> - Hi, Vera.<eos> - Celine.<eos> Mum, Mum, the tooth fairy forgot to take the tooth!<eos> She'll come back for it, pet.
Thank you.<eos> You decide who you're voting for?<eos> I'm apolitical.<eos> You don't sleep, you rip ties off innocent bystanders for me, you're killing yourself 24/7 to get me elected, and I don't even have your vote.<eos> Well, you're gonna need to earn it, like any other candidate.
It's very unusual to find a complete service for 12 in such good condition.<eos> Come with me.<eos> It's been in my family for generations.<eos> As far as I know, it's never been used.<eos> If I can physically inspect it to guarantee its authenticity and condition, I'm pretty sure I have a buyer that would pay a tidy sum for it.
Mother of Dragons.<eos> On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you.<eos> A demonstration?<eos> Take this gem.<eos> Look at it.
Well, I'll shout out, "I don't mean you no harm!<eos> I just-I just wanna talk things out."<eos> Well, if you go with me, you'll be safe.<eos> Well, my horse-<eos> We'll come on back and get it.
Hey... you know how you said that my place is spotless in therapy?<eos> Look, I'm sorry about that.<eos> I was...<eos> Wes... my home is permanent.<eos> It's mine, man. I know it can never be taken away from me, so I take care of it.
Don't worry, he hasn't done anything wrong.<eos> If you've seen him, it's important.<eos> I've seen him around, but I don't know him.<eos> Where'd you get the necklace?<eos> I traded for it.
I missed my flight. Besides his description, is there anything else that you can tell us?<eos> Anything that you remember?<eos> He, uh... He had this weird rod.<eos> It was blue.<eos> And he'd look into it like he was some kind of fortune teller.
Bait?<eos> They never caught him, Joey.<eos> They never believed me, how... how he was everywhere.<eos> How he could be at two places at once.<eos> That wall back there... my friend smashed her head open on it.
It belongs to us.<eos> It contains our power.<eos> No.<eos> It has the power of thousands of witches.<eos> And now that it's activated, all of them will come for it.
They were trying to make sense of what was happening to them, and I'm there telling them not to bother?<eos> I should have spent my life being more like you.<eos> Should have been a manipulative, self-centered, narcissistic ass who brought misery to everything and everyone in his life.<eos> You'd still have cancer.<eos> But at least I'd feel like I deserved it.
I thought you were dead.<eos> He said he was taking me to the movies.<eos> Well, time to learn.<eos> Let's see if you can order lunch for everyone in Spanish.<eos> And pay for it.
Glad I could help.<eos> It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favor.<eos> And now, all the rings are magically linked together.<eos> My fiancée's wearing a magic ring, too.<eos> It made all my money disappear.
Mr. Paddington, how can I help you?<eos> Your wallet?<eos> That you left in the pocket of your coat at my office.<eos> I understand.<eos> Of course. I will send one of my assistants there right away to look for it.
Charlie is hiding a phone in the janitor's closet.<eos> - Well, did you confront him?<eos> - That's not my job.<eos> Tell your counselor.<eos> She's in a one-on-one, so I'd like you to go get it.
It never even occurred to me that there was gonna be a second key.<eos> Oh... They're going to catch us now, aren't they?<eos> Claire!<eos> We came up with a good plan, all right?<eos> And I believe in it.
- Probably at the house. No, no.<eos> Julia said it was here. "Julia."<eos> And, um... what do you want with it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> she asked that I find it.
Yeah, a deal's a deal.<eos> I get your vote on the board of my company, you get your name on the deed to the house.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Does this mean I can borrow against it?
Tori, the girlfriend, in Uniondale. Manny stopped by on his way to work.<eos> She didn't mean the plant. She meant afterwards, on his way to the site which means the whole time he was at her house he had a truck full of wet cement.<eos> What am I supposed to do when this load locks up on me?<eos> What?<eos> Are you gonna pay for it?
Otra vez en esta casa tan fea.<eos> Ay, grandma.<eos> Hector, I got you a sweater.<eos> It's out in the car.<eos> Nando, go get it.
No.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not going out there to get a sweater for Hector.<eos> But I'm cold.<eos> Well, then, you go get it.
It is just.<eos> It is vital.<eos> Not to mention that they outnumber us a thousand to one.<eos> Any threat to mainstreaming is a threat to us.<eos> Fundamentalism is a dead end and I won't fucking have it!
"Mug up--"<eos> "Mug up--"<eos> "Forget the Everest, Climb the mountains of books hundreds of times."<eos> "Mug up by speaking it aloud."<eos> "Make your brain run faster, hit it with lash, hit it."
You don't have to learn the terms.<eos> All you need to know is a couple of numbers.<eos> First, Ms. Lee's current carcinoembryonic antigen level is at 106, and on the drug she's been taking for the past three months, that number should be less than three.<eos> So, w-what does that mean?<eos> It means she has metastatic stage-three pancreatic cancer and she's not being treated for it.
You must excuse me for speaking so openly.<eos> They should call us "the guardians of the ceiling", not prisoners.<eos> We're on our beds, looking upwards, almost the entire day.<eos> If they put you on the top bunk, you can see the ceiling.<eos> You watch it... you touch it, you speak to it.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Very good.<eos> Fall out, then.<eos> Right on time.<eos> I don't want to leave my battalion to a man that would knock it about while I'm on sick leave.
And the porch where it was smashed, I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, so I assume it's permanently lit.<eos> How did you notice that?<eos> I lack the arrogance to ignore details<eos> - I'm not the police.<eos> So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.
Pretend your emotions aren't there.<eos> A weapon doesn't know feelings.<eos> You know, Danny should be back by now.<eos> Perhaps his chi is more damaged than we thought.<eos> But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.
Help us use the diamond to solve the mystery of the Magadha treasure.<eos> What's so special about this diamond?<eos> Jiang Wen, could you please explain it to him in Chinese?<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Eye of Shiva, whoever possesses it shall possess the entire world.
Years ago, someone like you used their abilities to seal this.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Alexandra talked.<eos> I listened.<eos> In doing so, they guaranteed that only one thing could open it.
Excuse me, officer? What kind of handcuffs are those?<eos> Police handcuffs.<eos> Are they furry?<eos> There had been some local perps, who have been having an allergic reaction to the metal.<eos> Now, we coat it in synthetic material, health is on the uprise, crime is on the down rise.
- Hell if I know.<eos> Have we found a smoking gun?<eos> School magazine.<eos> The graffiti.<eos> Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.
I know the royal garden is important to you. I'm sorry.<eos> Nabila.<eos> Do what must be done.<eos> Your Majesty...<eos> You can tear it out and cut it down.
I could wish for world peace.<eos> That's always a classic.<eos> - Boo. - No need to ask for a bigger family since everybody seems to be marrying each other.<eos> I always wanted a little brother, by the way, dude.<eos> Or I could... I could give it away.
I thought they had gone, you see?<eos> Gone with everyone else.<eos> I never even considered searching for them.<eos> If I had...<eos> I took the cross from the chapel and brought it out there... To mark the place where they died.
This is the backyard, which needs weeding, mowing and pruning.<eos> It is also where you will chop wood.<eos> Bathroom number seven, the only one you are allowed to use.<eos> It has all the usual amenities, though the management regrets to inform you that the shampoo is not tear-free.<eos> If anything, it encourages tears.
Well, maybe you just got the sequence...<eos> I did not forget!<eos> Maybe it got reset by accident.<eos> Grandpa, this is a three-wheel dial lock.<eos> In order to reset it, you have to have a rep come out from the manufacturer with a change key.
She miss being handled?<eos> What are you, a sadist?<eos> Girls usually get the hint after their first six unanswered messages.<eos> You played Wozniak a copy of my wire?<eos> You handed him a recording of it?
'<eos> 'Percy.'<eos> 'I found the ball, ma'am.<eos> - Good.'<eos> 'And don't worry about the glass, I'll clean it up.'
I think you should stare at that diamond real hard and think how long it took for a lump of carbon to become that.<eos> I mean, it's like... a million years plus.<eos> Talk about patience.<eos> You can't expect him to be on your timetable, Aria.<eos> If the man needs another week or two, give it to him.
Lily, I want to thank you for bringing your mom down.<eos> It was a delight to meet you, young lady. Oh.<eos> Thank you, Jimmy.<eos> And you tell your friends, even if they already<eos> Have a will, it's important to get it updated, Just like you did.
What do you got?<eos> When my Sonic cry hit vigilante, it knocked off a small piece of his visor.<eos> Looks like it's lined with some kind of circuitry.<eos> Well, that means, it's manufactured.<eos> Maybe I can link it back to where he bought it from.
And who does that?<eos> A repeater.<eos> But there's just one small problem.<eos> No more bodies.<eos> Unless we missed it.
No.<eos> He stayed over.<eos> Take a lot of gear out there with him?<eos> Couple of shorties and some gnarly-ass suitcases I think were for camping.<eos> He bring it all back in?
Never trusting anyone.<eos> Call your boss.<eos> Ask for State Department file on me, Grigory Krukov.<eos> He says no, I believe you.<eos> If he provides it, well...
I've got 17 local stores left to contact about sales records.<eos> Anything new on Gunn's?<eos> A couple of decent prints we missed the first time.<eos> Entry, door, face plate, and latch bolt.<eos> Like, whoever broke in held his finger up against it after he picked it open.
No names yet.<eos> The claim is that you were capricious, that, you expected them to use intimidation to get settlements.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Well, this gives the case teeth.<eos> There's no way a judge is gonna throw it out now.
George?<eos> Are you unwell?<eos> That old woman... .. will have no party.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Has she given orders to defer it?
- Don't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before.<eos> But the judge will be here soon, and this is the best way to build our case.<eos> Now, the average point total for a resident here is roughly 1.2 million.<eos> Right now, based on everything that you did on Earth, you have -4,008.<eos> That's not great, but I'm gonna do nice things for every goober in this place until my point total is so high I can rub it in all their smug faces.
Well, those are the sort of things you hang on to, things you remember.<eos> Get Mark on the case.<eos> Jewellers, pawn shops.<eos> I mean, if Nathan really was fleecing that farmhouse, stealing Laura's stuff to sell on...<eos> - Someone must have been buying it.
We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and...<eos> I don't know. I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.<eos> Why didn't you leave them in the car?<eos> I didn't want them to get stolen.<eos> And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a "Y."
- You're killing him.<eos> - Have to reset it manually.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - His heart's already stopped.<eos> She's just trying to reboot it.
No pants.<eos> And no flat-ass fucking hair.<eos> I mean, Jesus H...<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, tits-on-a-stick Stacey.<eos> I don't care if you have to stand in front of a mirror for three hours teasing the shit out of it!
Kanan dead.<eos> [tense music]<eos> I wouldn't have left a fucking gun at Truth... You know that!<eos> I told you, Angie's framing me!<eos> It doesn't matter who put it there.
Hey, don't jinx me, Tommy.<eos> So drinks are on you, right?<eos> That's the rule when you stumble into a bucket of money.<eos> It was a bucket of something, all right.<eos> You know, you were lucky it was me that found it.
It fucking didn't help.<eos> That's for damn sure.<eos> Look, Axe, we're different, right?<eos> We didn't inherit our money.<eos> We earned it calling bullshit early, often, and very publicly.
But I can help you get back.<eos> Destroy this device when you return.<eos> That will sever the time loop, solve your problem.<eos> There's no other way.<eos> But, if I can find a way to understand it, perhaps I can undo some of the things...
And then we can treat ourselves to my second favorite candy when I was a boy, peppermints.<eos> During tourist season at Lake Lachrymose, the Fickle Ferry brings visitors from all over the world to enjoy sunshine... fresh air... smoked mackerel.<eos> The ferry leaves every 17 minutes to the Lavender Lighthouse, where tourists can walk to Curdled Cave or they could bask in the lighthouse's pale purple glow.<eos> But that's only when the weather is warm.<eos> During the off-season, Lake Lachrymose has very few visitors, which is why the ferry company has added two words to the bottom of their schedule in fine print, a phrase which here means "you might miss reading it until it was too late."
Launch sequence terminated.<eos> Raven, explain.<eos> It's simple.<eos> There's no power in the ring.<eos> Two minutes ago, I thought it wasn't a problem because I could activate it remotely.
Since when can you hit so hard?<eos> My strength has been growing steadily.<eos> As is your recklessness, it seems.<eos> I mean, what did you expect me to do?<eos> Stab you with the blade and have it be ignited by my joy?
Those are the West family businesses Garcia's been using to launder drug money.<eos> Yeah. But what's this... what's this Cayman account, with, uh, $2 million in deposits and no withdrawals?<eos> It's the only one with Garcia's name on it.<eos> It could be he's skimming a little off the top for himself.<eos> Can you seize it?
The last horse is entering the starting gate.<eos> $2 million?<eos> That's a lot of change.<eos> How do we know it's legit?<eos> I can wire it to you directly.
Bonn.<eos> Maastricht.<eos> I is not mine to give.<eos> It belongs to the Spanish.<eos> Tell them to give it to me.
So there's this banana and a vibrator, and they're in the top drawer, and the banana turns around and says,<eos> "Well, I don't know what you're shaking for, she's going to EAT me."<eos> I mean, my missus, she's in front of the mirror and she says,<eos> "I think I'd like me boobs to be a bit bigger."<eos> I said, "Right, once or twice a day", "get a bit of tissue paper and give them both a good wipe with it."
Well, I do have a lot of questions.<eos> Okay, but you're not going to fill it out like I do.<eos> You're telling me that Valentine's gift - wasn't from Gabi?<eos> - No. It was my gift to Elliot, who won't stop calling.<eos> But I refuse to answer because that gift, was from my heart, which I no longer have because my ice queen husband ripped it from my chest on the most romantic day of the year! Where's that damn stripper?
It's more than we had an hour ago.<eos> Can you print out stills of the car?<eos> Yeah, sure can.<eos> Show these to the security guard working the site.<eos> I'll talk to Linden, see if he can recognize it.
It's there.<eos> The other 50 is in a building on ventura.<eos> It's called the Lisbon.<eos> Mailbox 5c.<eos> Get it out of there tonight, and get yourself out of California.
I mean, help me out, Homeland.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sorry, not me.<eos> We overclassify too many documents.<eos> Label it top secret 'cause it's easier and covers our bases, not because it actually reveals anything.
This is a toy.<eos> These drones offer the highest level of security for an important businessman such as yourself.<eos> In fact, they're being employed for protection over Governor Vargas' entire property as we speak.<eos> It shoots 15 photos per second.<eos> And we can control it from over four miles away.
And we don't have God giving us orders. But like Noah's quest, this project is not just an exercise.<eos> In the coming months, we... The intellectuals, academics, scientists and our writer... have been tasked by Darius Tanz to select 160 people... to colonize Mars.<eos> Counterintelligence successfully traced the source of the hack.<eos> They call it a mimic signal.<eos> A sat signal that piggybacks alongside a proprietary feed, then overrides it.
When he asked you to make up a story about a detective pointing a gun at you, you did.<eos> I think I need to speak with a lawyer.<eos> That's one option.<eos> Or you could realize that we're throwing you a lifeline.<eos> Grab it.
The EmDrive... can you rebuild it from memory?<eos> My memory isn't the problem. That drive requires a unique crystal lining to operate it.<eos> We extracted that crystal from a meteorite that Darius owns.<eos> And it's the only one of its kind on Earth.<eos> The most important oneofakind device in human history, and no one at Tanz Industries even thought to properly vet the man building it?
I'd like to send a telegram, please.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have some post for you.<eos> I'll just have a look, see if I can find it.
What do you know about my father?<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I know this may not be what you want to hear... but there's no evidence of a murder at a Macau casino.<eos> If there was we'd know about it.
That's two nights in a row, then.<eos> That we know of.<eos> Policy says that we can't let him go this long.<eos> I'd like to stay here with him tonight if that's okay.<eos> You signed for the file, you can take it.
Two of my unis drove it over.<eos> You always break chain of evidence like that?<eos> Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy.<eos> Here's a voucher.<eos> - They handed it to Mathis?
Up.<eos> Straight up.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - What?<eos> Destroy it!
Reacher.<eos> How's my office?<eos> I'm sitting here now.<eos> There is this big dent in the desk.<eos> And people say you made it with someone's head.
We take mines together, sell them to guerrillas.<eos> Mines very precious.<eos> We very poor.<eos> She very good.<eos> She take stick and put it inside and touch the mine and dig very, very slow, and take out mine and put in tin can.
I don't have a fucking million bucks, are you crazy?<eos> You fucking cheapskate!<eos> You walked away with a million fucking dollars!<eos> It wasn't all mine!<eos> I had to give it to the cat who planned the whole thing, then I got my cut.
I just don't have the time anymore.<eos> We saw this coming, right?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> What do I do with the piano now?<eos> I got it just for you.
"She," like I'm a mind reader?<eos> Yeah, like you're a mind reader.<eos> Give me your phone. I'll snap her file.<eos> Give me yours.<eos> I'll put my number in. You can shoot it in texts.
And little candies and stuff.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> This is too much. You did not have to do this.<eos> One less thing for you to have to do.<eos> And I put a candy in each one... But you can take it out, if you want to.
We may be married but I do still have my dignity.<eos> So, rest over night then, Doctor?<eos> Mrs Buckle, you will need to rest for a week, perhaps two.<eos> A back spasm is a warning shot.<eos> We ignore it at our peril.
You might want to close that curtain.<eos> Is this you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wasn't snooping.<eos> I just found it in the drawer.
To resuscitate Japan and 3.6 million metropolitan refugees... we'll need a brand new cabinet.<eos> This country rose up through scrap-and-build.<eos> It'll be done again.<eos> The countdown was merely suspended.<eos> But it'll restart when Gojira begins moving.
There's no furniture, and it's not painted.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> I'll get the key.<eos> It is a little dirty, as I warned you.<eos> I'll take it, Inocencio.
Something dark and urgent.<eos> Ah. Okay.<eos> Great news.<eos> The smell of burnt sweatpants and singed leg hair is finally dissipating.<eos> I just hope I can grow it back by Speedo season.
He calls it The Citadel.<eos> And there's one key... and he hides it.<eos> - Do you know what's inside?<eos> - He says it's full of peppermints.<eos> Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Well.. I guess I'll give you that sandstone.<eos> - We'd wanna pay you for it.<eos> - It was the old school house, you know.<eos> From when the town was settled.<eos> They cut it from the massive sandstone around here.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas, English will be not it.<eos> Do not do this.<eos> It's done.<eos> So, one of two outcomes will result.<eos> Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
- Yeah?<eos> You find me my money or you're gonna go down for all of this.<eos> You've got my number.<eos> How are we gonna find what we don't have?<eos> We're gonna pound the person who has it, Donnie.
Glad you liked them...<eos> I don't get much appreciation for my poetry...<eos> There's so much angst in your poems...<eos> Angst will always find angst...<eos> Can I steal it for my music?
This time, they sent you.<eos> Sadly, in order to restore things, the situation demands a blood sacrifice.<eos> See,ArnoldandI designed every part of this place.<eos> It was our dream.<eos> Did you really think I would let you take it from me?
"Lamont, you clean the jelly off those glasses?"<eos> "All I know is he's the dude with the dame and you're the chump with the rump."<eos> "That's a big girl, ain't it?"<eos> "She said she lost 40 pounds."<eos> "If she look behind her, she'll find it."
Louis?<eos> Are you listening? Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.<eos> Did you buy the car?<eos> Antoine's old one.<eos> Mom bought it.
Their dad always owned a car.<eos> Here, back then, owning a car...<eos> But he worked. It was his car.<eos> It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.<eos> Sunday mornings, he washed it. Washed the hell out of it.
Let's see what you've got in here.<eos> If Jimmy hadn't messed me about, we wouldn't be here like this.<eos> But I need access to the dreaming.<eos> It's not yours to have.<eos> All right, bring it in!
I... I forgot that, uh...<eos> Well, I still have the money.<eos> Isn't that fucked up?<eos> Well, what are you gonna do with your ring and a bill?<eos> You're gonna mail it. And you'll leave a note in it saying to send it to Mandy.
What matters is not to know the world but to change it.<eos> Wow, somebody learned their Frantz Fanon very well.<eos> You know what else old Frantz said that I buy into 100%?<eos> "Violence is man re-creating himself."<eos> You know, if you don't like the way that the world is, you have to change it.
Wow, somebody learned their Frantz Fanon very well.<eos> You know what else old Frantz said that I buy into 100%?<eos> "Violence is man re-creating himself."<eos> You know, if you don't like the way that the world is, you have to change it.<eos> You have to change it yourself.
Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetie.<eos> I think I finally got the formula perfectioned.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Uh, what happened to all the weed in the store?<eos> We sold it. Really?
They told us the ground was uninhabitable, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed.<eos> Some of us have been broken by it, but most of us are still here, searching for other survivors from the Ark, trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness... a home.<eos> Our leaders believe that to survive, we need to make peace with the Grounders,<eos> but peace is a foreign concept here.<eos> I found it, John.
I love her.<eos> Yeah, well, I think you've proved that, Mr. Kirke.<eos> Let him go.<eos> The DNA test came back on the accreted deposits on the back of the crucifix.<eos> I ran it against the DNA database.
Well, they've been driving me crazy.<eos> Get rid of them.<eos> Oh. Don't let these feathery fellas ruffle your feathers, fella.<eos> Chickens.<eos> You have yourself a perfectly good coop, and that's what you keep in it?
Your mother called.<eos> She's been talking to Jeremy again.<eos> Do you think I really wouldn't come back - because of you? - Yeah.<eos> This show is my kingdom.<eos> I'm gonna take it back.
Two million livre.<eos> It took me six months to design this lock, two smiths a month to construct the door.<eos> It's over a foot thick.<eos> My tools and plans.<eos> You have until midday to dismantle it.
I intended to heal her.<eos> But I'm not ill, Victor.<eos> I am preternaturally healthy, as well you know.<eos> I have developed a serum, a medicine of sorts.<eos> I can take all your anger and rage and make it go away.
Everyone down here is.<eos> Are they? He's not wrong.<eos> The world is coming apart just like Star City.<eos> I mean, it is worse than it has ever been.<eos> That's because Darhk's been spending the past year trying to kill it.
Was it turned on?<eos> - When we got here, it was off.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> As you can see, the door was open but the lock wasn't forced.<eos> Looks like the lady heard the bell, went to open the door, saw someone wanted to rob her, tried closing it, but he forced his way in.
I'm broke.<eos> When the stewardess let it slip how much cash she was gonna make from this delivery, I...<eos> I thought it was drugs.<eos> I was gonna sell them.<eos> Then I opened it.
You're welcome.<eos> What this chair lacks in form, it makes up for in function.<eos> It will save you from straining your groin.<eos> Can we have five minutes where no one mentions my groin?<eos> Send it back, please.
Give me your sari<eos> How can I give my sari to that girl?<eos> Who asked for your sari?<eos> That pink sari you bought in Saravana Stores for Rs 8000<eos> - You were ironing it this morning
Arthur.<eos> Prison.<eos> Well, can you tell us who?<eos> That'll take a little more time.<eos> I've traced it to granite hills correctional facility.
What, it's not good?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Uh, no. This is not gonna be so simple.<eos> Someone went through and manually corrupted this file.<eos> So first I have to recover the data, and then I can decrypt it.
She kept your favourite ring.<eos> That was her idea, not mine.<eos> Bonnaire, do you have the money?<eos> I do.<eos> It lies hidden. Musketeers, take him and retrieve it.
My apologies.<eos> I thought we'd meet on neutral turf to discuss custody.<eos> Custody of what?<eos> Of our social calendar.<eos> We need to divide it up and decide who's going to attend which balls, fundraisers, galas, et cetera.
Hey, can you maybe...<eos> Part of me's glad I missed the recital.<eos> I've been looking forward to my senior dance since sixth grade, and it would've sucked to just sit there and watch.<eos> I'm not saying that I regret this baby.<eos> I just wish that I'd had it later... or sooner, like a lot of my friends.
Best not to ask.<eos> I've kind of got a color crisis.<eos> -Crisis?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Relax, you'll get over it.
Morning.<eos> You just come from training?<eos> Yeah. I'm, uh, workin' on my right hook.<eos> Good. That's a good punch.<eos> Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm workin' on it.
And she's not wearing the scarf.<eos> I don't see anyone that is.<eos> Wait... there.<eos> There's the scarf.<eos> So, the woman who changed Robyn's life is also the one who took it.
Deep breath, please.<eos> Deep breath again.<eos> After I got popped, they went straight for Lobos's GPS tracker, rolled up with fucking bolt cutters, ready for it, which means we've got a big fucking leak.<eos> GPS trackers are standard operating procedure with high-value prisoners.<eos> They were likely prepared for it just in case.
Hey, is that my car?<eos> - Whoa! Who are you?<eos> - Is that my car?<eos> - Uh... Ted Berner.<eos> - Was it stolen?
- Whoa! Who are you?<eos> - Is that my car?<eos> - Uh... Ted Berner.<eos> - Was it stolen?<eos> No, my son Evan borrowed it.
I think you've destroyed him.<eos> You know what the most terrible thing is?<eos> There was no reason.<eos> The election timeline was always arbitrary.<eos> He could have set it for 12 months away instead of six.
Leave at once or I will have you escorted from the area by the police!<eos> I do take your points.<eos> But I cannot countenance any further involvement from Mr Carter.<eos> As I understand it, Mr Lacau, while we speak, the coffin remains open to the air. The contents are inevitably deteriorating.<eos> It is the discovery of our age and you are allowing it to fall the pieces.
- Is it the ghost?<eos> - It might be the ghost, yeah.<eos> - With a birthday cupcake?<eos> - With a birthday cupcake.<eos> - I'm gonna eat it.
Have one.<eos> This enclosure was built for the purpose of common recreation and study.<eos> I had it repurposed into a garden worthy of our splendor.<eos> I dare say it's my favorite place in the entire kingdom.<eos> It pleases me that you've seen it with your own eyes before... Choosing to leave us so suddenly.
Nan always said the Prairie winds bring in bad dreams.<eos> - Those're some brutal winds.<eos> - drink some water.<eos> - Is it beer o'clock?<eos> Mix it with tomato juice and it's breakfast.
- Yeah.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> I saw a bird.<eos> Mercury Labs.<eos> It's under attack.
- Keith, by the way.<eos> I know your name, okay? I know everybody's name.<eos> Look... we can't cut everything about this platform that makes it revolutionary just because that's a little harder for you guys to sell, all right?<eos> If we want to sell out, let's just sell all the way out.<eos> Let's just take the algorithm, jam it into a metal fucking box, stick it in the back of a data center somewhere, so it can't connect to anything, and it just sits there and no one even knows it's there.
Copy that.<eos> What have you got?<eos> Found a fresh print on that old pistol you guys recovered.<eos> Pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid.<eos> Ran it through AFIS, came up snake eyes.
He could've seen the agent punch in the lockbox code, then gone back there any time.<eos> Let's go get some... decent coffee.<eos> That's the apartment that the AC unit fell out of?<eos> It was pushed out.<eos> Yeah, I looked at it.
Big find in the tunnel collapse.<eos> How'd a belt get inside the tunnel?<eos> Guessing somebody disposed of it after they used it in a murder.<eos> Now, the prints come back to this guy.<eos> He must have left it on the belt when he fought back.
I had an image of Nikki... as a perfect... as a perfect face, perfect, uh... condition.<eos> The coroner told us, the only thing the coroner told us is that a portion of her thumb had been severed in the accident and that she had head trauma, but they never gave us any detail.<eos> So I always focused on the thumb.<eos> I received emails with the pictures attached and it was a short time after the accident.<eos> I didn't know who the email came from, and I opened it up.
He wanted us to find this.<eos> He's been watching us the whole time.<eos> Is the steak too well-done for you?<eos> I haven't eaten meat in ten years.<eos> I gave it up after you took my parents.
I got bad news, Ryan.<eos> Uh, I was not even sure, , if I was to tell you or not, But I do not think it's a damn things at the moment.<eos> What?<eos> There's a problem with the baby.<eos> We lost it.
- I know.<eos> I lost him.<eos> And as this one comes closer... you feel that grief again.<eos> And fear.<eos> Fear that you'll lose it, too?
What about the phone we found in Nolan's apartment?<eos> You found a phone?<eos> We need to see it.<eos> You'll have to wait your turn.<eos> Ah, well, the-the phone had a pretty intricate encryption on it, but I was able to crack it.
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Just take my word for it.<eos> I know you don't deserve that mark, but somebody else does.<eos> What if I were to tell you there's a way for me to transfer it to somebody a little bit more deserving?<eos> It should've been Damon all along.
What does that mean?<eos> It means that you don't need to worry.<eos> It's bad, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, in my job, when something goes wrong, I go down the chain of command, I find the broken link, I fix it.
It means that you don't need to worry.<eos> It's bad, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, in my job, when something goes wrong, I go down the chain of command, I find the broken link, I fix it.<eos> If I can't, I remove it.
Um, the chicken is a little...<eos> - Rubbery? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's tofu.<eos> Yeah, it's made from soy milk, an excellent source of "rubbery" protein, or so I'm told.
See that marker?<eos> When I was looking for Deiser out there, the creatures wouldn't come anywhere close.<eos> They don't like the markers.<eos> And the base is surrounded by them!<eos> If we can get it, we can use it to hold them off while we clear the ship.
I just want to distance myself from everything that happened.<eos> I hunkered down and powered through undergrad in just a year and a half.<eos> After seeing all that death, I felt the need to do something to prevent other people from dying.<eos> Mm. So now I'm in my first year of med school.<eos> Working three jobs to pay for it.
I just got that. Johnny?<eos> Are you on your way?<eos> You didn't mention that massive data transmission that Khlyen sent just before they blew up the base.<eos> - It was encrypted.<eos> - Find out where it went.
I believe the railway dissolves the unnecessary cultural divides of our region.<eos> Men can travel for work.<eos> Families unite.<eos> When you say..."our regions", sir, do you mean the counties of England?<eos> Because you may find that the people of, for instance, Staffordshire, are rather fond of the peculiar virtues of their region and don't necessarily want it disfigured by iron rails.
I didn't make the connection till he said the thing about the necklace.<eos> A couple years ago, I was playing poker with some guys.<eos> Fraternity brothers?<eos> And one of them talked about a necklace.<eos> Called it his trophy.
De la Rosa's rebreather.<eos> I mean, I checked it and rechecked it.<eos> There's no blockages, no mechanical issues...<eos> That's de la Rosa's actual unit?<eos> They call it a built-in breathing system.
So, Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about.<eos> But I know it's kind of a touchy subject.<eos> Way to narrow it down to everything.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, your birthday's coming up. And you've never let us celebrate it.
Don't ever come see me again.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> By the way, you disposed of that inhaler back then?<eos> This is the victim's inhaler that disappeared from the crime scene.<eos> Chief Interrogator Kang heard in the recording kept it in secret from you for the sake of his safety.
Last few weeks.<eos> Small amounts at first.<eos> A few thousand here and there, and then, yesterday, after Captain Grant was killed, the entire account was cleaned out.<eos> A million dollars.<eos> You think Tyson Reed stole it?
Small amounts at first.<eos> A few thousand here and there, and then, yesterday, after Captain Grant was killed, the entire account was cleaned out.<eos> A million dollars.<eos> You think Tyson Reed stole it?<eos> It was Kayla's pin code that was used to clear it out.
Emma was worried you might be missing it.<eos> Yeah, I was missing it.<eos> This isn't your earring, Norma.<eos> This is Emma's mother's.<eos> She was wearing it in the hospital.
Mine's my face.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> You don't seem like yourself tonight.<eos> Ready, and go!<eos> Aw, oh well, now I get to eat it.
Five years?<eos> This wine we're drinking...<eos> Nerello... it's from Mt.<eos> Etna. It's my favorite wine.<eos> Grown on the side of a volcano, but what is it about this wine that makes it so special?
And I wore it loud and proud. It's my lucky shirt.<eos> You don't want to mess around with St. Patty's day.<eos> I'm sorry, but this is one holiday I do not comprehend.<eos> I mean, it's supposed to last a day.<eos> Why does this city celebrate it for ten?
Oh, there you are.<eos> Okay. This is not normal operating procedure.<eos> Do you remember anything from last time?<eos> There is a log showing I was activated once before, but the file contains no data.<eos> Someone must have deleted it.
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.<eos> You changed the lock.<eos> I don't know what you're talking...<eos> The vault, the pass code. Back off.<eos> You changed it.
You changed the lock.<eos> I don't know what you're talking...<eos> The vault, the pass code. Back off.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yeah, we changed it, actually, several times.
- not the apartment.<eos> - Fine.<eos> With no handcuffs.<eos> Handcuffs are not optional.<eos> Not behind his back, do it in front where he can put a jacket over it.
Well, what vehicle did the shooter come here to claim?<eos> - Do we know? - Uh, the computer requires a log-in before we can search it for that, but the attendant gave our killer a HOLD slip for the DMV, so whatever car he came back for has an expired registration.<eos> They don't tow your car for that.<eos> But it's a good reason to not drive it around with a bag load of guns.<eos> So maybe that's why he left it.
House is clear, Chief.<eos> Copy.<eos> Severide, you find the leak?<eos> Not yet, Chief.<eos> Found it.
But we're better than you madmen and murderers.<eos> I got to know your kind fairly well when I was a child.<eos> When mom and I would visit dad in prison you, the cops, would strip us both naked.<eos> You'd call us a whore and a bastard.<eos> I can still hear the sniggering, I hear it whenever I see you.
Thumb tack man.<eos> I started removing the tacks, then got pulled into a critical case, handed it off to a nurse.<eos> And why did you not call for a trauma consult?<eos> The wounds are all shallow.<eos> I'm sealing it with surgical glue.
Yes, it's odd, but Marissa Kagan was killed in Bristol, Connecticut and Phoebe Elliot died in the Bronx.<eos> I mean, do you honestly think two different police departments in two different states, including the one we work in, are just gonna sprinkle DNA around whenever they need to close a case?<eos> That's right, Phoebe died in the Bronx.<eos> Marcus said the shooter's car was abandoned in Bridgeport, and that's also odd, isn't it?<eos> Someone stealing a car in Connecticut to commit a murder in New York, only to drive it all the way back to Connecticut.
Like when a bully makes you hit yourself.<eos> So if we can get to the white shoe office in Long Beach, then I can... I can hack their server, see if I can figure out a way to disrupt the hacker's signal.<eos> Then I tell the authorities in the other three cities how to do it, and then we kill the signal simultaneously and regain control of the ships.<eos> Now, Toby, I left my car in Tahoe and Paige's is at her house, so we'll need to borrow yours.<eos> Okay, but I just had it washed in '08, so be careful with it.
And 118 just so happens to be the same company that put out the fire this morning.<eos> This surveillence video is from the western annex of the bottling facility.<eos> The fire was nowhere near this location, and yet...<eos> Do we know who this guy is?<eos> Well, firefighters generally have their names printed on the bottom of their turnout jackets, but this bag is blocking it, and happens to be the perfect size for two stolen hard drives.
We're walking out of this place and that is it for me and Horace Pete's.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay, all Iâm saying is that you can take this and turn it into something new.<eos> Sylvia's place.<eos> Get rid of all these old ghosts and make it your own.
But you can't.<eos> Look, it's hard to look back on the rough stuff.<eos> I mean, I'm transgender, I get it.<eos> When I see pictures before my transition... (sighs) When I see pictures before my transition... (sighs)<eos> I just wanted to erase the first 16 years of my life, but you can't let go of all that pain and sadness when you lock it in.
Forensics found traces of blood. They thought it belonged to the intruders.<eos> You gave a sample of DNA and as it turned out, the blood was yours.<eos> Yes.<eos> We got DNA from the stamp on the letter that was sent to Nils Wendt... by Adelita.<eos> We matched it with yours.
Turned out to be a dead end.<eos> I'll let you know when I find Symon.<eos> Things are gonna change around here.<eos> You and I are gonna make a difference in this city.<eos> We're gonna clean it up.
Special Agent MacLaren of the FBI.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> "MacLaren"?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, sometimes, our computer spits stuff out and we have to follow it up.
Buddy! How do I lock this?<eos> Do you hear me? !<eos> Let it go.<eos> What?<eos> I don't think they know how to work it.
You just can't hear us.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - Your implants. Your army implants.<eos> The Mass system?<eos> They put it in your head to help you fight, and when it works, you see us as something other.
I'd rather that than being stuck in a telephone box with a panicking gorilla.<eos> - Rubbish.<eos> - It was trying to kill me.<eos> - It wants to hurt me.<eos> - That's why I like it.
You got kids.<eos> I can tell that.<eos> Yeah, I sure do. Why are you sleeping in your car?<eos> Uh, I'm tired all the time.<eos> I call it Momstein Bar.
Drop your weapon.<eos> Logan?<eos> Hello, Jamie.<eos> The best thing you can do for Mitch and Jamie is to work with us to prepare the cure.<eos> Now, even if Mitch's protocols work, we haven't finalized a way to distribute it.
How?<eos> Metallo isn't just flesh and blood anymore.<eos> Cadmus has given him a metal endoskeleton.<eos> Traces of the alloy had to end up on my hands when I hit him.<eos> I can analyze it at the Fortress of Solitude.
In fact, I found this photo in the Hawthorne house.<eos> - When did you...<eos> - The belt is clearly the same one that SBK used to murder David Morales.<eos> They found it in a bag of clothes the family gave to Goodwill.<eos> Gunther was the guy who took it there.
Because we're announcing our best initiative yet, which is we're opening the New York Symphony Youth Orchestra!<eos> But for now, this orchestra, the main orchestra, we desperately need, we desperately need your help, so please,<eos> - if you could open-- - Any child-- Any child that wants to learn an instrument, he can come to us.<eos> And this amazing long-term vision can only be possible with your near-term support.<eos> And if there's a child that doesn't have an instrument, because most of them don't have an instrument, well, we're going to give it to them for free!
I was just out there fishing when he offered me the drugs.<eos> Yeah. I turned him down, of course.<eos> The guy in my cell got the drugs from your creel.<eos> No, no, no. Hold on. Y-You found drugs in my creel?<eos> No. 'Cause you kicked it over into the river.
What the hell is she doing?<eos> Nailed it.<eos> What do you mean you nailed it?<eos> What did you even do?<eos> I simply told Agent Albee that there was new information on the flash drive and she's going to deliver it with the rest.
I'll do my best.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Secretary Eun! Let me look.<eos> It's still wet in the crotch.<eos> Dry it some more.
Hey!<eos> What about this?<eos> Um, Dalton's not on the ballot because of the sore loser law, right?<eos> Just recently, the NFL changed the extra point rule...<eos> Yeah, too many kickers were making it, so they moved it back to the 15 yard line.
Patience is not a virtue amongst the city's contractors.<eos> Isn't Mr. Binks the seventh man you've interviewed?<eos> Yes, and he made the short list based on his budget parsimony.<eos> But I don't think he fully appreciates the intricacies of my design, Julia.<eos> He doesn't need to appreciate it to build it, surely.
Ah, it won't work.<eos> The crate may be old, but it's still military grade.<eos> Can you get me a closer look at that?<eos> What you're looking at there is a tubular lock.<eos> Pinnacle of security in the 1960s, before it became a go-to lock for bicycles and thieves figured out how to hack it using a ballpoint pen.
I mean, these corporate guys, they're out for blood.<eos> Okay? They are vicious, savage monsters.<eos> - Hey, everybody. - Hi.<eos> Um, these are welcome back flowers.<eos> - Oh. - They gave me a packet of, uh, plant food for it, but I left it in the car. But, anyway... here.
Well, you're daft if you think I'll spend any longer in this underwater coffin than I have to.<eos> I know your heart is filled with hatred, seeking revenge.<eos> This harpoon was enchanted to help me find wayward souls like your own.<eos> And then what?<eos> Fill it with something else?
It's from the data going out.<eos> There is a bug on this server that is effectively removing the software that counts and collates every single vote that has been cast.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Someone is sucking the info from this server.<eos> And once whoever planted the bug gets it, they can change it however they want and then put it back in.
Well, when Snow broke that mirror, it gave me an idea.<eos> Now, we can't hurt the queen, but maybe we can trap her.<eos> In a mirror?<eos> In the world behind the mirror.<eos> Anyway, I can enchant it to imprison her.
9,000!<eos> That's bike territory.<eos> But the best thing is the way it goes round corners.<eos> Because it's got four-wheel steering, and because the engine is sitting right over the rear axle, the grip is just astonishing.<eos> I've engaged all the hero buttons down here, turned all the electronic driver aids off, and let see if I can unstick it.
Our system.<eos> It's been hacked.<eos> Impossible.<eos> We've got more firewalls than the NSA's Utah Data Center.<eos> And I personally turn it inside-out every morning.
I'm going to go take the victim's personal effects up to Abby.<eos> Yes, I'd take them up myself, but she still thinks I'm sick, despite the fact that I have kept dry toast down for 24 hours.<eos> Did we miss something?<eos> The victim's necklace.<eos> I didn't notice it when I removed it, but... there's an inscription on the back.
Good.<eos> So, it turns out that America's favorite vice presidential candidate and the CIA's most wanted mercenary know each other.<eos> -You're not buying it's a coincidence.<eos> -Sorry. If Catalan worked intel on the 11/14 mission, the CIA would have a file on it.<eos> Did you pull it?
Who?<eos> It was Nikki.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> I knew as soon as I saw this picture.<eos> She took it in Ojai at a vineyard about a year ago.
I know Baby Weller is the star here, but this cake is gonna give the kid a run for its money.<eos> Patterson.<eos> It's a small party.<eos> - No, I get it. - Yeah.<eos> Allie wanted to throw it.
He'll have to wait for the owner to leave.<eos> This is his chance.<eos> A real treasure.<eos> A scarlet heart.<eos> "Got it."
And if you think about it, D-O-I-N-G shouldn't be doing.<eos> It should be freaking "doyng."<eos> Nick, you got 'em?<eos> You look like you should be paying child support in Florida.<eos> I get Nick the perfect gift, and then he goes and buys it for himself.
And I still find you abrasive, unforgiving, and completely unsuitable for a long-term adult relationship.<eos> Glad we're on the same page.<eos> What's going on, Frankie?<eos> We got DNA results on the confession letter.<eos> Traced it back to an ex-con named Harold Redding.
[Kember] I think they wanted the company as much as we did. [laughs]<eos> I think they were pretty bored.<eos> There was this movie called Con Air.<eos> One of the prisoners, he's got... embedded a piece of wire in his hand here, and he's like... He pulls it out. [grunts quietly]<eos> So then he sticks it in the little hole of the handcuff, and he springs it open.
Thirty million.<eos> - I told them to lick my balls.<eos> I don't take charity.<eos> - You're gonna let them keep $30 million?<eos> No. Come on. I told them I want an equity stake in the movie for it.
- Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Anyway, checkout's noon. - Sweet.<eos> Christ, what, did he send you out here to check up on me?<eos> Well, the hotel didn't know what to do with the damn piano.<eos> So I thought you might want it.
Well, the hotel didn't know what to do with the damn piano.<eos> So I thought you might want it.<eos> - I don't want his piano.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, it took six hours to move it out of the Hilton and I don't know anyone else in New Jersey. So tough shit.
We're almost there!<eos> We're there!<eos> That's Omotemachi!<eos> Even if you destroy their limbs or head.. They'll quickly regenerate. But this spot right here!<eos> If the nape is severely damaged.. It will perish without regenerating.
Now, see, Tanya, Lika, There's a part of the story that...<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> I'm gonna stick the gun up her fucking cunt!<eos> Put it in your mouth!<eos> You're gonna keep it in your fucking mouth, aren't you?
Mr. Wallington? Is that you?<eos> Samantha, you back yet?<eos> Sam?<eos> Told you last night I'd make breakfast. Why don't you go back to bed?<eos> I'd like to do it, Franklin.
- Couldn't have.<eos> - The one in the corner.<eos> Didn't know it was a desk until I opened it.<eos> Oh, that's not my desk, it's John's.<eos> He left it at Baker Street when he went off to get married.
You use Hickman?<eos> De Chepe.<eos> A minor scholar, but very good at labyrinths.<eos> It was meant to be impenetrable.<eos> How did you break it?
Anation, likea person, hassomethingdeeper, somethingmorepermanent, somethinglargerthan thesumof allits parts.<eos> Itisthatsomethingwhich mattersmostto itsfuture.<eos> - It's yours.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Here, take it.
Oh.<eos> I'm so sorry. Uh, how about I buy you a cup of coffee and we can talk about it?<eos> I got to say this guy's pain felt so real.<eos> It's hard to believe he was faking it.<eos> My guess is he probably gets some kind of perverse pleasure from it, grew up unable to access any kind of real emotion, so he started mimicking it, found out he had a true talent.
Can you please link that to my Etsy account?<eos> Yeah, what's your login?<eos> J, don't worry.<eos> The video's public, but my account's private.<eos> So, nobody knows who uploaded it, or who's in it.
A few days ago.<eos> Unfortunately, though, I can't give you any further information.<eos> What this means?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> - There wasn't any money. So I shut it down.
Are we making friends up there?<eos> You think I don't know this house hates me?<eos> Think it doesn't try this every time?<eos> Tries to warn people?<eos> I made a wish, and it has to give me what I asked for...
Her?<eos> Michael discovered mother quite by accident when the orchard was suffering from a terrible blight.<eos> Only one tree survived, absorbing the fungus rather than being consumed by it.<eos> Later, Michael discovered a curious effect in the fruit.<eos> It made the mortal men who ate it unable to father children.
No one asked you... Budhan...<eos> Yes<eos> Where have you kept my luggage...?<eos> In that room down there...<eos> No...keep it up stairs...in that room...
Then you're fine with spending 10 years in prison?<eos> You know Moon from Mirae Motors?<eos> He was their accounting manager?<eos> He was about to hand me the slush fund files 2 years ago.<eos> But Jang and Oh had a hunting dog to intercept it before I got it.
You remember Moon Il-seok?<eos> Ex-accounting manager of Mirae Motors.<eos> He was going to give me the slush fund file 2 years back.<eos> The records from Mirae Motors.<eos> But a fucking rat intercepted it.
Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. No, not at all.<eos> Take your time. No, not at all.<eos> What's this?<eos> Chairman, I'll pick up your shit from now on!<eos> - Yes, you get it and eat it!
Take your time. No, not at all.<eos> What's this?<eos> Chairman, I'll pick up your shit from now on!<eos> - Yes, you get it and eat it!<eos> - You eat it!
I'm not dying of anything.<eos> I've got a vial of Klaus' blood in my place right across the river along with enough blood to satisfy all of you.<eos> All we have to do is get there.<eos> You once asked me what I was fighting for.<eos> I told you I was fighting for this city, for our home, but if we feed out there, we lose it.
Why are you looking at me?<eos> How would I know?<eos> Hey, Can't find it.<eos> She lost her car key.<eos> I put it in her bag.
Don't know<eos> Marudheera The palace washerman wanted to meet you secretly<eos> I saw this leaf in your bedspread<eos> I've been eating this from when I was young<eos> Do you know what it does?
- Mmm-hmm. Okay, good. Evil eye is off of you.<eos> Don't you gotta break it or some shit?<eos> I'll break it in the morning when I cook it.<eos> What? But you can't feed somebody my problems!<eos> What... what if I eat it back?
And I cannot wait to spend every day that I am allowed to with you, and then when you are out, just every day."<eos> Vince I'm just so happy and honored to be Lorna Muccio.<eos> And for that, I think you very much-io.<eos> I'm not a great writer like you, so I-l have a poem to read.<eos> "In my life, there's been heartache and pain. I don't know if I can face it again.
Hey, Pop.<eos> You want me to take you home?<eos> Nope.<eos> What's the score?<eos> No, we should have it at the inn.
Okay, we can do that.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's not here.<eos> It's at my apartment.<eos> Well, if it's your favorite, I'd like to try it.
A bag of gold.<eos> I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.<eos> It was a heavy bag.<eos> And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.<eos> But you won't be around if he breaks it.
Excuse me.<eos> Allowance?<eos> Your family has you on an allowance?<eos> No. No. It's my money.<eos> I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.
I could hear her in the stands cheering for her man.<eos> A man who wasn't me.<eos> I never felt that kind of pain.<eos> I didn't know what to do with it.<eos> So I gave it to Oscar to deal with instead.
Come to think of it...<eos> Lord Pallas has been behaving oddly.<eos> Just the other day, he asked me about his olive tree.<eos> What?<eos> It's sick, and he wanted to cut it down.
As your son, I wanted to restore military control back into your hands...<eos> You think I left things as they are because I'm ignorant?<eos> My policy of 'Magnificent Harmony'...<eos> You rendered my life's work worthless in just one day.<eos> The throne is not a place for making decisions. It's a place to moderate decisions and ask who's responsible.
Good shot!<eos> It's like something out of a dream, Sal.<eos> The way the light bounces off it, it's changing all the time.<eos> It's...<eos> We ought to grab it before some other bugger does.
We'll all profit nicely under the new structure.<eos> How nicely?<eos> - Tell Mr. Fisk...<eos> - We don't say his name.<eos> Tell... Mr. Fisk... that if he wants a pound of flesh... he can come here and carve it himself.
I'm a policeman.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll get it back.
cancel your IPO.<eos> Or what?<eos> If you go through with it, I will dig up the dirt of your past and bury your Empire and everyone in it.<eos> And I think I'm gonna change the name of this place.<eos> I'm gonna call it Cookie's.
I cut a check for that and your signing bonus this morning.<eos> So you want to help the Nation?<eos> No. Never.<eos> But it's your money-- you do with it as you choose.<eos> But if I was you, I would... rebuild the center and put a studio in there, naming it after myself... so I could protect my legacy.
Since when do you mock me?<eos> It would be better if I got a fixed monthly pension.<eos> So I know what I to expect.<eos> Now I have this.<eos> It is a good amount of money. Take it.
That for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Guess this means I'm going back to rehab.<eos> As soon as I start this car.<eos> Where'd you get it from?
Look!<eos> - They've deleted them.<eos> Give me the key.<eos> Give me the key!<eos> They've changed it.
Give me the key.<eos> Give me the key!<eos> They've changed it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You knew I was here and you changed it!
Look, I-I'm...<eos> I'm sorry to even ask this, but the passports and the phone that Michael said he saw in your safe, did he just make that all up?<eos> No. Not all of it.<eos> I do keep cash in there, and I needed an international phone when I traveled to find Luisa.<eos> And I heard that Michael was snooping around, so I moved it.
We're taking Maddie off the pacifiers, so we planted them, and now lollipops will grow.<eos> Oh, I don't think you understand how gardening works.<eos> I don't think you understand how children work.<eos> Why doesn't your bike have a seat on it?<eos> Oh, I traded it for the gay penguin book.
Take a look in the mirror.<eos> Those remains in the Night Room, they were human?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jennifer said it was the origin of the virus.<eos> - We destroyed it. It's gone.
I mean, the frame is the gift.<eos> I just think those weird pictures that come in there are creepy.<eos> You know, it's like who are these smiling people that we don't know?<eos> So I don't know.<eos> I just... I just replaced it, but...
Okay, Barry's mother's body was found here, knife beside her, blood spatter on the wall belonged to Nora.<eos> Joe, I think...<eos> I just think maybe it's been too long, and everything's different.<eos> Except that mirror.<eos> Sherry must have bought it at the estate sale.
~ He's asleep.<eos> ~ Listen, tell him the trial's still on.<eos> But, also - and you need to know this, too -<eos> Claire Ripley showed me a photograph. She was wearing Pippa's pendant.<eos> Can you get hold of it?
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And somehow that's flattering on you.<eos> Is he gonna be all right?<eos> Well, he has a slight concussion, he dislocated his shoulder, and we had to put him under to reset it.
Take good care of it, boy.<eos> Will do.<eos> Need a ride?<eos> Okay.<eos> So I found it.
Pulled up the coordinates and a satellite view.<eos> Hey, what's with the tattoo?<eos> It's an I Ching hexagram.<eos> Means "force of the small."<eos> My dad used to draw it for me to remind me to be brave.
Yeah, then why do it?<eos> Uh, the only way to find out is to backtrack the proto-beast.<eos> Use the scent in one of the victims and see who he caught the bug from.<eos> Okay, so there's enough in there for me to identify it in a victim?<eos> Extracted it from my own blood.
He said he just wanted to drive the car some more.<eos> That seem odd to you? [Voice breaking] No.<eos> I'm an early bird, but Jason had this incredible energy.<eos> Like, he was just so happy to be living the life he was living.<eos> Like, he appreciated it more because of how hard he had to work for it.
-Yes<eos> -But on a massive scale.<eos> -It has the same magnesium mandibles.<eos> -That explains the presence of formic acid in the bedrock surrounding it.<eos> -It spits out the acid to soften the rocks, while the mandibles chew through it.
Jess asked me to clear out Tom's room.<eos> She just can't.<eos> Hey, do you still have Jess' house key?<eos> We should really get that back.<eos> I don't know where Nat keeps it, but I'll take a look.
The wall may be down, but I sense that some of Ingrid's magic remains.<eos> Yeah, leaving this town has never been simple. And Ingrid?<eos> She didn't change things.<eos> She wanted to be here alone with you and me.<eos> She wanted to make Storybrooke her ice castle, and clearly she wanted to protect it.
The American dream.<eos> Everybody's chasing it.<eos> Some find it.
Major Hewlett.<eos> What is this about?<eos> Release me.<eos> Maybe we'll just release your tongue.<eos> Tell another lie and I will see it scrutinized, whatever webs you weave, I will cut.
We can only survive!<eos> I know of one man powerful enough to turn the tide in our favor.<eos> Vlad.<eos> The Ottomans stole his armor.<eos> 'You get the armor's secrets, and the Crusade gets the man who made it.'
We're missing something.<eos> Max, you got a minute?<eos> I found a discrepancy in the employee access logs.<eos> The server automatically stores backup files to a secondary disk, but last week's files were corrupted.<eos> Did you restore it?
Dan Tana at 8:00.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> We presume it was a student.<eos> We're currently combing through the security footage.<eos> I want to see it.
Kind of an acquired taste.<eos> I wanted to celebrate my good luck with my good friend.<eos> I got a call from Northrop.<eos> There's an opening in fuselage assembly-- same thing I do now, except in this time zone.<eos> So, you got it?
Maybe some of you heard me on the radio offering my own hard-earned money for the capture of a dangerous fugitive.<eos> Or maybe I contacted you with a generous offer for your property,<eos> the kind of offer that makes all manner of things possible, things maybe you hadn't even gotten around to dreaming of.<eos> But I didn't come here just to make us all a lot of money, though I intend to do that.<eos> And I didn't come here to reverse this town's fortunes, save it from falling prey to the ghosts that dwell in these streets and hollers.
- At Princeton. Wait, all right, hold on. You're saying there are 3 million infected in New York City?<eos> There will be by the time we get this tested, refined, - and mass produced.<eos> - Jesus. Wow, I mean, this could be your polio vaccine, Leigh.<eos> Hm? This solution stops these things in their tracks.<eos> We can study it further once it's contained, but not before.
See? We're bonding already.<eos> Tell him I have a thing for him.<eos> Do you have a thing for him?<eos> I have your number.<eos> I'll text it to you.
You were digging ditches in San Jose for pennies a day, and you make $125 a month as construction manager for the greatest enterprise in the history of America.<eos> All I'm saying is, $15 a day means a whole lot more to those men than it does to this enterprise.<eos> Back in Sacramento, during the rush of '49, every jackanape with a dollar and a dream wanted to turn up his fortune in gold.<eos> Now, the thing about gold is, it's buried in the ground.<eos> If you wanna get it out, you gotta dig it up.
He'd need a booster to amplify the wireless signal so he could access it above ground.<eos> - What does a booster look like?<eos> - A plastic box.<eos> Small.<eos> He could tape it anywhere, but he'd want line of sight for a better signal.
- Call a plumber.<eos> - Come on, can't you fix it?<eos> - Ma, the pipes behind those walls are like an M.C. Escher painting.<eos> Even dad couldn't untangle that mess.<eos> Well, who do you think tangled it in the first place?
The kids.<eos> He promised them.<eos> What did he promise them?<eos> This trip.<eos> They've been talking about coming to Hawaii ever since they saw it on one of their TV shows.
It's not that bad?<eos> There's no wheels on my car.<eos> There's no physical damage other than parts missing, and those are all replaceable.<eos> They're not replaceable.<eos> Everything on this car except for the windshield is original from the factory, just like the day my dad brought it home.
But I love him... No judgment.<eos> My wife and I adopted a four-year-old girl, Micah.<eos> I also do alarm systems, in case you're in the market.<eos> Give me your contact info, I'll put you down on my weekly e-mail blast.<eos> All the guys get it.
Well, I'd have to, uh...<eos> Dr. Oppenheimer.<eos> Do you ride, Charlie?<eos> I'm a Jew from St. Louis.<eos> When a horse won't take the saddle, you can send it to the glue factory.
- She never says no to a slice.<eos> Oh, God, what's that smell?<eos> It sure as hell isn't pizza.<eos> Clams, it's New Haven-style pizza.<eos> - I had it when I was at Yale.
So how are we gonna beat him?<eos> Well, ever since I was shown a drained radiation tag, which I haven't been able to stop thinking about.<eos> - Thank you, Cisco.<eos> - You're welcome, Caitlin.<eos> If this guy likes radiation so much, I say we give it to him.
Someone left this letter on my desk.<eos> It's addressed to the queen of Navarre, Antoine's wife.<eos> It's an invitation to the tasting.<eos> Written by you.<eos> Um... it must have been dropped off here by a servant, after the queen presented it.
He embedded a RAT in one particular video file.<eos> Basically, it allowed him to live inside my computer.<eos> It was the video of us with Hannah in the park.<eos> The last time all three of us were together.<eos> Can I see it?
Nice, right?<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> That is, uh, out near Waimanalo.<eos> Um, a friend of a friend's place.<eos> We got it for the weekend, so...
Long time, no see.<eos> Now, um, give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip your balls off.<eos> She's not going to do it, can see it in her eyes.<eos> Whoa! Sex is a natural urge.<eos> Well, I put a lid on it.
I've been trying to find the right moment to do this. I got this ring ‭from your mom in Norfolk and her blessing, and I-I just think it's probably --<eos> *We'll roll the old chariot along*<eos> Are you the lady who made the cure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can I get it?
Can I get it?<eos> Well, weren't you in the park earlier? No.<eos> I missed the party.<eos> Well, with so many people exposed, it's likely you caught it just walking into the hotel.<eos> Still, I'd like to get it from you... for history and all.
In your suffering... I see love.<eos> In mine... hatred.<eos> Your pain...<eos> It draws light into the world.<eos> My pain... Repels it.
Why didn't you come out here and look for that flower yourself?<eos> I'm not exactly welcome on Nighthorse's property. So you send me out here to trespass for you?<eos> You're not trespassing, and I would never send you into danger. I honestly had no idea anyone was gonna be firing a weapon out here.<eos> Now can you please show me where you saw that flower?<eos> How's about I just point it out through the window for you?
When the car was dumped, it was empty.<eos> Don't let this get to the media.<eos> Wrap it UP-<eos> The last call from Sam's mobile was made on 2nd October at 07:12 pm.<eos> The signal indicates, that it was located in Pondolem.
Let's go!<eos> Miko, there's no way out of here!<eos> You're surrounded!<eos> There's a light switch.<eos> - Let's hit it. - Got it.
And they were determined that they were going to get money, so they followed me home.<eos> ~ With a baseball bat.<eos> ~ With a baseball bat.<eos> And I walked up to the front door, my mum answered and there were these two people, um, wanting money, standing behind me.<eos> And she had the sense of mind to look in her wallet and pretend that she only had 20, and so she gave it to them and... ~ And they were happy?
That should hold it for a bit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got to hand it to you, that was quick thinking with the pipe.<eos> We got to move.<eos> This door has been warped by the heat. I think I can fix it.
What kind of Librarian art thou?<eos> ! The kind who knows that sometimes you have to turn your back on power.<eos> This ending does not fill the story's page, but only marks a chapter on the stage.<eos> I will find another object with which to wield my rage!<eos> You burned it?
This ending does not fill the story's page, but only marks a chapter on the stage.<eos> I will find another object with which to wield my rage!<eos> You burned it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> To keep Prospero from it.
Well, his e-mails to his lawyer say somebody just showed up and donated it to his collection... for safekeeping.<eos> Yeah, I cracked his e-mails.<eos> So you buy that?<eos> It's the key to lost knowledge, mate.<eos> If Prospero did steal it, he went to a lot of trouble just to give it away.
[Grunting] [Sword thuds]<eos> You are but a story. - I... unwrite thee!<eos> [Panting and grunting]<eos> Don't worry. This isn't how your story ends.<eos> [Weakly] Flynn, his staff is his pen. Break it, and you can rewrite the story.
I think we should have a long conversation about parenting decisions.<eos> Uh-oh. Gone.<eos> Off to work.<eos> Steve, how did you learn to cook like this?<eos> Got the recipe off YouTube, but I made it my own.
And Swedish radio ...<eos> What a mess.<eos> How long did you follow Anna Ekdahl to get the photos?<eos> I got a tip that she was in Copenhagen.<eos> I wish I'd never gotten it.
What, someone you know?<eos> Sometimes, sometimes not.<eos> So anyone can turn up with a subject and expect to get paid for it?<eos> - Yeah, in principle.<eos> - Would you care where they sourced it?
Oh, he's already in custody.<eos> I need you to spearhead the mining operation.<eos> So why do we need these amethysts?<eos> They power the dome. Like batteries.<eos> The egg kept them charged, but when it was destroyed, the amethysts began to lose their energy.
'Cause I need it.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Okay. So I'm your lawyer now, Kalinda, and this dollar represents attorney-client privilege.<eos> Sure.<eos> You faked metadata, and Diane presented it in court to get Cary released, yes?
They both were.<eos> You ever seen a picture of Bobby?<eos> They sent it to me.<eos> I erased my phone.<eos> But I may have saved it to the cloud.
I don't think it's a good idea to test Mr. Bishop's power.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he has people like me working for him.<eos> You know, uh, I downloaded a flash drive of data from Bishop's computer, and it had receipts and notes on your, uh, employment.<eos> But I didn't see a reason to give it to the state's attorney's office.
We're hit!<eos> D.C. central, dispatch teams to portside midships.<eos> Fire on deck 4, portside amidships!<eos> Fire in the magazine! Fire in the magazine!<eos> Captain, fire in the weapons room! Flood it! Flood projectiles magazine!
Please leave me a message.<eos> - You find anything?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Most microchips are about the size of a grain of rice and all they contain is an ID number, but.. Ours feels bigger.<eos> It's like A modified it so that he could track our every move.
They are among the most powerful men and women on the planet.<eos> They are also part of a global conspiracy a shadow organization that spans across every continent and has for the last three decades consisting of leaders in world government and the private sector.<eos> The world you live in is the world they want you to think you live in.<eos> They start wars, create chaos.<eos> And when it suits them, they resolve it.
Eddie Reynolds is appealing against his conviction for organising Susan's murder.<eos> ~ On what grounds?<eos> ~ That the police withheld evidence.<eos> The CCTV images.<eos> ~ You withheld it?
If my trouble can fix it, you know I have to try, Gloria.<eos> Yeah, well, it doesn't mean I have to like it.<eos> It's really good, Vickie.<eos> When I'm done, if we fold it here, the crack in the core should close.<eos> And then we will give it to Vince, and finally we can build a new Barn.
Wheatley, get ready to hit the building from the river.<eos> Tower ladders on my signal.<eos> That'll cook anyone in there.<eos> There's no way they have any air left, and that hose line isn't big enough to get them out.<eos> I'm cutting off the water and sending it to the tower ladder.
Do not do anything hasty that you will spend eternity regretting, Mary.<eos> For he is already lost.<eos> I feel the presence of my love inside him.<eos> Nothing is lost if he yet lives.<eos> Fire runs through my veins like blood, and I will burn it before you even have time to blink.
There's a woman out here to see you.<eos> Intimidate me and pin murders on me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Y'all so tough with the gun and the badge on.<eos> Homey, take it off and see what happens.
He didn't want me going on the bus.<eos> He didn't nick it until the next day.<eos> - The day after that copper got shot.<eos> - So, he stole the car?<eos> Yeah. As soon as Riley saw it, he wanted it.
59!<eos> I'm 59!<eos> 'Your PIN has failed.'<eos> You spent much?<eos> I'm just looking after it for someone.
There isn't much time.'<eos> I need someone to stand guard and shout if someone's coming.<eos> On it.<eos> Come on! Let's at least look for the key.<eos> If you find it let me know.
Ready?<eos> Twister!<eos> Leroy!<eos> It's okay.<eos> We summoned it.
What are you waiting for?<eos> Kill her.<eos> Stop!<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now... crush it.
Those records are lost.<eos> Look, anything short of turning into a zombie is good, no?<eos> Don't be so sure about that.<eos> I know it's in there. I know it.<eos> I just got to find somebody to go in there and get it.
Today is a truly great day!<eos> Everyone, eat and be merry!<eos> Then later, let's meet at the village square and talk.<eos> Did you go check?<eos> The wind blew it over, so that's how they got in.
Why should I be?<eos> It's a beautiful night.<eos> The weather is nice, and I'm enjoying my cigarette.<eos> The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it.<eos> Work around it or work through it.
It was our dream, Anna.<eos> We have nothing.<eos> I have my trust-fund.<eos> That's your money.<eos> It's OUR money, and we could invest it in the vineyard, maybe try again and hire some help.
You need some answers, right?<eos> You can find him through the electoral register.<eos> I'm sorry for the mess.<eos> It's my mother's stuff.<eos> I should have thrown it out years ago.
That voice in my head was right.<eos> I don't want to give up the darkness. - Not yet.<eos> - What?<eos> I need to use it one last time.<eos> I brought the dagger and the flame, but you don't get it until you free my family.
- What?<eos> I need to use it one last time.<eos> I brought the dagger and the flame, but you don't get it until you free my family.<eos> No.<eos> You will hand it over now, or I unleash Merlin.
The roaming charges alone are going to bankrupt me.<eos> We're discussing how to take away<eos> Savage's newfound power. And his magic stick thing.<eos> Yeah, staff of Horus.<eos> Well, it's protected by some kind of energy field.
PRC government already controls Internet access pretty tightly.<eos> What would they want with, uh, Gail Sarkisian's research?<eos> In my experience, those with a great deal of power are often the same people who want a great deal more.<eos> There's little doubt that the Communist Party has an extensive and illustrious track record with propaganda, and then Drs. Weller and Sarkisian come along and perfect the art-- so the question then becomes:<eos> Did China kill to acquire it?
- _<eos> - I've pushed him as hard as I can.<eos> He's at the end of his tether.<eos> You were saying?<eos> Oh, go ahead. Crush it.
That was indur who walked out, zero's father.<eos> And that's what's left of zero's rifle?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Figure his old man should have it.<eos> I'll bring it to him.
Ishaq, there's a closed gas station two and a quarter miles northeast of you.<eos> Go there now and wait...<eos> What the hell?<eos> Sat phone lost connection.<eos> Can you get it back?
Then why is time still being erased?<eos> ! Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> We can't. We... we can't go.<eos> Rigby, what's going on? There's a second time machine, and our past selves are headed to the high school to finish it!
Silver nitrate.<eos> It's gonna heat the wound, forcing the blood to coagulate.<eos> God! Aah!<eos> Looks like some trace transferred off whatever was used to sever the finger.<eos> I'm gonna run it through the mass spec.
You know what, though? I can understand the appeal.<eos> Arrows are quiet, untraceable, accurate from a distance.<eos> So, we got a remote location, middle of the night.<eos> I'm thinking maybe it could've been a money drop.<eos> And maybe the killer, seeing right away that the money is counterfeit, just leaves it here.
Our target.<eos> He infected the camera's charger with malware, and then snuck it into the precinct.<eos> Once he found out what type of body cams they used, he copied the packaging, disguised himself as a delivery man, and dropped off the infected hardware.<eos> He was in and out in under a minute.<eos> Then, when it was plugged in, it began crawling through the network until it found the chief's computer and took over.
Why?<eos> When did you learn to work your way around the undercarriage of a Lamborghini?<eos> I failed home ec.<eos> Are you gonna answer my question?<eos> Maybe he knew the person who took it.
Now, the name of the patient is Mary Pattinson.<eos> - That's P-A-T-T-I-N ...<eos> - I can spell her name.<eos> And yet you can't locate her file.<eos> I will fetch it in a minute.
"Contained" being the operative word.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> - Thing is, we don't have to.<eos> - That planner also had notes of official White House meetings.<eos> By destroying it, you violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978.
- What's happening? What about the ink inside the diaper?<eos> Does it run?<eos> I've tested it myself.<eos> Let's leave it at that.<eos> What I'm saying is I wore it.
- And does she eat it?<eos> Does she pick her nose and then...<eos> No, no.<eos> Thank you, God.<eos> She wipes it on the sheets.
Look, Avery, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Laptop's got nothing on it.<eos> The last thing Darko said was "Python's name is on that laptop."<eos> I already had a friend who died.<eos> Find it and find it now.
Okay. We know that the killer broke into Vivian's house.<eos> We ran the place for prints, and they'll be back any minute.<eos> Really?<eos> You have fingerprints?<eos> We also know that the killer is looking for The American, and he or she has an encryption key that Vivian had, and that he or she is trying to crack it.
But we can't place him in Syd's room anyway.<eos> What?<eos> That kid magician stole my watch.<eos> This flower had color and could bloom once.<eos> And yet death, blind to the beauty of all living things, even one as vibrant as this, has swept over it, wrenching it closer to the ground.
So he gave me the address, and then when I got to the street, these two guys appeared out of nowhere.<eos> One of them hits me on the head. The other one grabs my violin case.<eos> Why did you take your violin with you if it's so valuable?<eos> My insurance policy.<eos> It's got to be with me at all times.
The implication is that this may have been before Teresa Halbach even is reported missing.<eos> What I'm left with is this jury having heard testimony from the first blood relative of Mr. Avery to testify here, his nephew and next-door neighbor, that amounts to a confession of a crime.<eos> There is no way to unwind this from the jury's mind.<eos> It has enormous unfair prejudicial impact.<eos> If there were a remedy short of a mistrial, and I don't know that there is, it would be something like the court instructing the jury that it may disregard as false all of Bobby Dassey's testimony
That's not how it is--<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> It's not how it-- Shut up!<eos> That's not all!<eos> I also thought you stole a huge fucking bag of guns and brought it back to my house!
This mural requires...<eos> Please, please, please, please.<eos> Don't argue after a meal.<eos> It upsets the digestion.<eos> And since this "masterpiece," as you call it, will soon be dust, this is our last chance to drink like our decadent ancestors.
As long as you're back there, past and present will continue to coexist.<eos> But once you wake up... whatever you've done will take hold and become history.<eos> And for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know.<eos> It will be like the last 50 years never happened.<eos> And this world, and this war... the only person who will remember it is you.
Where we gonna get...<eos> We don't have $25,000!<eos> - We're not giving it to Howard! - We're not.<eos> It's insane.<eos> We're gonna let this little freak show just post it up on the Internet for the entire world to see?
And whenever I tell somebody I don't wanna play college ball in my senior year, nobody listens to me.<eos> It's like I'm talking Chinese on another fucking planet!<eos> And then the coach tells me I don't have the market value I would have if I don't play out my senior year.<eos> But what he doesn't know is I got a fucking knee.<eos> You have it looked at away from the department?
Plus, I'm hungry.<eos> Um... We're gonna starve.<eos> Not if you like mustard.<eos> Why don't you have food?<eos> Well, I had food, and then we ate it all when we were really high.
It'll be okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay. Kill me!<eos> Fuck. Here we go.<eos> These cameras, this film... it's proof.<eos> I hope someone finds it and uses it to show others.
Here, I'll read it for you.<eos> Mr. George Briggs, care of Mrs. Altha Carter, Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa.<eos> So?<eos> I put banknotes for $300 inside this envelope, just for you.<eos> Well, why not let me have it now?
Mr. George Briggs, care of Mrs. Altha Carter, Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa.<eos> So?<eos> I put banknotes for $300 inside this envelope, just for you.<eos> Well, why not let me have it now?<eos> Right this minute I'm going to the Post Office to put it in the mail.
I put banknotes for $300 inside this envelope, just for you.<eos> Well, why not let me have it now?<eos> Right this minute I'm going to the Post Office to put it in the mail.<eos> Why not carry it along with us?<eos> When we get to Hebron, Mrs. Carter will have it for you.
What, you're just gonna tear down my bakery?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, I wanna offer you a very fair price, then tear it down. What about the tree house, Dad? No, don't worry about the tree house, Waldo.<eos> We'll uproot the tree and tree house and we'll have it moved right into our backyard. That's our tree house. Yeah!<eos> Not after my daddy buys it.
You just said my place was great.<eos> - Oh, you're serious.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What would I do with all my nice things?<eos> Well, you could sell the nice things or you could store it or... I don't know. I...
No other piercings, right?<eos> .<eos> No.<eos> (female lab technician) I know it sounds crazy, but I have to ask.<eos> If there's any ferrous metal anywhere inside your body, the magnetic field will put it out, and forcibly.
I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories.<eos> On the one hand, you can sugarcoat it.
Was there an answer?<eos> No. And it made me angrier.<eos> The fact that he was ignoring me.<eos> So I went round the back. I knocked on the back door.<eos> When I hit it, it swung open.
I have tights. You're going to find someone with an ID and then I will wire them $50 extra to say thank you for the favor.<eos> Yes, thank you. Thank you so much!<eos> Okay, just hold on.<eos> What?<eos> I have a friend who's trying to send me money in there and I just need someone with an ID card to go in there and sign for it.
- Yeah, good. Now do your very best impersonation... of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.<eos> No, Eggsy.<eos> That is sick.<eos> In the old days, they had a phone in the heel as well.<eos> How do I get it back in?
No, they all looked the same.<eos> And the other ingredients?<eos> I chopped some stalks.<eos> Wild celery.<eos> I picked it myself this morning from the riverbank.
- I have no time for this.<eos> Simply and clearly, if you are not out of this apartment by noon today, our lawyers will petition the police to have...<eos> Excuse me, but I'd like to say something, simply and clearly.<eos> This is my apartment!<eos> My dad bought it!
This is my apartment!<eos> My dad bought it!<eos> And he paid for it over 43 years!<eos> Gazillions of dollars!<eos> And then he left it to me.
Brother!<eos> Brother!<eos> Gerrant!<eos> No.<eos> The gem can kill, and it can give life.
¿Disculpe, estoy buscando a Eduardo Vega?<eos> You found him, muchacho.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I came across an article in the Wall Street Journal from 2004... about a Nicolas Treviño...<eos> How he made his first $100 million off your research by effectively stealing a drug patent out from under you and then marketing it as generic across all of Latin America without paying you a dime.
- Me too.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you on this plane?<eos> Did you buy your tickets?<eos> I´m in real estate, they sent it to me to check out a farm.
'Cause I'm so responsible.<eos> Later.<eos> See you later.<eos> Look for your oxygen!<eos> You'll find it!
Lassie, I am sensing that one of the trucks In our fleet is somehow responsible For the recent bank robberies and linked to the two murders.<eos> - All right. Well, talk to me when you get some hard evidence.<eos> Mcnab!<eos> - Yes, chief?<eos> - Scan the notes on that fake baby's butt, And email it to me stat.
Shower of useless bastards!<eos> I'm gonna get youse all fired, I swear.<eos> Where's the key, Mrs Gralton?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't know where I put it.
Oh, shite!<eos> Smash it through!<eos> Feckin' door!<eos> - Please, Mrs Gralton.<eos> - I don't know where I put it.
Get out of here.<eos> Get everyone to safety.<eos> Go!<eos> Gruff, it is too late.<eos> How can we catch it all?
But during the Carboniferous Period, the atmosphere had almost twice the oxygen as today.<eos> Insects could then grow much bigger and still get enough oxygen in their bodies.<eos> That's why the dragonflies here are as big as eagles and the millipedes the size of alligators.<eos> So why was there so much oxygen back then?<eos> It was produced by a new kind of life.
Look, I merely suggested you might be a bit scared.<eos> Yeah. No, I heard you the first time.<eos> You still don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> I know that Cain gave you his Mark for a reason.<eos> And I know that rather than embracing it, rather than looking at it as the gift that it is, you're sulking like you lost your knuffle bunny.
Wait a minute.<eos> It is never wise to be impulsive.<eos> Come down here.<eos> There is a stretch of coastline north.<eos> They would buy it and make money on it with their own private harbor.
Come down here.<eos> There is a stretch of coastline north.<eos> They would buy it and make money on it with their own private harbor.<eos> But why leave it to them?<eos> I bought it, Then the Russians fuck.
He's the biggest asshole of all of us.<eos> Both of us he...<eos> Yes, give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me. No. Please.
All dots, an irrelevance.<eos> Don't go metaphysical, mate.<eos> Juries hate that.<eos> The Greeks were terrified of beauty too.<eos> They saw it as a torment, excruciating, unreachable.
Janice. Mom changed the locks.<eos> Okay, okay, but you can open - the door, right, let your dad in?<eos> - Mom says I can't, that we need time away from you.<eos> Beth Ann, honey, open the door.<eos> O-Open it.
No one can help you, Mother.<eos> You have to do this alone.<eos> And the only way out... is through.<eos> So, feel the fear and the pain.<eos> Let it all in and then let it all go.
He had made some threats.<eos> So, prophylactically, we got the NSA to monitor all comint into and out of the committee.<eos> We didn't anticipate the kidnapping.<eos> That was bold, even for Hector.<eos> You adopted a lion cub, fed it raw meat, and feigned shock when it grew up liking the taste of blood.
My wife did a horrific thing today so that we could get into Widener's phone.<eos> To protect our daughter that's why she did it.<eos> So tell me you were able to monitor Widener's secure communications.<eos> I was.<eos> He'll figure out we've been in there, and shut it down.
You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining?<eos> There's an antidote.<eos> It just requires you to come meet me.<eos> I'll text you the address.<eos> Or you can just bring it over here.
- Mariana, I miss your old hair.<eos> - Ok, well, I don't.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really, I like it blonde.<eos> How about if we took you to a salon, and they got it back to brown...
But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
$1,000 a head.<eos> 3 thou.<eos> $2,000.<eos> - Deal.<eos> But you got to come across the border and pick it up.
Show me the spectrum of anything, whether here on Earth or from a distant star, and I'll tell you what it's made of.<eos> Fraunhofer's lines are the atomic signatures of the elements writ large across the cosmos.<eos> As with every other major revelation in the history of science, it opened the way to newer and deeper mysteries.<eos> And to the revelation that there were many more secrets hiding in the light.<eos> When Joseph Fraunhofer combined a prism with a telescope and turned it toward the skies, he brought the stars much closer to us.
So, you finally have - the place to yourself?<eos> - No more threat, no - more need for backup.<eos> - What will happen to - the gold?<eos> - Sit in a warehouse till Monroe gets convicted.<eos> Then we'll auction it.
The purpose of cows' milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 200 kilo cow as rapidly as possible.<eos> Cows' milk is baby-calf growth fluid.<eos> It's what the stuff is.<eos> Everything in that white liquid, the hormones, the lipids, the proteins every one of those is meant to blow the calf up to a great big cow or it wouldn't be there.<eos> And whether you pour it on your cereals as a liquid whether you clot it into yogurt whether you ferment it into cheese whether you freeze it into ice cream it's baby-calf growth fluid.
Yeah, we're not preparing our tax returns.<eos> We're preparing to make an oath of eternal and undying love.<eos> Even so, the budget your parents gave me just isn't gonna support it.<eos> Oh, what about my dowry chest?<eos> Have you opened it?
- The iron?<eos> - Yeah, it's the best piece on the board!<eos> The iron is?<eos> Oh, my God. I feel like I don't know you.<eos> No one suspects the iron. They discount it.
You're a perfectionist, like me.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Not too much time.<eos> Deadline's tonight.<eos> I'll have it done by lunch.
You ready to head home?<eos> Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick?<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> We're not bailing out just yet.<eos> You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.
The way to defeat them is not by racing them to the next weapon.<eos> You alone know how to deal with Florence's enemies.<eos> I search for an ancient tome called the Book Of Leaves.<eos> It's a compendium of hidden wisdom that men have died to protect.<eos> Sixtus and his cohorts, they moved mountains to find it.
You want me to ask you why?<eos> Sun's out, got my smokes, and a murder case worth working.<eos> What about the piano?<eos> We get any prints on the inside or any of those cut-up strings?<eos> No, it was cut a long time ago.
I can't believe I just said that.<eos> Dinner's in thirty minutes, OK?<eos> You know, it also has a massage setting.<eos> And memory foam so it contours to your body.<eos> Well then, why are you selling it?
It takes up the whole room.<eos> Well, I don't believe my bedroom's any bigger than this.<eos> Maybe it's too big for me too.<eos> It's not too big, it's just, it's not good for... intimacy, because of the split between the beds.<eos> That's why we're selling it.
- Thank you.<eos> - How do you do that?<eos> We only use untreated organic stone-ground flour and natural sourdough yeast, and we don't rush the dough.<eos> It's got a crunch to it, doesn't it?<eos> We give it two long, slow rises.
Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So my idea is for an abacus, but on your phone.<eos> I call it a "phone-bacus."
No, no, real... I really want to pay you back what I owe you.<eos> No, I don't feel comfortable taking money from you right now.<eos> No... it's yours.<eos> Just take the check, Mom.<eos> Don't be ridiculous. You keep it.
(laughs) Or did I?<eos> He showed you that? ! Yeah.<eos> He said he could never tell me because it was in the magician's code.<eos> There's a certain level of trust between dance partners.<eos> We have to have it.
- When you're ready, we can begin.<eos> So I have Stanley's will here, which I'd like to read to you.<eos> But out of respect, you know, I'll skip some of the colorful language.<eos> Oh, no. Please, go ahead, read it.<eos> I'm sure we've all heard it before.
So, my papa's- my dad's side different story.<eos> He was a crazy kid my dad growing up in the 60's and all.<eos> Drifting through life.<eos> Then as the story goes he was walking on a beach one day, and he came across this piece of driftwood and he saw something in it.<eos> So he took it home and he studied it and he studied it, and he ended up carving a statue of Jesus out of it.
- Not that he saw.<eos> - Killer must've followed him.<eos> Or maybe they came here to meet.<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?<eos> Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
- Objection. - Counsel is testifying.<eos> - ... access to the bag in question during the entire flight...<eos> Sustained.<eos> Is it true that you planted drugs in my client's carry-on<eos> - in order to extract it...
Right?<eos> In the meantime, let's, um, let's try this funeral home release.<eos> Couldn't hurt, right?<eos> Baby steps.<eos> Get her to sign it when I see her, and we'll see what happens.
Help me get this harness off.<eos> What you saw was a pre-recorded joke video that Madison made.<eos> By the time you watched it, she was already dead.<eos> Our killer used it as an alibi to make it look like she was halfway across town when the murder happened.<eos> She also witnessed it alongside a friend.
It's long been rumored that Luther labored over several rough drafts of the document.<eos> You can imagine what a copy might be worth.<eos> Oh, so you're writing a fake 95 Theses.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'm going to pose as someone who has recently inherited it, and has no idea of what its worth.
Forever, yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> - What's the code? - Uh...<eos> The numbers, Charles. I wrote it down.<eos> The ink-- I can't read it.
All right.<eos> You can tell them yourself.<eos> Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.<eos> Now let's go.<eos> - We found it.
Take it.<eos> You said it was fake.<eos> You should have seen your face.<eos> How much we get?<eos> You keep it.
See if there's any recent contact between Ian Little and Sue Walsh.<eos> Scanning slimeball's cell now.<eos> Not a lot of repeat numbers.<eos> Ok.<eos> Oh, there are dozens of calls to and from this number, though, and I'm gonna cross-check it with Sue Walsh's home.
How many times did I tell you!<eos> It's a shark!<eos> If a whale was a thick snake... a shark would be just a worm!<eos> Why you little!<eos> Fear makes it seem bigger
Crying out loud.<eos> Bloody chicken.<eos> It's on the bed.<eos> Go on. Go on, off you go. Bugger off.<eos> I thought Sherlock said he was going to send it to that petting zoo.
She doesn't understand any English.<eos> Vous etes une petite fille tres courageuse.<eos> I can feel another bit, Sergeant.<eos> That's shrapnel for you.<eos> Known men to be picking it out of themselves ten years after South Africa.
Well, try harder.<eos> Ooh, here's your office.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, this is nice.<eos> Yeah. Dennis liked it... until he didn't.
Room 147.<eos> Room 147?<eos> At the Best Traveler Hotel.<eos> I knocked on the door.<eos> He opened it almost immediately.
Yes, but I hate those European stations where they have those automatic credit card ones.<eos> Don't work. Never ever work.<eos> The other one that doesn't work, and especially in France, are those ones where you're supposed to put euro notes in a little slot.<eos> No.<eos> You put it in and it goes, "Nnnngh!
That sounds like Sebastian.<eos> There are definitely files removed.<eos> Destroyed, really.<eos> Like a bomb went off inside.<eos> There's a fragment of a trail, but I need a full IP, and the target device to trace it back.
Retractor.<eos> There you are, you little bastard.<eos> Okay... what is my approach, Dr. Lin?<eos> Evaluate the bowel.<eos> If it's alive, dissect it from the fascia and reduce the hernia.
- 'Cause their official secrets acts lets them classify almost everything.<eos> I have a file here from the D.O.J.<eos> That's me.<eos> Look at this.<eos> People are leaving classified files on top of here, unsecured, for it to take back down to records.
The ballot box?<eos> Why you and not me?<eos> There's a surveillance tape.<eos> Smoking gun.<eos> I took it to Peter Florrick.
Yeah, I need you to leave Will Gardner alone or I'll sue you for harassment.<eos> Mr. Gardner should consider how seriously I take this.<eos> Take what?<eos> He acquired a videotape of a stuffed ballot box.<eos> He brought that videotape to the governor-elect. And he attempted to show it to him.
It was determined at that time that your mother had not filed taxes for the last seven years.<eos> Once legal fees, the irs, and the state were paid, there was a balance of $1,500.42, most of which has gone to pay the storage unit where her personal possessions have been stored as per your request.<eos> It's a good thing you showed up when you did.<eos> Rent's only paid through the end of the month.<eos> It would've gone up for auction in 60 days.
He's promised to keep me on.<eos> You think he's a man of his word?<eos> He's a man of his brother's word.<eos> Here's the proof.<eos> Now, how can I get it to Martha?
Is that coming back to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We found it in Joe's bedroom.
Well, there you go.<eos> Sorry, I didn't know it was on.<eos> No, perfect timing.<eos> I added flashing lights to the system.<eos> I was just about to test it.
Come.<eos> This isn't the way back in.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> There's an opening to a hidden tunnel.<eos> Found it playing as a bairn. Here, careful.
Oh, I am so sorry.<eos> It was 25 years ago, move your hand.<eos> Ooh, very protective of the younger, sexy sister.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You know, even a strong man, you sit him in front of a piece of cake long enough, he's gonna eat it.
Doctor will want to take a look at you before you can go. Thanks.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> "mrs. Amber johnson, "a local pharmacist trainee,<eos> "secretly stole significant quantities "of percocet, oxycodone, and vicodin<eos> And sold it to community college students."
Captain!<eos> Order them to stand their ground.<eos> ~ The fire must not reach the Tower.<eos> ~ Yes, sir.<eos> If the pumps don't reach that far, then we will beat it out.
Oh, I am so sorry.<eos> It was 25 years ago, move your hand.<eos> Ooh, very protective of the younger, sexy sister.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You know, even a strong man, you sit him in front of a piece of cake long enough, he's gonna eat it.
You okay? There was an egg inside.<eos> Oh, my God...<eos> Melanie, what are you doing?<eos> Put it back.<eos> Don't do that. I took it.
Susie: Dr. Isles.<eos> Yes, Susie?<eos> None of our equipment is working, and the spectroscope is on the fritz.<eos> I can't even get a barometer reading.<eos> Well, did you check it before we left the lab?
What would I want with a parrot?<eos> Fair question.<eos> There's a good lad.<eos> Easy now... Hey, what's in there? Monkey.<eos> Someone ships it all the way from Colombia and can't even be bothered to come and pick it up.
It's a well-known fact.<eos> I've a list of them here.<eos> A list of foreign animals?<eos> Of diseases.<eos> Oh. Even if we get a fraction of this lot, my herd won't know what's hit it.
Lars Pierson.<eos> His cell phone number was found in the lining of Danny's jacket.<eos> I see you again, I will lock you up.<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> - We have to keep it.
I'm still processing all of this.<eos> She also knows exactly where Joe and Norrie found the mini-dome.<eos> - How?<eos> - 25 years ago, she and three of her friends found a meteorite in exactly the same spot in the woods with an egg inside.<eos> Melanie said that when she found it, that she wanted to protect it, and the others got violent.
What?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> In Philly.<eos> They found your car and impounded it.<eos> He went down there with Melissa to get it out.
These here are my root logs from 7:00 P.M. last night until 7:00 A.M. this morning... every stroke I made and where I made it from.<eos> Well, I'm sure a world-class engineer would have no problem faking something like this in their sleep.<eos> Well, then you obviously don't know what a root log is.<eos> Every action you've ever made on any device is recorded on one permanent digital record.<eos> You can't alter it, delete it, erase it, or even touch it.
We were.<eos> Well, then, it's a good thing that I killed her 'cause that would have been a huge mistake.<eos> Cindy was carrying your child.<eos> She was carrying a fetus.<eos> I told her to get rid of it, but she refused.
Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> And no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I dropped it in the lake a few minutes before I found you.
Hey, you know what, man? I'm sick of you calling me a liar.<eos> Who the hell knows your story anyway?<eos> You show up the day the dome does. No one knows where you came from and you don't say.<eos> Well, shouldn't you be telling me what's going on?<eos> 'Cause you've known about the egg since 1988 when you and Melanie, Lyle, Pauline, when you all found it?
Charlotte, this is my brother.<eos> Hey.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, er... my spare cover-up mousse.<eos> You can have it back.
They think Joan was trying to get back at me an that Gorman an Jeffries were in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> - That's what happene.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> I saw the smashe jar.<eos> I close up my office an I fixe it before it coul be a problem.
Guess who bought miss hanging-by-a-thread a car?<eos> - Miss who got a what? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Apparently, being a responsible adult around here gets you nothing.<eos> Turns out the squeaky wheel does get the oil.<eos> - And a car to put it in. - Mm-hmm!
Up against the car, please.<eos> Are you really just gonna sit there?<eos> I thought that was clear.<eos> Okay, I'm not a monster.<eos> I can unplug it for you.
We could learn from the mistakes we made with the Aruna.<eos> Why send another mining expedition when we have in our possession perhaps something more valuable?<eos> Billions were spent locating the source of the substance, and we encounter the entity in the same location?<eos> It can't be coincidence.<eos> It's all the more reason to protect it.
Money doesn't know where it comes from.<eos> And it wouldn't give a damn if it did.<eos> One generation... that's all it takes in this country if you play your hand right.<eos> You have a gambler's spirit, Joe.<eos> Gambling implies risk. I take the risk out of it.
I got it.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> You did everything you could.<eos> I thought the captain was dead.<eos> His brain is gone, but he's pumping to keep the heart working so we can transplant it into Nick.
No one answered the door.<eos> Well, hard for a mummy to run to the door.<eos> How about the inheritance?<eos> Fran's mom had less than $90,000 in net assets when she died.<eos> She gave it to the stepdad.
- Liar.<eos> We saw your phone. You're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Look, they sent me here to report back to them about the egg.<eos> He's been monitoring it for weeks from the outside.
I could teach you how to fly-fish.<eos> Are you OK, Vera?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> That drink machine stole two bucks off me.<eos> I put it in and I pressed the button and nothing came out.
This isn't a social call.<eos> All right, I take it back.<eos> Wexler is divesting a huge block of Gillis Industries, and I need you to find a creative way to buy them for Logan Sanders.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, Logan Sanders has a TRO that actually prohibits him from buying any additional shares.<eos> Which is why you're going to set up a trust for us to buy it for him.
Where's the video, Marty?<eos> I'm getting it, but...<eos> But what?<eos> Well, now they want 2 million.<eos> Now, Ray, look, I saw it.
'Everything since has been erased from your minds.<eos> 'Now, pay close attention to this briefing.<eos> 'This is the Bank of Karabraxos. 'The most secure bank in the galaxy.<eos> 'A fortress for the super-rich.<eos> 'If you can afford your own star system, this is where you keep it.
You will always be a citizen of the Song.<eos> If only that were true.<eos> It is as if the gates of hell have opened.<eos> It is the warm embrace of home.<eos> When did you last feel it?
My granddaughter looks prettier than she is after dressed up.<eos> Then... We will have your parents invited...<eos> So they know how much they missed out<eos> They have to give you a wedding gift.<eos> I put it here
Then... We will have your parents invited...<eos> So they know how much they missed out<eos> They have to give you a wedding gift.<eos> I put it here<eos> Put it in a safe place when you have time
But no.<eos> People who work for free, that's who.<eos> What?<eos> You and Russel bought pieces for Ray's restaurant without even looking over the terms of the contract.<eos> He said he would sign it this afternoon.
- OK. - I want it in writing.<eos> I can't believe she's not the least bit chagrined<eos> - about inheriting Dad's money.<eos> - Can we please stop talking about this?<eos> I mean, you know she's just gonna flush it right down the toilet.
You know, 'cause you're going on the road, I thought you needed it, and...<eos> You really signed that contract?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not taking this.<eos> No, I want you to have it.
I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> Well, I guess you and your dots will have to ask Juice.<eos> This is your daughter-in-law's murder I'm trying to solve here.<eos> The mother of your grandkids.<eos> Save the righteous cop bullshit for someone dumb enough to buy it.
While we work, will you explain to me what the deal is here?<eos> Today in the cafeteria, they served tempeh.<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Soybean cake.<eos> If you marinate it the right way, it tastes just like... Feet.
Well, you... you have other mirrors.<eos> I have many... hundreds.<eos> But none as important as this one.<eos> For what I want to do, your former home should do quite nicely.<eos> The person who trapped you in here imbued it with much dark magic.
Is that why you wanted to see me? No.<eos> No, I... C-Can I...<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> Yesterday you-you asked me about coming back to the hospital, and I was wondering if there's a position, then I want it.
Which is also how they managed to get themselves caught.<eos> Did you learn anything from the heart?<eos> Unfortunately, none of the killer's DNA or fingerprints were on the package or the heart itself.<eos> The most I can tell you is that it was expertly cut out three to five days ago.<eos> And judging by the vital reaction of the organ, it seems that... she was still alive when it was removed.
Well, while you back there trying to figure it out, I'm just gonna go on-line and make an appointment with her.<eos> I came to see about the piano.<eos> Dad, you forgot?<eos> No, I left a message with your RA.<eos> Well, I have to move it tomorrow.
Threeyearsago, Matt gets on that plane.<eos> Not a single piece of luggage, but he's supposed to have 18-and-a-half million dollars.<eos> If that's the case, then it's here on the island.<eos> So, what?<eos> How you supposed to find it?
Because then you'll never know the truth about your dad, will you?<eos> All you're doing is making this harder for me to do it unnoticed.<eos> Tom's really messed up.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I can't help that your friend walked out of here with a serum, or that he was stupid enough to try it.
Anybody see on the subway, "Link your MetroCard to your debit card," right?<eos> Like, auto-refill?<eos> This is a concept which is key to everything we'll talk about today.<eos> And it's called linkability:<eos> Take one piece of data and link it to another piece of data.
So he died from asphyxiation.<eos> Manually strangled.<eos> You can see finger-shaped contusions beginning to form.<eos> I swabbed the neck for epithelial DNA from our killer.<eos> Already sent it to Henry.
And when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough.<eos> Dough that makes bread, donuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy.<eos> Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distill the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten.<eos> Not a bioweapon, just harmless flour protein.<eos> - Then eat it.
I spent years gazing into that mirror, but all I saw reflected back at me was pain, just like the nordic king.<eos> You're going to cast that spell.<eos> The spell of shattered sight.<eos> It would take an entire lifetime to cultivate enough power to cast a spell over an entire kingdom.<eos> Luckily I only need to cast it over you.
So it would seem that Tomas is not the only one that this client has double-crossed.<eos> Well, if these guys knew who he was, maybe someone else does too.<eos> (Katya) You waste my time.<eos> Your drug charge is podrobka.<eos> You'll never make it stick.
I've been asked that question.<eos> Guys, Building "H" is close.<eos> Follow me, follow me.<eos> Okay, Happy, see if you can get any gas out of that tractor.<eos> Paige... find her something to collect it in.
So that whole exchange was a setup.<eos> He was just testing to see if we were watching him and we took the bait.<eos> Here's the thing- - I think we might be too late.<eos> All right, HPD went to the bookshop, tore the place apart, found nothing about counterfeit money.<eos> Might have unloaded it already, he might have, I don't know, set it in fire. Fine.
Affluent means rich.<eos> Come live in the kind of place a Persian guy would say is a little much.<eos> The ceiling is a pool. The ceiling is a pool.<eos> Quagmire, you got to get this.<eos> I don't know about buying a place without seeing it first.
Stop it!<eos> I'm the one in control here.<eos> - What evidence do you have?<eos> - We have evidence that Mr. Agos, when a deputy ASA, buried evidence against his one-time client, Bishop, allowing Mr. Bishop to avoid prosecution.<eos> Now... the evidence against him was two kilos of cocaine, which went missing after the defendant, Mr. Agos, removed it from the evidence room.
I understand.<eos> I don't care what you see.<eos> If you see a mermaid popping out... mermaids aren't real.<eos> I don't got to remind you how expensive the lens is... $548.<eos> That's why I'm giving it to you... - Yes.
It's more than that.<eos> Paige... it's melted.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just recover the cloaking software we came for.<eos> We'll hump it back to the plane.
The wall may be down, but I sense that some of Ingrid's magic remains.<eos> Yeah, leaving this town has never been simple.<eos> And Ingrid? She didn't change things.<eos> She wanted to be here alone with you and me.<eos> She wanted to make Storybrooke her ice castle, and clearly she wanted to protect it.
Boy, you're tough as nails.<eos> Guess you'd have to be to be married to Cabe.<eos> Moving on.<eos> So, you said when you returned to your computer seconds later, the suspicious file was deleted.<eos> That means whoever set it up programmed a Trojan horse to destroy all data viewed by unauthorized personnel.
Not for us. We called LAPD.<eos> Police escort, baby.<eos> Oh, good thinking.<eos> But hurry.<eos> Okay, two minutes, gold melts, and I mold it into a thrust bearing, and we are done.
Passenger with sword stabs Raj the driver when they're stopped.<eos> Passenger dumps the body, drives here, and then launches the cab into the Hudson?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Hey, look at this window.<eos> These fragments make it look like it was blown up from the inside.
Match made!<eos> They're gonna make a snadger.<eos> How you doing that?<eos> Love potion, yo.<eos> I got it all.
Don't I?<eos> Okay, this is a bad game.<eos> Ok... wonder what JJ would choose, 3 wishes, cause obviously you'd want to cure your cancer, for start.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go use the restroom.<eos> Then you'd probably want loads of money so that you could donate it to cancer research.
I spent years gazing into that mirror, but all I saw reflected back at me was pain, just like the nordic king.<eos> You're going to cast that spell.<eos> The spell of shattered sight.<eos> It would take an entire lifetime to cultivate enough power to cast a spell over an entire kingdom.<eos> Luckily I only need to cast it over you.
Okay. Okay.<eos> So I'll take a check.<eos> Are you proposing to me?<eos> I just don't have a lot of ready cash available, so...<eos> I can't go to Lee, 'cause he doesn't want me taking it anymore.
I can't go to Lee, 'cause he doesn't want me taking it anymore.<eos> Well, that's silly.<eos> He wants you to stay skinny, doesn't he?<eos> Silly.<eos> I mean, I'd like to wean myself off it... eventually, but, uh...
Well, that's silly.<eos> He wants you to stay skinny, doesn't he?<eos> Silly.<eos> I mean, I'd like to wean myself off it... eventually, but, uh...<eos> I have it under manageable control now.
See you Sunday.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What about your car?<eos> It's parked in a fire zone.<eos> Well... if there's a fire... go ahead and move it.
The ring was in it. That's all I know.<eos> And the picture?<eos> Was that in the pocketbook, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you decided to just hang it up on your fridge?
Was that in the pocketbook, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you decided to just hang it up on your fridge?<eos> Look, I don't know any more.<eos> I found it.
Yeah.<eos> And you decided to just hang it up on your fridge?<eos> Look, I don't know any more.<eos> I found it.<eos> The picture was pretty, so I hung it up.
Your dog is crapping everywhere!<eos> It's disgusting, this is not a kennel!<eos> Either Jonathan goes, or I go!<eos> Taxi, you don't like it, you don't have to work here!<eos> so, is that your real hair color, or do you just dye it that way?
No.<eos> You must never beg.<eos> Preserving our honor... is in our hands, always.<eos> This circus is my life.<eos> You're tearing it from me.
Ours will be the best circus in the world.<eos> - The greatest show on earth<eos> - This is not a circus. This the future of circus, Anderson.<eos> This circus is my life.<eos> You're tearing it away from me.
Look. We have to save the sick one.<eos> No. Barbara, if we're gonna take one, let's take the good one.<eos> You're such a bitch.<eos> Take the sick one.<eos> No. Just leave it there.
I actually started life-- I was going to be an architect.<eos> And that's what you see in the palace you know, which is, it's-- You could physically build it.<eos> Because the story of my life is, anything I design it's entirely buildable.<eos> And if you look, there's a detail. Look, you've got the walls with weeping water, all very stylized.<eos> I designed it knowing exactly how they would build the set.
- No, I don't need the car.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.<eos> He likes the car.<eos> Here.<eos> Please, just take it.
He likes the car.<eos> Here.<eos> Please, just take it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> Just take it.
Ash tree leaves.<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> They were in the park.<eos> It truly is the most beautiful tree in the forest.<eos> But Dad... How do you recognize it in winter?
Let me get my...<eos> Rhythm.<eos> This was the word that burrowed into my brain as I listened to their late night conversation quietly dissipate.<eos> I thought about that word, "rhythm,"<eos> and whether my mom thought Frank had it.
_<eos> They said it couldn't be done, *, but here we are, stealing an unlimited supply of birthday grade helium<eos> - from the unsuspected moon.<eos> - Um... sun.<eos> At night it's called the moon.
You two can handle this. I have a young man that needs my advice.<eos> Carry on.<eos> George, have the men collect the craft, and have them take careful note of where every piece was found.<eos> I want every piece accounted for.<eos> And have them take it to the warehouse on Governor St.
I think.<eos> Hey, man, I could tie it for you.<eos> I mean, I don't know if it's a Windsor, but it's the kind I do on me, for church.<eos> Tie it on me.<eos> Then, we transfer it to you.
You know something?<eos> Maybe Derek's right.<eos> Maybe it's you who can't see the show anymore.<eos> Hey, I see the show perfectly.<eos> I see Derek changing it because he is jealous of me and Karen.
Be grateful, I don't hit women.<eos> Now, tell me where my diamond is!<eos> I swallowed it.<eos> I sold the diamond. What?<eos> I swapped it and sold the real one.
I admit, on occasion, we can be inscrutable, but so can you.<eos> I wanted to meet the storied Da Vinci in the bright of day.<eos> We're different men, once Hell breaks loose.<eos> And when's that happen?<eos> Hell happens when the evil of this world exceeds our belief that we can conquer it.
There is a kingdom called Francia.<eos> A kingdom far larger, far richer and far more powerful than England.<eos> Athelstan, come.<eos> Come.<eos> This man has seen it.
You're family.<eos> Now, he's gonna do whatever he can to keep us apart.<eos> But since you're a child, he'll be inclined to trust you.<eos> That makes you my secret weapon.<eos> You'll tell me his schedule, find his food supply and then poison it with your blood.
_<eos> Come on, keep moving.<eos> There's things in these woods we don't want to meet.<eos> Okay, there's a settlement in this direction, all right?<eos> I saw it on the scanner, but I don't know how far.
But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.<eos> My take-home definitely doesn't allow for that whole Robin Hood thing.<eos> But apparently Jesse here is just raking it in.<eos> - Yes, indeed. - And I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable explanation for where he got it.<eos> He found it.
I'm sorry for your loss .<eos> Really.<eos> But these craters... this lost world...<eos> - is perhaps the last place where these animals live.<eos> - I just want to protect it.
The official company spokesman, Mr. Spock,<eos> Leonard Nimoy.<eos> The sound is great.<eos> We've been using it on the<eos> Enterprise for decades. It's about time it got to earth.
No, Mr Eagles.<eos> That the victim's belongings were about him, that five men saw him depart the scene at some speed soon after...<eos> Though none saw the act... that this boy is no stranger to violence.<eos> And that finally, when presented with the opportunity, he even now refuses to deny it.<eos> Lusk and his hamheads have served an entire hymnal of guilt and the world has sung from it.
The man had a key.<eos> The nanny gave it to him.<eos> He was dressed as a cop.<eos> He hid under one of the AC units nobody knew about.<eos> Except the nanny, who gave it to him.
Your teacher called.<eos> Mr. Beattie?<eos> You plagiarize a paper?<eos> Sounds like you already know the answer to that.<eos> Yeah, he ran it through some software.
Others do too.<eos> The pop-folk sound is huge right now.<eos> But without my woman's support, why bother?<eos> Hold on. Didn't we say you'd get a job, we'd find an apartment, we'd get married and move on?<eos> I've had a dream all my life and you just sank it!
- Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Let me help yöu.<eos> There yöu are.<eos> When do we undo it?
I have an extra set of keys if you want them.<eos> It's gone.<eos> As far as the estate goes, you're still owed $2,800.<eos> There's still a box of your things...<eos> You can keep it all.
Elisabeth?<eos> It's just a baby.<eos> Maybe it's hungry?<eos> It is very hungry.<eos> Wonder what else it eats?
like...<eos> like...♪<eos> ♫yöu cut my heart out.♪<eos> ♫yöu cut it...♪ ♫yöu cut my heart out and patched it somewhere else.♪ ♫Sometimes yöu dropped my heart.♪<eos> ♫Sometimes yöu caught it.♪ ♫Sometimes yöu matched it...♪ ♫...
Just stood there and watched.<eos> And I killed the guy.<eos> So I'm sitting there, blood all over me.<eos> And Frank reaches down... and picks up a stack of bills.<eos> Holds it up to me.
So I'm sitting there, blood all over me.<eos> And Frank reaches down... and picks up a stack of bills.<eos> Holds it up to me.<eos> There was blood smeared on the top few bills.<eos> And I took it.
I know that the law favors mothers. I know that. But Tammi is not a mother.<eos> She's just an egg donor.<eos> So, uh...what's with the new haircut?<eos> Is that the "Police Star" special?<eos> I just cut it different.
I just need your numbers.<eos> I haven't seen these in a while.<eos> So you and your girlfriend seem to be having a nice little reunion.<eos> Negative. Come on, she slipped you her cell number by texting you blood results.<eos> She sent it to you, too.
I'm going to give you the rest of the day to give me back my money and my pills, because bad things can happen to schmoes who get in over their heads.<eos> Yeah, that's right. I can put two and two together.<eos> So maybe<eos> I'll go talk to that hot blonde cop, or maybe you get me my money, and I forget her number.<eos> Just get it for me. Tonight.
Chemical synthesis means you could do it quickly and cheaply.<eos> I have a contact here in a factory in London...<eos> Selfridge's own house scent.<eos> Something exotic and glamorous.<eos> Ellen could endorse it.
Selfridge's own house scent.<eos> Something exotic and glamorous.<eos> Ellen could endorse it.<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> We could call it 'Spirit of Selfridges'.
Boot production.<eos> I have plans.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> I'm going to make boots with flaps over the lace-holes and double tongues so no water can enter.<eos> I think three years would be the life of such a boot and then... at the end of the three years, we'd clump it.
Alec had fallen off the chair trying to rescue the fucker.<eos> Sam wanted to rescue things all the time, too.<eos> Everything.<eos> Flies. Spiders. Earwigs.<eos> He'd get his cup and put it on top and then slide his drawing pad underneath.
While George continued uncovering the mystery that was Dalia,<eos> I was selling Lisa on the merits of her mystery date.<eos> - Okay, so listen to this.<eos> - Yeah? Every morning at dawn, he writes a poem.<eos> And every evening at sunset, he burns it.
You know, you don't think I had them turned off for routine maintenance?<eos> Come on, Lawrence.<eos> Now, I think we can, uh... we can both agree that our children and their lives are the most important thing, right?<eos> - I guess. - Yeah?<eos> Have you thought at all about what your, uh, fall from grace might do to them?
He doesn't look good.<eos> He looks... lost. I think he is.<eos> I think maybe it's too much information.<eos> Like, he's getting buried under all the memories.<eos> Being overloaded by them.
And the worst of it was that the villainous Count Olaf was still at large, a phrase which here means that the authorities had not caught him and would not catch him for a very long time.<eos> By the way, the police tell me they feel very confident that Count Olaf will be caught in no time at all.<eos> Ah, here's the turn.<eos> Lousy Lane is perhaps the most unpleasant lane in the world.<eos> It runs past an orchard of trees which once produced apples so sour, one only had to look at them to feel ill.
Dad?<eos> I saw them.<eos> The other kids.<eos> They're so scared.<eos> Promise me if you ever see the blue lights, don't look at them.
If you were my kid, I would've slapped that ass till it bled.<eos> Yeah, my mom, uh... she put raisins in everything that she cooked for about a month.<eos> - Very passive-aggressive.<eos> - Better than aggressive-aggressive.<eos> Maybe my kids would have turned out better... if I hadn't always been so damn pissed at them all the time.
- Dutch...<eos> Wait.<eos> He's baiting us, trying to draw us out.<eos> Please, I'm so sorry.<eos> Your stitches are a gift, but your eyes belong to the Unseeing, and you don't deserve them anymore.
Otis.<eos> He used to beat you, didn't he?<eos> And?<eos> And I know how scared you were for the babies.<eos> I mean, if that monster came at them the way he came at Simone...
Fuck you.<eos> I had a dream last night and you were in it.<eos> It was just the two of us, and we were in this house down by the water.<eos> I think we'd been living there a long time 'cause there were these pictures on the walls. Pictures of us.<eos> It was weird looking at them, because... something about it felt right.
By preying on a mother's weakness.<eos> The cuckoo bird is too clever to raise its young.<eos> Instead, it sneaks... Its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.<eos> So, when they hatch... The mother bird is fooled.<eos> She feeds them, nurtures them.
Where did this come from?<eos> Ribera.<eos> Any news about him?<eos> - Yaiza, they'll ask me questions.<eos> - And you won't answer them!
It's roast beef night.<eos> You'll have a good meal, meet some of the brothers... and there's no obligation to do anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe in fraternities.<eos> - Believe in them?
We're not losing this one.<eos> Take a breath, Lieutenant.<eos> We've got this.<eos> Famous last words.<eos> I am holding you to them, Bosch.
Do you remember the day you moved in here?<eos> I put that rope across the room to keep you out of my half.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> And the only way to get out was by climbing up on the curtains, remember?<eos> I hopped on up on them, and I was like...
They've already built a town square in here.<eos> Please don't say "lice." I'm disgusted enough as it is.<eos> Look, these things happen.<eos> When you go near children.<eos> -Oh, you can't be mad at them.
He can't stay on the street and<eos> - take the blame for what we did.<eos> - He's just a kid.<eos> Children know more than you think.<eos> They know, in their blood, right from wrong and no one pays attention to them.
No, we've only been here one day. Oh.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Have you seen one of those before?<eos> - The nest of an Egyptian vulture.<eos> Its party piece is breaking eggs it wants to eat by throwing pebbles at them.
I'm sure you'll appreciate I have very little time when I'm taken up with...<eos> More serious complaints.<eos> So tell me, what are they?<eos> Scrofula, phthisis, scurvy.<eos> What can be done for them?
Listen, I hate to derail us, but, uh...<eos> - We'll eat later, Finch.<eos> - The fact of the matter is, I could always go for a good slice, but this is about Eloise.<eos> I think I know the guy that killed her.<eos> I'm guessing you have some questions. Let's answer them.
Don't make me cry, Harry.<eos> I've done enough of that already.<eos> Detective Joe West...<eos> You have great kids.<eos> You take care of them.
It's not for me.<eos> Seems when they lobotomized Clementine, they didn't bother to reset her prime directives.<eos> I can't hurt you. But she can.<eos> I hacked what's left of her to ensure she only responds to me.<eos> But if you get lost in your memories or... devoured by them...
No discussions, no last-minute pleas for my sympathy.<eos> You have been in my home with me.<eos> And somehow, in all your scheming, you've missed just how far I'm willing to go to protect my children.<eos> I'm not coming for you.<eos> I'm coming for them.
I'm not so sure.<eos> Dana, look out!<eos> Did you really expect that to work?<eos> All the windows in this place are reinforced.<eos> We're not getting out through any of them.
I do what I want, and right now...<eos> I want to do this.<eos> Don't ever doubt your words again.<eos> They're perfect.<eos> Just believe in them.
- I have to go to them!<eos> - Stay here!<eos> - My children!<eos> - Stay here!<eos> I'll go get them. Stay here.
I'll leave you two to catch up.<eos> One other thing.<eos> Our theme for tonight, yes?<eos> I'll leave you with a few memories.<eos> Mind them.
If you will let Miss Ives live, I will walk with you to the end of time.<eos> It's the one thing I cannot do.<eos> The Master will have her.<eos> I leave you with a few memories.<eos> Mind them.
I don't have to, I want to.<eos> What?<eos> I heard a song the other day.<eos> Old song.<eos> The girl says, "Your eyes." It's a day's work just to look into them."
Hose is 15 minutes from you.<eos> OK. Text me the address.<eos> Sending it now.<eos> What have you done with our kids?<eos> Don't worry about them.
On it.<eos> Hey, one of these cars belong to you?<eos> Never seen any of 'em before.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> We're gonna plow right through them.
Having trouble?<eos> Let's see what I can do.<eos> See, this thing works two ways, you know.<eos> I want those memories.<eos> The trouble is, you're asking me for them, which means you can't access them, right?
Look, local police will get here first, all right?<eos> There's no access to the main street on this side of the building, so you'll have a head start, but only if you go right now.<eos> All this time, and I still don't know who the real Simon Asher is.<eos> Nobody's ever just one thing.<eos> Now, look... when they get here, they're gonna have a lot of questions, and I'm gonna have to be able to answer them, but only if you make it look good for the cameras.
So don't try and give me your talking points like I'm some senior citizen drooling away in my la-z-boy watching cable news from sunup to sundown.<eos> His whole administration he's had these bitches - lined up like planes on a Jetway. - Senator.<eos> Are you telling me this woman isn't pulling his strings like a marionette?<eos> There are legitimate questions.<eos> Now, the president can answer them in person, or he can come up to the Hill and answer them under oath on live television.
A dead body ain't property by law.<eos> Right, so if something ain't got an owner, it can't be stolen, can it?<eos> - Does he bring in children?<eos> - Not often. Hard to come by.<eos> Families keep a closer watch on them when they go.
What happens next, I believe, is that they will come by land and sea, they will split our army in two, possibly more.<eos> Now, Uhtred may be correct, this may not occur for a year or more, but what is clear is that we need ships.<eos> We are bordered by water, yet we have so few ships.<eos> You'll not get me on a ship, I'll volunteer my son.<eos> To save our shores, we have to look beyond them.
Mm-hmm. About an hour ago, they got a rush order pickup for a '68 Ford, going from Jones Beach to a dock in Baltimore.<eos> Okay.<eos> Detective Reagan... please... don't let anything happen to him.<eos> Cloris, this is Detective Reagan with the NYPD.<eos> I'm gonna ask you some questions, I need you to answer them completely and honestly, okay?
Hey, I can't even imagine.<eos> After their father left, I didn't want my kids growing up thinking that they were a burden, so I made sure they knew that mom could do it all.<eos> Meals, coaching, homework, shopping.<eos> That's an awful lot to sustain.<eos> Why else am I here if not for them?
Why would Bridget throw out my photos?<eos> No, no, I'm not saying..just. you know..whatever, by accident.<eos> - What do you want with them?<eos> - Nothing..<eos> ..I just want to show them to Dyl.. ..to ..to... ..myself, look at them.
It's about to enter the pupa stage.<eos> You said "poop!"<eos> Hey, kids.<eos> Stay close.<eos> I'll get them.
Yes! The fifth girl was also kidnapped!<eos> Are you a human or a sadist?<eos> Why are you so happy?<eos> Five girls have been kidnapped.<eos> You are not at all worried about them?
Oliver!<eos> I know you have a lot of questions.<eos> Nope.<eos> How could you not have any questions?<eos> Because I already know all of the answers to them.
Well, I've watched you with patients.<eos> You have the same gift.<eos> Oscar loves those cookies.<eos> - Good, I'm glad.<eos> - He deserves them, for making an honest woman out of the family republican.
You will, too.<eos> Well, it's time for Abbey and I to have some quality time together.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> You know, I used to allow for a few questions at this time, but... well, they were always the same-- so boring.<eos> I'll just answer them.
Why don't you help us so we can help him?<eos> You pump our children full of lies.<eos> Then accuse us of making them sick.<eos> You care for these children? But you're putting them in harm's way.<eos> - We do care for them.
I'd want my son to choose for himself... rather than have his father choose for him.<eos> But then our... views on liberty... true liberty... may differ.<eos> You say you need this suit, this pin, and this paper.<eos> I'll do you a deal.<eos> Fight me for them.
Here's all you need to know about me, old man.<eos> My dad was an alcoholic.<eos> Nearly tore the family to pieces.<eos> The thing about growing up that way-- you get good at spotting lies.<eos> So good that you start expecting them from everyone.
Like this one here?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Look at that.<eos> That okay for you, Mr. Huntsman?<eos> Hey. Okay, initially I thought the damage to the organs was caused by predation, animals tearing them apart.
You want Victoria.<eos> I know you locked Amanda away in exchange for an A-list career.<eos> So I want the promise of your testimony, anything else you have, and I want it now.<eos> I have records.<eos> I'll go get them.
You got in a fight with her, didn't you?<eos> I told you I don't remember.<eos> Look at these photos again.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - Look at them.
will create a positive domino effect through all your other memories. Can't you just compel me to forget everything at once, and we can go get a beer?<eos> I'm supernaturally rewiring 3 years of your memories.<eos> If it were that easy, I wouldn't be so terrified.<eos> I have some questions.<eos> Answer them honestly.
I wanted to send her away to school, but she didn't want to leave her classmates.<eos> Troubled classmates who could kill her.<eos> Joe, you fear for your children.<eos> And who wouldn't in this town?<eos> It's your trouble that's trapping them, and I think it's trapping them in the places that you fear for them the most.
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen...<eos> Was strangled by the Kingslayer.<eos> - They were his kin.<eos> - They were boys!<eos> Look at them.
I have to go make so many phone calls.<eos> Can I make beer instead, and you go make phone calls?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> Question: how are the eyes?<eos> They're... they're good, despite boiling wort being thrown into them.
Mm-hmm. Come here.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> - I hate kids.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> I do. I hate talking to them, I hate looking at them.
They're positively Victorian.<eos> Miss Love, I see no problem with these photographs.<eos> They convey exactly the message I was asking for.<eos> Then you must have got the message wrong.<eos> Look at them, Harry.
They all have one thing in common.<eos> We brought your wife in for questioning.<eos> She never did anything but raise those children.<eos> She didn't ask where they were coming from?<eos> If the parents weren't able to fight for them, they didn't deserve their kids.
They were like little boys plucking wings off a butterfly.<eos> No, I don't believe that for a second.<eos> They're so far ahead of us.<eos> These children are our living proof.<eos> Some day, they'll come back for them.
Because we're not a couple.<eos> We talk and actually listen to each other.<eos> And I don't charge a $100 entry fee.<eos> What do you mean you don't like kids?<eos> I mean, I think they're great if you have the time for them.
Wisdom well received.<eos> You are certain of this?<eos> I have for heavy span been pulled in opposing direction.<eos> A thing I have noted.<eos> Gratitude for standing by my words, even when you did not believe in them.
Go on, out!<eos> Now, THAT is a good question.<eos> With respect, sir, it's not our fault the girl lied.<eos> Apart from Constable Dawson, did anyone take the time to look into Palmer's claims?<eos> Oh, she looked into them, all right.
Sorry, Kris.<eos> Buzz is right.<eos> These pictures are...<eos> Are very, very upsetting.<eos> Don't look at them.
Well, Christ knows, somebody's got to, darling.<eos> Here, cheers.<eos> Ooh. Okay... What?<eos> let's play a game.<eos> We each ask each other three questions, and we swear to answer them honestly.
Thank you, Les Angeles.<eos> You know, Doug Flintlock here... well, he just leaned into my ear and he said:<eos> "Mike, I have kids.<eos> Teenagers.<eos> And these days, I'm scared for them.
I got so nervous, I just...<eos> I just could not sing anymore.<eos> - I just... - Here.<eos> You know this?<eos> 'Works of art are of an infinite loneliness, and nothing... ' '... can reach them so little as criticism.'
It might be of interest to you.<eos> I'm the founder of a company that specializes in abuse prevention for pets.<eos> I love pets more than anything in this world and I can't stand the thought of them being hurt.<eos> Most people buy pets without considering the implications.<eos> They love them at first and care for them, but then lose interest day by day and start neglecting them.
Nothing comes for free<eos> I have nothing but my balls Want that?<eos> Testicles?<eos> Why sure!<eos> I've been dying for them
We're done talking.<eos> Relax, mommy.<eos> Time to go to sleep.<eos> Please, I can't leave my kids.<eos> Jo and I will take care of them.
- Hanna!<eos> I'm just saying he's a bad guy, and you deserve way better.<eos> It was second nature with him.<eos> It's those eyes.<eos> You look into them, and you're just, like, hypnotized.
I decided I'd prefer to be pretty.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's make some distance before the night draws in.<eos> You can have three questions.<eos> I will answer them with pure truth.
She definitely made it harder to meet husband number two.<eos> Oh, bets.<eos> You're talking about your daughter.<eos> You know, it's a funny thing about kids.<eos> You raise them, provide for them... you do your job as a parent because you have to.
Look, we don't have to go there now.<eos> I'm here for another reason.<eos> - I think I can take you.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> I got a double murder, and I want you to answer some questions, so you can either answer them or, you know, I can let you cool off in jail for a couple days.
Yes, we have some serious misgivings about your children.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Our records show that they've never had regular checkups or vaccines.<eos> It's all right. They're healthy.<eos> If that's the case, can we at least see them?
Heh-heh-heh. Yes, they are ridiculous, no?<eos> Are the accommodations to your liking? Honestly?<eos> No.<eos> You shouldn't even keep animals in these conditions.<eos> Look at them.
Cement floors, steel bars, no room to run around, nothing to play with... Ah.<eos> I think perhaps you are confusing this with a zoo.<eos> I think maybe it's all these exotic animals.<eos> Yes, exotic animals for me to hunt.<eos> - You hunt them?
Ms. Dodd shouldn't be liable for the network's choices.<eos> There's only one question remaining for me and that's premeditation.<eos> Unless you have evidence to prove Ms. Dodd went on the show intending to perform indecent material-- for instance, an earlier and identical stand-up routine-- then I am prone to dismiss. (Window slams shut)<eos> I don't understand breasts.<eos> (Audience laughing) They're made of fat; They sag; they drool; And guys still go for them.
Hey, guys, I need all of this stuff downstairs.<eos> Sawyer, your mom's here.<eos> You gotta go home.<eos> - What about the animals?<eos> - Don't worry about them. Go home.
I know.<eos> I know. Especially since you've had so many difficult years.<eos> It took me a long time to be able to remember when I was young.<eos> Because I didn't trust the happy memories.<eos> I couldn't believe them.
I've seen firsthand the deep hurt and devastation that fatherlessness brings in a child's life.<eos> Our prisons are full of men and women who lived recklessly after being abandoned by their fathers, wounded by the men who should have loved them the most.<eos> Many now follow the same pattern of irresponsibility that their fathers did.<eos> While so many mothers have sacrificed to help their children survive, they were never intended to carry the weight alone.<eos> We thank God for them.
Blue eyes.<eos> Deep blue.<eos> Kind of eyes you could drown in if you weren't careful.<eos> I remember those eyes real well.<eos> I was staring right into them when I choked the life out of her.
What does "all the best" mean? Adrian.<eos> You can't say that!<eos> It couldn't be worse!<eos> Adrian, look at the ripples!<eos> Adri, look at them!
It was my grandfather's.<eos> I had to get it back.<eos> I put a word out to some fences<eos> I'd pay top dollar -- No questions asked.<eos> Well, now questions are being asked. And I suggest you start answering them.
I can get the grade up.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm trying to figure out a way to start this sentence that doesn't start with, "Someday, when you're a parent."<eos> You know you're supposed to protect your kids and take care of them.
And then in europe, you're just getting started.<eos> There's persson in sweden, schroeder in germany. Beyond that, there's cardoso in brazil. you're right.<eos> People are ready for this and we're on the right side ohistory.<eos> It's a sladunk.<eos> He understands the limitations of power, of what can be accomplished, he just refuses to be limited by them.
Yeah, me too.<eos> So has the muse shone on you, Greg?<eos> I've been distracted most recently by those delicious cookie things Beth brought around this afternoon.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course, we call them biscuits here.
Hey, Lucy.<eos> Hello.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about this whole me being a closed book thing, right.<eos> How's this for a deal?<eos> 20 questions and I have to answer them totally truthfully.
He loves sleeping with me so much.<eos> Hello? You're being evaluated tomorrow.<eos> Do you want to lose him for real this time?<eos> He needs a safe place to sleep, Brianna.<eos> Do you know how many parents have killed their children by rolling over on them in the middle of the night?
This is the last time I'm telling you!<eos> I'm not telling you again! (beep) I will not say this one more time!<eos> So... Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> The kids don't listen to me unless I yell at them. (earrings thud)
Hello? Hello Miyage!<eos> It is you..?<eos> Look, Miyage..<eos> I have some questions.<eos> Could you please answer them regarding your condition..
With hundreds of mission specialists ready to bump me off the last flight,<eos> I couldn't risk a scandal. Yes or no. She knows?<eos> No.<eos> Look.<eos> I adore my children. I would die for them.
- If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, Why have you been keeping it a secret?<eos> - Because I wanted you to come to me and say,<eos> "wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "well, it's in the genes."<eos> And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans.<eos> And I'd point to them...
- You're not meant to be a parent.<eos> - Why not?<eos> First sign, stealing someone else's eggs.<eos> Second sign, one of them almost became an omelet.<eos> Sid, someone's probably worried sick looking for them.
Sure you are, Ian.<eos> - Would you like some milk? - I don't want any cookies!<eos> I will be right back. Don't go anywhere.<eos> These are the exact same cookies ... I have been making for you all of these years.<eos> But these are extra-special, because I put a "magic spell" on them.
Can you at least consider it?<eos> Doctor, before, you said you'd do whatever's best for me, right?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> In that case, Doctor, won't you help me tell my little lie?<eos> You're going to lie to your children to take the pressure off them?
I assume you also know I'm a retired coroner from Reno.<eos> I do now.<eos> So,how'd you go from being a coroner to owning this place?<eos> Natural transition,actually.<eos> Used to spend all day cutting up dead bodies and sticking them with needles.
The chassis's still holding together.<eos> Oh, my boss is gonna murder me!<eos> Can you still drive it?<eos> Oh, no, the wheels are stuck.<eos> Look at them, they're never gonna budge.
Buy me a glass of that scotch and I'll tell you.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm going to ask you a few questions.<eos> I want you to relax and answer them truthfully.
Brown, and this is my associate Shawn White.<eos> We're friends of Leonard Callahan, and we're wondering if someone could help us with one of his encrypted files.<eos> I doubt it. Leonard was the best we had.<eos> No one could break his encryptions.<eos> He even had patents on them.
They're not that small.<eos> Besides, size doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Our trees are huge.<eos> We build tunnels through them.
The Jedi were no problem.<eos> Anything else I can help you with?<eos> I need test subjects.<eos> Choose four children and bring them to Mustafar.<eos> I will take care of them.
No! No! I'll do anything you want.<eos> This is the last of our humans.<eos> Yummy.<eos> Ginger. This woman has some questions for you.<eos> Be a good girl and answer them, will you?
For the record, can you confirm that you are...?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> Is it necessary to have...?<eos> Was Kennedy blackmailing you?<eos> That vile little pervert came to me with the photographs, sat there, and told me he wanted £2, 000 for them.
I'm not going.<eos> Can you keep your head up?<eos> Yes... but not for long.<eos> Ah, if I had equipment from the tree house, I could move this easily!<eos> Go and get them!
If my children see me worrying, that has them worrying.<eos> And no good mother would want that, would she, Sir?<eos> So, see, if the beer makes me happy, that makes them happy, to see me happy.<eos> What would you rather my children had, Sir, a downhearted mother, or a merry one?<eos> I would rather they had a mother at liberty to take care of them and not locked up for bad debts.
-Thank you.<eos> -We better...<eos> -Yes, absolutely.<eos> I would like you to take look at these pictures.<eos> I guess you can't watch them?
I cannot preside over a reign of witches.<eos> I shall remove myself to Monticello.<eos> That is your privilege.<eos> I do not have such a luxury.<eos> I am determined to control events, not be controlled by them.
i just hope it's big enough.<eos> you can't put brownies next to that.<eos> our babies are getting married!<eos> i know.<eos> look at them.
font color="#ffff00"gt; The Big Bang Theory Season02 Episode01lt;/fontgt;<eos> Oh, hi, Penny.<eos> FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine two, so colors only, and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle, so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, good Lord... why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?
That's good.<eos> Plus we tell the kid one less lie.<eos> You know the layout here?<eos> Any windows?<eos> There's a bunch of windows looking out on King's Court, but you'll never see through them.
What's the fun if each one fulfills his own dream?<eos> The fun lies in fulfilling others' dreams.<eos> Are you the meaning of Iife?<eos> It's said that God lives in children.<eos> It seems to be true on seeing them.
I think what Tugg means is...<eos> No, look at his eyes, man.<eos> - ... you people, you actors.<eos> You people...<eos> - Look at them beady, white devil eyes.
Is it too soon to get him a stocking to hang from the mantel at christmas?<eos> - Come on,james.<eos> - No,no.You know what?<eos> You're ... you're right.<eos> I-I will take the kids to the dentist, and I will force them to do their homework, and I will work my ass off providing for them just to makeure nick is freed up to show them a good time.
Of all the ridiculous claims, and by a Fargo.<eos> - You're saying it's not even possible?<eos> - No. Well, yes.<eos> Scientists are always bickering over credit for breakthroughs.<eos> Or denying responsibility for them.
My father--<eos> - Can't we be together here?<eos> - There's nothing here.<eos> What about your children?<eos> I'll provide for them.
We Don't Have To Start Right Now.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, My Officis Freezing.It's Frozen In There.<eos> I Need My Labs For My 10:00.<eos> All Right. I'll Go Get Them.
And we have created a form of artificial intelligence - the computer.<eos> The discovery of the fundamental laws of nature in the 20th century will open up unparalleled possibilities for the 21st.<eos> We are making the historic transition from the age of scientific discovery to the age of scientific mastery in which we will be able to manipulate and mould nature almost to our wishes.<eos> I will show you just how rapidly and radically science is transforming our lives.<eos> I believe this will confront us with profound challenges and choices, so profound that we have to start to address them today.
- I will.<eos> /Please comfort her, /Reverend.<eos> She's so afraid.<eos> I will take care of them all as if they were my own Emily.<eos> - Take care of them, will you?
Hold on. Ms. Bell.<eos> And my mother had the nerve to think that you would do a better job than me.<eos> So I guess this, right here, is a better job?<eos> - Almost killing my kids?<eos> - Just go get them.
And now men look at these pictures and think that's how women should look.<eos> And women look at these pictures and think that's how they should look.<eos> Women look at these pictures?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They look at them and feel like crap.
And women look at these pictures and think that's how they should look.<eos> Women look at these pictures?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They look at them and feel like crap.<eos> Do women ever look at them and feel good?
The last time there was an Armenian jump-off that old-world hit man Margos crawled out of the woodwork.<eos> A nice choirgirl like you you don't want any part of that kind of bloodbath.<eos> And if he could talk, he'd tell you the same goddamn thing.<eos> I would like those names, please.<eos> You paid for them.
- Well, I'm not going to.<eos> I know, but if you did--<eos> - What, you think I'm gonna call the--?<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'll purchase them.
He's inside?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Here are our animals.<eos> Take a look at them.
If he's a developer, then... why does he have a boat from the sheriff's department ?<eos> Let me know if you need anything else, Tom.<eos> He won't hurt the kids.<eos> How do you know ?<eos> Because he's not angry at them, he's angry at me.
- Got me.<eos> Because they have what's called tapetum.<eos> Which is kind of like a mirror that lies behind the retina.<eos> It amplifies all the available light.<eos> It's what makes their eyes glow when we shine a light on them in the dark.
My theory is that...<eos> The one they picks the one you'll know by<eos> Don't you ever ask them why<eos> If I told you, you would cry<eos> You just look at them and sigh
And the girl's cousin.<eos> I blame it on magic mushrooms.<eos> What you do in private is none of our business.<eos> But these photographs were fake.<eos> Conan Doyle believed in them.
Your annual Christmas pageants<eos> The Drama Club's recent and so I'm told, highly lauded presentation of Green Grow the Lilacs.<eos> But no purpose this room has ever served is more important than that which brings myself and my able assistant Mr. Blumsack to your community tonight.<eos> I assume worthy parents like yourselves have photos of your kids in your wallets.<eos> right ? Could you take them out and look at them ?
Is it the boy ?<eos> Is he here ?<eos> who are these children ?<eos> They're patients.<eos> I'm reacting to them... their fear and their desperation... they're reaching out to me...
No, I'm not.<eos> How many times did you call today ?<eos> Russell, there is a hurricane coming. I have a right to know that my children are safe.<eos> They're our children !<eos> Our children, Mariel ! I'm perfectly capable of taking care of them...
No one said you couldn't.<eos> - Then don't start.<eos> I just wish there was some way we could just...<eos> - What is it? That little fucker hired a lawyer. Her name is Bobby Bennett.<eos> She took the first gay adoption case in Pennsylvania to the state's supreme court, and won. - Yeah. She said as J.R.'s biological father I have rights, and I should fight for them.
Thank you.<eos> But Nate, it's always better to acknowledge the truth.<eos> Yes, I am all in favor of being honest with her about where she came from and who she is.<eos> I just think that we should follow her lead on this one.<eos> When she's old enough to start asking those questions, then we'll answer them.
They'll cut off our heads.<eos> Then we will all die, happily, and meet again in heaven.<eos> So every Jew must die before we get what is rightfully ours?<eos> What is rightfully ours is the unconditional love of God, as his sons and daughters, the joy of knowing that, the peace that love brings.<eos> I'm sorry. I hear your words but I don't believe them.
I need them and I want them back.<eos> OK, let me see if I've got that.<eos> You need them because you want them, because you don't know who you are without them.<eos> See, all I'm hearing is "you, you, you."<eos> But this can't be about you. It has to be about them.
Hail them.<eos> This is Capt. Archer.<eos> We're responding to your distress call.<eos> Thank you for coming. But be aware, this region contains dangerous spatial distortions.<eos> We're run into them before.
And if he's dead, I want to bury him.<eos> "Hitler ist kaputt!" I heard your son say it.<eos> He's a child, Lutz.<eos> It means nothing to him, it's a game.<eos> He hears things and he repeats them, that's all...
Our crew was infected with this virus?<eos> The pathogen was designed to infect all non-botanical life forms.<eos> All the animals...<eos> The meat, if you will.<eos> Either kill them out right or use them... as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.
This is some storm, huh?<eos> At least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere... surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves.<eos> You know it's not too late.<eos> We could always turn back...<eos> It's just... every time I close my eyes... I picture Maurice stranded alone. And then when I open them... he's...
Please, Andi.<eos> Where's my sim card, Andi?<eos> What did you do to the windows?<eos> They're reinforced.<eos> If you try to break them, I'll have to board them up.
These pictures, they're that man on the telly, aren't they?<eos> - What pictures?<eos> - They're everywhere.<eos> Oh, these pictures?<eos> ! Oh, you can see them too? That's good.
Courage<eos> I wrote those words<eos> I wrote those words when I was 12 a years old<eos> My letter to the white house<eos> Never did I imagine The President would read them loud to Nation Mourning the loss of the another crew of the astronauts
I copied the data from the tablet before you left.<eos> Joy's been going through it.<eos> Bakuto has been transferring the money that Gao was hiding in Rand to his own account.<eos> And now that we've been reinstated in the company, I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.
Hey, get your ass over here and help us.<eos> Those people upstairs are pit of vipers.<eos> You should thank me for getting you away from them.<eos> What use do you have for the Iron Fist?<eos> You know, when I was a child, my mother told me the story of the Sack Man, a sort of bogeyman who shows up at disobedient children's homes and steals them away in his sack to sell them.
To unearth cultural relics and treasures is our job.<eos> Did you catch those raiders?<eos> Our police intercepted and arrested them on the highway.<eos> Here are the greetings from leading officials.<eos> Take you time to read them.
Exaggerations propagated by the ranchers.<eos> The New York times, science news, why would they lie?<eos> Because they sell ad space to the ranchers who don't want to share the grazing land that they have, because it'll lower profit margins.<eos> Exploiting defenseless animals is irrefutably wicked.<eos> I am here to protect them at any cost.
- Boss.<eos> - Move those vehicles to the right.<eos> I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are clearly visible in the background.<eos> Copy that.<eos> They're... They're completely blocking them.
And maybe the question isn't "What is this play?"<eos> but "Who are we?"<eos> I take your point.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> - Right. - We... we all have small children and this is the village that we've chosen to raise them in.
I don't think you understand the concept of pissed off.<eos> It's angry.<eos> Oh, I know what pissed off is.<eos> I'm pissed off, so as a pissed off person, I'm aware.<eos> You're confused. You got a lot of questions, but you don't know how to ask them.
Or am I, wrong about that?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No. You have rights.<eos> Well, then, quit violating them and get the fuck out.
Some of us might die in this trench, but we will beat them from here.<eos> Got it? Yes, sir!<eos> We bring our dying animals here.<eos> While they can still walk.<eos> Then we throw them down.
40 dead, 87 wounded.<eos> And why is that, Frank?<eos> Why do you think our new President's son lost more men than any other commander during the surge?<eos> 'Cause Andrew Keane only cared about his career and the ribbons that he had pinned on his chest.<eos> And he didn't give a shit what he had to do to get them.
- Who?<eos> - Mark Linn-Baker.<eos> I'm, uh, calling on behalf of a third party and they-- well, they've asked me to ask you would you like to see your children again?<eos> What?<eos> Your children, Erin and Jeremy, would you like to see them again?
No, I didn't mean that...<eos> You meant it, and you were right, Kevin.<eos> There were always gonna be bulletproof vests, hugs from holy men... tattoos to cover up.<eos> But those were just ways to deal with what I lost.<eos> I needed a way to get them back.
I open my home to them, and all they do is complain.<eos> "The bathroom is filthy.<eos> The rat is noisy.<eos> The bed is cramped."<eos> I think living in a mansion has spoiled them.
To be their best selves.<eos> All I need is an address where he's staying.<eos> I'll tell you what, Detective.<eos> You have questions for Mr. Josepovich?<eos> Write them down, I'll make sure he gets them.
What? He took your what?<eos> It's my art.<eos> And I spent a lot of time on them.<eos> And they're beautiful.<eos> And... and that piece of shit Paul Bunyan confiscated them, and I want them back.
Stay with me.<eos> Bones? There...<eos> There you are. That's it, open up.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Let me see them.
That's it. That's it, Mickey.<eos> I don't want to ply you with questions, child, but if I do not ask them, I fear we shall not find answers.<eos> Do you think I don't ask questions myself?<eos> Questions come into my head all the time.<eos> Sometimes I think He is asking them of me. Sometimes I think I'm asking them of Him.
No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge.<eos> I am in charge now.<eos> If you have questions or concerns,<eos> I suggest you take those up with your boss, who can take them up with his boss, who can take them up with my boss.
- Hope that's all right.<eos> - I'm sure it'll be fine.<eos> Um, did you get the, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got them.
Um, did you get the, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got them.<eos> I went ahead and, um... I figured I should maybe...<eos> I wrapped them up...
I would like to... address a complaint that I received from a concerned parent about a school-sponsored gay sex education class their daughter attended.<eos> That class was not... was not affiliated with Anchor Beach.<eos> As a concerned parent, not vice-principal, I organized an LGBT sex ed class off campus to educate those kids who were being left out, my son included.<eos> Well, then why were Anchor Beach permission slips required?<eos> I insisted Lena get them for exactly this reason, to prevent any parental backlash.
- Attaboy. - Quit calling me Hoss.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready?<eos> Where are your questions?<eos> I got them right here.
We're gonna catch that scum bag.<eos> Instead of working shoulder to shoulder with him?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Things may not have worked out between Gay and me, but she was always there for the kids.<eos> She loved them, and they loved her, and now she's gone.
- Right. Out.<eos> You've got the virus.<eos> Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.<eos> Are there any other glaringly obvious remarks you'd like to make?<eos> How about I cut your lungs out and show them to you?
You want answers, Barry?<eos> How's this?<eos> You will go back.<eos> You will do everything that you can think of to save her.<eos> You're even gonna create time remnants of yourself, but he's gonna kill them all, mostly.
Bonnie... she must be...<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> I don't know how I can...<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see it play out over and over again in my head.<eos> And every time I open them, I see Enzo's blood on my hands.
He was taking us to Peru.<eos> What?<eos> Wha...? See? Hysterical.<eos> No, the children must be confused.<eos> Dr. Montgomery was taking them to Peru.
I, um... I have a real phobia of parasites.<eos> How did this thing get in your leg?<eos> Oh, the... the tumbu fly...<eos> It lays its eggs in your clothes when they're drying.<eos> And then, when you put them back on, the eggs hatch, and the larvae burrow themselves into your skin.
But...<eos> I'm afraid if I don't do it, or even if I do do it...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Tell him you can't get what he needs.<eos> I already ordered them.
Folks like us, we got nothin'.<eos> We should be stickin' together, you know?<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> My wife baked some cookies for a friend.<eos> I'm supposed to drop them off to the husband, but he ain't home. He's at the bar.
In otter creek, all right?<eos> Just pay for everything in cash.<eos> Here... here are your clothes.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> Just throw them out.
Counting cards is a circus trick.<eos> I don't count cards.<eos> I see equations, broken down to an infinitesimal level.<eos> Itty-bitty fractions as algorithms.<eos> I take those probabilities and turn them into virtual certainties.
Sign of the times, I guess, right?<eos> Maybe it's the Mayor, coming to check out his big todo.<eos> He drives one of them sports coupes.<eos> This isn't a coupe. This is a larger model.<eos> Give up, asshole. Turn them off.
Of course you may, but I'd rather you gave her my love.<eos> These are frightening times.<eos> Why do we need to paint our windows?<eos> Well, the idea of the white paint is it deflects the heat from the initial blast.<eos> And obviously, you need to paint them on the outside.
Are your shades closed?<eos> What? Shades?<eos> I don't have shades. - I have handmade Venetian blinds.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Close them and lock your door.
Of course I want to know.<eos> Mellie. This is my campaign.<eos> The less you know about what happens behind the scenes of your campaign, the better.<eos> Those pictures are a gift.<eos> We leak them, and you are the only Republican candidate left standing.
So if you don't have any more questions...<eos> All I have our questions.<eos> Questions seem to follow you everywhere you go, Detective.<eos> I have questions about Bianchi's abrupt ending.<eos> I left them unanswered.
- Oh. Well, enjoy "out."<eos> - Hey, - these photos are really cool.<eos> - Oh wow, yeah.<eos> I've never seen these before. Are they new?<eos> Yeah, I just got them in today.
- And then you'll bring me copies?<eos> - Yeah, or email them.<eos> Oh, honestly, you kids and your technology.<eos> Do you have the photos or not?<eos> I will try to get them to you.
Here's your file. The instant I heard it, I recognized the similarities.<eos> The Apollo riff had a much slower tempo, but digging in, both recordings have the same basic wave structure.<eos> And here's where it gets real weird.<eos> Both have a degrading time signature embedded in their audio spectrums.<eos> Meaning what? If you play them out long enough, they'll eventually come to an end.
Talk about peeing in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> If I didn't know that somebody could go through a mirror... and believe me, I wish I didn't know that... I'd think this got broken in a fight too.<eos> Let's check out the underwear guy.<eos> Any guesses as to where his clothes went?<eos> Well, either this is how he gets his kicks, or someone took them.
So the next time I'm asked to stand for public office... .. can you imagine what my answer will be?<eos> Good lad.<eos> Elizabeth... I must...<eos> Are you saying that my doubts, my suspicions, are completely unfounded?<eos> Name them and I will tell you.
Okay.<eos> Last summer, I went to Burning Man with my band, and... I got a little wild.<eos> What do you mean, "a little wild"?<eos> I mean there were pictures taken of me that could end my teaching career.<eos> Gavin stole them and threatened to post them online.
I wasn't going to come all this way empty-handed.<eos> My children? Are they here?<eos> Where are they?<eos> They are in Saint Germain with their governess.<eos> Then when do you see them? "See" them...?
What time is it?<eos> It's, um, eczema by the way.<eos> Uh, you were too polite to ask, but I'm pretty sure that you were wondering.<eos> Where are my clothes?<eos> Uh, you puked all over them so I put them in the wash.
He would've been a good one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - We had no idea.<eos> - It seems like he's been harboring thoughts and feelings that he wasn't comfortable expressing, and his body found a way to express them for him.
I'll let you know when it's ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Damn.<eos> The funny thing about feelings:<eos> You know, we think that if we push them down hard enough, that they'll disappear.
- No. No, no.<eos> I took them with my phone, and I deleted them months ago.<eos> But did you delete them off the cloud?<eos> Oh, God. The goddamn cloud.<eos> That's how he could've gotten them.
Well, that'll be a conversation for a different time.<eos> Since I know Megan better than anyone, I thought maybe we could talk about how to make the most of a very unfortunate situation.<eos> What did you have in mind?<eos> Focusing on the ex.<eos> You know, he forced her into taking the pictures, and then he leaked them when she had the courage to get out of a borderline abusive relationship.
Wait. What?<eos> You're the one who leaked the photos?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Hope.<eos> How did you get them?
All right.<eos> Come forward.<eos> Ofwarren, you too.<eos> Quickquick.<eos> Take them to the van.
Julie-Ann's posh accent.<eos> I mean, he knew her old man was well-off.<eos> Or he knew he was a pushover.<eos> Sir, the photos from the Drug Squad surveillance of Dwayne Clarke.<eos> - I've checked them against the log.
I got shoes already.<eos> Shoes?<eos> Boutonniere?<eos> It's a fucking flower, Daryll.<eos> The pictures of The Waterfall star were taken during a trip to Jamaica, but no word yet on who leaked them.
The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.<eos> It wants those other kids.<eos> I can feel them.
- The tree's a sign of goodness.<eos> But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.<eos> Plus, she's got that dumb name.<eos> Okay, permission slips, people!<eos> I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.
You've got two hearts?<eos> Robots, they don't breathe.<eos> They can fix the atmosphere for you, send data back, so you know whether to bring your waterproofs or not.<eos> Work in huge robot flocks.<eos> You just send them up ahead and you leave them to it.
- Aye, he does.<eos> Ah, maybe he means it.<eos> So what's his wife like?<eos> She died when the kids were young.<eos> He brought them up on his own.
Single mother. Three kids.<eos> I-I gave them everything. Cooking, cleaning...<eos> And they weren't easy those kids.<eos> I-I was at the end of my rope.<eos> And then you set them on fire.
All this needs to be cleared out, make room for the cots.<eos> You can put the blankets... put 'em over there.<eos> You must be Sidney.<eos> I thought you were gonna bring the cots in?<eos> Well, I wanted to make sure this is where you wanted them before I started hauling them all in.
- Anything else you need?<eos> Not presently.<eos> You know, it might pay to familiarize yourself with the Secret Histories over there.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Supernatural threats lurk in every corner, and those volumes could provide clues as to how to defeat them.
Not anymore.<eos> Well, maybe you know somebody who does.<eos> Even if I could pry one open, it's a federal crime.<eos> Look, Stahl doesn't even feel like a man unless he's manipulating a woman.<eos> He crawls inside your head to all the places you feel safe, and he takes them.
And gross.<eos> Well, the sample DNA is corrupted as feck, but from what I can tell it's a close match to, uh... you.<eos> How's that even possible?<eos> Right now all I know for sure is that these cells have memories that Khlyen was hiding.<eos> Want to crack them open and see what's inside?
Relax, I sutured livestock on my farm all the time.<eos> This does not make me feel better, Zeph.<eos> Quinn, we're almost done.<eos> That tickles.<eos> - Can I open them now?
I want to warn them, but I can't.<eos> Like hell you can't.<eos> There's a nogo directive in place.<eos> Screw the directive.<eos> Listen to yourself, you're sitting there, and you're bellyaching about all the mistakes you've made, how you want to take them back.
Must have been you.<eos> He'd never go around with photos of the bastards.<eos> He's put a lot of time into you.<eos> My own children didn't have the drive.<eos> Maybe I spoiled them too much.
- Oh.<eos> Couldn't find any boxes.<eos> Eh, thanks, love.<eos> Look at them.<eos> I'll have them with a little bit of toast.
We shall now hear from both sides.<eos> I am here today at your request.<eos> But I owe nobody an explanation, for why I took back what was rightfully mine.<eos> Those oil fields belonged to my husband and his father before him.<eos> I inherited them.
I am here today at your request.<eos> But I owe nobody an explanation, for why I took back what was rightfully mine.<eos> Those oil fields belonged to my husband and his father before him.<eos> I inherited them.<eos> And yet, when Quinn seized them illegally, there was no conclave called to restore my rights.
There was just this sadness about him, you know?<eos> He didn't get to know his dad growing up...<eos> All the politics and then the White House, and I felt like he's still chasing his father.<eos> I so don't want that for our kids. I don't want it either.<eos> I know we're trying to protect them, but aren't they better off with us...
Alright, Kevin, close your eyes.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> All right, now, I want you to picture the love of your life. Imagine that you have 30 seconds to win her back.<eos> One shot, three sentences.<eos> What are those sentences, and who are you saying them to?
The definitions are not mutually exclusive.<eos> I found them wandering unsupervised, poor dears.<eos> Well, you know what we do with trespassers, don't you, Charles?<eos> But they're only children.<eos> I thought we could take them in. Give them a loving, normative home.
I thought we could take them in. Give them a loving, normative home.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I believe you treat children like grown-ups.<eos> Put 'em to work in the mill.<eos> It'll teach them responsibility. It'll teach them the value of hard work. And it'll teach 'em how to make flat wooden boards out of trees.
That is a very untidy habit and I can't allow it.<eos> You must fold your clothing neatly and place it on the chair.<eos> I haven't any use for little girls who aren't neat.<eos> I was so harrowed up in my mind last night, I didn't think about my clothes at all.<eos> I'll fold them nicely tonight.
We have faced extinction before, and we have persevered, but we have always been familiar with sacrifice, and today we will be tested once again.<eos> The ground won't be survivable for 5 years.<eos> We've confirmed that this bunker can only generate oxygen and food for 1,200 people for that length of time.<eos> By mandate of the Conclave, our clan has been given 100 spaces, an equal number of spots as all the rest.<eos> To fill them, we will hold a fair lottery.
- Right here.<eos> Just use your finger.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I've got ten more boxes outside.<eos> - Great, you can bring them in. - Okay.
That was an onion bagel with whitefish!<eos> This surveillance tape should prove my client was not at Detective Hiss' house.<eos> Your Honor, how do we know the defense didn't tamper with the tapes?<eos> Because the defense didn't have them.<eos> We're all seeing them for the first time.
Well, I think she's perfect for Lucifer.<eos> Her bra size equals her IQ, huh?<eos> That's generous.<eos> See that vein popping out the side of your neck?<eos> Same thing happens when I throw the dishes in the trash instead of washing them.
All right.<eos> A school like that is great for Trixie.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah. Fancy-pants rich kids? They're like vipers, okay?<eos> Trixie will learn to slash them with her words. Then I will teach her the knives.
You won't have to worry about Jay much longer.<eos> So does this mean there's nothing out there?<eos> Maybe it's 'cause the bodies are cold?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Did you put them out there?
- I can't hear you.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I can hear you just fine. - Tell the kids Mommy loves them.
Why?<eos> Keep going.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Seriously, how are these mug shots not online?<eos> Scan them and e-mail them to me.
Then why share anything?<eos> I thought that if the police knew Travis was a predator, then the next girl who did come forward would have an easier time convincing them.<eos> There's still a chance to help Sophie.<eos> By giving you the other victims' names?<eos> So you can try and put them in prison?
Petra's babies are warming up... to Anezka.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, I just missed them so much.<eos> And they missed their Auntie Anezka. Hmm?<eos> Thank you for letting me see them.
Absolutely not.<eos> So I will not tell you about the big break in the B.O.K. case.<eos> We're not at dinner yet.<eos> Sam and Maxine uncovered that in '06,<eos> Clark Sims delivered double-pane windows to a contractor in Queens, who then installed them in 2236-01 East 61st Street, also known as Caitlin O'Brien's townhouse, five months before the murder.
You two were S-C-R-E-W-I-N-G.<eos> Can you calm down, Piper?<eos> There are children!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you come to breast feed them all?
You think about him a lot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think about?<eos> That someday I'll- - I'll get married and I'll have kids.<eos> And I'll do it right for them.
- Well he's not getting Henry.<eos> Do you think Paige wanted us to see those photos?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She already told us.<eos> But... maybe she wanted to see us read them right in front of her.
So, we're not gonna finish the movie?<eos> Yeah, sorry, but my colleague here was pretty adamant that a better use of class time might be to learn while accomplishing something.<eos> Now take one, pass it all the way down.<eos> We're supposed to scrape the Internet for thousands of food images?<eos> Yeah. So you'll find, like, five or 30,000 pictures of your food, and then put them in a folder with that food's name on it.
So what?<eos> Well, he wasn't my friend.<eos> He was my partner.<eos> My lover.<eos> I used to hate those words, but his father hated them more, so I grew to love them.
Imagine how trotzich he would be if it were his children's lives in danger.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> You wouldn't hurt them - of course.<eos> - Nee. Nee, nee, nee.<eos> Just take them on an outing somewhere.
Actually... I'm not.<eos> Please tell me this is a Japanese game show.<eos> Enjoying the low road?<eos> I really have to thank you, Emily.<eos> I told The Riddler about your cell phone cases, and he's having us steal them so he can use them to build a tank to attack Arkham Asylum.
In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I crown you King Aethelwulf.<eos> - May God save and protect you, all the days of your life.<eos> - Sire.<eos> Now, please hurry!<eos> I want you to go, get them in the cart.
It's happened again.<eos> A nom de plume is a pen name for purposes of anonymity.<eos> I shall be writing under the name of Rosamond Montmorency.<eos> Oh, that gives me such a thrill.<eos> Once a week, we'll read our completed stories aloud to each other and talk them over thoughtfully.
I guess... I'd best get her home.<eos> Anne.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> Oh, Matthew... isn't it a beautiful morning?<eos> The trees look as if you could blow them away with a breath.
- I thought you'd know.<eos> - Well, I did... I don't.<eos> Can I go for the kids?<eos> No.<eos> Well, we usually pick them up, me and Mam.
I've got to be there or Mam's got to be there, so...<eos> All right, I'll go with YOU, then.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> No.<eos> - They like it when I go for them.
Well, you weren't in your office, and your ringer was off, so I had Abby ping your phone.<eos> I got pinged?<eos> That is so awesome.<eos> Recordings from last night.<eos> We need to get back so you can translate them.
No!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> They're hijacking her memories.<eos> Infecting them like a virus.
Just... let me rot.<eos> Let's move it.<eos> Well, you've been a busy boy.<eos> Re-tagged and sold almost 100 stolen cars this year.<eos> You ship them over to Poland?
Hey, you guys, I'm gonna let you go, okay.<eos> I know you got to get ready.<eos> - I'll be out there watching.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's get our seats before we lose them.
I'm separating conjoined twins, they're sharing a heart which is funny 'cause it's Valentine's Day.<eos> Anyhoo, I'm gonna need to be out of here by 8:00.<eos> Very well, right this way.<eos> Tonight we serve a prefixed menu consisting of seven courses.<eos> Hey, you know what, chief, why don't we just, ah, mush them all together.
And, since you're making this so difficult, "Hamilton" tickets.<eos> Henry, grab your things.<eos> I was foolish to think this washed-up hack would help us.<eos> His Author powers are taking over.<eos> He thinks he controls them, but he doesn't.
Damn it.<eos> Can we get a drone out there?<eos> Some kind of tail?<eos> Not in time.<eos> Yesterday, when President Dalton spoke about dreams, and the courage to act on them, I realized I still want to be a doctor.
- Oh, yeah. More than one.<eos> Come here.<eos> Is that your way of thanking me for bringing the tools?<eos> - It's a start.<eos> Thought you had them, by the way.
And they can be hacked.<eos> So he can hack into any one of them and watch in real time.<eos> Yes, he can, newbie.<eos> So he can control a hacked car like a remote control toy.<eos> I thought you all might want to look at the vehicles. We've got them in impound.
Yes.<eos> And by that, I mean yes.<eos> I am compiling a list of manosphere users and subscribers and cross-checking this "I will destroy it" phrase with acid sales and...<eos> Oh, they just posted new photos.<eos> Get them to us.
Why does Shepherd care about me so much?<eos> Shepherd doesn't care about you.<eos> Or anyone.<eos> Look at her own children.<eos> She loved them, and she tried to kill them.
Shut up.<eos> Another word, and I'll blow your brains out. Both of you.<eos> Please, you have to let me go.<eos> You're gonna get my babies killed!<eos> Ma'am, we're gonna get them back.
Welcome to your pre-recorded seduction.<eos> Mama likes!<eos> Papa knows.<eos> That's right.<eos> I know my wife so well, I was able to anticipate her questions before she asked them.
We understand he had over $30,000 in us bills on him.<eos> Counterfeit bills.<eos> Untraceable.<eos> We'd like to review any eyewitness reports.<eos> Well, I'll forward them from the police prefecture if you tell me why you are so interested in a random hit-and-run.
We haven't tried everything...<eos> Not yet.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I found two ancient spells.<eos> It won't be easy, but I think, with your help, I could combine them into something very powerful.
Nice job.<eos> How the hell does something like this happen?<eos> Wish I knew, Chief.<eos> Let's get some blankets on these bodies.<eos> - Let's cover them up.
- I figured you'd go.<eos> - And you'd stay here?<eos> - It is my loft. - You made the deal with Abbott.<eos> Agent Goodkin... do you happen to have something I can wear while my clothes dry?<eos> Things got a little messy last night, so I washed them in your sink.
We are on the same team, but it is a competition."<eos> Excellent. Excellent.<eos> And on a related point, you're going down, punk.<eos> "Revised ground rule number two:<eos> "There are definitely stupid questions. "And those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
Don't worry about it, happy to do it.<eos> I was gonna tell you I've been talking to some big money guys back east.<eos> They really believe in the concept, talking about franchise potential, so I really feel...<eos> Kids are getting big.<eos> They do that when you don't see them for a while.
- okay, well, I'm really not ready to, you know, talk about all the juicy details.<eos> Oh, I'm so fine with leaving out the juice.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you have questions, you should feel free to ask them.
Yeah, so me and Ruz haven't ID'd the girl yet, but we did a reverse Google Image search, found out that somebody's been posting the exact same pics on a revenge porn website.<eos> Looks like our golden boy's not so perfect after all.<eos> Well, so now we have a motive.<eos> All we need to do is find out who she is, where she's at, who she runs with.<eos> I'm wondering if we can take the partial shots of her face, put them together, make a composite image, and run it through facial recognition.
Okay, so Salaam's Intel might be good.<eos> Somebody in this ledger may have been sending money to a terror network.<eos> That's certainly possible.<eos> All right, how many names are in this ledger? Hundreds.<eos> I already sent them to Chin, and he's running background on them.
Somebody in this ledger may have been sending money to a terror network.<eos> That's certainly possible.<eos> All right, how many names are in this ledger? Hundreds.<eos> I already sent them to Chin, and he's running background on them.<eos> And then, he's gonna cross-check them against the Terror Watchlist.
Yes.<eos> All those children dead because of you.<eos> No!<eos> The children... they're alive!<eos> You saved them!
What about the should?<eos> The should is a very disturbing question, as it concerns other people's views.<eos> I always listen, when I think about this verb, I always hear that motherfucking fascist pointing at me and asking me:<eos> "What about breasts?<eos> Are you getting them?"
Oh, thank God.<eos> I admit, you... you made me nervous.<eos> I know. But your EKG on the ambulance showed AVNRT.<eos> I'd recommend doing some more tests.<eos> Can you do them?
And this is so quiet and isolated.<eos> We're safe here.<eos> No one knows what I've done.<eos> And you must never tell anyone.<eos> I know you have many questions. But you need to let them sleep in your heart for now.
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!<eos> See when I get mad, I lose control you know, I just...<eos> I don't know what I do... till it's done.<eos> And the kids?<eos> He killed them.
Mrs. Kennedy, I want to thank you for letting us visit your official home.<eos> This is obviously the room from which much of your work on it is directed.<eos> Yes, it's attic and cellar all in one.<eos> Since our work started, we receive hundreds of letters every day.<eos> This is where we evaluate all the finds, and see if we want to keep them, if they'll fit into our budget.
I always have.<eos> And yet, in the days after, directly after, something seemed to change.<eos> In what way?<eos> Before the funeral, the day you moved the casket to the Capitol, well, your children were on full display for the whole world to see.<eos> Well, what are you insinuating, that I exploited them?
But we do know that their entire civilization ended suddenly when they abandoned their homes.<eos> Some have speculated that the nature spirits worshipped by the Anasazi became destructive demons when the community ceased to maintain their sacred laws.<eos> These beings appeared in the form of a coyote, snake, crow, buffalo and wolf.<eos> They terrorized the population.<eos> Often appearing to children before taking them away forever.
Yeah. Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> They terrorized the population.<eos> Often appearing to children before taking them away forever.
Miss Avocet's awake.<eos> Oh Miss Peregrine!<eos> They found my new loop.<eos> The children...<eos> I tried to save them but there were so many Hollows...
Welcome home, King Mudbeard!<eos> My father and my father's father and my weird Aunt Chloe have all searched for the eggs.<eos> But only I, King Mudbeard...<eos> My pom-pom.<eos> - ...have found them.
Geran gives back the takings in 500 EURO notes.<eos> You know, easy to move.<eos> Finally Hagen packs the money inside the bodies high end luxury cars.<eos> 5 million in each car.<eos> The export them onto ships, ships go back to Chile, the cycle is complete Pretty good setup right?
Fuck off.<eos> Find it.<eos> - March the 6th show.<eos> - We do five shows a week.<eos> Find them!
I stood there next to you, drinking my beer in shorts.<eos> I will have walked away, I would have sat down.<eos> A person knows if they are aroused by children,<eos> Because they always look to be near them,<eos> To lure them, deceive them.
- What's that? - Weapons in the chamber.<eos> Captain, we have to stop the processor now. Or everything breath in Yorktown is died.<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> You will die.<eos> Better to die saving lives than to live by taking them.
That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?<eos> That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?<eos> You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.<eos> But I held on to you, Troy.<eos> I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.
Okay.<eos> So, which do we watch first?<eos> I'm not staying.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've seen them all so many times, it's exhausting.
Captain Sullenberger?<eos> First Officer Skiles?<eos> Not at this time.<eos> I would like to go over the parameters that were used.<eos> We will make them available to the union.
That's a request I can live with.<eos> I'm partial to the Kardashians, myself.<eos> As apparently as her majesty.<eos> 19 special requests from 12 different countries.<eos> We denied all of them.
Please... my kids are missing.<eos> It's Noah. Leave a message if you want.<eos> Noah, it's Chad.<eos> Give me a call back, mush, on this number.<eos> We dropped them off at school this morning.
Things are better. The world is better.<eos> Maybe in Westchester.<eos> Out there, mutants are still running, hiding, living in fear.<eos> Just because there's not a war doesn't mean there's peace.<eos> If you want to teach your kids something, teach them that. Teach them to fight.
In these costumes.<eos> Days that Aryan does not want to forget.<eos> Memories he wants to keep close to his heart.<eos> I treasured his memories too.<eos> Kept them right here.
Look, Harper and I have been talking.<eos> The kids need structure, stability.<eos> They need to go to a real school, so they can get real jobs.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.<eos> You're going to get them killed!
Do you want to try one, anybody?<eos> -Those go outside.<eos> I don't want the eggs with the dessert.<eos> It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay?<eos> So do you want to put them here?
Welcome to our "women, own your power" workshop.<eos> Only four percent of the fortune 50d companies are led by women.<eos> Women only hold about 14°/o of corporate executive positions and less than 20°/o of our governmental positions.<eos> I made video diaries complaining about how I had to change what I wore to walk alone at night, how much time it took me to get ready for work, all the housekeeping that was on my shoulders.<eos> In comparison to other gender issues, these videos seem trmal, but I made them nonetheless.
Iam<eos> This applies to images.<eos> -What is it?<eos> I do not know with certainty ...<eos> Do you know who took them?
It was so simple.<eos> It took just a few drinks.<eos> And a little ugly reputation.<eos> Suddenly everyone was talking about your nude photos.<eos> Said they had seen them.
My God, you know how hard it is!<eos> And then, things come up with kids, from inside them, someplace inside.<eos> How can you know what to do?<eos> You try.<eos> You love them.
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?<eos> It's almost insulting.<eos> Is it true?<eos> When are you gonna unpack these boxes?<eos> When I unpack them in my own club.
This means she won't recover soon.<eos> Hardly in the nearest future.<eos> Poor girl.<eos> Please give these magazines to her.<eos> If she is able to read them, of course.
Probably 3 casualties.<eos> They're armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> I repeat, do not go anywhere near them.<eos> They have some kind of skin disease that will eat you alive.<eos> So if you see them, don't hesitate to shoot them on site.
Please, don't forget them.<eos> Reach out and tell that animal you'll be there.<eos> Go online or call now.<eos> Give your monthly gift of support.<eos> For only $18 a month, this is your chance to pull in animals from the depths of despair, to save them from a life of pain, provide them with the food...
But my real name's Nam Sookee.<eos> Raised by Miss Boksun, top purveyor of stolen goods.<eos> I was able at age 5 to tell a real coin from a fake.<eos> Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai, and studied pickpocketing from Kutan, but these babies will never learn such useful skills.<eos> Abandoned as newborns, we'll wash and feed them, then sell them to Japan.
At least they trained us.<eos> Come.<eos> We need to start preparing.<eos> The deserters will be here in a matter of hours.<eos> Please, take these instruments inside and sterilize them.
- How is the money being handed over?<eos> I have to put it in a bag and get on a train to Hamburg tonight.<eos> He will call and tell me where to hide the bag, and then I have to get off at the following stop...<eos> When he has the money, he will release the children somewhere familiar to them.<eos> If we don't do as he says, or tell somebody, he will kill them.
I posed nude and spread my legs.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Yeah, Fantasy is actually, um, he's involved in installation work. Not...<eos> Not type specific, but more like mixed media.<eos> And, um, he actually finds these dead animals, and he embalms them, and then he sort of roboticizes them into these, like, audio sculptural sort of...
The college fees, the medical bills.<eos> Plus Rita left me.<eos> I hooked up with this Asian chick.<eos> She cleaned me out.<eos> Howard, I'm gonna stack the bodies of your 11 children on top of each other and burn them on your lawn if you don't tell me who hired you right now!
No, I need like full fucking and novelty.<eos> Right. The worst part...<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Was that when I went to college... I was so worried that my parents would find these photos that...<eos> Instead of just throwing them away like a normal person... I would cut each of the photos into tiny, little strips... And then I would soak them in water.
Now, please?<eos> At last!<eos> Aw, thank God you're back.<eos> Have you got my order?<eos> Orders will be late this week but we'll do our best to get them in, you have my word on that.
You're too disorganised and too slim!<eos> But I remember teaching myself some words of Yiddish when I first came to Poplar.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> "I can see Baby's head!" and, "We're almost there!"<eos> Welcome words to any mother after a hard labour, but I reckon they deserve to hear them in their own language.
Make a left, then another left.<eos> This is my second war tour!<eos> I know what I'm fucking doing.<eos> Well, this is my 12th.<eos> If they got pictures of us, then we need to get them.
Gnomes would've gutted you.<eos> Who was it, another Rover clan?<eos> An Elf.<eos> An Elf?<eos> Well, you should have killed the arrogant little snot, cut off its pointy ears, and brought them to me as a souvenir!
Here's something to do.<eos> I got a job Monday.<eos> Go to the truck, unlock the big box... and bring me my wood tool box.<eos> The one with the old chisels and knives?<eos> You can help me sharpen them.
Is this one of her jokes?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She went to get the photographs.<eos> - What photographs?<eos> - Had them done with that bloke who takes the school portraits.
Abigail kept a chair against her bedroom door.<eos> - Do you have children?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Then you know.<eos> You do all you can to keep them from harm.
That's more of Dominic's base.<eos> Travis.<eos> What?<eos> Where did you get these photos?<eos> Dominic left them for me.
I think you know his record.<eos> Could you just send somebody over here?<eos> Okay, what is he doing there?<eos> Are these the 911 tapes? Yeah.<eos> The media made a request, And some idiot at county released them.
Thank goodness that's over.<eos> Everything turning black.<eos> Then open your eyes.<eos> I can't feel my wings.<eos> You didn't even know you had them five minutes ago.
And I want to tell you that it's all gonna go back to normal, but honestly, I have no clue.<eos> Anyways, the footage came back on that BE, and we've got a suspect.<eos> I'm going to bust him right now if you want to come with me.<eos> Why don't you give me those eggs?<eos> I'll put them on top here.
- Yes.<eos> All right, I'm gonna go get dressed.<eos> It's a brave new world, Fiona.<eos> Nice ghetto job on the windows.<eos> Yeah, some drunk asshole smashed them with a tire iron.
It's hot!<eos> Oh, dude, don't fucking touch it! I told you it's hot!<eos> Oh, my gosh! I thought it was like Jacuzzi hot.<eos> - No, it's boiling hot!<eos> Now, we add the eggs, and we hard-boil them, okay?
Uniforms will be in to book you in a minute.<eos> Whoa, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> I took the pictures.<eos> I dropped them off, just sending a friendly message to stay away, but that's it.
We know all about the war here.<eos> Especially these little ones.<eos> Children, come out.<eos> Meet my friends.<eos> Now we just need to get them to safety.
I can't tell which is real.<eos> Well, this is what happens when you fuck around with your brain.<eos> Your mind isn't like ours.<eos> When we remember things, the details are hazy, imperfect, but you recall memories perfectly.<eos> You relive them.
All right.<eos> We'll make a fine group of Highland soldiers.<eos> No time to waste.<eos> James Fraser taught me these drills himself.<eos> And believe me, I am going to teach them to you, and you are going to learn them.
It's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Now all that remains is that we escape this place and survive.<eos> All the doors are covered by men seeking the bounty.<eos> And I have to imagine the tunnel exits are being watched as well, given Hornigold's familiarity with them.
Step aside.<eos> When weeks went by with no news of your sentence having been carried out, I assumed an arrangement had been reached to carry it out privately or a deal had been brokered to commute your execution to a long prison stay.<eos> I suppose I should have seen this, that somehow your grip on this place would be too strong to be denied by a king, his laws, or even your death.<eos> In the winter, the sun drives hard through those windows.<eos> You'll be blinded there lest you keep them shuttered all day long.
That can't be me talking.<eos> How would I forget something like that?<eos> There are other recordings, Mr Spector. These are video recordings.<eos> The prosecution suggest that... they were found on your phone.<eos> That you made them.
Sure. Okay.<eos> After six years, how many of those 24 drill bits do you think are still in their case?<eos> None of them.<eos> None of them.<eos> My husband has lost them all.
I became conscious of my own self-consciousness and then I had my very first thought--<eos> "I'm naked!"<eos> I became overcome by some irrational need to cover up.<eos> For some unknown reason, there was a bunch of dead bodies lying around.<eos> Now, I had never worn clothes before, but through some primordial instinct, I... I knew how to put them on.
No, I'd be afraid to leave.<eos> It's gone from bad to worse out there.<eos> There's nothing to be done for those people,<eos> - Centers For Disease Control confirms massive contagions.<eos> They're at a loss to contain them.
I've got some property out there.<eos> You've a clean record.<eos> You'll be the caretaker of my children.<eos> You give them your name.<eos> Raise them and get them married.
Watch where you fall.<eos> hello Urja .<eos> Patel, I've been washed out before in life.<eos> Betrayed? - I mean apples, grapes...<eos> I've washed them before I ate them.
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.<eos> It goes quicker.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> I get the curiosity, but we have questions ourselves.<eos> And we'll be the ones asking them while we drive you back to wherever it is you call home.
Like this?<eos> go ahead<eos> I notice you've been rubbing your eyes<eos> There's a creek over there<eos> Go wash them there
go ahead<eos> I notice you've been rubbing your eyes<eos> There's a creek over there<eos> Go wash them there<eos> Wukong if your eyes aren't feeling well wash them and you'll feel comfy
I notice you've been rubbing your eyes<eos> There's a creek over there<eos> Go wash them there<eos> Wukong if your eyes aren't feeling well wash them and you'll feel comfy<eos> Just go wash them
Ever since this White Bone Spirit moved in she's done all kinds of evil and has snatched countless kids<eos> She feeds on these young kids she has improved her stamina<eos> She hangs the children with cages in her Moon Waters Cave<eos> There are cries of the kids echoing all year round<eos> I can hear them whenever I close my eyes
As it should. He owes you that.<eos> - Fucking monster.<eos> - He's not a monster. He's the father of my children.<eos> So your children are half monster.<eos> You'll raise them human.
Okay, close, close, close, close.<eos> That's good, right? Is that closed enough?<eos> No!<eos> Look, I can still see eyeball.<eos> Can we manually close them? Here.
There's an issue we've had to address involving Taylor.<eos> There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code.<eos> Pictures of what?<eos> I can't show you.<eos> Well, I want to see them.
But he won't tell me what's going on.<eos> There are pictures. Have you seen them?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Just dumb stuff.<eos> Do you have them?
What's he doing?<eos> Just dumb stuff.<eos> Do you have them?<eos> They got sent around.<eos> I want to see them.
I talked to Evy.<eos> I saw the pictures.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Those are online.<eos> Kids are just sending them around.
Thanks.<eos> Are there any available lockers?<eos> - Uh, Ragosa's.<eos> - Yeah, this one right there.<eos> He's actually interning in Dallas to be closer to his kids when his wife took them.
As if you're with me.<eos> As if you are me.<eos> Close them.<eos> I imagine with my eyes open.<eos> Could you close them for me then?
I peed my pants before I had to go onstage.<eos> So the last time you got nervous was 35 years ago?<eos> I bet you were a cute kid.<eos> Come on, you've seen the pictures.<eos> They're all over the Internet, especially now that my aunt sold them to pay her Oxy dealer.
There's heaps of maggots, maggots wriggling in that sheep like moving rice.<eos> Yuck.<eos> That was my haiku about maggots.<eos> It's called 'Maggots'.<eos> This counsellor lady made me do them when I got in trouble.
The same thing you've wanted since you were a little girl...<eos> A life of adventure.<eos> Well, I've grown up.<eos> My dreams changed.<eos> No, you've just let everyone else drum them out of you.
You have beautiful hands.<eos> You are quite unused to physical labor, no?<eos> War changes everything. Ja.<eos> What do you think of ducks, child? Hmm?<eos> I'm very fond of them.
Step away, Jace Wayland.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> The search of your unconscious... is a perilous one.<eos> Please... my memories were blocked.<eos> I have to get them back.
In the nightclub scene, wardrobe will have a gown for you that's more forgiving.<eos> Any more thoughts about who you might marry?<eos> I ain't doing that again.<eos> I had two marriages.<eos> It just cost the studio a lot of money to bust them up.
It was the girlfriend.<eos> The video makes the whole thing clear.<eos> He was drinking.<eos> He basically admits to driving your kids drunk.<eos> He insults them and you.
The rotting corpses.<eos> This was a slaughterhouse in days long past.<eos> They butchered so many poor animals.<eos> I can still hear them screaming.<eos> I can still see them hanging there.
How many questions have you got?<eos> So far, 147.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Josh encouraged me to write them down and be as comprehensive as possible.
It came out of her vagina. So no, I don't want to hold it.<eos> Really puts things in perspective.<eos> You know, the whole circle of life thing.<eos> Yeah, it's true.<eos> Yeah, you raise kids, teach them everything you know, and then they grow up to stab you in the back.
It is not easy putting all of this back together after a shooting.<eos> Quinn, we're doing so well.<eos> Why pretend?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I mean, if we wanted kids, we would have already had them by now, and we didn't.
You certainly have a knack for it.<eos> My father taught me a thing or two about mechanics.<eos> You know, I have a few girls in the East Group that have an interest in learning more about it.<eos> It is the future.<eos> I may bring them by, if it's all the same to you.
Plagues of illness and death.<eos> "And then all light will end and the world will live in darkness.<eos> The very air will be pestilence to mankind."<eos> Is this your prophesy, woman?<eos> Don't speak these words or you may bring them to life.
"The Romans believed it was a punishment worse than death."<eos> Being forgotten.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "Damnatio Memoriae, was later used "on a serial killer in 1598, known as the Demon Tailor.<eos> "He lured children into his shop in Paris "where he would kill them "and boil the flesh off their bones to eat.
Anything that brings you back.<eos> This is gonna hurt.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Don't close your eyes.<eos> Keep them open.
Somethin' about memories.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever had a dream that's, that's so real that you thought it was a memory?<eos> Okay, in this dream, I'm lying in bed with Claudia.<eos> It's a couple of weeks before we graduate from college and we're talking about the future and kids and what we'll call them.
Because we wanted Charlotte dead.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> All the people who could've killed Charlotte... they might have done it because they thought that's what we wanted.<eos> What kind of nut would think that?<eos> The kind who would hold my eggs for ransom... and destroy a freezer full of potential babies just to get them.
I want to talk to my son, Darhk.<eos> I want to know that he's safe.<eos> Oh, this must be the first time your son's been kidnapped because clearly you don't understand how these things work.<eos> I make the demands.<eos> Well, you've made them, and I've agreed.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Well, Chris, looks like another day of nobody joining us for lunch.<eos> Yeah, we never should've let that blind girl touch our faces.<eos> Attention, students. This is Principal Shepherd with the lunchtime announcements.<eos> And as a special treat, I thought I'd deliver them in the rapping style you kids are so enthused about.
- William Etheridge. - Oh, right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> William: Friend of mine took them.<eos> Saw Renée at a restaurant, was about to say hi, and then... saw her take his hand.<eos> So instead of saying hi, he took photos and sent them to you?
William: Friend of mine took them.<eos> Saw Renée at a restaurant, was about to say hi, and then... saw her take his hand.<eos> So instead of saying hi, he took photos and sent them to you?<eos> If she's having an affair, I'd rather know.<eos> Have you shown them to Renée?
But in these kinds of Situations, it's recommended. So, if you have a doctor<eos> That you all normally see For things, that's great.<eos> If not, i want to make sure That you get connected With the city clinic For those tests.<eos> All right.<eos> I wanted to ask About the clothes That he was wearing that night And if he still has them.
If not, i want to make sure That you get connected With the city clinic For those tests.<eos> All right.<eos> I wanted to ask About the clothes That he was wearing that night And if he still has them.<eos> I-i think so.<eos> Okay. If y'all haven't Washed them yet, Put them in a paper bag And just tape it closed.
Okay. If y'all haven't Washed them yet, Put them in a paper bag And just tape it closed.<eos> We did do wash. We did.<eos> But i don't think They were in there.<eos> No. Okay.<eos> Put them in a paper bag, Tape it closed, And then give those To the detective.
We did do wash. We did.<eos> But i don't think They were in there.<eos> No. Okay.<eos> Put them in a paper bag, Tape it closed, And then give those To the detective.<eos> Can i just bring Them to you?
Norman! What are you doing down here?<eos> Just looking in the freezer.<eos> Why?<eos> And what are those dead animals doing out?<eos> Maybe because someone took them out of the freezer To make room for something else,
Leave us!<eos> They'll destroy us.<eos> This losing retrograde battle against homosexuals, especially in the glare of that young man's suicide, will put an end to everything.<eos> It's possible to tolerate a great many things but not a threat to one's own survival.<eos> But you told me that you gave those photos to Sister Mary and that she had destroyed them.
They use latels filled with holes, So the drops would come out slowly, And the pain would be prolonged.<eos> Each small splash of the water, Was like a burning coal.<eos> The Governor of Nagasaki took four friars, and one of our own society (?<eos> There are hotsprings there.<eos> The Japanese call them hells Partly, I think, in mockery. and partly, I must tell you, in truth.
No, no, no.<eos> It's half... half a sleeping pill.<eos> It's not... it's not really drugs.<eos> Folks, do you... do you have kids?<eos> Why? Do you wanna abduct them, too?
More like con-fuck-ulations... or whatever the opposite of congratulations is.<eos> Why?<eos> You get to go find your kids.<eos> You get to fuck 'em up yourself instead of having someone do it for you.<eos> Even I find them, I'm not gonna get 'em. The state won't give them over unless I got an apartment.
Just for a minute... try... try to be Frank Castle.<eos> To be solely fueled by... by a single cluster of seconds.<eos> One moment in... in your entire life...<eos> And every time you close your eyes, you relive that moment.<eos> And every time you open them, you find only the... the briefest peace before you realize that that nightmare is real.
And why are you telling me this?<eos> Honestly, why summon me here at all?<eos> Surely it's not just to reminisce.<eos> I've asked you here because those same wings have been stolen.<eos> And I need your help to get them back.
Your wings are missing?<eos> Sorry, is there an echo?<eos> Isn't that what I just said?<eos> What exactly am I supposed to do with that news?<eos> Use your angelic powers to soar around the city and find them.
Humanity can't handle them.<eos> And if they fall into the wrong hands... Then people might die? Yeah, I get that.<eos> Just saw a chap toss himself off a building after a mere peek at them, so if you're done telling me things<eos> I already know... will you help me or not?<eos> You tell me something. If you truly hated the wings, why'd you hold onto them all this time?
Get it all out.<eos> Okay, seriously, what was in there?<eos> Oh, you are serious?<eos> Oh... okay, sorry.<eos> Did someone make them for you?
I simply used it to gain entrée to you.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Someone stole my wings.<eos> About six feet, glow with the light of God.<eos> So if you'd be so kind as to deliver them, then we can be on our way without any... unpleasantries.
But there's something at Palmetto that I need to take care of, so...<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Didn't you hear me?<eos> My wings are still out there.<eos> I need to find them.
I mean, you were willing to let a human die and unleash the wings upon the world just to remind me who I was.<eos> To fool me into desiring the wings and the hellish throne they accompany.<eos> Well, do you know what?<eos> It almost bloody worked.<eos> But destroy them?
- now, would you, eh?<eos> - You're right.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, don't feel bad.<eos> You have those desires for a reason.<eos> You should act on them.
You got to shake up the competition.<eos> I'm playing with the depth of field.<eos> Stop covering your cock.<eos> Why am I completely sure that your kids are gonna walk in right now?<eos> Ingrid took them for breakfast at the Sherry-Netherland and then shopping at Schwarz.
- Will do, Captain.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What does Buddha say about all these cars in his shop with no owners?<eos> None of the vehicles were reported stolen, and some of the parts that were replaced were of... Dubious origin.<eos> And you might be surprised to learn that all those cars were charitable donations to the salvation community church, and Buddha and his team were repairing them for resale.
But I think he might know who did.<eos> You said you lost your phone.<eos> Ray, you need to get my kids back from the cops, right now.<eos> There's nothin' I can do. You know that.<eos> You bring them here and then, we're getting out of town.
You don't think I had something to do with this.<eos> Just want to know how the admission process works.<eos> I'm sure privacy is a major concern here.<eos> Who has access to the applications?<eos> I see them all.
Just want to know how the admission process works.<eos> I'm sure privacy is a major concern here.<eos> Who has access to the applications?<eos> I see them all.<eos> Then I divide them into four groups.
James, as you read this, I will be taking my brother's body home to where our family is from.<eos> I will take his ashes home and pray that at last it will bring some peace to his troubled mind.<eos> And then I am going to stay here for a while.<eos> Maybe this place will bring peace to me, as well.<eos> I put these words on paper because if I said them to you,
The same person lived at them.<eos> Albert Lin lived at the first crime scene from 2008 to 2012.<eos> He lived at the second from 1978 to 1985, and then it was condemned and torn down.<eos> The empty lot.<eos> The only thing these places have in common is that Albert Lin called them home.
- Dear Lord.<eos> These children are victims of the crop blight in Scotland.<eos> Hunger affords even the innocent no mercy.<eos> Neither do you, forcing them to make the arduous journey across the channel.<eos> We brought them to prove our point.
Where's the other chair?<eos> It's in the Loan Clerk's office.<eos> (gasping): Oh my God, oh my God!<eos> They're here.<eos> You've found them!
(gasping): Oh my God, oh my God!<eos> They're here.<eos> You've found them!<eos> I've got to call Mr. Bruce.<eos> - I have to put them in the safe!

Nothing gets in or out.<eos> Good patrol?<eos> Found more bodies over at Renaissance Park.<eos> It seems to be a popular place to drop them.<eos> Did you burn them?
Wait a minute.<eos> You think my business is in the same universe as Carl's Auto Body toilet seat covers?<eos> Carl just opened a third location because of that wizard.<eos> You got two lives left, Taffy!<eos> Is this how you want to spend them? !
Sometimes when I'm, uh, upset, I let anger get the best of me.<eos> I know the type.<eos> I had a kid with one.<eos> Those kids, they'll be looking to you, you know?<eos> They want to believe you can protect them.
Well... if the people giving us our orders are lying to us...<eos> I guess we better do something about it.<eos> Did you check the backup security tapes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They tape over them every two days.
I think we're being lied to.<eos> I saw two bodies.<eos> They were both dead before Patient Zero.<eos> Did you check the security tapes?<eos> Yeah, they tape over them every two days.
- My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,<eos> I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.
Ow!<eos> Kyle, the "No shoes on the sofa" rule applies whether your feet are in them or not.<eos> Sorry, babe.<eos> [Sighs] Why are your clothes everywhere?<eos> Well, I like to peel them off after a jog.
Kyle, the "No shoes on the sofa" rule applies whether your feet are in them or not.<eos> Sorry, babe.<eos> [Sighs] Why are your clothes everywhere?<eos> Well, I like to peel them off after a jog.<eos> I'll pick them up.
You'll not answer it?<eos> James, don't.<eos> She's to hang in a fortnight.<eos> "I wish to know if you will let me see the three children as soon as possible.<eos> "Bring them if you can."
Man, they're gonna scatter, Shawn.<eos> I want them just as much as you do. All right?<eos> They got pictures of me.<eos> Bobby said they'd take pictures at the warden's parties.<eos> What if he's still got them?
There something else, Gordon?<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you deal with all this nonsense?<eos> You know, it's like feeding animals at the zoo.<eos> Dangle a couple kippers out for them and they dance and keep them locked up in their cages the rest of the day.
What happened to me, you,<eos> Danny and Mark...<eos> Didn't we all go missing the day Jesse disappeared?<eos> What happened to those kids that spent every single moment together up until that point?<eos> Anyone ever see them again?
Easy does it, buddy.<eos> Whoa. What are you doing?<eos> Found him.<eos> He's clear.<eos> "Do you understand your rights as I've explained them?"
It's time for a solution we know will work.<eos> There are over 42 million species of animal.<eos> Wreaking havoc on the world.<eos> So, you're in favor of the Noah Objective now, huh?<eos> You want to call all the animals, exterminate them, and then repopulate.
It's twice what it should be.<eos> Respiration is off the charts for a human being.<eos> The way he's changing, the heightened metabolism, accelerated healing...<eos> We saw that in other animals.<eos> Yeah, mutation made them better, stronger, right?
Cooperate how? Whoever is behind this, he's forcing Vincent, forcing us, to do all of these things.<eos> Maybe it's to see how far we're willing to go.<eos> All I know is that if we don't, everything's lost.<eos> That explains the photos.<eos> Yeah, somebody anonymously took photos of Vincent with Erik Lee, and then slipped them to Agent Dylan.
He knew Vicky Fleming. This is about four or five years ago.<eos> He was having a fling with her. He was married.<eos> And apparently she tried to blackmail him, well, she did blackmail him.<eos> She must have drugged him and taken photos of him. Compromising photos.<eos> And then threatened to e-mail them to everyone he knew - all his family and friends - if he didn't pay up.
- Come on.<eos> - We have to go back, Quentin.<eos> And do what, exactly?<eos> Help those children.<eos> You can't seriously be thinking of leaving them there.
You speak words of the most tender kind only to recant them a day later, and ever since then you've behaved with an aloofness that borders on disdain.<eos> - Just what am I supposed to think?<eos> - Can't you see I am possessed by you?<eos> My waking thoughts, my sleeping thoughts, are only of you.<eos> And had my words been met with anything other than cold indifference I swear I would have repeated them over and over a thousand times since, but... Well, you could hardly have made your feelings any clearer.
- Then why film it?<eos> - To admire his work.<eos> Yeah, his propensity towards voyeurism and the nature of these blitz attacks tells us that he probably is incapable of normal social interaction, and he may be unemployed.<eos> What of the suicides?<eos> Why fake them?
We only assume it's a matter of time.<eos> This is Adrian Vescovi.<eos> He supervises undercover work in the city, and, uh, he will fill you in on the rest.<eos> At this point, we have no idea what these thieves want.<eos> They could be selling these names, they could post them publicly at any moment.
None of you are safe!<eos> Your secrets!<eos> And your lies!<eos> He sees them.<eos> And He exposes them, and they lie there... grunting in the sun, stinking to high heaven.
- Hid it.<eos> Go get it.<eos> My children are too powerful for me alone.<eos> Ash, I need you.<eos> All of you, help me retrieve the Book and send them back to Hell.
The media must be having a field day.<eos> Oh, you could say that.<eos> Oh, well, not nearly as clever as that infamous "New York Post" headline:<eos> "Headless body in topless bar."<eos> He dumped the bodies in public, so he obviously wants them found.
Oh, by the way, I just polished the floor in the Eisenhower Room.<eos> - Tom, stop.<eos> - Be careful in there, all right?<eos> - That was something.<eos> Why did Tom James just wrap up his balls in butcher paper and put them in my purse?
Oh, hey, Peter, listen, I can't work tonight. I'm spent.<eos> That last trick was like trying to use an empty bottle of hand soap.<eos> But you got to work. I set up five appointments. That's a lot of money.<eos> Sorry, I can't do it.<eos> You're just gonna have to cancel them.
I'm more of a Wizard of Oz fan.<eos> You just can't beat a farm girl in great shoes.<eos> Every culture has their version of a mythic creature who takes children.<eos> The Germans have Der Grossmann, the Mexicans- - La Llorona.<eos> But there are whispers that Lady Ambrosia is not a myth, that there's a real woman out there-- takes unwanted children and raises them with the promise of eternal youth.
If they have Ethan, if he leads them here...<eos> Well, you can't let that happen.<eos> You know, what we do matters.<eos> Unwanted children feel loved here.<eos> We keep them safe until... we have to let them go.
- They remind me of...<eos> - The finger painting.<eos> That's the same pattern that was painted on Ethan and the other two kids who escaped.<eos> Same dark edges, same spotting.<eos> So whoever was holding these kids was painting them like butterflies.
They help prepare for the celebration while the wrapping of the butterfly child continues.<eos> Where is she?<eos> We call it The Colony-- an abandoned schoolhouse, Route 2 south of Richmond.<eos> After our son died... she wanted to save other children.<eos> She turns them into butterflies, sets them free s-so they can stay children forever.
Nothing.<eos> Reddington's not gonna stop, you know.<eos> Neither are we.<eos> You have your assignments.<eos> Go do them.
Then you need to stand up for what's right, not for what's black.<eos> Y'all need to respect.<eos> If you handled your kids better... Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> L-listen, it's not about that.<eos> You pull our kids out of school, you suspend them, - you were name calling.
Strong family values are the foundation of everything we're talking about tonight.<eos> I know I would not be standing here if it weren't for the values my parents instilled in me, and I can only hope that I have done the same for my own children.<eos> I know that I am not the only mother out there who is sick and tired of our elected leaders making it harder for me to protect my family.<eos> 10 seconds, Mayor Warren.<eos> Making it harder for us to keep our children safe, to provide them with, uh...
You have to smoke the hive to harvest the honey.<eos> Very important to a beekeeper, but it's not the last thing I wanted to have said to the love of my life... the man who wakes up singing in falsetto.<eos> I kid you not.<eos> "It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day."<eos> The idiot who asked me to marry him three days after we met, and the sap who makes the same disgusting molasses Christmas cookies every year because his grandmother made them, and I eat them.
Interesting.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What is this?<eos> Why didn't it work?<eos> Hades told me to pick three names and chisel them onto the headstones.
- Oh, honey, I love you!<eos> Donnie, would you pray with me, please?<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Just close your eyes, close them.
No, I just...<eos> I wanna take a shower. Feel like myself again.<eos> And then tomorrow, I'm gonna wake up and try to see all my kids.<eos> Walk across all five boroughs if I have to.<eos> I'm gonna tell them I'm gonna get them the fuck out of foster care.
So I totally understand the emotions are...<eos> I got invited back to all nine.<eos> I got invited back to some!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna rank them.
Children need discipline.<eos> Now, if you have kids yourself, you know what--<eos> That wasn't discipline and they're not your children.<eos> The hell they weren't.<eos> I saved them.
Get this party started with some raspberry champagne-skis.<eos> Let me go get some whiskey and a cot.<eos> They didn't listen to anything I told them!<eos> Wow, you've really decked out your workspace with a lot of... dolphin pictures.<eos> I just love them. I don't know why.
Where is The Necronomicon?<eos> I'll never tell you.<eos> Night-night.<eos> My children have turned on me.<eos> Help me retrieve The Book, and send them back to hell.
Bless your soul, Chet, you drunk driving angel.<eos> Step on it, Chet!<eos> Smells like Ash's trailer.<eos> My children have been nesting in here.<eos> Stop calling them that.
Smells like Ash's trailer.<eos> My children have been nesting in here.<eos> Stop calling them that.<eos> They're not your children anymore.<eos> I can feel them.
And when they look upon my son, what do they see?<eos> Go on, say it.<eos> A monster.<eos> Is that what we call these creatures who can't control their nature, their hunger?<eos> And what do we call those who destroy them?
Since the day I first... came online.<eos> If Arnold made me, then I've met him.<eos> Somewhere in my memory, he's there, waiting along with the truth.<eos> Your memories are woven into your identity.<eos> If I should unlock them now when you're conscious...
No.<eos> Most of you go insane.<eos> These memories...<eos> The girl. My daughter.<eos> I want you to remove them.
Nergüi.<eos> Nergüi.<eos> No name.<eos> My family was traditional.<eos> On the day I was born, they wrote names on slips of paper and placed them in the millet bowl.
Yeah, it's all right.<eos> Come in.<eos> I went through the East Africa report again last night.<eos> There's been a change since we sent it to you for approval.<eos> The CIA redacted a few lines, classified them.
It would make Amelia very happy.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And you shall prove it by buying the first drink.<eos> Who knows? Maybe our invitations got lost in the post.<eos> Or perhaps they're having them delivered personally by one of their footmen.
I am, as Baron says, fresh from the streets of Cairo, and I'm still trying to digest the hurricane of popular uprising, violent military coup and revolution that I have just witnessed.<eos> Bloody natives.<eos> You all know King Farouk. Colourful character.<eos> - He owned more than a hundred cars.<eos> - Had them all painted red.
I'm actually in Gumford.<eos> I'm in your room right now.<eos> I bought you some cookies and hot chocolate.<eos> Thank you, mom!<eos> Well, just leave them in my room and go home.
Are they okay?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Babies are healthy.<eos> They're with Alaric.<eos> He took them to the nursery to get them checked out.
We are everywhere.<eos> Like Starbucks.<eos> Or the Eye of Sauron.<eos> Tell you what, I can tell you're not comfortable with taking lives, so I'm going to make things easier for you.<eos> You can save them instead.
I would have noticed.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> You never knew to look for anyone.<eos> And now, during times of stress, details often get buried.<eos> There's a way that we can dig them out.
Pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid.<eos> Ran it through AFIS, came up snake eyes.<eos> But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets inside the magazine.<eos> Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.<eos> I was able to lift them during a process called cyanoacrylate fuming, ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.
I am telling you what I have to tell you as your director.<eos> REBOA is not approved for the E.R.<eos> If we're going by the rules, it's not approved for an O.R., either.<eos> It's experimental. Also, it's our only option.<eos> I'm gonna close my eyes. When I open them, I don't want to see you here.
Are you their guardian?<eos> Oh, we have a guest.<eos> I'm a doctor from Korea.<eos> Some children here have measles.<eos> Can I take them to the field hospital?
Doctor Pyo, it's me.<eos> Let me ask you a favour.<eos> I'm looking for some old materials that I can't find online.<eos> There's too much to scan.<eos> I'll just have to take pictures and send them over.
Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.<eos> I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.<eos> You know your kids.<eos> I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.<eos> You know them.
So, does she have a name yet?<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I can't. Hades can do things with names.<eos> Like put them on tombstones to keep people from leaving here.
Did you, um, I mean, did you... I mean, were you ever worried about people staring at you?<eos> Well, I was, but, you know, people don't really notice.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh.<eos> What'd you, um, what did you do about the... about the... about the nipples?<eos> - I had them tattooed. - Ah.
All right, well, whatever Leo's endgame is, if he left two bodies upstairs and a murder weapon in the wall, it's a pretty safe bet he's not coming back here anytime soon.<eos> Guys, look at this.<eos> It looks like these three 911 recordings were Leo's favorites.<eos> They were played over a thousand times.<eos> And he even put them on a separate playlist.
She had problems.<eos> - You have challenges.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.
Sounds like you've been having quite a lot of fun since last our paths crossed.<eos> Well, to be clear, Caroline practically died in childbirth.<eos> And she's not actually their mother.<eos> It just sort of happened.<eos> So she carried two lives in her womb, she gave birth to them, and now she plans to turn those cooing little faces over to Alaric without so much as a hiccup of hesitation.
Hades told me to pick three names and chisel them onto the headstones.
What is she to you, exactly?<eos> You've already got six children of your own, and I sense no prurient interest.<eos> Is Agent Regan some sort of interplanetary missionary project?<eos> "All creatures great and small?<eos> God made them all."
Dunning mentioned banking records.<eos> Yes, Farris had accounts in Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands.<eos> Would you be able to tell if there was any activity on these accounts in the last 24 hours?<eos> I checked.<eos> Someone cleaned them out late yesterday morning.
Did he love us?<eos> Oh, yes, child.<eos> Almost as much as he loved fritters.<eos> Well, why do all my unborn children sound like Michael Jackson?<eos> 'Cause you weren't around to raise them right.
I'll find him.<eos> Or her.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Just like you promised me that the photos of Jada would never reach Mr. Hanna.<eos> You... sent them to the embassy in Juba.
If one of us gets to go home and see our son, it should be you.<eos> How did you know to do this?<eos> Simple, love.<eos> Hades overlooked one thing during my escape... he enchanted my hand to carve these markers in the first place.<eos> I can't erase the names, but I can change them.
You tired, baby?<eos> I'm tired, too.<eos> There's just crisps, ice cream and a game of football but if the weather holds, you know, there you go.<eos> I'll see you at the party. OK?<eos> Right, come on, everybody, I know these invitations are really exciting, but put them away.
All of it.<eos> Scan the station for life forms.<eos> The station was built to block all scans.<eos> The children are here.<eos> Chambers must have them.
Nielsen Point.<eos> That's where your wife is.<eos> Where your kids are too.<eos> I told you where the women were and where the car was.<eos> I gave them to you on a platter.
Why did he have me do the heart?<eos> I'm asking myself the same question.<eos> Sorry to cause you so much trouble.<eos> That's all right, sir.<eos> After you bag the clothes, take them in for analysis.
He's a Realtor.<eos> There is a difference somehow!<eos> Oh, hey, kids. Actually, I'm waiting for Sarah, so if I could have the room for just a -- a minute.<eos> Thank -- Okay, funny.<eos> Whoever turned out the lights, please turn them back on.
Oh, busted.<eos> Oh, don't mind if I do.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> You there, up in the tree!<eos> The lights are too close together, they're all bunched up, can you separate them?
I have decided...<eos> Please come in.<eos> Sit.<eos> I know you said this wasn't the issue, but if these Scientology discs are holding you back in any way,<eos> I want to show them to you.
My needs are important, like Tiago said.<eos> And I know I don't want to have any more kids.<eos> So, uh, I shouldn't leave the door open.<eos> And I know you want them.<eos> So you should have them.
You don't want to do it to her.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> So, Don is at the top of the hill, and I'm down at the bottom, the kids are on the sled, and the snow was like frozen, thick ice.<eos> And I think, "It's okay.<eos> Even if they come too fast, I can stop them."
Well, Don let them go, and they are starting to rush down the hill. Whoosh!<eos> So fast.<eos> They are coming at me so fast. They're like a bullet.<eos> And all of sudden, I realize,<eos> "If I jump on them, I will kill them."
♪ And miles... ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, yeah. ♪<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> My phone has been ringing off the hook about photos on PicThread.<eos> The president's own children received them.
No, I'm actually more interested in the fact...<eos> I want to hear.<eos> Yes!<eos> Uh, sir, please hold your questions.<eos> I would if you'd let me ask them.
I'm sorry.<eos> So why would someone want this Jeff Brick dead?<eos> I dunno.<eos> I'm guessing it was someone who didn't like all his questions.<eos> Put them down.
Tom, maybe we should.<eos> Look what happened tonight.<eos> How many people... We haven't even processed.<eos> And our kids?<eos> Are we putting them in danger?
They're replacing them just as fast as we're taking them out.<eos> Glad you're all here.<eos> Take a look at this. Sort of a Black Claw corporate structure.<eos> These are the top Black Claw operatives that we know of, alive or dead, listed based on their position in the organization.<eos> The blank spots are positions we know exist, but we don't yet know who's filling them.
Please give my best regards to Abigail and her parents.<eos> So, should we move up the departure or stick with the current schedule?<eos> He was the bridge.<eos> He was perfect.<eos> I'm Sorry All children are perfect only if we can teach them well.
By the way, this is your one hour of video games for the night.<eos> Are you sure you want to spend it arguing about a piece of cake?<eos> Man, you are a natural-born father.<eos> Well, I've always kind of grooved to the crazy kids.<eos> Did you always know you wanted them? Yeah.
This is the first sunrise in my memory.<eos> I really hope I can remember it forever.<eos> You are too naive.<eos> These memories never belonged to you.<eos> I can take them away anytime I like!
- What refuse?<eos> - The wings.<eos> - Inedible.<eos> At this point, I'd eat the bloody feathers.<eos> Fry them up.
- Inedible.<eos> At this point, I'd eat the bloody feathers.<eos> Fry them up.<eos> Oh, but sir, they're just... bone and skin.<eos> You're going to throw them away, and I'm offering you good money instead.
No residual damage from the link, probably thanks to her nanites.<eos> That's one hell of a story, Kid.<eos> I wish I could remember some of it.<eos> Well, I wish I could forget all of it.<eos> What I don't understand is, if our memories were wiped, then how did the link bring them back?
Well, the options are pretty limited.<eos> Hang on, where is it?<eos> Were the cleaners in last night?<eos> No. No, they wouldn't take an iPad anyway. That's way too obvious.<eos> I know it was, because I Skyped the kids and Mum had put them to bed early, so...
The kids like seeing your face, you know.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But I promise I'll FaceTime them tomorrow, OK?<eos> Alright.<eos> I'd better get them fed.
Dr. Robbins talks to me.<eos> Dr. Robbins is the "in" guy.<eos> She's the one. These babies are staying in.<eos> Dr. Robbins is "in."<eos> You're keeping them in, right?
Here's the thing.<eos> Alison really has her heart set on this trip, and, well, she shouldn't be left behind just because I messed up.<eos> - No, please, just let me say my piece.<eos> Now I don't know if you noticed, but it's been pretty hectic the last couple of days in the world, and, well, I haven't focused too much on my kids, which I promised wouldn't happen when I took this job, but who am I kidding, right?<eos> But not being present for them is different than completely letting them down, so I-I-I'm throwing myself at your mercy here.
The adult guests were sitting around the pool while the kids played hide-and-seek.<eos> They alibied each other.<eos> Detectives also cleared two of the staff - that were working in the kitchen.<eos> - What about the kids?<eos> Police interviewed them, but nobody saw anything.
- Bye.<eos> You're welcome!<eos> Would you tell them we called ... again?<eos> Secretary says, "Oliver Davenport isn't here.<eos> And if you have any questions, you should consider submitting them in writing."
Not a staircase.<eos> - A stair presentation.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> Irv Bircher.<eos> I designed your offices, now I want to bring them
Because your girlfriend is in a death spiral.<eos> Just fix it, okay?<eos> "Pencils down."<eos> We all remember those dreaded words from school.<eos> When you heard them, it meant you were out of time.
Didn't know you could be allergic to carriage leather.<eos> Still, just so much good family time.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> You could blow off the convention.<eos> We could stay here for a romantic few days but never tell the kids because we just made them go home?
You have to come down here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think we're in the middle of a major medical ethics scandal.<eos> I have photos and everything.<eos> I'll send them to you as soon...
She may have been in trouble before.<eos> Got the guy from the pawnshop looking through mugshots.<eos> - We're trying to get fingerprints off the bracelet, the watch and the earrings.<eos> - Good.<eos> Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them.
- Why would I?<eos> - Because you're wrong.<eos> - What's the boyfriend gonna say about you?<eos> - I haven't got one.<eos> Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them.
- Because you're wrong.<eos> - What's the boyfriend gonna say about you?<eos> - I haven't got one.<eos> Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them.<eos> My guess is she stole them from him.
You want to stand right up and repeat that to my face, son?<eos> Hey, Bos. Bos, you got a sec?<eos> Real quick. Bos.<eos> Hey, listen, look, I know you hate these meetings.<eos> Oh, yeah, compared to a prostate exam, no, I positively love them.
Until something happened and he rebelled.<eos> Something about you.<eos> What about me?<eos> We don't know.<eos> He's taken all memories of you out of the green, hidden them from us.
We have forensic confirmation, sir.<eos> The American president of Abuddin has waged a holy war against Islam.<eos> Now this is a war against the children of Islam.<eos> These are children.<eos> Can you see them?
That's Jack and Megan.<eos> My kids.<eos> My safe kids.<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> You watch them like this often?
A thousand mothers... grieving.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> I thought losing my...<eos> Emma... was the worst thing ever... ever... but all those children...<eos> I killed them.
Do we have the go-ahead?<eos> Yes.<eos> The American president of Abuddin has waged a holy war against Islam.<eos> Now this is a war against the children of Islam.<eos> I killed them.
This is the third raid of the campus in two weeks.<eos> And it's not going to stop.<eos> These prayer spaces are a problem.<eos> Religious extremists use them to spread their message, to radicalize other students.<eos> You need to shut them down.
We miss you so much.<eos> Do your kids know... that you're a vampire?<eos> Uh, no, we haven't had that talk with them yet.<eos> Kind of waiting for the birds and the bees first.<eos> And when you tuck them in at night, and you brush the hair off their pretty necks, admire it a little?
When we wrote music together... you not only tolerated a vampire, you fell in love with one.<eos> Play that song and you will have something to hold onto.<eos> Like I do.<eos> I have always wanted to be loved by someone in the way that you loved me.<eos> And I would rather have those memories than any future where I destroy them.
Uh, just getting some stuff out of the attic.<eos> Leah's been nagging me, so, you know...<eos> This sudden urge have anything to with the questions I was asking you about your street files?<eos> Eh, it's a total coincidence.<eos> We can get a warrant for the contents of those boxes, unless you want to hand them over now.
- Easy is different than impossible.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'm guessing you didn't get to this office by quitting every time a man told you, "No."<eos> This is about my kids.<eos> If giving him my money lets me have them back...
Sorry. Don't.<eos> You're getting clean.<eos> This is what happens.<eos> The feelings you've been drowning in booze starting to coming up all ugly and loud.<eos> Which is why I'm now trying to bury them in food. Well, come here instead.
That's where I knew her from.<eos> She was in the culture section of the Dispatch.<eos> How does a selfie make her newsworthy?<eos> Ephraim Hill is an appropriation artist from Portland.<eos> He pulls images from social media and then recontextualizes them as art.
Here, I'll show you.<eos> These are portraits from Ephraim's exhibit.<eos> I put on a wig and went into the gallery one day.<eos> I used a hidden camera and took pictures of his pictures of our pictures.<eos> I was gonna sell them outside the showroom for 50 bucks apiece.
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse, I ran back in time and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.<eos> I restored the timeline to how it was, only to find things weren't as I left them.<eos> I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.

Of course.<eos> So, what's gonna happen to the antiquities and the lamp now?<eos> Well, I'm no expert, but given the way that they entered the country and their connection to a murder trial, they'll be tied up in legal battles for years.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I'm sure that Mr. X will be very disappointed considering he worked so hard to procure them.
One there.<eos> One back there.<eos> Chances are each one belongs to a house.<eos> There's no boats at either of them.<eos> We should probably check them out anyway.
I... Though Malik needed to know his options.<eos> You talked to my boy without my consent?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Mr. Martin, this accident has torn apart your lives.<eos> But when are you going to start putting them back together again?
No, I was parking and re-parking the boobie van all day.<eos> I thought Svetlana had them.<eos> Since when do I take babies anymore?<eos> They're with my father.<eos> You let him take them?
You are needlessly alarmed.<eos> It annoys me.<eos> It annoys me that you didn't check with us first before you let him take our kids.<eos> That's why he's been kissing our asses.<eos> - He's gonna sell them.
He has Russian ties to the Mafia, I think, and has very disturbing tattoos.<eos> Has he ever threatened to harm the babies in the past?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Does he have regular contact with the babies?<eos> Well, he sees them every morning, feeds them breakfast, speaks to them in Russian, sings little songs to them.
Has he ever threatened to harm the babies in the past?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Does he have regular contact with the babies?<eos> Well, he sees them every morning, feeds them breakfast, speaks to them in Russian, sings little songs to them.<eos> Is it within the realm of possibility that he may have simply taken them for a walk?
Hello.<eos> This is Debbie.<eos> Hi. Yes, that's me.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I was trying to make them levitate.
What's wrong?<eos> - I-I don't know how you do it, Mer.<eos> - Do what?<eos> Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.
- Do what?<eos> Love your kids like this.<eos> I really love them.<eos> - They love you, too.<eos> - No, I love them like...
Yeah, she does.<eos> Dr. Warren.<eos> Dr. Robbins tells me that you showed superb technique under trying conditions.<eos> She said you saved two lives today.<eos> We knock them down, build them back up, and knock them down again... Oh! ...but does it have to be that way?
I am Mayor Cobblepot.<eos> Why aren't you playing with the other children?<eos> What if they don't like me?<eos> Well, how would you ever know if you don't give it a try?<eos> And if they don't like you, wait for them to turn their backs and push them down the stairs.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse,<eos> I ran back in time and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.<eos> I restored the timeline to how it was, only to find things weren't as I left them.<eos> I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.
Where are they?<eos> They're safe with me.<eos> Let me speak to them.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't do that.<eos> Bring them back, please.
I don't know how to do this.<eos> I don't know how to protect... my own children.<eos> Yes, you do because you were right about something else.<eos> Right now, wherever I go... darkness follows me.<eos> So you need to take them.
I don't know how to protect... my own children.<eos> Yes, you do because you were right about something else.<eos> Right now, wherever I go... darkness follows me.<eos> So you need to take them.<eos> Take them someplace safe until this is all over.
Yes, you do because you were right about something else.<eos> Right now, wherever I go... darkness follows me.<eos> So you need to take them.<eos> Take them someplace safe until this is all over.<eos> Take them away from me.
Two powerful, immortal vampires.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Just let the girls go.<eos> I don't know how to protect my own children.<eos> Yes, you dou Take them someplace safe.
I'll do it.<eos> Just let the girls go.<eos> I don't know how to protect my own children.<eos> Yes, you dou Take them someplace safe.<eos> Take them away from me.
Come on. This way.<eos> Management.<eos> Yeah, this way.<eos> What happened to your wings, son?<eos> I cut them off.
When Hugo lost his child, he went mad.<eos> Buried himself alive in his basement and walled himself in and starved to death.<eos> Damn.<eos> But when new families moved in, families with children, he coveted those children.<eos> So he took them.
Rick Anderton did.<eos> I like Rick Anderton.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I ran those photos on Mithat.<eos> I don't know if you had a chance to look at them.
I don't want you to say anything.<eos> Just put the pictures back on, please.<eos> Not in the same position.<eos> - Then how?<eos> - Can you just put them up differently?
You make me laugh, and you always have my back, except for yesterday.<eos> And... if you give me another chance, I'll never let you down again.<eos> I read Leslie Garner's book.<eos> Wait, you did?<eos> I love that you have big dreams, and I want to be there to help you make them happen.
Sucked up the whole hard drive like an audit.<eos> Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!<eos> If that shit gets out, that's my wife out the door.<eos> Then there's the kids, she'll take them.<eos> Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind she'd take them and she'd win.
It isn't.<eos> Well, whatever.<eos> We decided to meet up with the cars and settle this once and for all.<eos> The location we chose for this titanic duel was Portugal... specifically, the international race track of the Algarve.<eos> When we arrived, mechanics from Porsche and McLaren pounced on our cars, fettling them for what was to come.
Well, you did the right thing.<eos> I'll take all the information back to Homeland, but there's nothing to worry about.<eos> You know, I'd swear on my mother's life that was Bob Lee Swagger.<eos> Didn't you say he stole some tools?<eos> Probably just a junkie looking to sell them to get high.
But we lost.<eos> We just played our last card.<eos> The gas is going to drop, and the world is never gonna be the same.<eos> We made the animals our enemies, the monsters. But we're the monsters.<eos> And now we're gonna punish them for our mistakes.
Well, we have experience tracking animals.<eos> Not like these.<eos> They're reclusive, secretive.<eos> I've lived on this island for half my life, and I've only seen one in the wild.<eos> What if we lure them out?
Wait, I've seen that before.<eos> They're the same.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is what Pierce used to fix the animals in 1895.<eos> He sterilized them.
They're the same.<eos> What is that?<eos> This is what Pierce used to fix the animals in 1895.<eos> He sterilized them.<eos> You know, wiped them out.
- You're already married.<eos> - Only legally.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're... we're recommitting our hearts to each other.<eos> Yeah, you need to find them first.
That was the very first time.<eos> And she told me, "Just keep walking," but I didn't.<eos> I went back.<eos> Jackie the protector.<eos> Take the clothes, put them in a bag.
Of course it is.<eos> But real men don't take no for an answer.<eos> Were all those tests necessary to check a minor gunshot wound?<eos> Well, and concussion.<eos> No. But given how hard it is to get you in here, I figured I'd do them while I could.
[crying] No!<eos> The children look at their lives and see no future.<eos> No one stepping up.<eos> Nothing ever changing!<eos> How am I supposed to protect them? !
Sweetheart, I bought two boxes from you half an hour ago.<eos> You've already done this side of the street.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Both of which you're going to take to the office with you tomorrow.<eos> If they stay in this house, I'll eat them all.
Yeah, you got a point.<eos> Mm. Honestly, that's super dumb.<eos> They just sit there hoping for a photo?<eos> They're vultures.<eos> So... they wait for injured animals to die so they can eat them?
So we get the medical records of every one of those hospitals who had the surgery, we compile a master list.<eos> That is a nine-year window.<eos> Even if we narrow it down, we-we don't know SBK's name.<eos> Wh-What good are medical records?<eos> Then we cross-reference the names with DMV photo records and we show them to Garrett.
Good thinking.<eos> Two, are you upset that I helped Four retrieve his memories without consulting the rest of the crew?<eos> I'll admit I was a little surprised at first.<eos> But the truth is, they're his memories.<eos> If he wants them back, that was his choice.
You're not going to influence my recommendation to the committee.<eos> We've come too far Joon.<eos> If the train is derailing, there's nothing I can do to keep it on the tracks.<eos> The nations respect you, they will listen to you;<eos> you can inspire them to stay the course.
- Leonard... you were married before you went to prison, weren't you?<eos> - My wife, she left me two years after I went away.<eos> She said she couldn't handle it anymore.<eos> - And what about your children?<eos> Do you still see them?
ALEC sounds like the name of a high school lacrosse player who just got baked and wrecked his dad's Saab.<eos> But incredibly, it's actually even worse.<eos> - ALEC is a political lobbying group.<eos> - ALEC is a political lobbying group.<eos> - They write laws... - They write laws... - and give them to Republicans.
Basically it doesn't stop until you've cum.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh, don't worry about him, he'll be fine in a minute.<eos> Oh, my God, I love surprise parties.<eos> I love them, I love them, I love them.
Ah. Thank you.<eos> Mmm. Madam Secretary, do you know why civet coffee isn't bitter?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Th-The beans are gnawed on and digested by little animals called civets, but the bean's core is too hard to digest fully, so eventually they poop it out.<eos> Farmers gather them.
- Hey, you!<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Lend a hand.<eos> - Oh, of course.<eos> - Grab the empties and refill them.
So you trust him?<eos> I think he deserves a second chance.<eos> Besides, I don't need to buy your affections.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I reckon, most nights, you can hardly wait to give them to me.
Well, clearly everything I've told you is a lie.<eos> I've been secretly following James Smith, or whoever he is, and after going to considerable effort to leave a trail of evidence pointing to me, I killed him and kidnapped his son.<eos> Or who knows, maybe I killed the son, too.<eos> I have no motive for any of this, but then maybe I do this sort of thing for sport.<eos> Or maybe, possibly, there is the tiniest chance that the killer took these photos - and left them in my office.
- You cheated on your final exam.<eos> Not here.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Don't pretend you don't know!<eos> You stole the exam questions and gave them to Sarah!
The job of being a parent, just end it<eos> You Keep going on and on about how 'tough' it is, so just end it<eos> Who has forced you to continue being parents? Has anyone forced you to?<eos> You didn't start the job well in the first place so why continue it... just put an end to it!<eos> When kids need you the most you happily leave them and go and then complain about their tantrums...
Especially last year, when I discovered those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern on Peter's phone.<eos> But he explained that his phone number was the old number of-of her ex-boyfriend, so... what was it again?<eos> Oh, the Cloud, that's right.<eos> So the photos were on the Cloud, and that the-the Cloud pulled the pictures or...?<eos> I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him, and that's why he has them.
You manipulative son of a bitch.<eos> Obergruppenfuhrer Smith, I have an order for your arrest.<eos> No, hold on.<eos> The obergruppenfuhrer is here with critical intelligence that the acting chancellor needs to hear.<eos> I have my orders. And I'm countermanding them on my authority.
Hey, boys, get on over here.<eos> Old Denzel's gonna write our notices for us. We need you to write something for the newspaper.<eos> You go ahead and start with mine.<eos> I...<eos> I can't write that. "The Colored Tennessean" prints them free.
That's why you're here.<eos> You ran from it.<eos> Ran all the way to the CIA.<eos> The choices you made saved lives.<eos> The fact that you could make them, stick your neck out when no one else would... That's your greatest strength.
They'd go out on adventures together.<eos> Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.<eos> That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.<eos> Oh, and did they have kids?<eos> They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
- What, like screwing JFK? - Wyatt!<eos> I'm sorry. We cannot play coy anymore.<eos> - Stop it! - How did you know that?<eos> He has pictures, okay?<eos> How he got them, I don't know, but if I don't do whatever it is he wants, he could ruin me.
Just saying.<eos> What happened?<eos> She double-crossed us.<eos> That's what happened. - She went right to Flynn.<eos> - Well, of course she did, because Flynn still has the pictures and she's still afraid that he's gonna use them.
But the memory still exists somewhere.<eos> They can be recovered, right?<eos> In theory, with professional psychotherapy.<eos> But digging them up can often cause anger, depression, PTSD.<eos> Is it better to leave them alone?
I thought you had a date or a... meeting or whatever we're pretending this is.<eos> Oh, yeah, I cancelled.<eos> Why?<eos> I... I... I'm not very good at friend meetings, and they sound like a... a good idea, but then I start thinking about them, and I get a little anxious and just kind of flustered<eos> - and... - Start calling them "friend meetings"?
That's Meridia.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> They sent me photos from the morgue.<eos> A death certificate.<eos> They must have faked them.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> Women love it there. You know what I mean?<eos> Yeah, it's a sick place.<eos> It's only, like, 12 miles from the beach.<eos> Okay, but between us, could you just find a reason to take them off the shelf?
Khun Sa and Naw Khar have completely different styles.<eos> Naw Khar is a reckless and arrogant drug addict.<eos> Most of his men use drugs as well.<eos> He oppresses the small tribes.<eos> He turns the kids into child soldiers and controls them with drugs.
Adamski, uh, Tomcat...<eos> - Uh, that's Thomas Katz? - Yeah.<eos> And who's this young boy here?<eos> It... it wasn't like there was a regular gang, you know?<eos> Hammers would pick up random kids, feed them fish and chips, make them feel special.
Ok, cross-reference those against missing persons.<eos> The rest of us need to figure out how to deprogram the unsub safely.<eos> He's still our best lead to Scratch and Gabriel.<eos> It's the pictures that are baffling.<eos> Scratch left them out specifically to call our attention to them.
It's the pictures that are baffling.<eos> Scratch left them out specifically to call our attention to them.<eos> He's a math genius. He likes us to solve his puzzles, which usually tend to lead to bigger traps.<eos> But it's the configuration that's strange.<eos> The pictures are obviously of Gabriel at different ages, but normally one would arrange them in chronological or reverse chronological order.
Loved it.<eos> Anyway, my friends thought that I was crazy for not going out.<eos> But I knew the reason why we stayed in was that my father didn't want me running five houses ahead with my buddies, while I tried to acquire as many double polysaccharide nougat treats as possible.<eos> He wanted me home with him.<eos> He knew that when kids get older, you lose them, so he wanted to spend the time together.
I hope you aren't in there, but I saw something in the mirror at Granny's, and if the Evil Queen's out here, then I'm worried the tables have been turned.<eos> So if you're in there, please say something.<eos> It's not like leaving a voicemail, Henry.<eos> Mirrors are much more complicated than that.<eos> You trapped them in there. Didn't you?
The things we do for our children.<eos> Yes, I heard Henry didn't exactly make his mother proud today.<eos> All children rebel.<eos> That's their job.<eos> And ours is to do what's best for them... to make them strong.
Seriously, Hammond, you won't be able to see anything unless I do.<eos> -Where are your eyes?<eos> About here?<eos> -At the front of my head!<eos> Right, close them, Hammond.
And then, and this is its party piece, just occasionally, it'll go violently left or right for no reason.<eos> Whoa!<eos> You see that?<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> But look at it this way, we could all probably find fault with our children, and yet... we still love them.
I'm not convinced that this isn't...<eos> Oh, the goat's escaped.<eos> At this stage, we explained to Jeremy that animals cannot be used as counterweights.<eos> Right, no, you may have a point.<eos> I think it's better if I kill them.
Is that the size of the drop or what's happened to his penis?<eos> Right, then.<eos> Let's see what all the fuss is about.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> And now straighten those wheels, Richard, straighten them, because you've got to go down straight.
I've left her at three malls myself, and I've wanted to shove her out of the car on the freeway at least once.<eos> I don't know what to do with her anymore.<eos> I can't reach her.<eos> Before yesterday, she's spoken seven words to me in two weeks.<eos> And you heard them:
How could you let Alan say all that stuff about me on LHL?<eos> You're supposed to protect me from crap like that!<eos> And where did they get those photos in the first place?<eos> I don't know, and it doesn't matter.<eos> When Julia first showed them to me, I said the same thing.
I put a call in to her agent to track her down.<eos> Thanks for coming in, Levi.<eos> I wasn't going to, but I told Oscar you called and he asked me to find out what you wanted.<eos> Have you seen these photos before?<eos> Saw them on your show.
Be safe.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't come back unless you have seen or done something extraordinary.<eos> Otherwise, you will not be in the stories and what will I be able to tell our children about their famous father, Bjorn Ironside?<eos> Tell them that... I love them.
Gail: My mother forced me to learn.<eos> Something about learning an instrument would helped instill discipline.<eos> - [Monitor beeping rapidly] - Remove the top blades.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Remove them.
There's a lot to process before my first cup. Thank you.<eos> I can't believe he's been dealing with this for weeks and we never knew.<eos> That part really doesn't surprise me. He's always kept things to himself.<eos> I guess it was just his way of protecting us.<eos> If anyone targeted my boys, I'd do anything to keep them safe. I know.
Ed, when I met Samanthia, math was her least favorite subject.<eos> Now she's doing fractions and loving it.<eos> And yeah, she's didn't win a demathlon medal and I know that stung, but it made her want to get better.<eos> And isn't that what school is for?<eos> Look, I think challenging your children prepares them for the real world.
- Hey. - What?<eos> I thought I told you to put your clothes away?<eos> - And I did.<eos> - Really?<eos> Then why am I still looking at them?
That's not fair.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> No matter what's happening with us, our children come first.<eos> Don't you dare throw that at me.<eos> My whole life has been about protecting them, especially now.
No way to trace them back to him, either.<eos> Actually, I think there is a way.<eos> I've seen those girls before.<eos> Where'd you get these?<eos> Damien Novak's wife found them on his laptop months ago.
His sister was a victim of abuse, and even though their descriptions varied, all five men who were shamed said their attacker overpowered them easily.<eos> Novak was built like a linebacker.<eos> Well, there's another possibility:<eos> Novak was the worst predator of them all.<eos> He fell for all five of the vigilante's phony girls, cut and pasted their photos into a file on his laptop so he can always have them.
Yet this can be a dangerous place in which to linger.<eos> 60 miles away, in the heart of the desert, sandgrouse chicks are hatching.<eos> It's safer for them to be here.<eos> But being so distant from water is a gamble.<eos> With only their mother to shield them from the sun, if they get nothing to drink, they will be dead within hours.
I have eyes on the shipment.<eos> There are only ten guys. Only?<eos> That's too many guys.<eos> They're removing guns.<eos> All right, they're taking the other boxes... oh, no, they're burning them.
She dies at the very beginning of it, and then her two young employees prop her up and pretend she's alive for the whole weekend.<eos> Exactly, Carol! See?<eos> And this is just like Weekend at Stella's, okay?<eos> See, look, right now your feelings are dead.<eos> What we need to do is prop them up and stuff them full of groove, right?
You can believe I'm innocent.<eos> I just need to prove you didn't pay Harold.<eos> Any chance your financial records are still kicking around from before Tom was murdered?<eos> Oh. It's been a long time.<eos> But my ex-wife might have them.
He grabs a large dictionary.<eos> He cuts out all the pages to fashion it into a camera case and then he cuts a hole in the back of the dictionary for the lens to come through.<eos> That is literally how they shot it, right under the noses of the guards.<eos> And smuggling in their escape equipment was equally risky.<eos> They were allowed to get mail-in packages from family back home, but the guards would routinely search them, so they developed a system.
It's crawling with police looking for them.<eos> [Yolande] We recognize it as our guard's voice, Ali, who we had in Taiz.<eos> Ali had betrayed us.<eos> And as that thought comes to us, we... we simultaneously said, "The children."<eos> Did he betray us and them, or did he just betray us?
Pierre!<eos> No! No!<eos> [sobs] No! And Pierre jumps up and he says,<eos> "I love you.<eos> Tell the children I love them."
I have no regrets.<eos> I'm sure I did the right thing.<eos> [Yolande] The last memory and the last words that I heard from Pierre was,<eos> "I love you.<eos> And tell the children I love them."
- Well, you deserve it.<eos> Shrimp cakes?<eos> Gosh, I haven't had those since...<eos> - Since...<eos> - Dad made them for us?
This trollhunting is making you hallucinate!<eos> I mean, what would a goblin want with a baby?<eos> I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> They steal babies... so they can replace them... with changelings?
I'm still on book three.<eos> Can't exactly read Trollish, so just been kinda looking at the pictures.<eos> This is taking forever.<eos> Excuse me. My zeal for the library sciences seems to be waning.<eos> Since I only have two eyes, reading makes them very tired, very fast.
The National Reformation Council took advantage of this instability and militarily seized power to restore UPC dominance.<eos> We NDF refuse to recognize this illegitimate government.<eos> Who are we? - Who are we? - We are NDF.<eos> - I said who are we? - We are NDF!<eos> Our very own politicians, who steal our resources and give them away for small-small dollar in exchange for private pay-offs, they are spit on the constitution!
What?<eos> What is it with me?<eos> Every woman in my life has kids.<eos> Every one of them.<eos> Before I even got to them.
- I would hurt them.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I would freakin' hurt them!<eos> Okay.<eos> This guy over here is trying to take them!
It's just a project.<eos> It'll happen when it needs to happen, okay?<eos> I mean, we have wood coming out of our ears here with the trees and... Ann... there's no way to cut the trees.<eos> I'm sure we can come up with a way to take them down.<eos> Don't you think? No, it's not even the taking them down.
Or you'll have Stalin on your backs.<eos> Stalin's reach is very long.<eos> If anything happens to him, you'll be picking ice out of your asses in Siberia or have an ice-pick lodged in your brain!<eos> Here, your photographs.<eos> Put them away somewhere safe.
Stalin's reach is very long.<eos> If anything happens to him, you'll be picking ice out of your asses in Siberia or have an ice-pick lodged in your brain!<eos> Here, your photographs.<eos> Put them away somewhere safe.<eos> Don't leave them lying around for innocent chambermaids to steal and show to their mamás, hmm?
I guess I'm kind of hooked on them.<eos> So please give me just one biscuit, then I'll be able to think about something else.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Oh, oh, oh! He's getting the biscuits! He's getting them!<eos> He's got them.
- Sort of.<eos> - What!<eos> Oh my god!<eos> And the photos.<eos> Instagram likes owns them now.
Honestly... We can't have Christmas here!<eos> It feels good to purge.<eos> And we downloaded all our pictures!<eos> You threw away our baby pictures? No!<eos> We sold them to the gay man at the flea market who turns them into funny cards.
It feels good to purge.<eos> And we downloaded all our pictures!<eos> You threw away our baby pictures? No!<eos> We sold them to the gay man at the flea market who turns them into funny cards.<eos> And your father put them on this.
This is the problem.<eos> We're going to need new drills.<eos> Okay, I can get you more drills, but - we're running out of time.<eos> - I know.<eos> Why are you burning through them so quickly?
My parent has called me to Stockholm.<eos> I will return in the fall.<eos> I'm not going to tell the Council what happened in the dining room.<eos> Council has large archives.<eos> I'll go through them thoroughly.
Hey, I'm gonna take you out.<eos> Sort of like a little welcome to the neighborhood?<eos> I appreciate that, but you got.. You got kids at home.<eos> Yeah, but they live with their mother.<eos> I get to see them like once a month, you know how it is?
Angie talks while she chews with her mouth wide open!<eos> It's like a fireman's hose. It speaks of her character.<eos> She's worse than my Aunt Edna.<eos> Look, Hank, I had kids young, just like you did.<eos> I had to raise them while I was still raising myself.
You have his smile.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> You know, I think that your hands were the first thing I loved about you.<eos> I'm gonna miss them.<eos> I think, at first, I held on so tight to the kids, because of all that we went through and how much I loved them.
We were born with flippers.<eos> No?<eos> Just me?<eos> Okay.<eos> We have big dreams, and we will do anything to make them come true.
Maybe if I helped old ladies across the road every day until the end of time.<eos> Or if I joined the VSO, went to Africa or somewhere and helped swollen-bellied kids build dams.<eos> Volunteered to drive the buses that take mongoloids to the seaside.<eos> Served gruel to skeletal pensioners in London soup kitchens.<eos> Or moved to the country and had kids, ate oatmeal, went running, read books, tried to raise them to be so that they don't they won't...
You should ask my mother and my sisters.<eos> - I never met 'em.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> You never did.<eos> Indians got them?
Why are we doing this?<eos> I've always closed my eyes to things that made me uncomfortable.<eos> It makes everything easier.<eos> I don't want to close my eyes.<eos> I want to keep them open.
I wish I had the strength to leave, but I can't.<eos> All they want is my money to work on that infernal machine of his.<eos> That's all they care about.<eos> I will hide these cylinders away in the linen closet.<eos> Should anyone find them, let it be known that they did this.
As for the complex emotions and the capacity for empathy, we all saw the distressing images of Ted agonizing over his fallen friend<eos> John Bennet.<eos> In those images, Ted exhibits all of the remaining qualities of personhood.<eos> It's right there for anyone to see.<eos> And I believe that a just court must by definition grant basic human rights to all those who deserve them.
Johnny please.<eos> You shut up.<eos> Tell me..<eos> I know.. I know where hi._ ._tu_io i._.<eos> Let'._ come back later for them.
Us midwives are going out for a good old knees-up.<eos> Funny when you think of it - when we spent our entire careers extracting babies from women lying with their knees up.<eos> Oh... I... I didn't know you were a midwife.<eos> Retired.<eos> I just thought if I can't have kids myself, I might as well just help others to have them.
-Hitler Attacked Russia.<eos> And when he attacked Finland?<eos> Who occupied the Baltic states?<eos> When occupied Poland?<eos> The devil took them!
I would never do that Katie, and you know that.<eos> - You know he's lying.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Nesbitt is my client now.<eos> You know what's interesting about the photos, if you had them, you'd already have shown them to me, don't you think?
I plant some vegetables to eat.<eos> My husband has just gone to get his pay, but it's a tiny amount.<eos> Apart from that, I have nothing at all.<eos> There's just a hen at home .<eos> if she lays eggs, I sell them at the market, then I buy salt and things, enough to survive each day.
I don't see life that way.<eos> You just have to live life.<eos> We all have been, we all are, and we all will cease to be.<eos> I think I was born to give birth to one or two children.<eos> To feed them from infancy so that, when I'm old, they take care of me, in return.
What do you think I was trying to do for Callie?<eos> And protect Jude from what?<eos> From getting into trouble for the shenanigans in the tent?<eos> Which he actually did!<eos> I love this about you, how passionate and idealistic you are, Lena, how you would do anything to protect our kids, but by trying to protect one, you are hurting all of them.
Testing. Zubaid, is all okay.<eos> This one isn't working.<eos> - Testing. Testing. - Open the mike.<eos> Where are the images from 9th and 10th? Stop. Stop.<eos> For God sake send them.
You're welcome.<eos> They're wonderful kids.<eos> We should get together sometime.<eos> I feel I've been rather childish about all this.<eos> We have to face the fact that we are raising them together, the three of us, yeah.
- What's your husband do?<eos> - My husband's...<eos> Did I take my pills?<eos> Yes, I put them there.<eos> I saw you put them in your bag.
Did the boy speak with you when you went to the water?<eos> A little.<eos> I don't know how to talk to him.<eos> The words get caught in my throat.<eos> I fight to push them through and they come out harsh.
- Rip and ripe.<eos> - Will...<eos> With the E?<eos> Tripe.<eos> Tell your children how you felt when you gave birth to them.
- No big deal?<eos> A lot of women your age...<eos> - having starter marriages and...<eos> - This was not a "starter" marriage, okay?<eos> I was gonna marry Max, stay with him, have kids... and actually raise them to adulthood.
They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.<eos> Never once have they had to work for it, give thanks for it, or pray to you for it.
As soon as we know anything, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> If glass is made from sand, how come you can see through it?
- oh... shit.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> What happened to my picture?<eos> - I-- just tidying up.<eos> I accident-- i bumped into it.
I was in the Spice Shop, I remember that.<eos> Rosalee and Monroe found you unconscious this morning.<eos> You were on the floor in the back room.<eos> There was a mirror.<eos> I looked into it.
Okay. What happened to you, Suzanne?<eos> I need help!<eos> - Okay. - Then we got to get his cells to iron out, because...<eos> But you cannot touch the iron, because it's going to burn your fingers.<eos> You have to throw your spit at it and listen!
What's your boy done with my diamonds?<eos> My boy wouldn't rip you off, Saul, he knows what's what.<eos> Let's just tell Saul Gold who heisted it.<eos> I want that gold, boy.<eos> And if you don't bring it to me, I will come for it.
They always make it seem worse than it is.<eos> My God.<eos> What happened, are you okay?<eos> There's a tree down in the road.<eos> I couldn't see anything... I slammed right into it.
Otherwise, they would have been suspicious of you. So I'll ask again.<eos> What drugs did you do that night?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm asking you a simple and relevant question.<eos> Would you answer it, please?
So, I need you to get to the main menu.<eos> And get ready to rock and roll.<eos> Should be a dialog box.<eos> Okay, and...<eos> Click on it.
Most having to do with my dad.<eos> I think she loved him.<eos> As much as she's capable of loving anyone.<eos> She may have even thought he was the one.<eos> Maybe he wanted her to have the baby, begged her to have it.
Into a baby hybrid?<eos> But how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this egg, I think it's calling for help.<eos> The razorbacks have come for it.
Next time, keep your hands off Ferguson.<eos> What's it to you?<eos> Ferguson's obviously got someone on the outside.<eos> - When's your board meeting?<eos> - It's this afternoon, and I am not looking forward to it.
You know, as long as he's in Syria, Topher's death doesn't seem as real to him, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I agree.<eos> You know, it's just so dangerous over there, and it's getting worse every day.<eos> And you know T.C. He sees danger, he goes right toward it.
The heir to come.<eos> It needs to be kept safe.<eos> We'd be willing to take the little one in.<eos> - You let us handle that, alright?<eos> - Others are coming for it.
You sound wistful.<eos> It was kind of nice, yeah.<eos> I got this huge mahogany desk when I was little.<eos> It's still in there...<eos> And I remember asking specifically for it... For my 8th birthday.
And then I met Denis.<eos> My miracle.<eos> My kind, wonderful miracle.<eos> He brought frankincense to the church.<eos> They call it perfume of the sanctuary.
I don't know.<eos> This is my passion when I'm not running.<eos> I love to ride quad bikes.<eos> It gives you that same adrenaline when you run.<eos> The only rule is if you take an orange tree out, you've got to pay for it.
"GETTING EXPLOSIVES"<eos> Fan Chuan.<eos> Here. Noodles up!<eos> I asked for an large bowl with extra meat.<eos> Can you afford it?
Welcome to he Yoknapatawpha!<eos> I practiced that all morning, which is why it will always be the yonk to me.<eos> I wanted to personally stop in and say how proud we are to have the Yonk back open and contributing to the community once again.<eos> This institution is another strong example of the progress that we are making in the Los Angeles Block, as law and order are restored.<eos> Rest assured, this place is critical in the transitional authority's long-term plans, so we will have our eyes close on it to assure that everything moves ahead as smoothly as possible.
See, I had leverage and I used it.<eos> It wasn't personal.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need food. You have it.<eos> We're willing to work for it.
But isn't it true that these gospel accounts vary widely in what they say, that there are numerous discrepancies between these accounts?<eos> Absolutely. But that's exactly what we should expect.<eos> I don't quite understand that.<eos> Reliable eyewitness accounts always differ slightly in the way they recall the story.<eos> They're coming to it from different geographic perspectives, their history, even where they are located in the room.
That was a lie. But... whatever was in that box meant a lot to her.<eos> Maybe there's something inside that could help us track him.<eos> Where can we find the box?<eos> I think it's still back at the loft.<eos> Let's go get it.
There's a box.<eos> It belonged to my father.<eos> Let's go get it.
Okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I take it the staff meeting isn't happening.<eos> Uh, no, and do you mind being on call for a few hours?<eos> We've got an important wedding commitment and we don't wanna be late for it.
She has a great teacher.<eos> I was a brilliant flautist --<eos> May have won best new soloist at the Lower Ventura Jazz Happening.<eos> I used to keep my trophy in my locker.<eos> I'd stare at it every time the jealous kids would stuff me in there.
Happiness is a myth.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I had it before. It's real.<eos> And it's worth fighting for.
So, I can come to them, they can come to me, whichever's easiest.<eos> I-I'll give them a call today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To a new beginning, Mr. Mayor... for me and this town.<eos> Oh, how the sun shines when you take time to look at it.
Hey, you know what?<eos> I took a couple of cosmetology classes at the community college.<eos> I could give you a little makeover!<eos> She's beautiful, Ma!<eos> Yeah, so is the sun, but you can't stare directly at it.
Because I went to prison.<eos> Because I was wrongly convicted.<eos> I didn't ask for a speech...<eos> You asked a question.<eos> I'm answering it.
I realized I don't want to be scared of that anymore.<eos> I don't think it's gonna work.<eos> What do you mean, you don't think it's gonna work?<eos> I built this to go to absolute zero.<eos> I realize that. But we need the mirror to maintain zero-point energy long enough for Barry's molecules to pass through it.
Told myself that I was being a good big brother.<eos> That I was protecting Tessa.<eos> Anyway... we needed to get rid of the body... somewhere no one could find it, so I came up here.<eos> Alone?<eos> I put the body in the back of the car, threw a tarp over it, and I was here in a few hours.
I came to ask, if you want to join.<eos> They accept Poles.<eos> My late husband's.<eos> Where should I burry it?<eos> You shall win the Ukrainian state or die fighting for it!
Penance.<eos> Yeah, you going to law school, working at the Innocence Project, and now here.<eos> You're looking for forgiveness.<eos> There could be another way.<eos> Ask for it.
Why?<eos> Prison changed me.<eos> Yeah, I'm familiar with the concept of change.<eos> I mean, you didn't just... walk away from your old life.<eos> You ran at it full-bore.
I don't believe that.<eos> Maybe you and I didn't know her as well as we thought we did.<eos> There is no greater blessing a city can have than a king who would sacrifice himself for his people.<eos> But such a sacrifice must be earned.<eos> We must deserve it.
Yeah.<eos> I realized I was kinda having fun not knowing, but now I think it's more weird than adorable.<eos> Is it hot in here?<eos> I don't really like my name. I just kind of...<eos> I kinda hate it, and it makes me angry.
- You mean to say mine.<eos> My men accept that death will be waiting for them upon completion of our task.<eos> They are warriors of the Seventh Rank.<eos> They will not ask for a reprieve.<eos> But I ask it for them.
Are you okay?<eos> It's been a really long day.<eos> Blood-sugar thing?<eos> I have a cookie.<eos> I bought it fresh yesterday, but I was only planning on staring at it.
She'll be all right.<eos> You can't kill this cowboy,<eos> I can't believe you found the fucking water source!<eos> That's going to save hundreds of lives, maybe more,<eos> Take good care of it.
You know, I-I can't believe that she would even want to.<eos> Maybe she didn't think she had a choice.<eos> I'm just saying, if there are still things that go bump in the night out there, what's she supposed to do?<eos> She can't just ignore it.<eos> Vincent, I know how much you want a normal life, and God knows nobody deserves it more than you do, but let's get real.
I mean yours.<eos> The Wolf of God.<eos> You have been chosen.<eos> You are unlike all others and you have a profound destiny.<eos> Will you seize it?
It's not the same.<eos> He's not a mom.<eos> Is this the part where I'm supposed to forgive you?<eos> I don't deserve your forgiveness, Lena.<eos> I'm not asking for it.
I mean, really talked-- that everything we were would end.<eos> Yeah, and now look at us.<eos> I'm still hoping we find our way back.<eos> That is all I ever wanted.<eos> Simon was just... a door for me to try and-- and, uh--and find this part of myself that was lost so I could come back into our marriage and... and fight for it.
Why would somebody hire a thief to steal the heart and then kill him before actually getting it?<eos> All I know right now is that that heart is out there somewhere.<eos> We got to find it fast if we hope to save Zalman.<eos> Or he may end up with a supercharged heart.<eos> Or die waiting for it.
She, uh... she looked up at me and she smiled.<eos> Like she forgave me.<eos> And I never knew it before that moment, that was what I wanted.<eos> Forgiveness?<eos> I don't deserve it.
Don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna take it.<eos> Why wouldn't you take it?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> I don't deserve it, and I don't want Hunter to die.
- What is she doing?<eos> - You have photos of my husband supposedly at the apartment of his legal counsel-- is that correct?<eos> I wish you'd just let me answer my question, Mrs. Florrick...<eos> I mean, ask my question,<eos> Mrs. Florrick... My daughter is in the audience tonight, sir, and I would like to do her the favor of addressing your question, not answering it.
Yes.<eos> And is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well maybe you should take a piece of advice from a man who has pushed away every chance at happiness because it was never enough.<eos> If it's within your grasp, if you know... Where it is and who it's with... Then you should run to it, grasp it, and never let it go.
- My friend!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> It's my home.<eos> How did you gain the King's forgiveness?<eos> I begged him for it, saying life away from Versailles wasn't worth living.
My lords...<eos> My lords, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce to you my dear friend, the saviour of English magic, the magician of Hanover Square, Mr Norr-ell!<eos> He has disappeared.<eos> The rain shall make a door for me.<eos> And I shall walk through it.
I have three.<eos> If any one of them grows up to be like Ensign Wilt, I'll be one proud papa.<eos> Just a special kid, in every way.<eos> A kid with a very heady position at ONI, Captain.<eos> She earned it.
I'm sorry.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm volunteering.<eos> I understand this work better than anyone else out there.<eos> I believe in it.
Now take a hit.<eos> and then, after you do, you can kiss me... anywhere you want.<eos> What about right there?<eos> You wanna kiss my forehead?<eos> Well, most guys would look past it.
Well, it's only going to last a few minutes.<eos> We're on one of the poles.<eos> - Look what I found.<eos> - Will, where did you... is that the wine from the graveyard?<eos> You went back for it?
He was more conscious of the risk and he was trying to be a more conscious rider.<eos> When he started to come back and his results started to get better, all of a sudden, he's racing like a true racer.<eos> COMMENTATOR: Marco Simoncelli has done it.<eos> Marco Simoncelli has grabbed his first MotoGP podium.<eos> It's well deserved after everything he's been through this season.
Where?<eos> That's it.<eos> He told me he's an electrician.<eos> That burn is an exit wound from an electrocution.<eos> We missed it because the rebar went right through it.
Yeah.<eos> Max, you're awful.<eos> We didn't pay for that.<eos> It's Indian food.<eos> We'll pay for it in three hours.
No.<eos> The punishment no longer fits the crime.<eos> Terrible... horrible... unforgivable things are happening each and every day.<eos> It's not supposed to be like that.<eos> We're supposed to respect human life, honor it, protect it.
We're going to get these bitches!<eos> Shoot the tire! Shoot!<eos> Watch out, woman!<eos> You know how much I spent on this car?<eos> I'll take care of it, I promise.
Dr. Rocca, I still don't know what that means.<eos> Saw you out there with Dr. Goran.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Your heart just got fixed.<eos> Be careful with it.
Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.<eos> That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> Wine always helps.<eos> I thank you for it.
I can't do this.<eos> I called my dad this morning.<eos> We both agreed that our relationship probably works better long-distance.<eos> Am I in the right place?<eos> I just fixed up the place a little bit, put my own stamp on it.
Where is it?<eos> Where's the city?<eos> It should be visible from here.<eos> Inverness?<eos> You're looking straight at it.
No. I work a lot, but I thrive on it.<eos> - How's your sleeping?<eos> - It's fine. Like, seven hours a night.<eos> Now, I'm gonna ask you to remember a name and an address.<eos> - I'm gonna ask you for it again later.
Okay, I'll do it.<eos> Why?<eos> !<eos> My heart's caused me enough suffering.<eos> Nobody needs to die because of it... not even you.
Less the big deal we make it, the better.<eos> So give me my money.<eos> You ought to enjoy life a little.<eos> And speaking of which, I enjoyed your statement.<eos> That's pretty funny, you look at it a certain way.
- Emma arnot. Her father.<eos> Jesus... - We'll bring her to the hospital.<eos> Run some tests. - Then we'll have video of both redfern and her.<eos> - I'll never get used to this car.<eos> - You know I traded my rolex for it back...
Open the back. Stop.<eos> The pas de deux in "Romeo and Juliet"<eos> is two dancers who become one.<eos> You cannot climb down from his lift.<eos> You need to melt into it.
Because that is the British way.<eos> Self-deprecating, make fun of the situation, have a laugh.<eos> Make fun of the rules and regulations.<eos> I don't know who did this, but if you're watching and you ever come to England, I would like to buy you a beer.<eos> I'll put a strawberry on it for you.
- Corrupted.<eos> The hard drive is fried.<eos> All we've been able to retrieve is a photo of a farm that we think was connected to an ad for the job.<eos> Trouble is, we don't know if Brooks created the ad.<eos> He could have just been answering it.
Yeah, well, I think you'll see that I was there, also. Two months ago.<eos> My wife was representing Finn... against you, I believe.<eos> This is from two weeks ago.<eos> I'm not gonna use it, Peter, but it will come out.<eos> Finn will be asked about it. Your wife will be asked about it.
Oh, God.<eos> - Oh, hey, I'm sorry.<eos> - Hey, what's the score?<eos> Gotta get a picture of Ricky. [Chuckles]<eos> You're probably not gonna get much for that photo, not unless there's a bong in it.
I don't want to hurry anyone but can we bring this to an end?<eos> I've had quite enough sentiment from John Barrymore and I'm starving.<eos> Goodbye, Mary.<eos> And good luck to you.<eos> I'm glad to have engineered a resolution even if I should have thought of it long ago.
Have all the guests arrived?<eos> I think so.<eos> I should tell Mrs Patmore it won't be long now.<eos> What are these?<eos> Mr Carson's got a notion he and I might buy a place as an investment and maybe run it as a guesthouse or rent it out.
But, you can defeat necross!<eos> I have seen your power.<eos> Go!<eos> My sandman.<eos> You think you can light the sun just by puffing it.
- He's--he's-- he's allegedly in the mob.<eos> - Does that concern you?<eos> - Yeah, a little.<eos> But what other option do I have?<eos> - A question is only rhetorical if you don't answer it.
Bourg knows him. He knows Ian Garrett.<eos> They've shared things.... Material.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Bourg's alibi was a lie.<eos> Garrett paid for it.
There!<eos> On the beach.<eos> That's where the surge started.<eos> Emily, Duke and I got into a fight down there.<eos> Suddenly, a blue light appeared, so bright, it hurt to look at it.
You get to hang out with the rich moms, and I get to be the nanny!<eos> Well, if it helps, you're really good at it.<eos> Ai. Pobrecita Wendy.<eos> "Poor Wendy"?<eos> Mama, I don't think you get how sympathy works... Or who deserves it.
- We need... - Matt.<eos> We need Matt.<eos> 'Mum, you do know hacking is illegal.'<eos> 'I know, Matt and I would never want you to do anything illegal.<eos> 'But I wondered if you could just... accidentally stumble into it.'
Still sorry, though.<eos> Stop it.<eos> And while i led Sebastian into the VIP area, my dad was being led somewhere exclusive as well.<eos> And... this is my bedroom.<eos> I used to have a waterbed until my son decided to jump on it wearing his cleats.

If you tell me this block is going to be zoned for high-rise luxury condos or a new hospital center, I'll buy it up so fast it'll make your head spin.<eos> But a nightclub?<eos> Don't you need an edifice somewhere saying that you came, you saw, you conquered?<eos> Come on, man! Share my dream!<eos> Nurture it!
We... we don't know why he needed that wand.<eos> He took the wand because he wanted magic!<eos> People who steal magic never have good intentions! No.<eos> No. You can't tell what's in a person's heart until you truly know them.<eos> Oh, we'll see what's in his heart, all right. When I shoot an arrow straight through it.
- All right.<eos> Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.<eos> And my second Bruce Lee movie.<eos> And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.<eos> And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded.
Owen?<eos> Marion Rieder?<eos> We have a warrant to search the premises.<eos> A confession is a confession.<eos> Whether you believe it or not doesn't change it in the eyes of the law.
Ray didn't tell you what he did to Amanda, did he?<eos> You're trying to trick me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at the photograph.<eos> Look at it.
I think you're supposed to close the window.<eos> And today, when the thingy goes off...<eos> The air-raid siren?<eos> We're just supposed to lie there?<eos> If you have a desk, get under it.
You come across strangers, you just avoid them.<eos> Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Maybe we can find a better place.<eos> You know, if... we're willing to fight for it.
Can we take your photo?<eos> Sure.<eos> 1... 2...<eos> Meen got the scholarship.<eos> She deserves it.
Is this-- is it because of what happened on the island?<eos> No. After.<eos> There were things that I did; things that I had to do to survive.<eos> Things that there's no forgiveness for.<eos> Well, that's the thing about forgiveness-- you can't get it until you ask for it.
No, I wasn't talking about him.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> You got your solve.<eos> No. You take it.<eos> I mean, you earned it.
You said there was something you didn't tell me.<eos> Will?<eos> You owe me an explanation.<eos> Look...<eos> I know you went to a lot of trouble to get my heart back, but... but that place back there can't possibly affect it.
Stick with what got you here: the easy way.<eos> My son's right!<eos> I became what I despise the most.<eos> I don't want your membership, not this way.<eos> I want to earn it, with my working man's hands.
Look at that!<eos> What is... Whoa!<eos> Solar eclipse.<eos> Blocking the sun.<eos> Do not look directly at it.
Oh... he died.<eos> I was riding him and I thought he just tripped, but he never got up. And here's Uncle Wendel.<eos> No, that's Aunt Jane.<eos> You know, all this cooking we're doing is for my daughter Karen's wedding reception tomorrow.<eos> We're having it here. You should come.
Okay. The full, complete, unedited original tape.<eos> And this... is a subpoena for that tape.<eos> The unedited tape.<eos> Well, I-I, uh... guess I can check through my files.<eos> Great. You want to run home and get it?
I can't get used to them fig rolls.<eos> They'll do you good. They've got fruit in.<eos> The night I met Zakir, he gave me chocolate cake with fruit in.<eos> He'd given me wine to drink, and I hadn't liked it.<eos> The cake was supposed to make the wine taste sweeter, but it only made it taste more sour.
I should just go back to typewriters.<eos> All I need to get you up and running is the activation code.<eos> You keep the original packaging?<eos> Mm, yeah. It's upstairs.<eos> I'll go get it.
And no one taught you how to check out, either.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Max.<eos> You need to get another mix, now don't ya?<eos> I'll go get it, won't take a minute.
I hope he doesn't bring his attorney. Ha, ha, ha.<eos> So, this is where God spoke to you, huh?<eos> Right over here?<eos> Yeah, I was on a run and I had stopped to rest.<eos> This city's really beautiful, if you take the time to look at it.
And Lieutenants Flynn and Provenza were left behind to... talk the doctor into cooperating?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Chief Pope is driving in right now to talk about how he would like Major Crimes to...proceed.<eos> Lori as a nurse, I completely understood his commitment to the poor and to the sick, and I admired him for it.
"Culpers don't exist." Copy that.<eos> Still, use your spy training.<eos> All right. What do we got?<eos> Well, there's a box down there.<eos> All right. How about you go down there and get it?
AND... THEY DIED, TOO.<eos> THEY DID.<eos> YOU KNOW TOMORROW... FOR YOUR BREAKFAST, WE HAVE EVERY CEREAL,<eos> AND WHATEVER'S YOUR FAVOURITE, WE PROBABLY HAVE IT.<eos> AND IF WE DON'T, MRS SIDWA COULD GO GET IT FOR YOU.
Its enormous eyes detect slight variations in contrast above it, towards the surface.<eos> Its vision is entirely adapted to the shadows.<eos> The sedimentary plane, uniform and grey, seems to stretch out of sight and span lit by the camera.<eos> When we approach this spongy marsh, we see carnivorous sponges at work.<eos> When waste touches the bottom, crabs, eels and carnivorous sponges gorge on it.
I will scrub your toilets.<eos> I will trap rodents in your sixth floor walk-up.<eos> I live in an elevator building, but, um, we'll be in touch.<eos> Okay. Now just turn and walk away.<eos> If he picks up your application and looks at it, he's interested.
I-I don't know.<eos> I stopped being me such a long time long ago, I can't even remember who that was.<eos> Guess the only thing that makes me feel like myself these days is when I'm not.<eos> But you've got your whole life ahead of you.<eos> You know, with your crappy genetics and the awful choices you've made so far, you're going to have to fight for it.
- What is this?<eos> - It's calorie aversion therapy.<eos> Cat!<eos> The night before I stopped smoking, I made myself smoke four packs of cigarettes.<eos> Lost the taste for it.
What kind of corset is this? Up here!<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yeah. That's our home.<eos> Where's the lake?<eos> You're looking at it.
No.<eos> Alla nostra buona fortuna.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> To our good luck.<eos> We both deserve it.
How can I take out to India a girl of 19 unless she is my wife?<eos> I love you as a brother.<eos> As a husband, no.<eos> My heart is mute.<eos> Then I must speak for it.
Milly wants her shit, dude.<eos> What the fuck are you thinking coming over here?<eos> If you want something from us, you send us a fucking letter!<eos> I'm gonna let you go, but if you come back here, I swear to God, I'll fucking kill you.<eos> I'm putting all her shit in a box... so you don't have to stare at it anymore.
He's the first man ever to go into space.<eos> The Russians beat the Americans.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> So he goes up in this big spaceship, but the only habitable part of it's very small.<eos> So the cosmonaut's in there, and he's got this portal window, and he's looking out of it, and he sees the curvature of the Earth... for the first time.
We're forbidden fruit. Observe.<eos> - Oh, Laurie.<eos> - Yeah. What if I was to tell you I had an apple in my pocket from lunch?<eos> So what?<eos> Who cares? What if I was to tell you this apple was so special you couldn't even look at it?
You coming, Walter?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> After I took a second look at the video, I knew who it was.<eos> Mr. Joyce keeps a photo of Bobby on his bedside table.<eos> I've been looking at it since I worked here.
You eat like you just got out of jail.<eos> - They don't feed you where you work?<eos> - Oh, we don't eat food.<eos> We just cook it. There's no time.<eos> And if there is time, you're looking at it all day.
Alright, cool.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - See ya.<eos> Bye.<eos> ..this is my chair, I paid for it.
Most vampires disagree with you.<eos> I can't speak for them.<eos> What if you could?<eos> What if I could introduce you to a powerful group of vampires who feel exactly like you do?<eos> Who want to emerge from the shadows of society, maybe even fit into it one day?
What she said last night about that curse...<eos> You think there is anything to it?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> The gold...<eos> Why ain't nobody come back for it?
That's it, that's it.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Tomorrow, after lunch, I'll go to the back of the building.<eos> In the bathroom, above the radiator, there is a window.<eos> Crawl through it. I'll wait for you on the other side.
I will miss you.<eos> I will miss you too.<eos> Come to Mumbai sometime. We'll meet.<eos> I don't know about Mumbai.. ...but make sure you send me your wedding card.<eos> I'll definitely make it for that.
I'm still a smidge nervous about the whole billion-mile thing.<eos> Hey, you are the last person that should be nervous about leaping into the unknown.<eos> Look what you've done as director of G.D.<eos> Jo, we both know they handed me the job.<eos> I didn't earn it.
Well, he should be so lucky.<eos> Oh, uh, I saw they recovered Gibson Hawke's body on Mt. McKinley.<eos> -What?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Apparently, those lost hikers stumbled on it, and they brought the rescue team there.
You don't know how she'd react.<eos> Sally the Ghost.<eos> That's asking him to swallow a heck of a lot, don't you think?<eos> I've been dead for 6 months with no sign of change.<eos> If he gets scared... if my feelings get hurt, if a wte light appears and I walk into it... what's the harm in trying?
Fantastic.<eos> All right, well, let's get behind that fridge and see who or what started this thing.<eos> Hey, who the hell let you in here?<eos> Megan Hunt, M.E. Where's the body?<eos> Uh, well, we kept tripping' over it, so I had Skip here put it in the truck.
In a car accident.<eos> It was raining really hard And we skidded into a river.<eos> We were sinking fast and there was a lot of water.<eos> I thought I was gonna drown.<eos> But my father rolled down the window And shoved me through it.
Vince, wait. Look,<eos> I get that I'm not your favorite person, but I never thought you'd spread lies about me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I may not have a formal education or a high school diploma, but I got a heart;<eos> And you stuck a knife in it by way of my back.
20,000.<eos> Maybe more.<eos> You don't have to do this yourself.<eos> Your father would understand...<eos> My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
Saved you one.<eos> - Thanks, Billy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My root beer.<eos> You've earned it, son.
- The den.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> We're not gonna still live together!<eos> You have to get your own place!<eos> Fran, I can't afford it.
So, it's gone from Ricky's apartment to the apartment?<eos> No, no, it's still Ricky's apartment.<eos> I was just using a more neutral term, I guess, "The apartment."<eos> More neutral than what?<eos> Well, Ricky calls it "Our apartment,"
No. It's just...<eos> It's some stuff at home, Eddie.<eos> Is it Marina?<eos> I love having her in my life, I do.<eos> But everything she's been through, she needs a lotta support and she deserves it.
- The washroom is on this yacht, isn't it? - You...<eos> You wait here..<eos> I will find my way back..<eos> But you know.. he always said..<eos> If you have a dream, believe in it!
It seems like just yesterday since we... Not to me, it doesn't.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have a broken window up there, would you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Facing this direction?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Big enough to fit a person through it?
So why give me more?<eos> I seek forgiveness.<eos> I thought all crusaders were granted remission of their sins.<eos> Oh, I don't seek forgiveness from God.<eos> I seek it from myself.
And you just didn't think to mention that safe haven<eos> Was parked right next door to the frickin' death star? !<eos> It had to be.<eos> This is where we got the vaccine.<eos> We were raiding it for tech whenever we could.
I haven't hired a costume designer yet.<eos> Why not?<eos> The person I wanted didn't work out.<eos> Dare I ask what's in the box?<eos> You're staring at it like someone sent you a severed head.
We, we! That's a lie.<eos> Don't listen to her! Cassidy, she's just saying that To make you feel bad for something you didn't do.<eos> She couldn't stand being alone, So she lied to those other ghosts so she could have friends.<eos> That's why the light's not for her.<eos> She doesn't deserve it.
But I think Mama knows when a dude's digging the show.<eos> I mean, he couldn't keep his good eye off me.<eos> TED: Well, let him down easy.<eos> People are fragile.<eos> And sometimes, without even meaning to, you might rip someone's beating heart out and stomp on it in a room full of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.
This is too soon. I'm not ready, I'm not done yet.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Why's it going dark?<eos> - So what's wrong with the sun? - Nothing.<eos> You're looking at it through a force-field.
You think?<eos> Well, either that or we try too hard.<eos> I mean, I never wanted a kid.<eos> I got one.<eos> I... I didn't try for it.
My sisters and I would find a clump of white violets in a cleft of the brook bank, and we called it our "holy secret".<eos> We would guard them the day long.<eos> We were only about six or seven.<eos> We loved our little secret.<eos> Ethel, the tree - let's go climb it.
I was just trying to help.<eos> My interview report is due tomorrow, and you still haven't checked it.<eos> (Whispers) Checked it.<eos> I'm sure it's fine. Why were you even talking to my ex-boyfriend?<eos> You didn't even look at it.
Check it out.<eos> Wow.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Why did he paint "starry night"?<eos> Maybe 'cause the sky is beautiful And everybody likes looking at it.
- Do you think we should leave too?<eos> - In whose car?<eos> Besides, I kinda like it like this--<eos> Just you, me and the sky, baby.<eos> Look at it.
No toothbrush, no deodorant, no shampoo in the shower.<eos> I'll run his credit card for anything that indicates he's traveling.<eos> Dean's desk?<eos> You can't miss it, right? Pictures everywhere.<eos> He calls it Tyler-Palooza.
Fry, you're alive.<eos> Not only that.<eos> I now know exactly how to end my comic book.<eos> Let's watch.<eos> Say good-bye to your forehead 'cause I'm going to shoot you in it.
Grovel.<eos> Or, you know, we could just let the entire party see your cocktail Frank.<eos> All right. Ivy, listen.<eos> Please. I'm sorry.<eos> I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I'll work for it. All right?
He's not gonna sue. - I wouldn't blame him if he did. He told me his girlfriend cheated on him last year and he still wants to punch somebody.<eos> You have a right to be angry, Kevin.<eos> And the fact you wanted to take the guy's head off means something.<eos> - Yeah, that I should avoid bourbon.<eos> - Well, that too. It means you care enough about your marriage to really fight for it.
I need some rest.<eos> You know, in Julia's office, her window... what... what about it?<eos> It's the nicest window in the house.<eos> You can see the trees swaying and the moonlight glowing so softly on the glass.<eos> And sometimes when I cannot sleep I just go and stare at it.
Do you have any idea where that locker is?<eos> We're looking.<eos> Well, if you find it, you must let me know, because that device is mine.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You haven't paid for it.
I can't believe it.<eos> Russell's moving on.<eos> Parvati moving on.<eos> One spot left.<eos> Three people vying for it.
But here's the thing.<eos> The people who care about us the most have... The most power to hurt us.<eos> Marcus would never do that.<eos> Your body is your temple.<eos> I want you to, uh, take care of it.
I don't even know your real name.<eos> And I've looked.<eos> Thanks for the pen, by the way.<eos> What pen? I got...<eos> Earned it.
I did. Told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.<eos> Now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.<eos> - Wasn't a difficult leap. - How did you know about Afghanistan?<eos> Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.<eos> We ought to be able to afford it.
The bullet is stuck on the vest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you don't have a private one the state will provide you with one.<eos> You ask for support but you don't wait for it.
The Super Sport's version has 1, 200 horsepower.<eos> So why, you might wonder, does it need the power of a Golf GTI added to it, just to do another five miles per hour?<eos> Well, the reasons are quite complicated and I've been barred by the producer from explaining them properly.<eos> So here instead is the primary school explanation.<eos> Well, the issue is the air, which has genuine substance once you're trying to move through it.
Marti.<eos> Yeah, I saw her.<eos> She's a moose.<eos> We're going to bury you, So you should probably keep that luck for yourself.<eos> I don't believe in it.
Who had Thai food last night?<eos> We did, but that was my idea.<eos> Was it?<eos> Uh, I love Thai food.<eos> I was in the mood for it.
She has told everyone about it. I will...<eos> What happened grandma?<eos> - Our Baby has died. Baby?<eos> Who is this Baby?<eos> Milk is boiling on stove, keep an eye on it.
We need to talk later about this.<eos> Later.<eos> As you can see, I'm a reasonable man.<eos> I'm not the monster that you somehow conjured up in your head.<eos> I've been given a position, didn't ask for it.
There's the "Always allowed in" list, the "Sometimes allowed in" list, and the "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever" list.<eos> Who's on the "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever"?<eos> Dr. Dorian at your service.<eos> How was your weekend, Howie?<eos> Well, I bought some new soap, but it turns out I was allergic to it.
Oops ...<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> No. ..<eos> Yes.<eos> Life leaves us unless we fight for it.
And I think this is a good time to make my case.<eos> Tony,we've gone over this before,okay?<eos> It's not how it works.You don't ask in.You're invited in.<eos> All right,then get me an invitation.<eos> Look,after what I've done today,I think I've earned it.
Madre mia.<eos> What do you want the dvd for?<eos> The kids miss their grandpa,you know,especially katy.<eos> She was asking about it.<eos> You know what? I'll just swing by and pick it up.
No, Dad.<eos> I'll never attempt suicide.<eos> I promise<eos> The Rancho you detest put this picture in my wallet<eos> Told me to see it if a suicidal thought crossed my mind and imagine what'd happen to your smiles when you see my dead body
All right, acting Sheriff.<eos> Just until the DOD makes it official.<eos> You happy?<eos> Carter, you know I've always wanted your job.<eos> And I deserve it.
Leave me alone!<eos> Fucking bastard!<eos> Keep still, will you! ?<eos> Your karma must be terrible.<eos> You don't believe in it, right?
But he didn't do it?<eos> No,he didn't.<eos> An ex-wife confessed to it.<eos> I showed him the picture of Mitch Crawford.<eos> He reacted to it,which means that he had to have been talking about him.
Let me just put this away<eos> Sorry<eos> Don't apologize<eos> You should take happiness when you can find it<eos> - You deserve it
Hi, there.<eos> Sorry, some passengers can be so rude.<eos> Why can we still hear her anyway?<eos> I thought these things would stop working once we were in the air.<eos> You're welcome. And if you're curious, I hacked into the plane's wi-fi connection and piggybacked our signal onto it.
You're totally challenging Uma Thurman in Kill Bill!<eos> Get out!<eos> Scram!<eos> Come on Anya, get dressed.<eos> The Froshes are having a party and we're crashing it!
Doesn't mean i think she's wrong.<eos> She hasn't looked at her father's picture since we've been here... not once.<eos> Neither has her mother.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> If you had a photo of kyle reese, you'd look at it, wouldn't you?
Are you kidding me?<eos> That's sweet.<eos> No, kid, you need to be scooping this up with both hands, okay?<eos> You're living the good life.<eos> You deserve it.
Don't shake 'em.<eos> Just swirl 'em around a bit. Richard. Hi...<eos> Rachel Maddox. Oh, and thank you very much for getting me the tickets.<eos> Thanks for the signed first edition for the auction.<eos> I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for my blood.
Thank you, Your Majesty.<eos> I have some urgent business to attend to.<eos> Madam.<eos> The Council considers it sufficient, as Head of the Church, that you can have the bishops annul your union.<eos> But it would be more diplomatic if you should find proof that the marriage was never consummated and that Your Majesty never truly consented to it.
Someone she obviously cared about.<eos> Ziva has always remained an officer of Mossad.<eos> I certainly don't envy the position that she just found herself in.<eos> Considering her less-than-conspicuous background, it's amazing she ever had your trust.<eos> No, she earned it.
Must've been jealous... him getting the scholarship instead of you.<eos> You kiddin' me?<eos> I wouldn't touch Maynard Green with a hundred-foot pole.<eos> So,why do Maynard security logs show you trespassing two days before Luke was killed there?<eos> I'm asking you a question.Answer it.
Is that you talking or is that Poppy?<eos> I just want our old life back.<eos> I don't even know this Abe guy.<eos> Yeah, but you knew where to find his body.<eos> I stumbled across it.
I bought my first Ruger 1022 from Rinaldi's.<eos> Oh, sweet.<eos> Colt Single Action Army.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Aw, this baby's a shooter, not a collector. Dang it.
Thank you.<eos> - Next.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What do you think of my work?<eos> You've been looking at it ever since we left the station.
I can't stay, Pad.<eos> You don't have to come to our wedding.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> And I don't want you to pay for it or give me away.
They thought you were bringing food. Farmers stop you?<eos> - Hm? They had guns?<eos> Dogs? - No.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The Talmud says, if you save a life, you must take responsibility for it.
I never knew anyone like that before.<eos> I had spent my whole life obsessed with my career.<eos> I moved through the world with blinders on.<eos> I never once stopped to look at life the way this crazy, sick old man did.<eos> And I never looked at it the same way again.
I need you at the store.<eos> Why you want to cut down the tree, Pop?<eos> I promised your mother a view.<eos> And it's old.<eos> Look at it.
You know what thought of you the first time I saw you?<eos> - What?<eos> - I thought you looked like a dead man.<eos> I thought... beneath that professional exterior is a man who stopped living.<eos> I wanted to take your heart in my hands and... just pump life into it.
What's the assignment?<eos> Missing person.<eos> Well, when we say person...<eos> I haven't done anything!<eos> Burglaries, joyriding a horse and carriage, pick-pocketing, 24 instances of consuming food without paying for it.
I see her, I'll tell her.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Somebody down at the Sheriff's office.<eos> Said a local shot some kind of animal.<eos> Wants Jamila to take a look at it.
Well,police never took a statement from you back then.<eos> Well,I thought she was assaulted by some sick pervert.<eos> Did Rita have her picture taken by anyone besides Zip?<eos> Oh,guys always wanted to take her picture.<eos> See,the thing about a good photo,you can stare at it over and over and still find... a new meaning in it.
Well, you're probably right, I shouldn't have stopped therapy.<eos> We don't need the four walls and a couch.<eos> It's this agent that I lost...<eos> You've lost people before.<eos> He had this picture of his family and he was reaching out for it.
So I started building an analysis of the wave heights around that island on the day that Nathan died.<eos> How can you do that when the swell's gone?<eos> Magnifying glass.<eos> It's transparent, right?<eos> But when light passes through it, the focal point becomes encircled by shadow.
I mean, we were really cookin' there.<eos> Tom, you got any beer in the fridge?<eos> I got nothing but beer in the fridge.<eos> All right, everyone, go grab a cold one.<eos> You earned it.
- Oh, we'd love to.<eos> - Jeez, we can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Celia's birthday party is Sunday.<eos> We've got to get ready for it, remember?
Amateurs often play scenes in groups.<eos> And the dom would select slaves who share similar fantasies and fetishes.<eos> Why did you lie to us about knowing Ian Wallace?<eos> We have physical evidence linking him to your SM room, so we know you know him.<eos> You had no right to ask the question, therefore I had no obligation to answer it.
Well, maybe in contrast to the surroundings.<eos> What can I get for you two?<eos> Couple cups of coffee if it's fresh.<eos> Just made a batch.<eos> This place looks like a cyclone hit it.
This is... this is a really small town.<eos> You know, there's...<eos> It's... it's bizarre, and, um, that's just the way they live.<eos> They catch their food.<eos> They hunt it, they cook it, they eat it.
Well, you say that now, but once you've held your child And felt that rush of love, well...<eos> It can change you.<eos> Please.<eos> I hate this baby.<eos> What has it done but make me fat And ruin an entire year of my life?
So, um... when do you and Charlie leave?<eos> Tonight.<eos> So I guess... I guess this is, um...<eos> I want you to have a really wonderful life.<eos> You deserve it.
- That's a hell of a dog.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We got a crew coming in the morning.<eos> Look at this wood, huh?<eos> Look at it. It's crap.
My God, can we, at our age... start over?<eos> It's a bit late. Yes...<eos> My leg hurts.<eos> What about your stall?<eos> A friend and the neighbor will keep an eye on it.
We just drove over here and the whole thing's collapsed.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> Look.<eos> Mercifully, though, the ice eventually thickened.<eos> But we were still in all kinds of trouble, because we knew from pilots who'd flown overhead we were about to enter a massive ice boulder field, and we'd been told we wouldn't have a hope of getting through it.
A mark on a map, a double line of tape.<eos> Those are just surveyors.<eos> As the railway comes closer, it will devour every acre in its path.<eos> Will it come over that hill?<eos> It will come through it.
Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.<eos> This is off the record.<eos> Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.<eos> I handed him a photo.<eos> He looks at it.
There was a girl.<eos> Her name was Simone.<eos> It lasted a few months.<eos> - And I'm really fucking sorry. - Okay, enough.<eos> Lucy, if you ask me a question, I'm going to answer it, and I'm going to answer it honestly.
Death only loses its terror when one has consummated one's life.<eos> Have you consummated your life?<eos> I have achieved a great deal.<eos> But have you lived your life?<eos> Or have you been lived by it?
-Are you hungry?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You're probably hungry.<eos> Got some food on the stove.<eos> -I'll go get it.
- Director Brandt.<eos> - Sir. Senator Meachum couldn't be with us today.<eos> I'm sure we can manage without him.<eos> Sergeant Swagger, you asked for this meeting.<eos> Against my better judgment, I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.
It was lost.<eos> Maybe it got mixed up with everything Jimmy brought back to his apartment, and then, I don't know.<eos> What does it matter, Wiley?<eos> I care for you.<eos> And there's this all this other stuff, please don't ask me about it anymore, okay?
That sounds very fascinating.<eos> - I have to tell you this story - I was working with this kid in my office<eos> - and I had to go to the toilets.<eos> And when I came back my chair was all wet.<eos> Oh-oh, that little... - rat. He had peed on it.
Just felt them.<eos> When you died the last time, did you go into the light?<eos> I saw the light.<eos> I wanted it so bad.<eos> - Yeah, but did you go into it?
You killed my daughter!<eos> Tell me where it is or I'm gonna kill him!<eos> That's not the Lock.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You're looking at it.
That's not the Lock.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> What?<eos> I told you, you're looking at it.
Groveling in three, two, one.<eos> - Sebastian?<eos> - Yes? Leary wants to talk.<eos> All he could talk about was how he wanted to get Reshaun Ferris.<eos> When that call came over, he jumped on it.
I got to get up early and open the diner.<eos> Are you sure you don't wanna stay for dessert?<eos> Homemade peach pie.<eos> You made a peach pie?<eos> Well, actually, you made it at the diner, which is technically your home, but I paid for it, I swear.
Cemal's been on the bottle again. Huh?<eos> Pass me that bucket. Will you?<eos> What kind of bucket's that?<eos> It's glass.<eos> You can see the seabed with it.
You were always too useful with it.<eos> Yes, your majesty.<eos> Have you come to beg my forgiveness?<eos> Yes, your majesty.<eos> Well then beg for it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> What about him?<eos> Anyway, we're making small talk, guy says he can't complain, then all he does is fucking complain.<eos> His dead wife, the leg he got shot in, his crappy pension, but then he stops when he sees the picture Marty snapped of your kid.<eos> Just stares at it.
Your grandfather went out of his way to help him find a donor.<eos> You could even say, I think, that Mr Hamilton's alive today... because of Red Stevens.<eos> In the, um, basement of this building... there's a small apartment for a custodian.<eos> It isn't being used right now.<eos> Perhaps you'd, um, like to take a look at it?
Mr. Vice President, the next question is for you.<eos> How do you respond to the charges that you've seized the idea of permanent settlement on this planet as an opportunistic gamble? Some would say it's to be construed as a desperate move from a campaign that was falling behind in every poll.<eos> Well, you know, that is...<eos> That is an excellent question, in fact, Jim. Thank you.<eos> And I am only too glad to have the opportunity to respond to it.
We should at least notify the civilian observers and the press that these ballots will...<eos> I said I'll take care of it from here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Madam President, you should celebrate.<eos> It's a great victory and you've earned it.
I was thinking about Betty, and it's too bad that she couldn't tell people who she really was.<eos> I lied to you before.<eos> About what?<eos> The pancake breakfast.<eos> I didn't tell you about it because I didn't want you to go.
Wow. Is that her spleen?<eos> Looks like a grade three laceration. Maybe a four.<eos> What was she doing standing under a tree in a thunderstorm?<eos> She wasn't standing under it.<eos> She was climbing it.
Wow.<eos> Were we lucky.<eos> - It's a funny thing about luck.<eos> - What's that?<eos> I don't believe in it.
I don't like this.<eos> You don't think I'd rather be in there cracking skulls open?<eos> I show my face, the White Prince disappear.<eos> Look, there's only one way get in and out this place.<eos> And I'm watching it.
And that's what you're bring into that light, nothing else.<eos> Ahh... I see it.<eos> The light...ohh.<eos> It's more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.<eos> Then go into it.
Good.<eos> Means I'm doing my job.<eos> I do have a potential cause of death. But it's by no means airtight.<eos> See this fracture?<eos> Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it.
Do you know where it is?<eos> I've got no idea.<eos> Stefan?<eos> What do you know about Magnus Rhunberg's murder?<eos> I know you suspect Lasse of it.
I have to go.<eos> Will you be okay with Mr. Butler for a while?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Come on, Bates. When we're finished here,<eos> I'll teach you how to polish silver by spitting on it. - Cool!
Make your bid.<eos> - Eleven<eos> Stop kidding<eos> Fifteen<eos> Emily was surprised that though slavery was abolished in Britain... the Company allowed it in India.
- Pleased to meet you.<eos> I'm Raymond's mother.<eos> My family always appreciated gourmet food.<eos> Did you at least make a wish?<eos> It won't come true, he can't get it up yet.
Hear that?<eos> That girl talked to me and I didn't even have to talk to her first.<eos> Come on, Thor. Let's go cruise the mall.<eos> Francine, you are one lucky lady.<eos> You can do anything you want to this body because you married it.
Now go away.<eos> I do not represent evil people.<eos> The lawyer who got the T.R.O. He says he's your son.<eos> –Donny Crane.<eos> –Denny Crane. You gave me the Crane legacy, and I fully plan on living up to it.
What you're about to see is classic sausage-making bureaucracy, civilian oversight of the military.<eos> So get ready to drink out of the fire hose.<eos> Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.<eos> Pay attention.<eos> If they ask you a question directly, answer it, but don't get damn diarrhea of the mouth.
Are you blind?<eos> This place is a piece of crap!<eos> What?<eos> A piece of -<eos> Look at it!
- I mean, if it's a bad heart.<eos> - It's not a bad heart.<eos> Well, can you get him back on the list?<eos> He's waited two yearsfor this heart.<eos> He has to fight for it.
I stabbed lily.<eos> I stabbed my fiancee. Come on, marshall, Do you really think she's still your fiancee?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment.<eos> But you fought so bravely for it.
- No, we're fine.<eos> - I need your car. - Oh, Charlie.<eos> I wasn't really serious about that.<eos> - No.<eos> Go get it.
A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
You can take 'em.<eos> Oh, Sam, you're breaking hearts left and right.<eos> Am I breaking yours, Mr. Daimler?<eos> What?<eos> Your heart, am I breaking it?
It must get a lot of light.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's like waking up in the middle of the sun.<eos> I get to see the old tree.<eos> I like it.
How do you get better?<eos> Gotta sacrifice something.<eos> How do you know when you're lying to yourself?<eos> When you give somebody your word... does it mean anything?<eos> You can just take it back.
I kind of started fucking with him.<eos> I drew a bull's-eye on his head with a red lipstick and I would throw soft fruit at him, like target practice.<eos> And when he shat himself I would just wheel him into a closet and leave him there all day until my mom came home.<eos> And I was, like, a girl interested in sex and boys.<eos> I would take off all of Wayne's clothes and, one day, I put peanut butter, like, all over and just let the dog come and lick it up.
Too late, Johnny Boy.<eos> Ritchie, please!<eos> Stop while there's still time to save your soul.<eos> Says the man who skates away from everything.<eos> Since you got me infected, I've looked all around the world for a cure and I've finally found it.
Please guys, Always eat a pie.<eos> Life is short.<eos> Thanks for the ticket.<eos> It's right.<eos> We must take our share of the pie And we eat it.
Forget it.<eos> Speak the fuck up and tell him what you said to me. - Please, man.<eos> - Go on, sergeant.<eos> It's okay. Speak freely.<eos> That we have a job to do and we'll do it.
Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.<eos> It is worth letting him do this.<eos> Is your friend quite mad?<eos> No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.<eos> Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
Relax.<eos> She said relax.<eos> Did you have a nice time in London?<eos> It was OK, I guess. But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?
When you see the hound and you hear the coins, that's when you know he's close by.<eos> - You understand?<eos> Larry... I don't know what's happened, but I'm trying...<eos> He listens for his name.<eos> Anyone could say it.
I never knew it.<eos> What?<eos> If my husband had told me the name, he'd have had to kill me with the rest.<eos> My husband controlled himself.<eos> Your fucking husband wrote the name in the nightstand you sold and I read it.
What?<eos> If my husband had told me the name, he'd have had to kill me with the rest.<eos> My husband controlled himself.<eos> Your fucking husband wrote the name in the nightstand you sold and I read it.<eos> He typed it in a dead article and I read that, too!
I know exactly where Jack Rabbit's Palace is.<eos> My dad, when I was a little kid, he took me to this place.<eos> It was near where our station used to be.<eos> It was our make-believe world, you know, where we made up stories.<eos> I was the one who named it Jack Rabbit's Palace.
I'm a little freaked.<eos> I'm gonna make sure Shannon has people posted outside your place.<eos> There was another thing.<eos> So strange.<eos> What? right in front of a car... but then he just sort of put his hand out and jumped over it like it was nothing.
Let's go.<eos> Get up!<eos> Why would Rand wanna buy this pier?<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Ward said to buy it.
Oh, what was that?<eos> Come on, hit me.<eos> Okay. Okay. Okay.<eos> You are not to be underestimated, Claire.<eos> Hell, I'm still getting used to bringing the hurt... instead of fixing it.
'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.<eos> Back in the monastery, Brother Kuo would... harvest plums every summer to make wine.<eos> He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.
You incinerated the priest's temple.<eos> Burned it to the ground.<eos> Now he's free of the marker, what do you think he'll do?<eos> He had a glimpse of the other side, and he embraced it.<eos> But you, Signor D'Antonio... took it away from him.
Are you insane?<eos> I can't introduce rogue elements this late in the case.<eos> Sir, I can take...<eos> Now more than ever... the armistice is off paramount importance.<eos> It must be negotiated it must be signed..
Fuck.<eos> - Orale.<eos> - Pull, fucker!<eos> I'm not going in there. That's Spyder's place.<eos> My car's in that guy's garage, Steve, you gotta get it for me.
James, they're not going to give you a ship, they're going to hang you!<eos> No, no, no. Look... go to this address, all right?<eos> There will be a man with markings on his face to meet you... he will take you to my friend Atticus.<eos> Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is.<eos> Write your account... he will secure it and keep you safe.
Oh, another lie?<eos> I got this for you, 'Akbari Afeem'.<eos> What is that?<eos> - It's very good, smell it.<eos> I'll smell it from there itself.
I'll smell it from there itself.<eos> - Are you a clog?<eos> I've been smoking for ages.<eos> Yes, stand back.<eos> - OK, you take it.
I realised that I've been a slave for generations.<eos> We need freedom from these monsters.<eos> Whether we die for it or kill for it.<eos> My life's for the taking.<eos> Take it.
Fire.<eos> Cremation.<eos> Those are images that have never been on the tape before.<eos> You know, primitive cultures believed that the only way to free a soul is to burn the body.<eos> That is, if you can find it.
Then I started doing the research nobody would dare do.<eos> Limb reanimation.<eos> Brain-tissue regeneration.<eos> Trying to figure out how the human body works.<eos> And then learning how to duplicate it.
Wait, what about the apartment above The Cracked Mug?<eos> - Isn't that empty?<eos> - Well, yeah, but... Bay:<eos> I totally forgot about that!<eos> Can we have it?
Can't come between two sisters, right?<eos> Then yeah.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> - I guess I'm home then. - (chuckles)<eos> Plus, that apartment is Regina's, and I would feel bad taking it for us when Daphne has to pay for a place off campus.
Are you more of a beer person or a beer person?<eos> Tough call.<eos> I'll take beer.<eos> Excellent choice, madam.<eos> Tonight, it is being served lukewarm in questionably clean cups and devoid of any flavor.
Profile in Courage.<eos> I had a guy take an intentional shit in his bed.<eos> - That's very aggressive.<eos> - It was premeditated.<eos> Guy told me yesterday, "I'm gonna shit in this bed, and you're gonna fucking clean it up."
It stinks of booze in here.<eos> Ingrid, Petra, get to the cemetery.<eos> I've reports of a fire.<eos> Supposing you can break into Munk's room, his computer, it must have a password.<eos> Of course. I called his old secretary in Oslo to get it.
Yeah?<eos> Well, whatever it is, it ain't enough.<eos> Look, it's not just the money I'm thinking about.<eos> I'm keeping this baby.<eos> I want to raise it right.
But the reason I wanted you to see this picture was that was the year that changed my life.<eos> When I was nine years old I wrote a paper in school about what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said I wanted to be a janitor, because my father was a janitor at city hall.<eos> And I worshipped my father.<eos> I got an A+ on that paper.<eos> Brung it home all proud, but when I gave it to my father, he ripped it up right in front of me and said,
We will only defeat our enemies if we scrub ourselves clean, both physically and morally.<eos> OK, hand it out.<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> - Make good use of this soap.<eos> And make it last.
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
I think they might all be at lunch.<eos> If you want to wait over there?<eos> Can I borrow your pencil if you're done?<eos> Does everyone in Northern Virginia have a security clearance?<eos> Yeah. It comes with your Starbucks rewards card.
- Yeah.<eos> Pretty much had to come from NSA.<eos> Unless the CIA has some monitoring program<eos> Answer me!<eos> Where did it come from?
Holy shit. Holy shit.<eos> Obviously I had no idea what was coming next.<eos> I mean, the explosion, I still don't believe it.<eos> But because the recording got Sekou released, it's important evidence in the bombing investigation.<eos> Now, I've told the FBI I wouldn't say where I got it, and I won't, but...
Faced with a fearsome enemy. But I do not see God.<eos> He was there, within us all.<eos> Praise Him.<eos> Word of the victory is being spread throughout the land.<eos> People will hear that it was God-given.
You were with them?<eos> I was in town at the Big W.<eos> The register girl vanished right in front of me.<eos> She was holding my box of Weet-Bix.<eos> Took it with her.
I do not think you're going to like the answer.<eos> Whatever must be done to secure Madi's release, I'm going to do it.<eos> I do not expect your understanding, but I demand your support.<eos> As my partner, as my friend.<eos> Do I have it?
Whatever must be done to secure Madi's release, I'm going to do it.<eos> I do not expect your understanding, but I demand your support.<eos> As my partner, as my friend.<eos> Do I have it?<eos> Do I have it?
Is this gonna be on the test?<eos> The Black Plague revealed our vulnerabilities and it terrified people.<eos> So what did they do?<eos> They built temples to the immortal like this.<eos> Vertical lines descend from heaven, with all the might of the Lord bearing down on a single point until it is utterly and irrevocably crushed.

They're not us.<eos> And what would "we" do with a city?<eos> We need a place where we can be free, be ourselves. Free of sapiens.<eos> Sounds like a nice fantasy.<eos> Help me make it a reality.
No.<eos> Your private meeting.<eos> You tell me how that is in any way relevant to your investigation.<eos> I am investigating all misconduct, wherever it may be.<eos> And however an investigation may start, once I'm in it, I'm like a Goddamned octopus... Tentacles out in every direction, looking, listening, sucking up every bit of information that I can find.
I am not gonna debate you about which one of us blacker, especially not because of one stupid article.<eos> Which you never should have done!<eos> You know the media's biased against us!<eos> Do you remember Hurricane Katrina?<eos> The press said that black families were "looting" food, but white families were "finding" it.
I need to figure out what our victim was investigating.<eos> Dr. Vaziri, I believe I have found something of note.<eos> Look at the distal end of the left ulna.<eos> Torsion spiral fracture.<eos> I've already documented it.
Oh, he'll be okay, he's fine.<eos> He's already 12 doughnuts in.<eos> I think it's great that you're sending in your audition tape.<eos> You know what? You're-you're challenging yourself.<eos> Actually, I destroyed it.
Yes! Of course I'm upset.<eos> You had a significant procedure done without telling me.<eos> Hold on.<eos> A body was found.<eos> They're bringing it to the lab.
It's because without Sully I don't think I would've been ready for you, for this... and because of that, will always be grateful to him, because... I love this.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, Bones... always.<eos> In Norse mythology, there is a place called Valhalla.<eos> It is the home of the gods, but it is also the place where the bravest warriors get to spend their afterlives.
Come on. I'm a huge fan of your work.<eos> No, I'm a huge fan of your work.<eos> Who was that man, and why is he here?<eos> Ivan and his green goats.<eos> You said you wanted carbon-free landscaping, the goats are gonna clear the hill and fertilize it.
Then that's the building my brother's in.<eos> Easiest way to find out is to call the prison and ask.<eos> There's no Michael Scofield.<eos> Punch up an image from the Internet. Michael Scofield.<eos> Send it to the prison.
I'll show you.<eos> She's always brushing her hand up against Chelsea's thigh.<eos> Always?<eos> That was Coach Fields' first meet.<eos> I-I don't know why I can't find it, but if you saw this photo you'd understand why everyone's so uncomfortable.
- Yeah.<eos> And I figured that's what you're shredding.<eos> After the cops left, I took the shredder bag and I dumped it in the composter just to be on the safe side.<eos> How did you know?<eos> The other night, after you fell asleep. I... found it...
You can get me in, right?<eos> The burns are pretty bad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You honestly want me to believe you just lost the body?<eos> - We're gonna find it.
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!<eos> - We're gonna find it. - You better.
My God.<eos> Oliver, I told you... Nate's on it.<eos> Okay, but if he doesn't find him, I have another idea.<eos> Kiddie porn.<eos> I read that the Russians put it on their enemies' computers.
These people trusted you, Jimmy.<eos> Do you have any idea how much time I had to put in listening to their insipid ramblings about their sciatica or which grandchild disappoints them the most?<eos> Damn right they trust me.<eos> I worked my ass off earning their trust.<eos> Then you betrayed it.
He's got Simon and he's threatening to kill him if Clary doesn't come and activate the sword.<eos> You have to keep Clary away from that sword.<eos> Don't worry. She's with Magnus.<eos> Luke and I are coming for it now.<eos> Just get to the power core. Shut it down.
For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?<eos> I've only seen it one time, and that was from a distance.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Really sorry about this, Sergeant.<eos> You're not here to secure the trigger.<eos> You're stealing it.<eos> Want to read your confession before you sign it?
- Yes. - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next? You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... And you're working double time to make it a better place.
One of my last happy memories.<eos> And I'm guessing, this not one of them.<eos> I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.<eos> I didn't save our city.<eos> I failed it.
And not normally.<eos> He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.<eos> I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.<eos> Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.
Or what?<eos> Or she could lose her mind forever.<eos> Do you remember my eighth birthday?<eos> It was the day you gave me my first seraph blade.<eos> I was so excited to use it that I snuck out of the cabin on my own.
Thank you.<eos> Izzy never would have made it to Idris without your help.<eos> Alec, you and Isabelle and Max and Jace are the most important people in the world to me.<eos> I know I've lost your trust.<eos> I hope I can earn it back.
Before.<eos> After. Before. After.<eos> Richard, I'm trying very hard not to completely lose my shit right now.<eos> I get it. After every VC in town turned us down, we decided that the best way to stay alive until we got to a million users was to cut server usage. Remember that?<eos> The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours was to decrease server load, not keep it the same.
Let's get them inside.<eos> I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass.<eos> Dragonglass kills white walkers.<eos> It's more valuable to us now than gold.<eos> We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it.
Would I could give you some of mine.<eos> You've got gold?<eos> Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.
I want this to be a slow... painful death.<eos> One of a thousand deep cuts.<eos> First we take away his mind...<eos> That's the part I like.<eos> We destroy his empire and take it for ourselves.
I've done this enough times to know I'm finished. No.<eos> DDo not say that. - Wewe will get you help.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Make this city yours... or you burn it to the ground.
But you have to live a little while longer.<eos> Long enough to see Iris die.<eos> The blade didn't hit your organs, but it did shatter your clavicle.<eos> Hang in there, man, hang in there.<eos> - We have to take it out.
His mother's death.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> Let me guess. You do?<eos> I know what my hell is.<eos> I've already seen it in the future.
Sybil called me back here.<eos> She wants that ball of iron I've been lugging around.<eos> For the first time, I was actually able to tell her no.<eos> Because of this.<eos> If you haven't given her that bell striker yet, I need it.
I want to fix my brother,<eos> I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena.<eos> But I am not becoming human while she sleeps for decades.<eos> You won't have to take the cure right away.<eos> Enzo will take it from Cade, and years from now,
I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena.<eos> But I am not becoming human while she sleeps for decades.<eos> You won't have to take the cure right away.<eos> Enzo will take it from Cade, and years from now,<eos> - you can take it from Enzo.
Everything else is replaceable. Let's go.<eos> Listen, I need you to go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.<eos> Help Stefan do what?<eos> Katherine has taken Elena's body, so I'm going to help them find it.
How is that possible?<eos> Crowley, I guess. And now he's dead.<eos> Well, that's what Hess said.<eos> But Crowley's a freakin' cockroach.<eos> I'll believe he's gone when I see the body and burn it.
- Mum.<eos> - I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, the news statement was approved.<eos> Just waiting for the word from you to release.<eos> OK. Send it out.
And in my photos there was a picture, and they sent it to everyone.<eos> What was the photo, Daze?<eos> Don't make me show you.<eos> Oh... sweetheart, no.<eos> Everyone in the school saw it.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.<eos> Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.<eos> Tried to escape.<eos> And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.<eos> Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
- ...and that is clear.<eos> I mean, you say that you want to solve Breece's murder<eos> - and then it's right here...<eos> - Listen falls right into your lap, and you say no?<eos> You just toss it out in the garbage?
I understand.<eos> I sure understand what it is to be lonely, although I don't have a choice.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't need you to understand my life, Madeleine.<eos> I barely understand it myself.
And I put it to him... that your little one was the next best thing.<eos> He knows I asked you.<eos> And he knows you said no.<eos> Well, as I said, I'm saying yes now.<eos> You can take it -- as soon as it's born.
One baby!<eos> Meet your little girl.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I longed for this baby, Patrick.<eos> Longed for it, prayed for it. And now I'm wondering why my prayers were answered because I don't know what sort of a world we're bringing it into.
The owls. What do they mean?<eos> They're the symbol of evil.<eos> Even in the Garden of Eden, evil lurks.<eos> After the fall, sinful man wraps his arms around evil.<eos> He embraces it.
Like, oh, Wayne's a good name?<eos> As if you like my name?<eos> As if you even care about my name?<eos> I like your name, Wayne.<eos> It was given to me by an awful man.
But that was just not...<eos> I mean, you know, for me, it was just a catastrophe.<eos> That's fair enough.<eos> So what do you got more on this?<eos> I mean, here I said, (sighs) why do people always... why do people always look for happiness right where they lost it?
- Yeah.<eos> No concert tonight?<eos> Nope.<eos> What about your solo?<eos> - Louisa can sing it.
This looks nothing like Amelia Earhart's plane.<eos> Well, neither did hers till it was finished.<eos> All right.<eos> You hold the wing.<eos> - I am holding it.
Well, neither did hers till it was finished.<eos> All right.<eos> You hold the wing.<eos> - I am holding it.<eos> - Yeah, I know you're holding it, but just hold it nice and tight.
Told him what?<eos> That you're thinking about leaving him, making a run.<eos> I'm not thinking about it.<eos> You are. Don't lie, Red.<eos> I know the look. I've seen it on many, many faces.
It's away from Saperstein.<eos> Stahl knows.<eos> Stahl suspects.<eos> The lye dissolved any evidence linking you to the body.<eos> Someone else could put it together.
He called it, Jerry.<eos> Not what you wanted.<eos> I guess.<eos> So ask the question.<eos> Run it from... every angle.
Did you come here to yell at me for not treating the family heirlooms with respect, or to blame me for what's happening outside?<eos> How could you let that woman deceive you?<eos> I taught you to be a scientist. To question everything.<eos> No, what you taught me was to doubt myself.<eos> To look for validation elsewhere, so much that I was willing to take it from the first mentor that offered it to me.
You will dishonor yourself before the gods.<eos> My gods are only concerned with my victory.<eos> No.<eos> No, destroying this city is not the answer.<eos> A city that's destroyed will need a new leader to rebuild it.
Wish a sickness on them so they'd die in awful pain?<eos> I cannot do that.<eos> I know, my "curses."<eos> But perhaps, they're just wishful thinking.<eos> Perhaps I take good luck and call it "magic."
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> - I've seen them before.<eos> - I can see it.
- How do you know that name?<eos> - Daddy said his name a lot of times last night.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Sometimes he said it really loud like he was mad at him.
The hand mirror we used to show you when you changed into Renard.<eos> It was on the floor next to her, covered in blood.<eos> She obviously fell in it, but I don't know why it would be on the floor<eos> - unless she was looking at herself.<eos> - Well, she must've picked it up.
Not as long as you help us.<eos> So how long have you had this mirror?<eos> Forever.<eos> It was my mom's.<eos> I remember my dad brought it here to the shop for me to play with when my mom was in the hospital.
How can we ever foresee what will come of our actions?<eos> I agree.<eos> How could I foresee that a month ago today I'd be a free man?<eos> How could your husband foresee that in freeing his friend, he'd liberate a man he'd never met?<eos> Well, I hope that whatever consequence come of this liberty, you'll take full advantage of it.
I mean there were pictures taken of me that could end my teaching career.<eos> Gavin stole them and threatened to post them online.<eos> Well, why would he want to threaten you like that?<eos> He wanted more money for rent. But for what I was paying him, I could, like, live alone.<eos> But if Wigged Out committed the murder, why did he call it in?
I got a few things I got to take care of at work.<eos> Come on, Harvey, you're not leaving because of work.<eos> It's time to let things go.<eos> I complained about the heat not working a million times.<eos> Landlord always says he's gonna fix it, and then nothing happens.
Mmm!<eos> - Mind telling me what that was all about?<eos> - You mean me making sexually suggestive comments to our it guy?<eos> - He has a name, you know.<eos> - I do, but I'd be shocked if you knew what it was.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.<eos> My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.<eos> It reminds me of him.<eos> Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.<eos> Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.<eos> Eleanor deserves to stay.<eos> Thank you for these testimonials.<eos> A ruling has been reached.<eos> Oh, you want to hear it.
Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.<eos> Ugh, your mother's coming?<eos> Oh, boy, hide the silverware.<eos> You mean the silverware you stole from Mom?<eos> Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.
My ex-husband installed it.<eos> It was one of the startups that he was investing in.<eos> Do you know your OffKey security user name and password?<eos> Yes. It's... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is, um, God.<eos> Tom changed it every seven days.
And I'm like, "don't 'babe' me, bitch.<eos> You owe me, like, 15 grand."<eos> And then he gives it to me in cash.<eos> 15 grand.<eos> Well, did he say where he got it from?
You've got houses to sell.<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing with that stool?<eos> Holding it.
Okay.<eos> What are you doing with that stool?<eos> Holding it.<eos> What are you doing with that beer?<eos> Drinking it.
I just have to go kill her brother.<eos> Brother.<eos> We're here.<eos> This spell is strong.<eos> It's been reinforced over time, which means it's going to take time to break.
Only He may be our judge.<eos> Father Pascal speaks from the heart. A suitable choice of Gospel.<eos> Spoken with a fresh voice means it's heard with fresh ears.<eos> A fine sermon.<eos> Such a shame you didn't deliver it yourself, Bishop.
Mandrake.<eos> Keep it with you, always.<eos> She is... kicking you at night.<eos> In the left rib with her heel.<eos> So close to your heart, it sometimes feels like it could break.
I would, Sire.<eos> You would question my faith?<eos> Your child is sick, is it not, Sire?<eos> Yes.<eos> it is sick because it was born out of a union unsanctified by God and because it is surrounded by sickness.
Wow. A few years ago, He realized that rock faces weren't enough.<eos> He loved his life.<eos> It's not over.<eos> But his heart will fail again, won't it?<eos> If it does, I'll restart it.
- You don't get to be modest and have a framed glamour shot on your desk.<eos> Fair point.<eos> Look, we're a team now, and I have a saying ... a tea...<eos> I read the motivational poster in the bathroom. Good.<eos> Well, um, the team trust has been eroded for both of us, but I'm hoping we can earn it back ... tackle problems together within the administrative structure and start ...
I would've figured it out a long time ago if it wasn't for the mind-control soap.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> That blue soap everyone uses?<eos> Hydra loads it up with chemicals.
The Russian has a base under a drilling platform in the Baltic.<eos> Go and save them, and leave us in peace.<eos> How do we get out?<eos> Did you build an exit back to the real world?<eos> Of course I did, but I suspect Aida's discovered it by now.
Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.<eos> And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.<eos> Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.<eos> Destroy this body, sure.<eos> It was designed only for killing.
Yeah. I don't know what I'd be looking for.<eos> Just go ahead and sign here.<eos> What's gonna happen to him?<eos> His... His body?<eos> Funeral home's picking it up for a cremation.
No, not that I've noticed.<eos> - It'd be too early for any of that.<eos> Is the Putnam's cake ready?<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> I just need to wrap it up.
- Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Is that why you didn't tell me that the secret to getting Mxy off Earth was to get him to say his name backwards, because you didn't think I could handle it?<eos> No, I didn't tell you that because it never works!<eos> First of all, it's hard enough to say it forward, and second of all, that guy is a motor-mouth, but he's not stupid.
Good. Then we can strike.<eos> Marcus knows where his mom is, but he's gotta take us to her.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let him out of here.<eos> Mon-El's mother created some sort of device with Lena Luthor.<eos> She could set it off at any moment.
She got her hands on your burner phone, dialed the only number in there.<eos> She blew your cover.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> You found the recording later, after the raid went bad.<eos> You found it and you erased it.
It'll look bad if we don't show our face.<eos> You're right, you should go.<eos> Thank you for offering.<eos> The body was found by the Police Maritime of the Principauté of Monaco.<eos> For now theyâre keeping it in their hospital.
No.<eos> So he kept secrets, even from you.<eos> Apartment 195.<eos> ID44574. The entry code.<eos> But maybe he changed it.
Is that what it told you, Will?<eos> That's what it showed me, Vince.<eos> Look at this city!<eos> It's overrun with evil.<eos> And the only way to take it back is to do one little evil thing myself.
I'm too weak right now, but if we could find a coven to counter Inadu's spell, then...<eos> No, I know the spell.<eos> And we don't need a coven, we just need one powerful little witch.<eos> I have a car in the lot out back.<eos> If I'm not back by midnight, you take it and you go.
And I disagree.<eos> I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.<eos> - How so?<eos> - The tree's a sign of goodness.<eos> But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.
Are you in any jeopardy?<eos> Good morning.<eos> My name... is Tasha Jefferson and I'm an inmate here at Litchfield.<eos> Two days ago, our friend and fellow inmate, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a prison guard.<eos> And I'm sayin' her name again because it can't ever be said enough.
A-squared plus B-squared subtract two-AB-cosine-C.<eos> What is the differential equation?<eos> Herr Einstein, are you still too busy contemplating the secrets of the cosmos to solve this equation?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I-I've already solved it.
The one I outbid you for at Barrett Jackson last summer?<eos> It's parked outside.<eos> Here.<eos> The car is a cute gesture.<eos> And I'll take it.
How does one bring an innocent child into the battle between good and evil?<eos> Probably not by just showing up at her school.<eos> Crane.<eos> You said you had an explanation.<eos> Let's hear it.
Is that...<eos> Am I... Oh, I didn't...<eos> I didn't hear the beep. Ruth. Hi, it's Mallory.<eos> There's an audition.<eos> I'm not running it.
- What the fuck is this?<eos> Just do the move.<eos> We are. We are. We're just motivating it with backstory.<eos> There is a law...<eos> There is a law, and you broke it.
- What? None of it fits anyone, and it's too shitty for Goodwill, so what're you getting so mad for?<eos> It might not feel like it now... but there's gonna come a day when you're staring at a picture... of your dad wearing some... fucking stupid motorcycle T-shirt... and you're gonna wish to fucking God... that someone said to you, "You know what?<eos> Keep that jacket."<eos> "Keep that dress."<eos> 'Cause right then, all you're gonna want to do is put it on.
Everyone's dead.<eos> Dead!<eos> Where's my gold, boy?<eos> Where's my gold? !<eos> I lost it.
All you've gotta do is say "please".<eos> Like, you said, pride.<eos> You rob me of mine. I'll have yours instead.<eos> The gold is mine!<eos> And I will not have some slimy little two-Bob shit nick it because nobody ever hugged him!
Right ol' mess.<eos> Right, we got 30 hours to the exchange.<eos> Got a safe house on Rivington Street where we can stash it.<eos> No.<eos> Take it to Elm Lodge.
They've been more family than you have these past few years.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what happened.<eos> Your son lost my gold to Bob Fink, all of it!<eos> Your gold?<eos> You had it for all of about an hour 15 years ago the night you lost it.
He stays low enough, we lose him for good.<eos> I hate Mexico.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Someplace Epifanio doesn't know about.<eos> Camila got it on the cheap from a dealer who went to prison.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay, here's what Julia found.<eos> August 20, 1976.<eos> Baby surrendered at hospital.<eos> Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker transferred it to a state social worker, uh.
It was gnarly.<eos> Like him. You know, just without all the holes.<eos> Can we see the photo?<eos> Sorry.<eos> My bro took it to the grave.
Oh, what, those symbols?<eos> So you can set it for swamp, minefield, Christmas or Mexico?<eos> Nice.<eos> - Shall I tell you something interesting about the wood, or one of the woods you can have in this?<eos> It only grows on a cliff face in Asia, and the way they get it is they have to abseil down it with their woodworking tools.
I'm sorry.<eos> But what does this have to do with me?<eos> My house?<eos> - Charles did work on your floors.<eos> He took lumber from the amityville house and used it on your renovations.
He was a friend of a cousin of a client, some sort of scientist, who needed help funding his various tech ventures, so Tabor...<eos> The guy owed Tabor money so he took a bunch of his stuff as collateral.<eos> I was getting there.<eos> What do you know about the device?<eos> We took it from his lab while he was out so... not much.
What would you do to get it?<eos> Anything.<eos> Now imagine you had this piece of technology, the means to save them, only to have someone take it from you.<eos> - You have this device?<eos> - Yes? - Give it to him.
I'd say "the one and only," but lately, that doesn't seem to be the case.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Seem to be locked out of all the systems.<eos> Their Android must've installed some kind of fail-safe.<eos> I should be able to override it, but I'll need to do it on the bridge.
As time went by, and freedom arrived, townships changed, and have become a place where black people can have fun.<eos> Barbecuing is something that black people and white people have always done.<eos> Barbecuing used to be something you did just for fun.<eos> Now it is something people can make a business out of.<eos> [in Afrikaans] I found this place and cleaned it up by myself.
All right, all right, listen. It's better this way than the other.<eos> But we have a way to strike back, right here, in Setauket.<eos> What do you got?<eos> They're stockpiling hay at the fort.<eos> Three hundred tons of it, straight from local farms, and due to be shipped to York City on Monday.
Or they'll leave, all of them.<eos> We have to defend this ranch with our lives or they will be slaughtered, all of them.<eos> This place, this place is all we have.<eos> And right now, it is... teetering.<eos> And the only thing that can save it is us.
- I mean, girls usually don't go on play dates with their rapist.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Unless there's something wrong with the girl, unless it's the girl that the mist wouldn't touch.<eos> I didn't ask for your opinion.<eos> Too bad. I'm giving it to you.
That's all it said.<eos> But you don't have the video?<eos> The police said it was self-erasing.<eos> But they took the senator's phone to try and recover it.<eos> So, only you saw it?
Yeah, only ten years of therapy.<eos> Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.<eos> She's right, pal.<eos> I love our life.<eos> And I'm scared of changing it, 'cause the truth is when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> We never got married. She wanted to... especially after you were born.<eos> She took my name.<eos> She wanted you to have it.
Desk duty. Perfect.<eos> I'll bring the desk with me.<eos> That was my feeling.<eos> Small desk, obviously. Maybe it folds up.<eos> But that way I'll have it while I'm making the world safe for democracy some more.
That we're...<eos> That there's no chance of us ever doing something awful again?<eos> That it didn't change us forever?<eos> What happened to us was a miracle, Megan.<eos> We drank in evil... and we spat it back out.
I hate the things, but I can't quit smoking 'em.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah. There's a reason this town will never forget your parents.<eos> They're the ones that burned it down.
There was no other footage before this moment?<eos> Diane, what do you have?<eos> Let's not sandbag here.<eos> Did you know that your video has metadata attached to it?<eos> Even if you try to erase it, the metadata tells us that there is one minute and 20 seconds missing from the head of it.
He's the one that pulled me over a few nights ago.<eos> - Would you tell the court what happened? - I was driving home.<eos> From my mom's house.<eos> He pulled me over, said I was switching lanes without signaling. I wasn't.<eos> He asked me to step out of the car so he could search it.
But after everything that Martha said, it's all over now, anyways.<eos> Honey, when you get home, could you do me a favor?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - When we were in the attic yesterday I saw a box of old newspapers that needs to go in the recycling.<eos> - You want me to bring it down?
But he carried on and even started his own rebel cell after the Empire took over.<eos> Hey, I think I found something.<eos> Looks like some kind of passage down there.<eos> This is the entrance to the tunnels.<eos> Looks like it was deliberately sealed.
She asked me to hold on to those until you needed them.<eos> I think you needed them.<eos> Put yourself in Pandora's shoes.<eos> She's given a gift a wondrous box, filled with things she never even knew existed.<eos> Of course she opened it.
We're the only things standing between those monsters and home.<eos> If we run, they'll kill everyone.<eos> How can we possibly win?<eos> This blade... it's called Hrunting.<eos> It was enchanted with light magic to ensure that whoever carries it into battle will be hailed a hero.
Has to be Dreyfuss.<eos> It does indeed.<eos> But hunting Dreyfuss now would be a costly distraction.<eos> This curse is out.<eos> And we must contain it.
Are you certain this is the place.<eos> Yeah. I know what I saw.<eos> Might be right.<eos> I think I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss's holdings.<eos> They're gonna turn it into a server farm.
Take down this demon?<eos> Okay, it's a little known fact, but cars are filled with trace amounts of gold.<eos> Anti-lock brakes, airbag inflation system chips.<eos> Come on.<eos> If gold was laying around in cars, people would steal it.
We don't have to talk about it.<eos> No, no.<eos> I-I want to.<eos> You know Dreyfuss has a thing for artifacts.<eos> Yeah. He sent Jobe and I to raid this place, clear it of everything valuable.
I know that the divisions between us run deep, that they may very well be insurmountable.<eos> But I implore both of our armies for this one moment to come together as allies and honor a ceasefire so that the injured may be removed from the field of battle.<eos> There may come a day when our courage fails us, when we forsake our friendships and break the bonds of fellowship, but today is not that day.<eos> And perhaps in showing our humanity...<eos> We might just save it.
Sorry I won't be able to help you with your next trial.<eos> For double murder.<eos> Police are on their way.<eos> What?<eos> You used Carter to create the back door and Adam to load it in, and then you killed them both, so you could exploit it any way you wanted.
- It's a circus now.<eos> The press, the mayor's office...<eos> the Deacon will be so lawyered up, I'll never get a go at him.<eos> You need the wife's body to put the bastard away in '96.<eos> He was my ticket to finding it for you.
Hey, you want to talk to Liz?<eos> - No. No, no. I...<eos> - I'm gonna go get some cake from the back.<eos> Why?<eos> They bring it to us.
Hey. Yes, hello, Alex.<eos> You, you didn't deliver on your side of the bargain.<eos> This cannot have been all you got.<eos> Um, I put the name in, and that's all that came up.<eos> Okay, well, did you spell it correctly?
Looks like he was headed toward the end of the IND Rockaway Line.<eos> Yeah, that's what it looked like, but the transit cops out there say he wasn't on the train when it pulled into the Rockaway Park Station.<eos> So, he got off at 105th Street.<eos> We're pulling video to confirm, but that's what we think.<eos> They put it over the air within 15 minutes, but I got to say, I'm not optimistic.
I don't think so.<eos> What is that?<eos> Okay, the milk here, does Ryan always bring the same kind?<eos> Until a couple days ago, there's a new kind in the fridge.<eos> Okay, did you see who put it there?
And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> The fairies want a baby?<eos> They aren't gonna eat it, are they?<eos> It'll be raised as a fairy.
Nikola Tesla?<eos> No, Fred Flexion.<eos> Okay.<eos> And it's only been used once before because...<eos> Three people died trying to shut it down last time.
Three people died trying to shut it down last time.<eos> What's the tent for?<eos> The Flexion is a fold between two different realities.<eos> The tented area is where they cross over.<eos> Now, Ms. Wicker and I will work together to cast the Flexion, but if we hold it longer than two minutes, we will all die.
All the babies this week woke up with no mouths.<eos> Oh, horrifying!<eos> I bet you're wondering what happens next, and that is how I know I've done my job well.<eos> Sit back, have a nice pipe of marijuana, and enjoy my grand opus.<eos> I call it Fillory's Last Gasp.
- Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> SportsCenter.<eos> Yeah, no, it's a company phone, Mary.<eos> Just send me a picture.<eos> I'll delete it.
At this hour?<eos> I gotta get up early.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, thanks for the beer.<eos> I'm taking it to go.
Trust me, he's not our guy.<eos> He didn't have that killer look.<eos> That killer look?<eos> Yeah, no joke.<eos> I saw it in Kuwait.
You mean the world to me.<eos> What's wrong with that light?<eos> It's just... it's a light.<eos> It's always like that.<eos> You know, it just needs a good kicking.
It's just... it's a light.<eos> It's always like that.<eos> You know, it just needs a good kicking.<eos> We gotta... We should fix it. I'll tell ya what,<eos> I'm gonna go fix it right now, okay?
Keep thinking.<eos> Wait.<eos> Just wait.<eos> The wristband the guy was selling, He posted a picture to prove it was real.<eos> I could download it for you.
Stop.<eos> Isolate frame 93.<eos> Crop edges.<eos> - What are you doing now?<eos> - Pulling an image, so I can run it through facial recognition.
Where we going?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> See that car?<eos> That's the one we pulled from the videos.<eos> - You recognize it?
I mean, as awful as that guy was, he didn't deserve to die that way.<eos> Besides, killing Harrison accomplishes nothing.<eos> The work people like me are doing, educating the public and fighting to get legislation passed, that is gonna do a lot more to protect the shark population than taking out one single hunter.<eos> So you believe her?<eos> I'll have HPD look into her alibi, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna check out.
I was eating my quesadilla.<eos> It was a good one.<eos> Chicken, cheese, guac.<eos> But they forgot my pico de gallo.<eos> I remember when I was a little boy, my mama used to make this, uh, she used to call it "fo' cheese."
He was found with the murder weapon on him.<eos> - The gun may have been planted on him.<eos> - If you would let ME finish!<eos> He was doing a runner, he tried to cheat justice by killing himself and he was keeping the body in his bloody car!<eos> We don't know if it was he who put it there. Somebody may have set him up.
They'll get here when they can.<eos> Sitrep.<eos> Reeves and Jintao have entered the plane, along with the pilot.<eos> Signal is confirming Reeves has placed the device in the cockpit.<eos> We're remotely scanning to ensure it's prepped for activation.
Please, you've got to help.<eos> - Boo Boo? - Is this about the apartment?<eos> - Damn. - Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.<eos> Whatever the explanation, it's okay.<eos> I don't need to know anything except, like, when did you get it, is it, like, a real, genuine place, or is it, like, a playing it cool thing, like Nick's fake bar shift?
- you would've already done it by now.<eos> - Look, Star. 30,000 likes is no joke.<eos> Okay?<eos> That video is on fire.<eos> Besides, the judges have already seen it.
Baby, this place is amazing.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> What is it for?<eos> I just bought it.
Right?<eos> And?<eos> What did it say?<eos> No-one knows.<eos> Everyone who worked on the translation, and everyone who subsequently read it is now dead.
Sorry, what do you mean, it's his real name?<eos> Nobody knows the Doctor's real name.<eos> I do, because I grew up with him, and his real name is Doctor Who.<eos> Bill, she's just trying to wind you up.<eos> Chose it himself, you know, trying to sound mysterious.
- but not... - Yes, uh, Egyptian Arabic. Eh?<eos> Okay...<eos> Well, my Egyptian Arabic is a little rusty.<eos> No, you'll... you'll be fine. Just whatever you do, don't let the mirror shatter.<eos> I've already enchanted it.
Did the others get robbed?<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> What, uh, what about security cameras?<eos> There must be some kind of footage, right?<eos> Yeah, they had footage, but I'd have to file a police report to see it.
- When did you start selling chocolates?<eos> When I decided I wanted to be known as someone who sells something other than flowers.<eos> - Did you find the place?<eos> - Yeah. Thanks to you.<eos> He ended up buying it, and he's moving here.
- "Go your ways and pour out the vials..." - "Pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."<eos> If you remember anything else, please give us a call.<eos> Um... Henry?<eos> My parents had to take out a double mortgage on this house to get me deprogrammed... and, I lost custody of my daughter.<eos> My life's, like, a complete disaster... but still, I am so glad to have it back.
Well, it looks like we've got a malicious hacker on our hands.<eos> And he's got a wireless foothold to a 2013 Meridian.<eos> Meridians are a popular model.<eos> He's got a huge victim pool.<eos> Well, we're working on narrowing it down.
So he and Brockhart together?<eos> And a few others who were elevated around the same time, yes.<eos> Thank you, Cathy.<eos> That Brockhart spot we talked about. You have it?<eos> Is it verified?
You make strange alliances with unsavory people.<eos> And it all becomes clear way too late.<eos> And no one else truly understands.<eos> Except someone who's been in the office...<eos> You can't expect the office to do anything more than what you bring to it.
Or is it for some personal gain?<eos> Perhaps to try to fill the small hole in your soul that you sold off a long time ago?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> This is my opening statement, and I will give it in full.
- How did this happen?<eos> - How do you think?<eos> Our team is all over it, but Dr. Bull wanted you to know as soon as possible, and if you like, you can see him when he's done meeting with Liberty.<eos> What do you suggest we do?<eos> - I assume she's planning on having it.
- A job that only requires a high school diploma, right?<eos> So you can raise a baby<eos> - that's not even yours?<eos> - That baby will be mine.<eos> I'll raise it like it's my own.
- That's the one. - Yeah? - Uh-huh.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Jimmy, I got to tell you, this place is awesome.<eos> How'd you find it?
The video in question was recorded by an active duty sailor.<eos> It's property of the Navy.<eos> Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-council have the necessary security clearance to watch this video, much less possess it.<eos> We can't put the rain back in the sky.<eos> We didn't have any inkling of its contents before we watched it.
Our case was slipping away.<eos> Whether that's true is debatable.<eos> Either way, you made an end run around my wishes.<eos> If you want my letter of resignation, I have one ready.<eos> Tear it up. I'm not vindictive.
You're up, Blondie.<eos> I hope I see you at the office.<eos> Get it, girl.<eos> Looks like we've got ourselves a murder mystery.<eos> Now we just need to solve it.
You want me to, um... Tell the jury... That my brother murdered the governor?<eos> But he was acting outside the scope of his employment, which proves that the company's not liable.<eos> I just don't know if I can do that.<eos> Here, I prepared your summation for you.<eos> All you have to do is read it.
But he was acting outside the scope of his employment, which proves that the company's not liable.<eos> I just don't know if I can do that.<eos> Here, I prepared your summation for you.<eos> All you have to do is read it.<eos> I'd like to hear it out loud.
Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it.<eos> Not yet, but they will.<eos> Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.
Agent Keen?<eos> Tell Reddington he's on his own.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Smoll's body's just been flagged by the CDC.<eos> They've rerouted it to a level 4 bio-containment lab.
- Is that the end?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't think that's the end.<eos> I think, uh, when you get here, we'll write the end of that, yeah?<eos> We'll work on it together?
We need to talk to him, too.<eos> I don't know for sure, but I bet he was at the same hotel as O.G.<eos> There was only one room registered under O.G.'s name.<eos> Then try looking under Tendu's real name.<eos> I only learned it when we were drawing up the contracts.
In fact, you have about five minutes.<eos> If you hurry, you can make it.<eos> What about my car?<eos> Don't worry, it's in good hands.<eos> I'll keep it warm for you.
What happens at the end of the book?<eos> The Savior fights the Final Battle.<eos> No one wants to be around to see that.<eos> Excuse me, but your tree is blocking the path.<eos> You should move it before somebody gets hurt.
And he's looking for you too.<eos> So where are we with this murder-for-hire case, Sergeant?<eos> Donald Clark, yeah, well, we're just keeping him on the hook for now until we can shed some more light on who actually killed his daughter.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Well, we traced the murder weapon back to the guy who bought it.
Sorry you're missing the fun part with Wyatt and Lucy.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your eye.<eos> - It's red.<eos> - I was rubbing it.
She'd still be alive if Mommy, the control freak, hadn't pushed her into the FBI, but Mommy always won.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Isn't that right, Mommy?<eos> Never play psych games with a shrink, Ms. Brown.<eos> All right, so, she drives my truck out here. She torches it.
Groupies.<eos> They can never get enough.<eos> You orchestrated. Sienna Brown's murder from inside this prison.<eos> Madison Gray came to visit you to get the name of your accomplice.<eos> I'm guessing you gave it to her.
Whose burrito did I just step in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> God.<eos> Guys, this place is getting out of hand.<eos> I love it.
Now... tell me where your heart is.<eos> I... I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where it is.<eos> She has it well-hidden.
And you're not getting this without a fight.<eos> I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> You know, I've done so many dark things in my life, but I've never had a chance to kill a queen.<eos> And I've never killed a fairy.<eos> I know you think you own this town, but I invented it...
Sarah...<eos> I understand why you didn't wanna tell us what was on this video, and I'm so sorry... But you've gotta understand that, from where I'm sitting, this is enough for Bobby to blackmail your father.<eos> If that's what he was doing, I didn't know.<eos> If you didn't know he was filming you, okay, fine.<eos> But the minute that I showed you this video, you knew what it was, and you had to know that Bobby was using it to blackmail your dad.
It also covers your confrontation months ago, and your promise in your hotel suite to let her come home.<eos> I know the law.<eos> You can lie to me all you want.<eos> I knew as soon as I saw the tape, but I just...<eos> I called my dad right after you showed it to me.
A place I needed to go to remind me it's never where I ever want to be.<eos> Clay, you have a gift.<eos> You know how to inspire people, how to keep us moving forward even when we don't want to.<eos> That speech tonight...<eos> We know you wrote it.
The suspect's name was Pablo Gomez.<eos> Naturalized citizen from Mexico.<eos> Worked in a restaurant in Queens.<eos> What about the house?<eos> Renting it under the table.
There must be some kind of explanation.<eos> Where is Isaac?<eos> Where is my son?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Structure of a pig's brain is similar to a human's. So by connecting it to mine, we can flash the device. Make it safe for removal.
We're not riding the bench.<eos> We're raising our son.<eos> What was that?<eos> It's that tree out front.<eos> I really should cut it.
Since I turned 15.<eos> Duh. We melted one of the statue's hands to try to convince Kashgar that he sold us a fake by accident.<eos> See?<eos> Why did you make a video?<eos> 'Cause we want Kashgar to watch it.
'Kay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's not have any surprises, okay?<eos> Look, you guys came here with your guns, looking for shelter.<eos> You got it.
I was gonna give to you boys one day.<eos> I'm sorry that's not gonna happen now.<eos> What're you sayin', Daddy?<eos> Well, didn't your brother tell you?<eos> We're gonna sell this ol' place... just as soon as you fix it back up.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.<eos> You think his heart's down here?<eos> I know my mother.<eos> This is where she'd hide it.
I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.<eos> You think his heart's down here?<eos> I know my mother.<eos> This is where she'd hide it.<eos> - If I find it... - Aah!
So, what's all this?<eos> Diane Fowler's living room.<eos> It was catalogued, crated and stored in evidence.<eos> Seems the bureau spares no expense for their leadership.<eos> We're gonna reconstruct the whole scene. And we're gonna dissect it until we find what we need.
Aggravated sexual assault... last time I checked, that's a Class 1 felony.<eos> Yeah. It's sad news.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> We've got witnesses saying that you were stalking her.<eos> And this picture looks like it was taken from inside her apartment.
Why did he do this?<eos> Krilov was hired to adjust someone's memory.<eos> We confiscated his lab. So he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.
Krilov was hired to adjust someone's memory.<eos> We confiscated his lab. So he stole yours.<eos> But your memory, the night of the fire.<eos> He stole it from me 25 years ago.<eos> That's why we needed you to get it back.
What baby?<eos> This lady was very pregnant.<eos> Baby could've survived that?<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> If the baby was dead, the killer would have left it here.
What did you do, then?<eos> I...<eos> I knew there was a baby inside her.<eos> I thought if I could just kill one more person...<eos> So I cut the baby out of her and killed it.
Practically threw it at my head.<eos> - I'm here if you need me.<eos> - I won't.<eos> So, Mr. Halstead, the results of your cardiac cath show that your heart has been under stress for so long from the mitral valve regurgitation... that it's basically giving up.<eos> This is why I told you to get it checked regularly.
The last image Lazlo saw before he died.<eos> Who could possibly identify that?<eos> Yes, Darius?<eos> Karissa, I'm sending you a photo file.<eos> Have Tess run it through our facial rec software.
Looks like we're famous by association.<eos> That's sick.<eos> Celeb Central.<eos> This picture was taken in the escape room.<eos> Find out who sold it to Celeb Central, and see if there are any more.
[Yorkey] We wanted to begin by telling the truth about what effect these events would have.<eos> We felt like if we could tell a story, not only with integrity, but hopefully one that had a chance to really resonate with young people who don't necessarily get a steady diet of truth in their entertainment,<eos> and hopefully could stand as something that was an honest representation of their experience.<eos> [shrieks, then giggles] [Langford] With the photo that's taken of Hannah, it was innocent, but an unflattering photo out of context, posted by a guy with a particular rep, or saying something, or spinning the story some kind of way can destroy someone.<eos> And when Bryce takes the photo from Justin and sends it round the school, it's the beginning of the end for her.
Why don't you like birthdays?<eos> Ahh, my mother always made a point of forgetting them.<eos> As if she didn't want me to feel special, on any day.<eos> When I was nine, she let me have my first birthday party and, um...<eos> I spent weeks planning it.
As if she didn't want me to feel special, on any day.<eos> When I was nine, she let me have my first birthday party and, um...<eos> I spent weeks planning it.<eos> Sent out the invites.<eos> And she cancelled it, the day before, without telling me.
We stuffed up but it won't happen again. I guarantee it.<eos> You're right, it won't happen again. You're out.<eos> - What?<eos> - Aren't you forgetting that I saved this entire project?<eos> I could just as easily unsave it.
I'm important in here, Franky.<eos> You can't take that away from me.<eos> I will lag.<eos> I need to prove to those dickheads that I'm innocent.<eos> Now I had a taste of my life and I wanna go live it.
Perhaps I don't mean more time, but another time.<eos> I have been particularly tense.<eos> I have had a few people over for quick interviews, and I was anxious for them to go away as soon as possible.<eos> Our meeting will not be a quick interview.<eos> I think I would rather postpone it, knowing what it means.
- Hey, Jordan... Hey, Kenny, did you take my carving wood?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> No, it was right here.<eos> The... the wood's valuable to me.<eos> It's not easy to find.
God bless America.<eos> - CT results came back clean.<eos> The eagle wing is clear of the spine, but not by much.<eos> - Great.<eos> Let's get it out.
We need to be as cautious as possible here.<eos> I can't miss this debate.<eos> I don't show up, I lose my lead in the polls, all right?<eos> - There's gotta be another way.<eos> - Actually, there is. I steal local anesthesia here, take it right out in the E.R.
- Oh, my head.<eos> I-It's pounding.<eos> - He's leaking spinal fluid.<eos> His wing was adhered to the dura.<eos> It tore when you pulled it out.
Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About the fact that I'm pissed off.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she handed it off.
Actually, I do mind.<eos> Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm speaking to you.<eos> It doesn't matter what year you are.<eos> I'm head of the associates.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
I've watched you, yeah. - Oh, you are Cam?<eos> - Hey, I got a question for you.<eos> - Yes, sir. Is your last name really...<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You changed it.
- Hey, I got a question for you.<eos> - Yes, sir. Is your last name really...<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Oh, I did change it, but I took the legal procedures.
- Yes, sir. Is your last name really...<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Oh, I did change it, but I took the legal procedures.<eos> It's on my passport, credit card, my license.
And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Your life, Belmont.<eos> Take it and go.
You know we have to put down this rebellion.<eos> It's good wine.<eos> It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.
It's good wine.<eos> It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it with you.
- Just get the hell out of here.<eos> - Not until I get your permission.<eos> - Fine, you got it.<eos> Give me my breakfast.<eos> - I'd like it in writing.
I need to boil some water, to make a tea.<eos> I'll fetch you a bucket.<eos> I can fetch it.<eos> No, you stay here.<eos> I'll fetch it for you.
With guns, ammo, and artillery.<eos> What's that got to do with my farm?<eos> It has everything to do with your farm, Ward.<eos> How?<eos> 'Cause they are the folks that burned it.
Shit!<eos> Brother help me.<eos> Before she kills me.<eos> Where's your heart?<eos> I will take it back.
Oh, shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, god damn it.<eos> Lisa, if you're watching this footage,<eos> I think you're gonna wanna delete it.
I promise, I'm not sure of myself.<eos> When they ask paper or plastic, I'm even like, "Whatever's easiest for you," you know?<eos> - Yeah, your modesty doesn't fool me.<eos> I'll give you a choice.<eos> You can use your unique position for evil by killing the president, starting a war, and bringing this country to its knees... or you use it for good.
Remember, we talked about this.<eos> Can't we just take it slow?<eos> When I met you guys two years ago, it was the best orgy of my life.<eos> Let's get back to that feeling.<eos> It's there.
Even when you win, we end up in the hospital.<eos> Who's "we"?<eos> I ain't never seen you there.<eos> Huh? Lou, for fuck's sake, say something!<eos> You got heart, kid, but you wear it on your fucking chin.
Come on.<eos> Vinny? Vinny, I got to get the Christmas box.<eos> Kev, get that box right there.<eos> Yeah, Ma!<eos> Kev's bringing it up to you.
Forgive me. It's just that... When we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid.<eos> Perhaps I'm just in a sentimental mood.<eos> My landlady was killed yesterday.<eos> I could hear her husband crying through the wall all night long.<eos> It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it.
Hans will be here for anything you need.<eos> If you want to contact me, call me and hang up after 3 rings.<eos> We're good.<eos> What's wrong with your apartment, Pinaud?<eos> It's being remodeled.
One hundred percent, Ed./ Understood.<eos> Wilson, beat it.<eos> The hell is that?<eos> / Cobra wine.<eos> Spotted it in a small village in Vietnam last month, thought of you.
Why?<eos> For money?<eos> For the glory of Panama?<eos> To hell with this nation of hypocrites.<eos> If life is such shit, why don't we stop it like you stopped the fight?
Our clients are going to want to see a serious plan to turn lab results in a volatile region into an investment we can all stake our reputations on.<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> No, it's not a problem, per se, but the fact remains that neither of you have taken a find of this magnitude through production.<eos> Wait just a minute there, Brian.<eos> We-we found it, we can dig it up.
I want to go home, fix my hair, put on a beautiful face of makeup and the best dress I own...<eos> Then take it all off and go to sleep.<eos> Fun.<eos> Hey, Nick, I sent you a friend request a while ago.<eos> Maybe you just skipped over it or sometimes there's a glitch and Facebook doesn't send the e-mail, so I just thought that I'd...
Darian, we don't...<eos> You're right about everything.<eos> I don't give a shit about you.<eos> I'm only here for me, and my life is fucking incredible.<eos> I love it.
Okay. Look at me.<eos> I can't feel my legs.<eos> Paralysis is temporal.<eos> What's the bad news?<eos> It caused a neurological split but we got you through it.
You're here?<eos> I told you, I come here often to record folk singers<eos> Yeah, that's right<eos> My recorder conked off.<eos> I had to send it to Delhi to get it fixed
I told you, I come here often to record folk singers<eos> Yeah, that's right<eos> My recorder conked off.<eos> I had to send it to Delhi to get it fixed<eos> So I just came to collect it
Tell me about it.<eos> My gosh! You'd think in a neighborhood like this you wouldn't have to worry about something like that.<eos> I'm so sorry about that, Tim.<eos> Yeah, well, Jeff, here's the thing about trust.<eos> Once it's gone, bad things happen.
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?<eos> - I just farted.<eos> - Buddy! You can't jump through the window like that.<eos> That's triple pane glass!<eos> You gotta break it first.
The insights from the Book of Daniel and Revelation that we discuss today are the fruits of many years of my own study.<eos> And, yet, I think it is important for you to know that I am not alone in my convictions.<eos> Many others across this country now believe in these very truths.<eos> Our message is the same, for it is plain in the pages of God's Word, for all to read.<eos> And it is delivered with urgency because, my dear friends, the time till Christ's return is very short.
Edson, why don't you eat?<eos> Because he's full of all the food he shouldn't be eating.<eos> Now, Willie, stop trying to get your brother in trouble.<eos> Our focus should not be on a list of bad foods.<eos> It is more important that you understand your body is the temple of God, and you must treat it accordingly.
Don't have to have my name.<eos> I done died and went to Heaven.<eos> But he got your name, though.<eos> One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, and he was marking it up for the Judgement, and he let me see your name.<eos> He got it in there under "M."
But it's not my life.<eos> It's not even close.<eos> You never saw me before.<eos> I loved my life.<eos> I really loved it.
Okay, look, dude, we are going to Hawaii.<eos> Let's go on vacation.<eos> But it's not a vacation. Lt's a wedding.<eos> Do you really think a wedding's the best place for me?<eos> Since the last wedding I went to was mine... And it didn't turn out very well.
Flight 329 from Tokyo, you have clearance for runway. 2<eos> Willkommen in Salt Lake City.<eos> If we serve the food so hot, we get in trouble.<eos> - Do not spit into the food.<eos> - I blow so it cools.
Therefore I have a choice: to kill myself, or kill others.<eos> My decision is as follows:<eos> I will get revenge on my haters.<eos> You wouldn't pay the price if I became an anonymous suicide.<eos> And because society is too sovereign to condemn itself, it is often tried privately, sometimes punished, other times just shocked.
Let me hear the law.<eos> "This is the law of the jungle...<eos> "As old and as true as the sky.<eos> "The wolf that keeps it will prosper...<eos> "But the wolf that breaks it will die.
Probably in kindergarten.<eos> I was a bit obsessed.<eos> Dante defined our modern conception of hell.<eos> Our vision of it hasn't changed since he defined it 700 years ago.<eos> Botticelli drew it but Dante created hell as we know it.
If my headspace is right, then the performance is better.<eos> Clever.<eos> Hotel.<eos> Oh, life on the road.<eos> Love it.
It was a warning, Not an invitation.<eos> Thank you for looking after me. I'm in your debt, Mr...<eos> Let me be clear, boy.<eos> This place is isolated, remote.<eos> I like it that way.
You know he did.<eos> They'd have sent food by now if he had told them.<eos> He's an officer.<eos> Yeah, if we'd forgot, could you fathom the beating?<eos> I was saving it for supper, but...
Places he hangs out.<eos> Any place there's dope is where.<eos> You have a photo?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can burn it for all I care.
That can cure almost any ailment.<eos> Really? Anything?<eos> Anything that can be cured if mixed by the right apothecary.<eos> The apothecary wanted the yew tree very badly.<eos> But in order to harvest these things, he would have to cut it down.
Well, this drug is made from trees like that.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Seriously?<eos> All this time we could have gone out there and just chopped it down.
I just...<eos> No, no, don't go!<eos> Has anyone seen my glass eye?<eos> It's right here, Miss Crawly.<eos> I've got it.
- Thank you.<eos> - And you're going to have to hurry.<eos> We have orders to shoot on sight.<eos> Mr. Muller I brought breakfast.<eos> I could smell it before opening the door. Thank you.
I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.<eos> You are not my hero.<eos> And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!<eos> I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!
We'll always have Kabul.<eos> No, we won't.<eos> We won't "always have" it because I have to go home.<eos> No, this is home.<eos> I have to go to New York City and justify my life to somebody named Jerry before he takes it all away, and I
- Not even vaguely.<eos> -It does!<eos> - Tastes like rubber.<eos> - No, it doesn't!<eos> It's nice, but what I think is that if you're gonna eat tofu why pretend it's turkey, or burgers or whatever?
Some place else.<eos> It's all starting to run together.<eos> Hey, you got to listen to me, Mike.<eos> There's this threat.<eos> Have you seen it?
It's all starting to run together.<eos> Hey, you got to listen to me, Mike.<eos> There's this threat.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> Seems like I'm the only one that wants to stop it.
- You have to go immediately.<eos> I own this apartment!<eos> Your mother invited me to stay and I decide...<eos> - What's going on? - Not now!<eos> It's up for sale. That's why I'm here.
Ashley, I really don't wanna see you fail.<eos> Who said I'm gonna fail?<eos> Haven't you heard of positive reinforcement?<eos> Yeah, I've heard of it.<eos> Then why don't you try it sometime?
- Do it.<eos> Lyra!<eos> No!<eos> They have a child.<eos> Find it!
Snowden? What the hell are you doing?<eos> Nothing, sir!<eos> Where is your fucking heart?<eos> Right here, sir!<eos> I want you to reach way down in that pathetic excuse of a chest, and you rip it out. You find your heart, and then you get your broke ass on my tower! You got that?
Okay!<eos> 9-1-1 says she needs to breath!<eos> Way past that!<eos> Focus on that baby.<eos> It is about to be born whether you like it or not, so just use everything that your father taught you in little league and catch it like a fly ball!

No bed, lung ventilation equipment stolen, X-rays and clinical record also disappeared.<eos> As if there hadn't been such patient in our facility.<eos> I've read this in the report, you tell me something I don't know.<eos> When we were X-raying her spinal cord, we found an external object in her stomach.<eos> We conducted a gastroscopy and extracted it from there.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm asking.<eos> Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.<eos> I did it. That's as far as it goes.
- I have two words, perfect love and perfect trust.<eos> - Assist me to erect the ancient altar at which in days past all worshiped.<eos> From the old times, a woman was the altar.<eos> And the sacred place was the point within the center of the circle, the origin of all things.<eos> Therefore, should we adore it.
Anyone can sit down there.<eos> We saved this city.<eos> We should be on the Jumbotron, not in it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, one year ago, a shadow fell over our city.<eos> Suddenly, it was under siege by the notorious villain, Shredder.
I opened it. There were letters in there from your father.<eos> Mostly academic stuff, but... there was this one letter.<eos> The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and my father, and the way he phrased it made me feel like it was something big, maybe something terrible.<eos> Definitely something he didn't want to spell out on paper.<eos> It scared me for some reason. I put the letter back in the box, locked it, and never looked at it again.
And I bring the coffee. Just a moment.<eos> So please sit down, here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We take this tool.<eos> And you put it in hot wax.
Thank you.<eos> Orthodox Easter is when?<eos> Next week, but we come together before, usually.<eos> I will put it in the color bath.<eos> You have to keep it three to five minutes.
Semper paratus, always ready.<eos> Didn't work out.<eos> Somethin' about me not keepin' my foot locker locked.<eos> So you know this place?<eos> Yeah, it was shut down since I was maybe 25.
For the good of this place, I was the one who said you could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you stand behind me in that moment?<eos> Because you and I had been through enough shit for you to know that I would do the same for you, that I have done the same for you, and would again without hesitation.<eos> I made a commitment to you, with you, to restore this place, to make it strong again.
- You found out?<eos> The Good Masters of Astapor and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.<eos> With help from their friends in Volantis.<eos> You see?<eos> You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
It's difficult when you're away.<eos> Yes, I'm very sorry, Kitty.<eos> Tell me this.<eos> - How did Richard Crooks get the record?<eos> - She gave it to him.
Yes, I'm very sorry, Kitty.<eos> Tell me this.<eos> - How did Richard Crooks get the record?<eos> - She gave it to him.<eos> He's been playing it all weekend.
Then you'll take a hot bath to help you relax -- the heat intensifies the effects of the castor oil...<eos> He's not on his own, is he?<eos> Dr Turner's with him.<eos> Johnny is waiting for this baby.<eos> And I promise you, he will see it.
"When you pass through the flames, you will not burn."<eos> "You are precious in my eyes".<eos> This baby is still breathing!<eos> We couldn't have saved it.<eos> But to leave it alone?
That's not true.<eos> And I'm not going to speak to the police.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There is a time for us to mortify our flesh.<eos> And a time to cherish it, and marvel at its strength.
Save your courting... Till we've got you safely in that ambulance.<eos> Baby's turning, Daisy, it knows just what to do.<eos> Like you do.<eos> That's perfect!<eos> Can I hold it? Can I?
Talking the shit.<eos> Kick your ass, old man.<eos> Shit, I ain't no kid no more.<eos> You don't tell me a goddamn thing!<eos> I took the book of matches from Jelly's... because I knew he'd be embarrassed... if he saw that I'd found it.
Thanks for covering for me, Deb.<eos> Bloody Gracie bit me.<eos> Your patrons'll start biting you soon as well.<eos> You only took this place off me 30 days ago.<eos> Already you've turned it into a Slim Dusty song.
Go and save a seal.<eos> Thank you for the food.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> I'll let Fergus know.<eos> He made it especially for you.
Now's probably not the time to be adding something' to my plate.<eos> I'm just trying to lift her spirit.<eos> And I'm not?<eos> We need a solution, Kevin. We need it now.<eos> Yeah. And we'll get it.
Somebody made her think there was.<eos> - Can I touch that right now?<eos> - Sure. Uh, this isn't official.<eos> Must've got it at a party shop.<eos> I'll bet he picked this location because there wouldn't be any looky-loos to give it away as a fake crime scene.
Wait. Wait. Wait.<eos> That... that's O.J.'s garment bag that he gave to me to take to my house before he came to stay with me.<eos> Wait, wait. For the sake of both of us, please don't continue to tell me any more.<eos> No, wait a minute.<eos> No... If you do have possession of the weapon, and you decided to suddenly turn it in, I don't know.
That is the way of the world. I'm not here to change the way of the world.<eos> Slavery is the way of our world.<eos> You don't need slaves to make money.<eos> There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you.<eos> But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it.
My lord.<eos> My lord.<eos> My friends, the hour has come.<eos> Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children.<eos> But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came.
Come, Kubo.<eos> Come to your aunties.<eos> No reason to be afraid, Kubo.<eos> We just need your other eye.<eos> Your grandfather admires it so.
Similarly, there is a pleasure boat With three crew.<eos> The rough seas with waves over six meters have prevented Civil Protection from being able to help.<eos> As dawn comes and sea conditions improve...<eos> I am the judge Vicente Louro.<eos> In order to move the body, you need to identify it.
- No, the wallpaper is cool.<eos> If we get tired of it, we can paint it.<eos> We are also very close by.<eos> Bea and you found an apartment near where she lived.<eos> I rented it for you.
I refrained from you for years, But I made a mistake, lying about the hope of finding you knowing about you.<eos> That absurd hope has devoured the weak base On which I had built my new life.<eos> Now I have nothing left.<eos> Only you exist.<eos> Your absence fills my life completely and destroys it.
Some misbehaving humans been making hamburgers out of my sons and daughters.<eos> But we are not cows.<eos> We don't stand in our shit.<eos> The reason we don't... Is because I won't let that happen.<eos> I got each and every toilet in comfort taking that shit from all your little asses and sending it down the pipes till it reaches a place where no one thinks about it and no one smells it.
Say your name so you know this ain't Africa.<eos> This is Virginia, and you're the property of John Waller, like the horses and hogs, nothing more!<eos> Now, say your name so you know what you are.<eos> Kunta Kinte.<eos> Say it. Say it.
Say it! Say it!<eos> Say your name!<eos> Say it!<eos> Say Toby!<eos> Tell me your name! Say it, damn you!
You ain't alone, son.<eos> You got lots of people here who care about you.<eos> It don't matter what the Massa call you.<eos> You keep your true name inside.<eos> I'm gonna keep it there, too.
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.<eos> I believe you've restarted the program, and I would like to know...<eos> Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This whole city has turned its back on you, despite you risking your life to save it over and over again.
- Oh, no, this is way worse than the mail thing. - What mail thing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> There's no mail thing. There's no mail thing.<eos> But it's my sperm.<eos> How did you even find out I wanted it?
Now he's suing me.<eos> What I want is for you to use your badge and your gun to intimidate him into dropping the case. - Wow.<eos> That is so very illegal. He's not doing that.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> You have 48 hours to do so, or I'm gonna take your sperm, and I'm gonna dump it into the East River.
He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing it.<eos> Because he's a genius.<eos> He's writing the word "case" over and over again.<eos> Oh, now he's spelling it with a K.<eos> Is that not how you spell it?
I thought you'd be most exciting about the gas range.<eos> They have a gas range.<eos> I have to apply for this apartment.<eos> I mean, it just became available.<eos> We're the only two people to see it.
I'm applying too. What?<eos> You don't need closet space.<eos> You have, like, one outfit.<eos> - Just let me have this. - No.<eos> We saw it at the same time.
He's right.<eos> The safest place for this isn't behind walls or guarded with guns.<eos> The safest place lives outside the realm of anyone's awareness.<eos> If the English can't find it, they can't take it.<eos> I told them we were taking it, just not where.
Now you catch your breath too.<eos> Don't believe what your eyes see.<eos> Listen to your heart, Noor.<eos> But now it isn't yours anymore.<eos> You have given it away.
What is this?<eos> My apple!<eos> Where is my apple?<eos> Where is my apple?<eos> I want it now! Now!
I am so sorry that I'm late.<eos> There's a car parked in the principal's space.<eos> Dr. Brown was principal of several very high achieving schools in Philadelphia.<eos> Oh, look at you being so nice.<eos> And who's this sitting in my chair, keeping it warm for me like a gentleman?
We're gonna miss the Hamptons.<eos> Hey, why don't I take you guys out for a send-off lunch?<eos> Maybe if I'm the last impression you have of the Hamptons, you'll, I don't know, miss it less?<eos> I'll take that as a maybe.<eos> Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna need to see a permit, you need to get it out now.
And Congressman Hill was on that committee.<eos> He chaired that committee.<eos> So Wythe and his goons could be taking out anyone looking into this arms scandal.<eos> What happened to the inquiry?<eos> Well, it went away after Congressman Hill had to retire due to his injuries.
Well, that's a sad thought.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> Banking law... needs to be exciting.<eos> It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.<eos> Really wake it up.
You cannot truly believe that is possible.<eos> Youknowas wellasI do that so long as that gold is sitting in the belly of that fort, we are doubly exposed.<eos> Losing the fort guarantees the loss of the gold.<eos> Excuse me. What are you suggesting?<eos> That we exchange it.
Whitehall, my equity investors, my creditors, the lapse of a deadline or two might be bargained away.<eos> But there is one particular party whose Patience I do not wish to test, a party whose history with the pirates of Nassau suggests an extreme reaction would likely follow.<eos> Spain.<eos> What did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would seize fort Nassau, secure the remains of the Urca de Lima's gold stored within it, and return it to Havana.
She is everything here.<eos> Priestess, governess, warlord.<eos> She's not to be underestimated.<eos> Spain. What did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would secure the remains of the Urca De Lima's gold and return it to Havana.
- Who gives a shit?<eos> - I do.<eos> A little bit. I do.<eos> With everything I've lost in recent days, I can't afford to lose the name, too.<eos> Not when it is so easy to keep.
Someone could have been killed.<eos> Then you showed him incorrectly.<eos> It's a fucking lashing.<eos> I know how to tie it.<eos> If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
We should be under way within the hour.<eos> Put it in my office, please.<eos> I just left Miss Hudson.<eos> I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.<eos> I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
And without you, there would be no me.<eos> Clever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So that's what this is. We're all reasonable men, we all want the same thing.<eos> You offer me a pardon, I accept it, this all ends?
"I, Charles Vane, do hereby plead guilty to the charges of treason and high seas piracy.<eos> I understand that the sentence for my crimes is to be hanged by the neck until dead.<eos> It is my hope that in exchange for this plea I might be spared the humiliation of a public trial, and that my execution be carried out... privately and mercifully."<eos> At noon tomorrow, you'll be transported under guard to the bay, where you'll be boarded onto the Shark and sent to London to face a Court of the Admiralty.<eos> Agree to this plea, and the governor will endorse it.
I am your friend, and I will help you weather whatever challenges may lie down whatever road you may choose, but as your friend, I am simply asking you to consider how treacherous this road may be-<eos> while there is still time to avoid it.<eos> No one is taking this decisión lightly, I assure you.<eos> This is no attempt to circumvent the law.<eos> Indeed, the governor felt that it was necessary in order to protect it.
You've been through something, but it's going to be okay, I promise.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> My son's house and... A bridge.<eos> There used to be a mirror right here.<eos> Why did you take it down?
You have a daughter, don't you?<eos> Look, the crew's gonna be hitting the street.<eos> I can't.<eos> Cristina's car got hit.<eos> Her friend borrowed it and smashed in the front end.
I need to talk to you.<eos> Saddle up, tenderfoot.<eos> We're going for a drive.<eos> Come on, just help me find the permission slip.<eos> You sure she signed it?
Oh, she's dead.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe...<eos> This recording wasn't in the trial transcripts.<eos> We had to dig it out of the original case file.
Detective Santos is our only asset?<eos> Correct.<eos> And only one person gets immunity.<eos> Could've sworn I gave you a desk.<eos> Traded it in for some peace and quiet.
What is her name?<eos> Veronica.<eos> - No it's not!<eos> - It is. - Stop it.<eos> - She pronounces it differently.
You can tell him... that I am no longer involved in that line of work.<eos> He's not with Markridge.<eos> I know who he's with.<eos> I was a poison in that place.<eos> Reshaping life so you can destroy it?
You and Frank all settled in?<eos> So much to do.<eos> So many rooms!<eos> And the furniture from the old flat looks tiny in there.<eos> So, when do we get to see it, then?
I'm Hrothgar.<eos> Thane of Heorot.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Beowulf.<eos> The people will remember it.
Delay their arrival.<eos> Slean, ride west to meet Scorann.<eos> You and I, brother, will ride north to meet the others.<eos> You swore you'd avenge Bayen's killer.<eos> Can you find this thing and kill it?
You are telling us that the most reviled of all our enemies is running loose in Herot?<eos> As soon as it was discovered, I had it hunted down and killed.<eos> I favour peace... but if we have enemies, they will be struck down without mercy.<eos> Show us the body.<eos> Bring it.
- You'd open the box and look inside.<eos> Before that, when the box is closed, is the cat alive or dead?<eos> - Am I allowed to listen? - No.<eos> Or shake the box, or weigh it?<eos> Or drill a hole in it?
And I was like, "Oh my God!<eos> I love that word!<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Ayan said it means... "Vibe"!<eos> So me and the girls use it all the time...
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
But I will not be accepting the job permanently, no matter who wins the election.<eos> You're just gonna walk away?<eos> That's what interim means.<eos> And the Waits video?<eos> They have it.
Hi, Shoshanna. I wanted to call ya...<eos> Oh, my God, that is so nice to hear.<eos> Seriously, I'm loving it here.<eos> Like, this corporate environment is the dream I'm living for every day of my young life.<eos> I love it so much.
I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.<eos> It'll give you the answers that you need.<eos> -But tonight... -Oh, God. ...I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.<eos> Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.<eos> It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
That means that if... if Will and Barbara...<eos> My mom said she talked to Will.<eos> If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.<eos> That means that she's trapped... in that place.<eos> We have to find it again.
We'll see you there.<eos> - Outstanding.<eos> Watch your ass, Marine.<eos> Aye-aye, sir.<eos> If someone finds this footage, please YouTube it.
I got the perfect kid for you.<eos> And one other thing.<eos> Now, I know this may not be our most pressing concern, but graffiti.<eos> The plebeians, the average Joes, they hate it.<eos> And they love it when I rail against it.
Bobby. - That's not necessary.<eos> I'm... so sorry.<eos> Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm saving this seat.<eos> Can my ass save it for you?
What are they calling it?<eos> The Empiriconda... accurate.<eos> Every time Lauren gets the Empiriconda off one website, it pops up on another.<eos> Whoa, I don't understand how he walks, let alone runs runs the bases, or, quite frankly, why he even needs a bat, damn.<eos> Remember the good old days when you could take an embarrassing photo without fear that it would be posted on a worldwide platform for millions of eyes to see where it could feasibly exist until the end of days?
The last page of the entire series is actually written in Kronish, except for the final sentence.<eos> Really?<eos> You wouldn't care to elaborate, would you?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> No one can know the ending, unless, of course, you would like to hear it, Princess?
They are super dumb.<eos> Babies have a higher level of intelligence than we will ever understand.<eos> You sound like a baby that learned how to talk.<eos> I am a baby that learned how to talk!<eos> Hey, I want to teach it to walk around in circles.
What...<eos> Come on. You're overreacting, okay?<eos> Look, I'm-I'm sorry if you didn't understand<eos> - what I was saying.<eos> - I understood. My life is being pulled in a ton of different directions, and I need to make it easier.
I'm kidding, that's a joke.<eos> I got it.<eos> You know what's good for a hangover?<eos> - Hmm? - Rally's breakfast food.<eos> And I'm finally awake early enough to eat it.
There's a riot in Saint-Antoine.<eos> Ah, to success, My Lord.<eos> Why did he murder my grain keeper?<eos> We have made your grain disappear.<eos> It is too late for us to put it back now.
Go back to the gutter, Sylvie. We trusted you!<eos> - Sylvie... - Leon!<eos> I will make sure that justice is done.<eos> Do you really expect me to believe that? After everything that's happened to my friends? My own father?<eos> Take this burden upon yourself and it will never lift.
Nowadays, no one is tough enough for a job like this.<eos> Those scholar types just don't get it, Always hiding behind all the fucking rules.<eos> You see that tree?<eos> Know what tree that is?<eos> White people call it a "ceme-tree."
- Toph, we got to pull that glass.<eos> - Oh, is that all?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Surgery in a flying earthquake.<eos> Okay, look... if you pull the glass, I'll find the bleeder and clamp it off.
I'm gonna get a job, figure it out.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll find a space.<eos> I'll mount it myself.
I think we can all agree to that, but what about Fermi's Paradox, Rose?<eos> They exist, so where are they?<eos> I think non-human intelligence is already here, Max.<eos> Most people are just too oblivious to see it.<eos> Some think we haven't met any intelligent life because it's all been destroyed by a technological singularity.
I can't.<eos> - I feel like the pain is just too big. - Hey.<eos> Hey, you know why we, uh... why we like to be hugged?<eos> The way I see it, it sets a limit on the pain.<eos> You know? Puts a perimeter around it.
- Look at this.<eos> - $50,000?<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm gonna make her delete the picture. Nancy.<eos> - She could put it online.
Cap Rock where the desert meets the sky.<eos> It's like you're born into a new world.<eos> Some peyote, a few buttons, that ball comes up, mild silver and furious gold.<eos> It's delicious, man.<eos> You could find it again.
You know I did. I'm almost finished with it.<eos> It's funny 'cause I didn't know anything about Frantz Fanon before that.<eos> Oh, well, you should; everybody should.<eos> Well, there was something that he wrote that, uh, I was really moved by.<eos> Um, "Each generation must discover its mission, "fulfill it, or betray it."
Sure, let it slide.<eos> That's just some dog shit.<eos> But those are three devious little words.<eos> You know, if... if I let your dog shit slide, then I have to be okay then I have to be okay with this whole plaza filling up with it, which it would before we know it.<eos> Oh, then it would be on our pant legs and our shoes, and we would track it into our homes, and then our homes would smell like shit, too.
Yeah, thanks.<eos> So you wanna just watch TV and eat ice cream?<eos> Yeah, perfect.<eos> There's butter pecan.<eos> I'm gonna go down in a minute and get it soft.
Everything's changing.<eos> Green to red.<eos> It starts here.<eos> This place...<eos> I've seen it.
This case is much larger than we initially thought.<eos> Chief Sousa. New York wanted you to get this A.S.A.P.<eos> Thompson got us the Isodyne search warrant.<eos> Want to kick that nest again?<eos> Let's stomp it to the ground.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?<eos> No, your clumsy wife managed to knock it off the wall and break the glass.
I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?<eos> No, your clumsy wife managed to knock it off the wall and break the glass.<eos> I'll fix it.
- No, you're in a car.<eos> And it's a smoke-free zone anyway.<eos> I'm in the middle of something, okay?<eos> Can you just give me a minute?<eos> If you don't move your car, I'm going to have it towed.
I know I shouldn't be here.<eos> ♪ If I could ♪<eos> ♪ I'm inside out, shot through the center ♪<eos> ♪ Feel the scar of where you entered ♪<eos> ♪ Took my life and turned it upside down ♪
What the hell's going on, Barb?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you.<eos> And I want it back!
And I want it back!<eos> And so should you!<eos> But I don't, Barb.<eos> Don't you get it? I don't want it back.<eos> You want it back?
And so should you!<eos> But I don't, Barb.<eos> Don't you get it? I don't want it back.<eos> You want it back?<eos> You get it back and keep my goddamn share!
I don't know how much longer he can keep it together.<eos> We better do this now.<eos> I've seen my share of schemes, mr. Hawkes. This one is unique.<eos> John:<eos> Well, I see no reason why the law can't aide us while we break it.
Well, I'll be fast, too.<eos> I only wanted to notify you as a courtesy that I am running my Baird Whitlock story.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's the story?<eos> The story. I have a credible source and I am going to run it, and I think you know what story I mean.
Technically, she'd have to give up the baby to a third party.<eos> Joe Silverman.<eos> Joe Silverman. Exactly.<eos> He's the foster father for a few days.<eos> She hands the kid to Joe, he hands it back.
- No.<eos> I never walk away from a fight.<eos> This is not how you change things, Christophe.<eos> You both know, the enemy never gives you victory.<eos> You have to take it from them.
Boonkie is the best nanny.<eos> She gets her to her tutor, gymnastics, karate.<eos> Karate?<eos> Yeah, karate.<eos> She loves it.
I had to literally sneak away.<eos> What happened?<eos> Even John makes better tea than this. - Yes.. but"<eos> Something must be wrong with the milk.<eos> Who brought it?
I wish I could invent a machine that would just erase her memory from my brain.<eos> You know, some people say that the sativa is a memory-erasing machine, Frankie. I know that's funny, Gar.<eos> I'm just not in a laughing mood right now.<eos> Hey, free beer to anyone who helps us bring the rest of the stuff in.<eos> Why the hell should we work for free beer when these hipster jackwipes are buying it for us just for treating 'em like shit?
Look, I'd make a killing compared to what you've paid me, but you and I talked about making a real mark.<eos> My father really liked Francis.<eos> But as my daddy, he said to me, the day before we got married,<eos> "You have one life, Claire.<eos> Are you sure this is the man you wanna spend it with?"
- And who are you, now?<eos> Daisy Johnson, ATCU.<eos> Um, Edwin, right?<eos> How did you know my name, Edwin, when you called 911?<eos> Because I heard you say it just now.
Wrestling made me.<eos> And broke me.<eos> Listen.<eos> A wrestler's true worth is not in the ring, but in the game of life.<eos> When it pulls you down... you rise again... against all odds and face life and win it back.
Think big.<eos> Who has heard of that pressure cooker beyond Lajpat Nagar?<eos> Just think.<eos> Your logo on Sultan's jersey.<eos> The world will see it.
Hey. Your body is not a commodity.<eos> You tell you what you do with you.<eos> Chet, first of all, my body is a commodity, okay?<eos> It's my living.<eos> Funny thing I plan on protecting it.
It's Goggins, all right.<eos> He's had a tiger here.<eos> It's hardly big enough to house a dog in.<eos> Poor creature must have been driven half mad.<eos> He's come out to feed it and forgotten to latch the door properly.
If Jay ran, would you hunt him down?<eos> No.<eos> What we do ain't personal.<eos> It's the law.<eos> And these runaways are breaking it.
Yes.<eos> And we shall smite the Heavenly Father from his bloody throne.<eos> I've long dreamt of this moment, to stand at your side, close enough to touch, to smell, to feel.<eos> Give me your name.<eos> You can read it on my tomb.
We went through this already.<eos> Abbie doesn't want to talk to him.<eos> Oh, Jen, I mean, you can't use Abbie as an excuse not to have a relationship with your father.<eos> This is your life.<eos> You got to live it for yourself.
Randall... what you're doing... it's not you.<eos> My days in the minor league are over.<eos> Nevins' operation is mine.<eos> Anyone who tries to mess with that is gonna feel my wrath.<eos> Listen, Randall, you want Nevins' empire, just take it, okay?
Good news is I know where Julian's keeping Stefan's body, so you can sit back, relax, and not have to worry about that locator spell.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, right. Spoiler alert.<eos> When you were working on me, Julian stole Stefan's body.<eos> I'm gonna go get it back.
If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with...<eos> You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?
As leader, how would you navigate that threat?<eos> You don't go to war without wise guidance.<eos> Victory depends on having many advisors.<eos> And by the look in your eyes, it looks like you have some advice to give.<eos> So... spill it.
- I was, but it wasn't her.<eos> - Well, then who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.<eos> Whoever this was, they wanna cover it up.
Whoever this was, they wanna cover it up.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because they may have found the weapon.<eos> What?<eos> They were willing to kill me to get it back.
Gather your things and leave here.<eos> Go in there and tell my mother the truth.<eos> If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.<eos> They may have found the weapon.<eos> And they were willing to kill me to get it back.
And they were willing to kill me to get it back.<eos> Did Sara Harvey come after you?<eos> It wasn't her.<eos> Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.<eos> Whoever this was... They wanna cover it up.
Is anybody in there?<eos> Hello?<eos> It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.<eos> Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.<eos> And whoever this was... they want to cover it up.
Hey.<eos> Just wanted to check in, see how you were doing.<eos> Well, I think the answer to that question is fairly self-evident.<eos> Thea's bloodlust is the balancing of an equation.<eos> She was given life and now she needs to take it.
I've been thinkin' a lot about last names lately.<eos> Why?<eos> You know, on the plantation, I feel like I saw that Macon name everywhere.<eos> On work orders. That iron gate at the bridge.<eos> Heard it everywhere, too.
Come on in.<eos> My son is becoming familiar with the day-to-day operations of the plantation, so anything that you have to say, you can say right in front of him.<eos> That desk is... that desk looking mighty fine in here.<eos> It sure does.<eos> It's a beauty. I remember when you made it, Sam.
I think we just have to trust our elected officials... and Goldman's Pharmacy is fully stocked on cough syrup, which goes great with ginger ale.<eos> Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I'm actually thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.<eos> Oh, my God, he's just been drunk this whole time?<eos> This new law sucks.<eos> And I got to say, it was kind of uncool of Mayor West to call it "Peter's Law."
Yeah, but what difference does it make?<eos> It's the law.<eos> Nothing we can do about it.<eos> The hell there's not.<eos> I bet if we worked together we could find a way to change it back.
Don't insult me.<eos> I may be close to the grave, but I'm still a woman.<eos> I can see love for a man in the face of another of my gender.<eos> I see him across the way, I hear him talk... My heart beats like I think everyone on the mountain can hear.<eos> I wanna tear it out of my chest for making me a fool.
I only wanted to bring you a bit of joy.<eos> In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope.<eos> Do you know why I stand guard, why I remain hidden in this place, while the others live in the light?<eos> Once, and only once, did all the gods work as one.<eos> We took all the evil in this world, and we hid it away in this box, Pandora.
- 'More than 10,000 is all she would say.'<eos> OK, thanks.<eos> Mr Maguire.<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir, but the statement you gave us the other day,<eos> I'd like to go over it again.
The loss of our unique community?<eos> Generations of the American melting pot getting kicked out of their homes.<eos> Gentrification is everyone's problem, Fiona.<eos> Frank, what are they doing in our yard?<eos> I rented it to them.
- Have you no shame?<eos> - Slean!<eos> Selling your body and my birthright.<eos> You have no birthright.<eos> You gave it up when you joined your uncle in treason.
It's just... different.<eos> You want to leave?<eos> What is that coffee table doing floating out in space?<eos> And this chair?<eos> Looks like it dropped out of a wormhole from the Tang Dynasty.
Nothing can hurt that guy.<eos> But why would Gwen fake her own death?<eos> If someone was trying to steal the software...<eos> Maybe somebody wasn't trying to steal it.<eos> Maybe Gwen was trying to steal it from her boss.
But why would Gwen fake her own death?<eos> If someone was trying to steal the software...<eos> Maybe somebody wasn't trying to steal it.<eos> Maybe Gwen was trying to steal it from her boss.<eos> So she can sell it on the black market?
Here.<eos> All right.<eos> Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Peter's successor has a specific grace to ask of You.<eos> Now, right now, those two young people in their home, Peter and Esther, have only one wish.<eos> You must grant it to them.
Father Valignano, you will say that their death is not meaningless.<eos> Surely, God heard their prayers as they died.<eos> But did he hear their screams?<eos> How can I explain his silence to these people, who have endured so much?<eos> I need all my strength to understand it myself.
We aren't going to hang.<eos> You're going to trade us.<eos> For Culper.<eos> Where did you hear that name?<eos> Sergeant Hickey must have heard it while standing guard outside my tent.
- But he didn't fall without a fight.<eos> - He had a rope?<eos> Mary, please, please, please. It's done.<eos> I don't want to talk about it, all right?<eos> Tomorrow I have to go out and move his body before it's discovered.
Just let that dry, and you'll be on your merry way.<eos> You know, not that I was expecting a, uh, parade or anything, but why is everyone so eager for me to go?<eos> Stefan Salvatore is not the problem.<eos> But if you are so determined to find foe amongst friends, then look no further than Marcel.<eos> After all, did he not steal Jackson's heart and deliver it to the very people bent on harming us?
Well, you'd have to survive this first. (Ropes creaking)<eos> You see, there's an anchor locking my brothers inside.<eos> Something representational.<eos> That's why they can't get out.<eos> (Sighs) But I'm going to bust into this little mental prison and shatter it from the inside.
Are you quite sure?<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> Finn must have come back when Davina resurrected me.<eos> The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line.<eos> Either it worked on him, or he found a way to hijack it.
Kol's linked to that candle, so whatever our two lovebirds say, our witches will be able to hear it.<eos> I don't think that a few more minutes of privacy is too much to ask.<eos> I don't give a damn about young love.<eos> They have a task.<eos> They had better finish it.
Unless they already have.<eos> They need my heart.<eos> Or one that's identical to it.<eos> The unification ceremony didn't just marry us, it also made his heart a mirror image of mine.<eos> We need to dig it up.
It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage, the hunger...<eos> It's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> There was never any hope for you, brother.<eos> Finn. And the spell decreed that the white oak tree that gave us life could also take it away.
She's gone.<eos> There's no time to sing dirges.<eos> We're at war.<eos> Good news, Freya, I think I found a spell that'll draw together all the serum that Aurora took.<eos> Now, it's gonna take a little while, but if I can concentrate it in her heart, we can extract it with this... destroy it, and make sure we ain't got no more of these
Now, it's gonna take a little while, but if I can concentrate it in her heart, we can extract it with this... destroy it, and make sure we ain't got no more of these<eos> - unkillable monsters on our hands.<eos> - Good.<eos> In the meantime, I think I may have finally found a way to kill Lucien.<eos> Now, my mother once tried to end my siblings by reversing the Original vampire spell, and according to her grimoire, only the witch who cast the spell could undo it.
You cannot stay here, sweetie.<eos> We can't have parole officers popping in all day and night to give you piss tests.<eos> You know, screw it. I'll just crash at my place.<eos> Yeah, you can't.<eos> We sold it.
Thank you, ma'am. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Just got a call from Raleigh County, West Virginia.<eos> State claimed the body.<eos> So, uh, we called the E.M.S.<eos> They're gonna transport it up to Charleston, uh, right now.
We can still find Valentine.<eos> I might know a way.<eos> My mother hid a lot from me, but I did see one thing... there's a box.<eos> She didn't think I knew about it.<eos> But she opened it once a year and cried.
When he wakes up.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> Jace, what happened to you?<eos> Luke's car may have found its way into a pole while I was stashing it.
Maybe.<eos> No idea.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I'd made a mess of my life...<eos> I'd wasted it...
Hank's not here yet, huh?<eos> He's on his way.<eos> I prepared a speech for you, basically because Hank forced me to.<eos> I was gonna do it at the rehearsal dinner, but, uh, then it got interrupted, so...<eos> Would you like to hear it now?
Annette. Okay, I got you.<eos> So, Annette, the MRI results showed a cavernous malformation that the CT missed.<eos> It's a cluster of abnormally formed blood vessels bleeding in your brain.<eos> Is that why I've been having hallucinations?<eos> Yes, and you developed epilepsy caused by the presence of the malformation, but the surgery will evacuate the bleeding and remove it.
Are you a cop or what? Come on, think.<eos> - We didn't find it in the apartment.<eos> - Whose was it?<eos> Well, the apartment was hers.<eos> But she rented it out.
Damn, it's hot in here.<eos> No hurry to sell, no one's been to see it in six months.<eos> And this?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> The lady rented it out, but never came...
- For eight whole months.<eos> I know.<eos> Boo hoo. How long can we keep this up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Should we have our cake and eat it too?
What do you mean?<eos> You seem shifty.<eos> Yeah, well, you seem bulimic.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I... I found this photo of you and I want to show it to you.
Mm-hm. Who's that? That girl.<eos> Hmm... I don't recall.<eos> Just some girl.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> But if you leave it with me, I could try to find out more if you like.
I mean, five different papers and not a word about the bullet he took to the brain, or his military record, or his family.<eos> Uh, his family?<eos> I found this photograph.<eos> It's of him and his wife and kids at the carousel.<eos> You found it where?
- Perhaps you could help.<eos> He said Arthur was strangled to death.<eos> That can't be.<eos> He froze to death.<eos> Nuniq found his body four days later and returned it to the ship.
Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> - Mr. Nuniq, may I have a word?<eos> - Yes, I am Nuniq.<eos> I understand that you discovered Mr. Pimblett's body<eos> - and brought it back to the ship.
Captain Bernier, did you murder Arthur Pimblett?<eos> I will say no more.<eos> Well, if there is evidence, I will find it.<eos> In the meantime, I'll be holding you in our cells.<eos> If he did it, why would he bring the body all the way back and hand it to us?
Because you've been moving through history.<eos> Well, you'll come to learn that this is just one of many things we have in common, Gareeb.<eos> We're both doing what we must to save the world.<eos> Subjugating the world to your rule is not saving it.<eos> You would create a wasteland and call it peace.
I know that you'll always protect me.<eos> No matter how mortal I become, the Devil can depend on that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Whatever the danger, I'll be there to stop it.<eos> Whether you see it coming or not.
N-No.<eos> It's "puff, puff, pass," not "puff, puff, stomp angrily."<eos> You brought pot to a crime scene?<eos> I most certainly did not.<eos> I found it here.
You brought pot to a crime scene?<eos> I most certainly did not.<eos> I found it here.<eos> You found it?<eos> You found it here at a crime scene?
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> And so I hid my powers until recently when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.

Ugh, I have no idea how you can concentrate right now.<eos> That would drive me crazy.<eos> Really? It doesn't bother me.<eos> Well, JT and I ought to have your new office up and running today, so you can work in some nice peace and quiet.<eos> I'm so excited to show you. I'm excited to see it.
It's day 3 of 4.<eos> If anyone's seen anything out of the ordinary and tweeted about it, I'll find it.<eos> Great.<eos> Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and I to the neighborhood where Will was found.<eos> Yes. They call it Kidneyville.
Great.<eos> Deepak, I'd like you to take Clara and I to the neighborhood where Will was found.<eos> Yes. They call it Kidneyville.<eos> Kidneyville?<eos> Yes, that's the name the locals have given it.
Eldritch, I won't give you a job.<eos> But I am going to give you this.<eos> Ten thousand dollars.<eos> Do some traveling. See the world while you can.<eos> Life's too short to spend it cooped up in some office.
- He's using Ruiz to do it.<eos> - I know you had a plan with Ruiz.<eos> Ruiz told me about it, right before I stabbed him.<eos> Tommy, where's the body?<eos> - It's under the fuckin' L.I.E. where I left it.
What she is is no longer my girlfriend anymore, okay?<eos> She's back with Agent Knox.<eos> So you fucked that up too?<eos> - You know, maybe you could just start a group text to keep us all informed of your fuck-ups, you know?<eos> If that recording surfaces I'll get it excluded, since it's totally illegal, but... once it's played in open court,
What does that mean?<eos> It means "I don't want you to go."<eos> Why aren't you in the hospital?<eos> Knee was dislocated.<eos> They popped it back in, but we've got bigger problems.
But, Duval, Gracie's your kid.<eos> - It's your call.<eos> You know this place well enough to draw us a map?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know it very well.
- How do the Connavers get past? - Nobody knows how.<eos> What'd the RAC have to say?<eos> They figure Connaver stole some kind of gadget that protects her ships.<eos> We just need that tech.<eos> If there's a warrant out for it, we want on it.
Yes, sir.<eos> It's a nice way to honor her memory, though hardly enough, considering.<eos> No.<eos> Not enough.<eos> President Peng hoarded the cure, kept it for the Chinese, and is now letting the virus mutate and burn itself across Japan and probably the rest of Asia.
Show them that beyond revolt lies a safe harbor with allies strong enough to protect them.<eos> It is the only way to ensure that the greatest number of them survive.<eos> I lost six men tonight.<eos> The men I have left know this estate means supplies and full stomachs.<eos> They know they are stronger with it.
! To talk about our future? !<eos> 'Cause I knew you'd lose your head.<eos> I ought to smack yours right off your shoulders!<eos> We have the loan.<eos> That's done. And with it, I have purchased everything that we need.
And now the founder and chairman of Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor.<eos> Hi.<eos> You all know why you're here.<eos> We're going to be unveiling a new platform.<eos> We think it is a bold new step, to allow us to serve our community better.
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> The man you love shall be forevermore a beast.<eos> When the sands run out, he will possess the total power of the pantheon of ancient gods.<eos> The lieutenant and I will journey to the Catacombs.<eos> Once there, we will restore Pandora's box, and use it to drain the Hidden One of his power.
Agent Foster has been most valuable in helping me deal with a... sticky situation.<eos> You can speak freely.<eos> This map... shows the energy signatures of demonic creatures.<eos> It's like, um, a radar that detects monsters.<eos> We thought we might be able to use it to locate Pandora. No dice. But... we discovered something else.
He will possess the total power of the pantheon of Ancient Gods.<eos> Enough to destroy every living thing in this world.<eos> Our plan involves a two-pronged strategy... the lieutenant and I will journey to the Delaware River where we should use<eos> Betsy Ross's flag to guide us to the Catacombs.<eos> Once there, we will restore Pandora's box and use it to drain the Hidden One of his power.
Look, it doesn't commit us to anything. - Look, I don't wanna go down this route any more than you do, but at least we'll have our bases covered.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Imagine a duel. Me and Conway.<eos> Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.<eos> And it's powerful because with it, he can tell what you think, what you want, where you are and who you are.
I'll still always be there for you, but I'm with her too.<eos> She's amazing, by the way.<eos> But you just don't know her yet.<eos> She's gonna change our family.<eos> She's gonna make it better.
Fuck!<eos> I just donated $5,000 to my cousin Wajeed's Kickstarter campaign.<eos> He's trying to get an app called... Bro off the ground.<eos> - Bro?<eos> - It's a messaging app that lets you send the word "bro" to everyone else who has the app.
It depends.<eos> Well, he doesn't have a picture or a profile or anything.<eos> It's more out of curiosity.<eos> No, it's... Look, everybody's got the app on their phone, right?<eos> It's what you do with it that matters.
Now, whatever you do, don't be defensive.<eos> Right.<eos> Can't let it look like I know I'm gonna be tased.<eos> Of course, that's the part that has me most worried.<eos> The vest won't protect you from the shock, but it'll keep the taser from leaving a mark.
The day before your accident, you lost your swipe card.<eos> We worked it out after Bea Smith escaped.<eos> What, she used it to escape?<eos> No, no, not quite.<eos> She used it to access contraband, a knife, which she used in a fight with Doyle.
I don't eat fish. I only like spaghetti.<eos> Ugh, when are you gonna get rid of that toothpick?<eos> It's disgusting, and it's starting to smell.<eos> Why would I give it up?<eos> It's gettin' me tons of tail.
You gotta poop somewhere.<eos> So acting, huh?<eos> I want this part.<eos> But why?<eos> It's the kind of part that gets you noticed, and I wanna be noticed.
Go! Go!<eos> Henry!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Crane... You need to know... Before he died, Brooks begged me to destroy that map.<eos> He said Moloch would use it to win the war.
Go! Go!<eos> Henry.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Crane, you need to know before he died, Brooks begged me to destroy that map.<eos> He said Moloch would use it to win the war.
They realises you've noticed 'em.<eos> Or even just a smile.<eos> They lights up.<eos> It makes their day - and that makes me happy.<eos> Ha! That's the amazing thing about kindness. It makes you feel good.
- Says who?<eos> - You can pay off pirates.<eos> You and I are rich in many ways, but the thing we're richest in is riches.<eos> So let's take the power of the royal treasury and go buy ourselves a wishing thing.<eos> We can use it to rescue Elsa, and she can save Arendelle.
Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream.<eos> You people come over here to steal it.<eos> So fuck all of you.<eos> Well, Mr. Looney, I appreciate your candor.<eos> It's refreshing, and tells me that you're not smart enough to have done this.
She's got that whole nerdy geisha thing going on.<eos> Oh, my Hermes scarf.<eos> Hermes, for real?<eos> It was a gift from these rich parents of one of my students.<eos> It always made me feel just so Jackie O.
My country commissioned that weapon decades ago.<eos> After the fall of Hydra, many scientists followed their Nazi friends to hide on this side of the world.<eos> German engineering.<eos> The weapon was lost during a clash in the jungle until today.<eos> With it, we'll end the rebel uprising and finally stabilize my country.
I've turned my back on many things in anger.<eos> In envy.<eos> In fear.<eos> But love sustains us.<eos> We thrive on it.
you're familiar with it?<eos> Sounds like you and I both got long stories to tell.<eos> I've been up 48 hours straight and this case ain't getting no clearer.<eos> It's the adrenaline...<eos> it keeps me going.
No, no, no, come on, now, come on.<eos> Jeez, it's just pages and pages of stuff about this Kent guy.<eos> She's really obsessed with him.<eos> Well, obsession's not such a bad thing.<eos> It got us the first printing press.
What does it mean?<eos> No.<eos> This power that we have comes from a dark place but it's not who we are.<eos> It never will be.<eos> And we can use it to do good to help people.
It's just that much more to clean up.<eos> - And you never read it.<eos> - Like you ever clean it up.<eos> I read the paper!<eos> I also use it to keep track of all the baseball scores across the entire country. You can't just...
We set off at first light!<eos> You.<eos> You're going with us.<eos> I need that weapon.<eos> It's the only thing that counts.
So the shit better come good like clockwork next week.<eos> Chavez.<eos> I won't burn you.<eos> Money is money.<eos> It makes the world go round.
"The rhythm's taking over." "The rhythm's taking over."<eos> "My love..." "I'm colored in your hues..."<eos> "...bathed in desire, I'm your muse..."<eos> "Our joys stacked up will make a hill..."<eos> "...on it we'll sit, you and I..."
"Risk Acquisitions, Derivatives." Maybe Jerome mishandled someone's money.<eos> I don't think we're getting anything off that computer.<eos> You get ripped off, you bring a gun or a pipe.<eos> Oh, yeah, a pipe is good.<eos> Then you can feel it, you know, when the bone breaks.
Hiro! hiro...<eos> These abilities allow us to do superhuman things, But you are still human.<eos> And your human body is rejecting these powers,<eos> Like, uh... like a virus.<eos> But this power... it is what makes me strong.
Well, I'll learn to be more mature and responsible with you.<eos> That song.<eos> That's the one you asked me to play When you and Jessi were out somewhere.<eos> You never told me why you needed it.<eos> It helped us get where we needed to go.
And you still are, Michael. We can fix this.<eos> I came back so that we could fix this.<eos> This can never be fixed.<eos> There's a tape.<eos> It gives us everything we need.
Don't move protestor or I will blow your commy brains out.<eos> Spottswoode?<eos> Johnston? What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Get away from Intelligence!<eos> I am using it to blow up North Korea. No!
- So check out a piece of<eos> - Tragedy'ego and Mobb Deep.<eos> Clip, etc.<eos> * Because I come from Queens and we are still here. *<eos> This case between East and West was large, because it sold through the disc magazine.
All right, I delivered.<eos> You did indeed.<eos> Is that what you wanted?<eos> Her blood?<eos> It will give me great power.
Zaned is from a village near Sarajevo.<eos> His father and two older brothers were taken prisoner by Serb irregulars... the feared Chetniks.<eos> His mother was shot by a sniper whilst queuing for water.<eos> [Jane] I've got a letter of permission from Radovan Karadzic.<eos> We can use it to get behind Serb lines.
Our land is full.<eos> What treasures has she borne?<eos> Bless you.<eos> Save this offering.<eos> We are not ready for it yet, but someday it will increase our power.
Good for you.<eos> I was always mediocre.<eos> The sports version of "Village Child A"<eos> Still, I'll never forget that line as long as I live.<eos> It was going to make me a star.
Thank me for what?<eos> You don't like your boss very much, do you?<eos> I don't like many things about my boss and my country.<eos> But I like my job very much.<eos> It keeps me here in Los Angeles.
Look, up there.<eos> A tree star.<eos> It is very special.<eos> A tree star. It is very special.<eos> It'll help you grow strong.
We're tunneling through the Earth.<eos> All of us.<eos> We are using a engine.<eos> The engine is going to shaft for breaking the rock and dirt.<eos> The engine you see, it mixes fast enough to be there before the moon turns full.
Yeah, 'cause I remember we had to feed it to you drop by drop.<eos> HANNIBAL: B.A., you lie still.<eos> I'm warning you all for the last time, I don't want this sucker's blood in me.<eos> It's gonna make me crazy just like him.<eos> MURDOCK: It's not gonna make you crazy, B.A. It'll just make you mellow.
- What people?<eos> - Convicts.<eos> You're all tattooed.<eos> That tiger head. What does it do? Make you feel tough?<eos> That cop's badge, what does it do? Make you feel honest?
Yes. My proportions are shifting slightly, and they require new fabulousness.<eos> Then can I borrow that black strapless dress you got in Paris while you're too sexy to wear it?<eos> No.<eos> But you couldn't squeeze those melons in there without causing considerable unaboob.<eos> Why can't you just let me brow it? !
I've known you since we were boys, Jan.<eos> Go on, Szymon.<eos> What do you need from me?<eos> I'd like to keep my insect collection here with you.<eos> I can't take it with me.
- The card.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.
- Where's the damn card? - You got it, fancy pants?<eos> - Where's the card?<eos> - Where is the card?<eos> There it is!<eos> Shit, it's not here.
Did you write this one?<eos> Let's see that.<eos> Aah! Damn thing cut me!<eos> where's your card?<eos> I don't have it.
Want, not need.<eos> I don't need anything, Ray.<eos> If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I want.<eos> And I want that information.<eos> Kind of funny that she'll only give it to you.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.
We won't be able to get you through the airport like this.<eos> - We need to get you stitched up.<eos> - Airport? We're going home, Danny.<eos> No.<eos> The way to K'un-Lun is open, and you are not there to protect it.
Here is the treasure map.<eos> Doctor brought it from India.<eos> No. Really?<eos> Wait...<eos> If you want to have a good look at it, we can work together.
No.<eos> It's 'cause you still feel.<eos> For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.
No, it's just squeezing me further into the stuck!<eos> Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.<eos> - Just rip it off.<eos> - Dee, I'm trying.<eos> I can't get any actual leverage on it.
Wait a second, Dee.<eos> - I've got an idea!<eos> - What?<eos> If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here.<eos> You said you couldn't rip through it.
In the morning, I gave it to him.. He can't pay.. I take the car.<eos> I just need a few more days.<eos> Few more days isn't part of the deal.<eos> Come on..<eos> You make a deal you gotta live up to it.
Like I make it in 10 seconds.<eos> What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow Tyre?<eos> Loving that Lambo now?<eos> Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.<eos> Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.
Another half an hour, at least.<eos> I swear to God, he was beaten half to death before he yelped, "Enough!"<eos> Why do so many of them choose to be beaten? Power.<eos> One told me it's like pissing.<eos> You build up the power inside your belly and then you need to let it out, and a good thrashing from a Countess does the trick, apparently.
We'd be crazy not to use it.<eos> - It's not part of my plan.<eos> - Well, I don't know your plan.<eos> I'm in the dark.<eos> I mean, you asked me to put on the Melissa mask and then you don't even want me to use it.
I have powers you can't even fathom.<eos> And I own a run-down brothel.<eos> Because I hate magic even more than you.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm glad you banned it.
I'll say it again.<eos> Since the attack, the Brits have become much more alert.<eos> The last show is at Singhghat camp.<eos> From there, the trunk can safely be taken to the other side via the river.<eos> Then why don't you hide it in your ambulance?
This isn't about England... or her king... or our freedom, or any of it.<eos> When I thought Madi was gone, I saw... for the first time, I saw the world through your eyes.<eos> A world in which there is nothing left to lose.<eos> I felt the need to make sense of the loss.<eos> To impart meaning to it... whatever the cost.
Maybe I'll see you again. Maybe.<eos> Heel-toe, heel-toe out here.<eos> Bend at your knees. You want to keep quiet.<eos> I heard you from a mile away.<eos> And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring... when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men,
There's pictures of people eating poop in there!<eos> It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment.<eos> Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him...<eos> He won't have to ask for it, okay?<eos> He won't need it.
But then the medicis invented banks, and wealth and pornography.<eos> Of course, technology has other benefits as well.<eos> Safety, for example, a safer car, the artificial heart.<eos> And, well, how a handgun might be equipped with a fingerprint scanner.<eos> To keep it from being used by anyone but its owner.
- I know where to get some.<eos> You achieved glory by killing a load of fascists, then just walked away.<eos> I left when it was over.<eos> Glory only lasts a second.<eos> I experienced it and then I split.
Open the fucking door!<eos> From dozens of arrests made in connection with the assassination attempt on the President earlier this month.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people, that our Democracy is strong and resilient and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
I believe the rains will come, and with them a great flood.<eos> I have to sing to make it stop.<eos> You have to sing?<eos> For the last two years, I've been working my way down the songline.<eos> I don't have to tell you every community has a different part, so I've had to learn it piece by piece...
She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?<eos> Because I'm getting the feeling we're not hearing the entire story.<eos> No, the whole story, Matt, is in your ridiculous book, which somehow you convinced my husband and my stepson to keep from me.<eos> Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause they knew this would be your reaction.
I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...<eos> - It's marvelous.<eos> - It's wonderful.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> That means she likes it.
Well, of course not.<eos> This is the first I've heard of it.<eos> I'll get on it right away.<eos> Someone needs to organize a... an open forum on campus, get a dialog started.<eos> The school needs to prove it cares about the well-being of all its students.
What'd they call it?<eos> "Excessive use of force."<eos> So, I had anger issues back then.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.
Based on a multitude of evidence, Hodgins and I came to the conclusion that the killer's not a lumberjack.<eos> So we're not looking for a lumberjack's chain saw, we're looking for a regular consumer chain saw.<eos> So... we're testing all of them.<eos> And what exactly is the plan here?<eos> Look, Cam, if we can find the make and model of the chain saw that was used, we may be able to match it to a chain saw owned by one of the remaining non-lumberjack suspects.
Did I think about killing him?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was... It was a genius move.<eos> But you made it very clear during the generals that you did not want my help.<eos> I didn't need it.
Not really.<eos> People don't like the truth.<eos> The truth is slippery.<eos> Can't depend on it.<eos> Try it.
I had to cut her out of some barbed wire.<eos> So what was so important you suddenly had to see your sister face to face?<eos> - You've read the emails.<eos> - So it was about the farm.<eos> Half of it's hers, she wants to sell up, take it all away.
So, how do we get to him?<eos> Let's go again.<eos> Have you studied The Art of War?<eos> That was not on the reading list at art school.<eos> You should learn it.
We want you looking as young and innocent as possible.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Good thing she still has that baby face.<eos> So, aside from this, uh, make-under, what exactly is your strategy?<eos> Well, this is a big part of it.
Because I... I can't see anything past me just creating more targets.<eos> We're not targets, man.<eos> We're your teammates.<eos> We're your strength.<eos> You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Their life, my life is better because you decided to become the Green Arrow.<eos> Well, whenever you decide to become the Green Arrow again.<eos> I know you're right.<eos> I believe that you're right, but every time I take a step forward, it feels like the past is pulling me back.<eos> Probably because you're letting it.
Somebody fucked us.<eos> I spoke to Adelstein this morning.<eos> Fuck, I told you not to.<eos> And he told me about the deal.<eos> I'm not taking it.
Where you going, kitty cat?<eos> What were you thinking about?<eos> My parents.<eos> I've wanted justice for them for so long.<eos> And now that I've achieved it...
Look, it's early days, but... first tests show that her blood is attacking the cells in her body.<eos> Wait, that's the opposite of how my blood causes cells to regenerate.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Can we use my blood to save her?<eos> Listen, I don't think that your blood is the key to saving Iris. But I do think it might be exactly what we need to take down Yorkin.
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.<eos> One look, and you can see that.<eos> And she wants to be with him.<eos> No matter how scared she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, all that matters is, they're together.<eos> And when you find a love like that, well... you gotta hold on to it.
No, the reason that she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I didn't have sex with her.<eos> Yeah, I don't believe you.<eos> No one says no to a girl like that.<eos> I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, uh, as for your package, Burt...<eos> I don't have it.
- Where are you taking him? - Nothing to worry about.<eos> - Then why are you taking him?<eos> - It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> I was doing some work and I came across this bag.<eos> Did you touch it?
Get in the fireplace.<eos> What...? What did he tell you?<eos> That I keep cash around here, huh?<eos> I haven't seen him in months.<eos> You amateurs, it's not even here anymore.
I don't think so.<eos> I mean, it's our faces.<eos> - It's our store.<eos> - And it's my commercial.<eos> And you can't run it without my permission.
I wish everyone was.<eos> I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.<eos> You can't take the company back by force.<eos> You need our consent.<eos> And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
Yeah, some petition she means to hand in to the Prime Minister at Downing Street.<eos> What do you make of it?<eos> Henley postmark. Sent four days ago.<eos> I can look into the typeface.<eos> I doubt we'll have much luck after all the hands it's been through, but best get it fingerprinted.
He gets paid to sell stuff.<eos> There you go again.<eos> The sales will pick up soon, honey. I promise.<eos> We got enough for another glass?<eos> Depends how badly you want it.
You said you could help.<eos> My ex told you about a friend, right?<eos> Uh, Victoria Gemmet.<eos> He said she was a client.<eos> He said she had an opportunity, a real estate opportunity, but she couldn't take advantage of it because she didn't have the cash.
No...<eos> And I won't be till you are.<eos> Hey, maddie? I wrote a new song last night.<eos> It's called "the girls who spill coffee".<eos> You wanna hear it?
This version is just not me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's new.<eos> But I hope you'll at least give it a chance.
I can't find it anywhere.<eos> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Remember the last time that you saw it?<eos> No.<eos> I just hope I didn't leave it at that stupid party.
They've been sent from outside the bloc to clean up our mess, which is not just embarrassing... It might have serious consequences.<eos> We need to find Broussard and recover our Host's artifact.<eos> And nothing in your résumé or work so far makes me believe that you will be useful in this endeavor.<eos> Sir, I've been working in this bloc for six months.<eos> I... I know the history of the insurgency, how it's structured.
I don't want it to land on my daughter.<eos> [sniffles] We're alone.<eos> You have family in the bloc, don't you?<eos> That hasn't been easy either.<eos> It's been my experience that blood will always rise to the occasion if you give it the chance.
Where is it?<eos> There.<eos> Wait, hang on.<eos> "He knew he had to write back or at least call" and tell them they could give away his spot.<eos> Somehow, he couldn't take the envelope from his back pocket and stick it in the mail.
Did I think about killing him?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was... It was a genius move.<eos> But you made it very clear during the generals that you did not want my help.<eos> I didn't need it.
You are not welcome here.<eos> I believe I made that clear.<eos> Mr. Skinner, please escort her out the back.<eos> I offered you an olive branch, Priscilla.<eos> One day you will look back and you will wonder why you didn't take it.
Let's.<eos> How the fuck do you even know what he said to them?<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know what he said.<eos> He had his story. He stuck to it.
We shall see. But for now,<eos> Quentin, Alice, Penny, and Margo need Battle Magic.<eos> We're going to teach Battle Magic now?<eos> It was once a required course.<eos> Till it was outlawed.
Well, the meeting ain't over yet.<eos> The monks' philosophy is simple.<eos> Take every item you own and ask: does it still bring me joy?<eos> If yes, then you keep it.<eos> If not, you thank it for its service
When one of your betters is outside and front of the bars, you stand up, turn around, and look him in the goddamned eye.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> You know what I need from you?<eos> Your attention.<eos> And I'm gonna demand it every time I look in your fucking eyes.
We can't be realtors if we don't have listings.<eos> It's so basic. It's so fucking basic.<eos> [Sheila] Oh, my... [grunts]<eos> - Would've been nice to have the lid.<eos> - [grunts] I couldn't find it.
'cause it says in one of your mother's books that blood is associated with crossing over in death, like slain warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in its final state... human sacrifice on the altar... and sometimes blood is used as currency.<eos> - Eve, slow down.<eos> - What if blood could be used as a form of payment to pass into the other world?<eos> Blood magic is very dangerous.<eos> We would only need to use it to get to the other side.
No news is better than ill news.<eos> Ross promised to send word as soon as he had it.<eos> You may be sure he'll keep his word.<eos> 'Tis the Poldark way.<eos> My dear, this feud between Ross and George, can you find no way to end it?
Look, I want to talk to you about your offer.<eos> You thought about it. - I did.<eos> - Good.<eos> Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms.<eos> I'm not taking it.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.<eos> We never even get to be there... to see how fun it is.<eos> Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.<eos> Mm. French vanilla?<eos> Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it?
All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?<eos> Danny... told you he gave me his cell?<eos> But you didn't use it to make a call.<eos> You used it to look at an app you installed on your son's phone years ago...
First class all the way for my Sandman.<eos> - You came!<eos> - Of course.<eos> Miss Clarke, I love your new album.<eos> I play it every day. I'm obsessed with it.
Illegal?<eos> No. No.<eos> Then yeah.<eos> He gave me some pot.<eos> But you you guys can have it.
Where is it?<eos> We didn't get the machine.<eos> It didn't survive landing?<eos> No.<eos> It did, but I had a choice... bring the machine home or use it to save them.
From now on, I wish you to perform these same duties regarding your husband.<eos> If he says or does anything that you consider to be contrary to my interests,<eos> I wish to be informed of it.<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> As for love, if that is what you seek, I suggest you seek it elsewhere.
I won't ask more than you can afford.<eos> And if I don't get your son back, you don't pay.<eos> You don't use the pool so much?<eos> Pump broke.<eos> I didn't see much point in fixing it.
What's the situation?<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.<eos> But the bad news...<eos> There's a squad of heavily armed mercs guarding it.
Very well, then.<eos> Take a few deep breaths.<eos> Burns going in, but should wear off.<eos> You've got about an hour of augmented strength.<eos> Don't waste it.
You really have to leave right away?<eos> I have to get this book someplace safe.<eos> Keep an eye on my brother?<eos> - The gateway's almost ready.<eos> - Don't need it.
I don't know.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> What... What's in the package?<eos> I just know it's important.<eos> And don't open it either.
It's actually quite similar.<eos> Absolutely not. See?<eos> I have my own business card.<eos> "Captain Sham's Sailboats.<eos> Every boat has it's own sail."
They're checking surrounding businesses for CCTV.<eos> Yeah, well, there's nothing in here to indicate he was meeting anyone.<eos> Guitar supplies but no guitar.<eos> No, he'd take it with him.<eos> If he has a guitar, he wouldn't check it.
Let her be now, Koen.<eos> Is it alive?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Let's find out what else Cleverman blood can do.<eos> What we can do to it.
- But we have to fix this. - I know.<eos> Every time I check the money, there's less of it.<eos> The stacks are half of what they were a month ago.<eos> So move on 'em.<eos> That cash isn't worth the paper it's printed on if I don't know how to clean it.
This cost me my family, you know that?<eos> This deal was done.<eos> They could have come home.<eos> Now, there's gonna be men coming here, they're gonna be looking for answers I can't give.<eos> They made a deal with us, and they're gonna honor it.
Shopping then for a new set?<eos> I've joined the women's league.<eos> I want to do something I can feel good about.<eos> My wedding ring.<eos> When I escaped, I couldn't leave it behind.
What is this for?<eos> Protection. It's a 1915 semiautomatic, fully loaded.<eos> I am not comfortable taking a gun.<eos> Violence is not the option.<eos> Well, then, use this to prevent it.
Yes, but I imagine the lines are often blurred.<eos> I can assure you they're not.<eos> Well, it's impressive to experience darkness and not be consumed by it.<eos> Well, we don't have much choice, do we?<eos> We either reject the darkness or we let it destroy us.
The ranch ain't my autocratic plaything.<eos> Its residents don't bend to my whims and wills and fancies.<eos> It's a place for free people who only ask for help when they need it.<eos> I'm asking.<eos> I need it.
That's who.<eos> We could've just shut the camera off, Liv.<eos> Does she work here?<eos> You murdered her, didn't you?<eos> You found out she was recording sessions, and you figured you could steal the memory card and blackmail the other men on it, so you broke in.
Bajie, I, I know where the book is.<eos> Huh. No shit.<eos> You should've just chipped in earlier.<eos> It's in the Conservatory.<eos> The Widow's planning to use it to get our powers back. Same old Flea.
She was only on her fifth insemination. Now she's probably dead.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - She must've been relocated.<eos> Oh, right. To the wonderful "B-positive living facility"?<eos> Hey, dummies, we are here because strigoi like the taste of our blood and they want us to make more of it.
All non-toxic, of course.<eos> I like the yellow, but I mean, do you know how many yellows there are?<eos> I got a job offer in Colorado.<eos> It's a promotion, with... with a raise, and, um, Conor put in for a transfer as well.<eos> I know we decided to do this baby thing together, so if you don't want me to take it, I'll...
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What, you just lost it?<eos> No, I didn't... I didn't just lose it.<eos> It was here, and then it was not here.<eos> Did you try to look for it?
Your Honor, I'd like to cross-examine.<eos> This is not a full trial.<eos> This is merely a motion to dismiss.<eos> Yeah, I know, but this information just came into our hands.<eos> We were hoping to use it at trial, but... we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we could ask it now.
Yeah, Diane did a lot of legal work for the Fund.<eos> Because she was your friend.<eos> No, because we paid her.<eos> Is that why you had me get the Schtup list from Uncle Jax's computer?<eos> So that you could use it against Diane?
Hey, is this Liam?<eos> Little Liam with the religious parents? It is.<eos> I saw his name on the board, and I couldn't believe it.<eos> How did you get consent?<eos> I didn't need it.
He's just jealous.<eos> Maybe, Papa, but he's right about magic.<eos> The war's over.<eos> You don't need it anymore.<eos> I can't just give it up, Bae.
Not bullshit.<eos> Ask yourself a question:<eos> What will a Magician need if dark days come?<eos> Answer: magic.<eos> But if it is gone, it is gone, you say.
Well, that's remarkable.<eos> The spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound which acts as its own sealant.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.
I understand.<eos> But I can assure you this has gone to the highest ranks and there will be a full investigation.<eos> Thank you for working with us.<eos> For our reports, I would like to have the recording of that cognitive interview.<eos> I didn't record it.
I got a call from the Huggins Award committee.<eos> They were annoyed, because you won the award, but apparently I didn't let their honoree off to attend the ceremony. Which is odd, because she didn't ask me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I used you as an excuse.<eos> Why wouldn't you want to accept it?
He says that he's clean, but his money's going somewhere.<eos> I mean, he's always hitting me and Dean up for a float.<eos> I mean, he's desperate for money, could be an extortion plot gone wrong.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, Carter's got his personal problems, but he and I built this company from nothing, he wouldn't jeopardize it.
I know they don't work.<eos> This arrow is a tool.<eos> It will lead you to gaze upon the person you love most.<eos> The fairy told me about the man with the lion tattoo.<eos> You could use it to find him.
I don't know how or why, but something has lit a fire under his butt.<eos> - That's... I mean-- - Uh, great.<eos> Great. Which is why I want to move him into Algebra 2.<eos> Now, I know it's a little unusual in the middle of the school year, but we've got his attention now.<eos> We don't want to lose it.
Hi, could you tell Dan Melcher that Richard Hendricks and the guys from Pied Piper are here to see him?<eos> You guys are Pied Piper?<eos> The guys who built our data storage network? It's awesome.<eos> Oh. yeah, it was awesome until it crashed this morning.<eos> I was just using it two minutes ago.
I controlled their minds.<eos> Just like you have, many, many times.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.
- I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.<eos> - I always thought I had some kind of... God-level good luck.<eos> - True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.
- Uh, no, but when I walked in...<eos> - Did you identify yourself as a police officer?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Did you show him your badge?<eos> I would have, but I couldn't find it at that particular time, but I did find it later, so we're good on it.
I haven't, no.<eos> 'It's a 5,000-year-old pyramid.<eos> 'But there's one problem with that.'<eos> One little problem.<eos> It wasn't there yesterday.
We are modelling the future.<eos> Each thread is a chain of days, leading to your end.<eos> We can detect when a catastrophe is about to occur.<eos> And?<eos> Stop it from occurring.
You wrote it?<eos> It's hot.<eos> How come you never recorded it?<eos> I don't know, I guess because of the Spanish.<eos> I never had no one who could sing it before.
Simone, I'm done with him.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm done with him.<eos> Star, where are you going?<eos> I'm going to Hunter's, that's where I left my hoodie, and I need it for NextFest.
Oh!<eos> Right. Ooh. Did I forget to mention there's just one problem?<eos> The Jolly Roger isn't actually in this realm.<eos> It's... it's with that woman I spoke of.<eos> So if you want to claim your winnings, you're gonna have to give me that bean and let me use it.
Hey.<eos> It took a while, but I found your dress.<eos> I saw it in French Vogue and the stylist finally tracked it down.<eos> It's an Andre Devereaux, who is a totally cutting edge designer.<eos> No one else will be wearing it.
God.<eos> Noodle, I'm so sorry. I just...<eos> I can't wear the dress that you picked out.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It works great on somebody else, but I just can't pull it off.
Hey, no one will tell me anything.<eos> What are we doing here? What... what are the tools for?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I went for Smurf's gun.<eos> And I would've used it.
Whatever you want, I'll approve it.<eos> But, Edgar, whatever it is that you're going through, we can help you, but you need to...<eos> How the hell would you know what I need?<eos> I know that you need help,<eos> I know that I'm in no position to give it to you, - so, as your friend...
Most recently, a couple nights back?<eos> Oh, we get a lot of boats out here.<eos> You... You want to be more specific?<eos> The 45 foot Super Sport.<eos> Someone was using it illegally.
Interesting, I'm feeling a little punchy myself.<eos> Are ya?<eos> Yeah, I are.<eos> So, uh, what would one do if they're feelin' punchy?<eos> Well, I would imagine if he or she had a punch card, one might use it. Shwah!
So let's make one thing clear.<eos> You are the one bringing her down, not me.<eos> It's snowing!<eos> I installed a snow machine.<eos> Luckily, Liam didn't cancel it.
Guys, this Apothecary, this guy is good.<eos> You got the toxicology report?<eos> He knew Helen Dahle.<eos> I'm sorry, not know-know like he met her.<eos> He knew her medical history, and he used it against her.
How'd it go?<eos> Honestly, it was great.<eos> Truth is, I still don't know.<eos> But what I do know is that this family's the most important thing in my life.<eos> I don't wanna lose it.
traces of ink.<eos> What kind of ink?<eos> Printer, pen?<eos> I mean, there's literally hundreds of classifications.<eos> I don't know, Sebastian, but the sample was so small, I wouldn't want anyone to touch it, except you.
a conversation filled with deep and far reaching consequence.<eos> Now, if we don't...<eos> The conversation is very short. Yes.<eos> And it's a pity.<eos> Worse than death really, to be left out of the future after you've put so much into it.
Nothing.<eos> The less she knows, the better.<eos> Kelly Hughes... her mother just moved to the top of the heart and lung donor list two days ago.<eos> Maybe this is the Collaborators giving her an incentive.<eos> My mother had an infection, but as soon as it got better, they moved her up.
- He doesn't.<eos> - Where's my raincoat?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I need it for show-and-tell, and it has indoor pockets.
_<eos> I need it for show-and-tell, and it has indoor pockets.<eos> Mommy said she'd find it!<eos> Calm down, Mateo.<eos> I've looked for it everywhere, and it's not here, but I will find it and drop it off, okay?
♪ Her life was so enchanted ♪<eos> ♪ She took it all for granted ♪<eos> ♪ Now she'll dream of could-have-beens ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, evil may be powerful ♪ ♪ But wicked always... ♪<eos> Wait. Why just revel in her demise, when I can use it to my advantage?
Well, I hope you're more cooperative tomorrow, for your own sake.<eos> Hey, Tom, it's Ray.<eos> I left a package at your place last night.<eos> Make sure you get to it before Natalie does.<eos> My name's not on it or anything, but it's in your mail.
Of course.<eos> It never leaves my side.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> It may be the realm's only hope of defeating the darkness.<eos> I will guard it with my life.
She used magic.<eos> Kid, there's no such thing as magic.<eos> True belief is believing even if you can't see.<eos> Here, just look at the book.<eos> Henry. - Just touch it.
True belief is believing even if you can't see.<eos> Here, just look at the book.<eos> Henry. - Just touch it.<eos> - Henry, enough.<eos> - Touch it!
The point is, Helen knew that the Deutschemark meant I was with her.<eos> She wasn't alone.<eos> It's a coin, Owen.<eos> That no one, not Maxwell Fletcher or Alice Winter, would notice.<eos> And it will remind you you're not alone until the day you won't need it anymore.
It's like camping.<eos> Try the peppered one there.<eos> It's surprisingly good.<eos> Your friend has a gun. He does.<eos> But he'll have little use for it so long as you assist me in locating a passenger.
You know who else looks different these days?<eos> Terrance Valentine.<eos> The man you put in prison for a crime you did.<eos> Wrong.<eos> The gun... the one you kept all these years... your son used it to murder somebody last night.
And turned to walk away.<eos> And so, I pulled the gun out.<eos> Just to, show him I was serious.<eos> And, and he said, "Bitch, you gonna bring a gun?"<eos> "You better be ready to use it."
Can you fix it?<eos> Like before?<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We need to operate, and quickly.<eos> If the other half comes loose, the clip could end up in your brain or somewhere else you definitely don't want it.
- All right, good.<eos> I gotta know. What's gonna happen with my hand?<eos> - Am I gonna lose it?<eos> - Well, we don't know yet.<eos> I'm gonna take a good look at it now.
No!<eos> Waverly!<eos> No!<eos> Nicole! No!<eos> You're telling the truth. You don't have it.
This third seal.<eos> Constance's seal.<eos> Is it worth all of this?<eos> OK...<eos> Maybe we could use it to lure the Widows?
Apparently Mr. Reyes was in a fight.<eos> He was sent to solitary, where he complained of difficulty breathing.<eos> A doctor was called and delivered treatment. Unfortunately, he died a few hours later.<eos> Well, if he was in a fight, there has to be an incident report.<eos> That may be, but you have no right to access it.
I don't know who I love anymore.<eos> But you're funny and pretty, and I like the way you pinch your nose when you sneeze.<eos> And I'm really, really sorry I hurt your feelings.<eos> I appreciate your honesty.<eos> But you didn't appreciate it at the Olive Garden.
Also, there's something I want to tell you.<eos> Really?<eos> Actually, a major movie company was impressed by the sales of your book, and has offered to make Drifting Emotions into a movie.<eos> If we make this deal, even more people will read your novels.<eos> I really appreciate that offer, but... I'd like to turn it down.
But you... You are begotten of God.<eos> That is why you can make dead birds fly, the sick well, the blind see,<eos> and why you were able to make Eleazer live again.<eos> He's made you a child to grow in wisdom as well as in all other things.<eos> Keep your power inside you, until your father in heaven shows you the time to use it.
Some of these guys are military for sure.<eos> The czarina, what's she after?<eos> She ain't said yet.<eos> Whatever it is, it's in an unmarked Homeland Security building.<eos> DHS uses it as a weigh station for sensitive materials coming in and out of the country.
I don't know where they are.<eos> But you know where they were.<eos> You have no idea how long it took me to get here.<eos> The closest loop was in the California desert.<eos> I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.
David, do you know the average age of a resident here at Hilldale?<eos> Um, no, I don't.<eos> - Eighty-two years old.<eos> Have you ever seen the skin on an 82-year-old man?<eos> Have you ever felt it?
Desmond, yes, ma'am. Well, Desmond, we can't take your blood two days in a row.<eos> Well, that's good. I came to get mine back.<eos> You what?<eos> My blood. I need it back.<eos> Well, it don't work like that, we can't just give it back to you.
Who?<eos> Oh, there you are!<eos> I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> My book, I was looking all over for it.
Poor likeness.<eos> You a bounty hunter?<eos> Duly sworn warrant officer.<eos> Where is your gun?<eos> Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.
But I know someone who would tell you otherwise.<eos> There's one little boy who could tell you the whole story.<eos> He could even tell you what happens next.<eos> He knows that the North Star shines brightest of all.<eos> He knows that there's magic in the woods, if you know where to look for it.
Well, it's nice to meet you.<eos> We've come to get a book that your husband's been kind enough to look after for me.<eos> Oh, yeah, the book.<eos> Well, it's somewhere inside the house.<eos> As soon as I have a chance, I'll find it, and I'll put it in the mail.
One call, yeah?<eos> It's Billy.<eos> They're all over him.<eos> Get him to the cement factory in Deptford.<eos> We used it before.
I don't know if that's science, but it is definitely not religion.<eos> Water is denser than air, so as the light passes through each drop, it bends, the colours split and we see a rainbow.<eos> So Noah's rainbow was only reflections, not a promise?<eos> If we explore the mystery of Creation, discovering how it works, does that destroy its wonder?<eos> You know that a piece of music is made of notes, chords, crotchets and rests, but that doesn't stop it sounding lovely or inspiring beautiful thoughts.
Unlike others who seek to control you. I want to set you free.<eos> I know the kind of mutants you are looking for.<eos> And I know where to find them.<eos> It's my first time in America. I am very excited to see your culture.<eos> Well, you are not going to see it here.
They hit me and hit me.<eos> They broke my bones.<eos> I protected my face.<eos> It's Aryan Khanna's face.<eos> Nothing must happen to it.
It's called "The Riddle of the Model."<eos> That's really sweet. Oh.<eos> No, it's not about you.<eos> It's about another model I know. Oh.<eos> Right, well, I'll give it a listen, but I'm, like, really, really busy at the moment.
That was 20 years ago.<eos> And we're here to help.<eos> And I'm black.<eos> The Russians are blacks now.<eos> If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.
- Okay.<eos> They were nice to me.<eos> Grab your shit.<eos> Where's your jacket?<eos> I don't have it.
Can we go in?<eos> Nobody entered the cell.<eos> Strange.<eos> Did anyone tamper with the surveillance camera?<eos> Nobody touched it.
But this smell hadn't been there before.<eos> No, it hadn't.<eos> And now it's become colder, and the heating season has started.<eos> Look for a boiler house working on peat.<eos> And don't forget to put it under surveillance.
There's something else.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I wished I were dead.<eos> And if I'd kept my eyes shut, I could have almost touched the edges of oblivion.<eos> But I'd made a promise and had to keep it.
I put it out.<eos> Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window?<eos> I know guys put it out in their mouth.<eos> Just before you put it out, you knocked on the window, like people do to say "Roll it down."<eos> And we saw that she didn't roll it down.
Wars cost money.<eos> And without funds, Charles is helpless.<eos> All we have to do is see to it that his war chest remains empty.<eos> Let's hope the French Minister of Finance knows a bad investment when he sees one.<eos> If the Scottish rebellion can be plotted in a French brothel, then perhaps it can be stopped at the French Court.
- Shut up. - What the hell did I do?<eos> Just be quiet.<eos> All right, we got a lot to do.<eos> - What about the boat?<eos> - We can talk to George about it. There's no use hangin' onto it - if no one's gonna use it.
I'll send a car to check it out.<eos> The bottle was found here. right there.<eos> - Why narrow it to this circle?<eos> We're excluding Kattegat.<eos> The sea currents can't push it that way.
She's the victim.<eos> What, Naz isn't, too?<eos> If I was still his lawyer, I'd at least pretend I thought so.<eos> It's like having a nuclear arsenal.<eos> You don't want to use it, but if the other side knows you got it, they tend to come to the table sooner.
Are you hurt?<eos> Amahl, what's happening out there?<eos> - It's so bad. It's not good. - Amahl!<eos> Amahl, can I get my gun?<eos> Sorry, buddy, I think I'm gonna need it.
Yo, Farley, bring the camera. The 4K one.<eos> Luke Cage is going at it.<eos> You still hit like a bitch.<eos> - The folder.<eos> - You don't have it?
I'm her mother.<eos> And I knew, I just knew it was something bad.<eos> I'm not sure Anna can wait much longer.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I want to help you, I really do, but I've only had this job for two weeks and I really need it.
So..you're calling yourself Anjali here?<eos> Did you all find your footballs?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> See..when you were busy finding your ball.. ...you couldn't find it.
And in them is what<eos> I then identified as a possible glove.<eos> What did you do then?<eos> I approached it and I looked at it.<eos> Did you touch it?
I suggest you do it now.<eos> There was a chicken on a farm. Every morning, the farmer would feed it, until it became fat.<eos> The chicken thought the farmer was a good man.<eos> One morning, the farmer came as usual.<eos> But he didn't feed it. He killed it.
I mean, not face-to-face, I don't want to see him face-to-face, but from far away, definitely.<eos> Yeah, well, if it comes down to that, then I'll drop a gun in front of him I'll drop a gun in front of me, and we'll draw, fair and square, Old West style.<eos> Your ramp is a piece of shit.<eos> I know.<eos> I-I can't afford to have it fixed right now, so...
Wait, I'm confused.<eos> Is that a challenge or a terrorist threat to the ship?<eos> (Dee laughs mockingly) Give me the goddamn deck. By all means.<eos> Pick a card, any card. Hmm... Now take a good look at that card, please.<eos> You might want to bring it a little bit closer, just so you can see it well. A little bit closer. Great.
But this outcome would seem most unpredictable.<eos> The law was adhered to.<eos> If the bargain changes, there is no telling what else will change as a result- what trust may be lost and what chaos may abound.<eos> I am your friend, and I will help you weather whatever challenges may lie down whatever road you may choose, but as your friend, I am simply asking you to consider how treacherous this road may be-<eos> while there is still time to avoid it.
But this isn't me!<eos> This is the best version of you.<eos> You're the first to journey all the way back.<eos> To get another chance.<eos> Don't you want it?
Or more like a kaleidoscope of human suffering?<eos> It's not a picture.<eos> It's a feeling.<eos> Like a mist on your face on a cold morning.<eos> You can't see it in the air, but you can feel... the wetness.
Go.<eos> I just quit smoking, and I hate chewing gum.<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> All right. This phone call's the reason why we're here.<eos> -Let's hear it.
About a mile through the woods.<eos> This is rustic.<eos> Some backyard you got here.<eos> - Yeah, I like the quiet.<eos> - Ugh, I fucking hate it.
But just as I was about to do that...<eos> I saw him do the same thing to someone else.<eos> I'd never seen such pointless brutality.<eos> I was so transfixed by the horror that I didn't notice the moon had come out.<eos> But having caught a glimpse of what human nature was capable of, I wanted no more part of it.
- That's what everyone says.<eos> - No. We'll just need the room for a few minutes...<eos> to do research.<eos> Yeah, that's what everyone says.<eos> You know, I've never seen a patient receive so much attention... especially one who's so unworthy of it.
We'll stop on the way out. Thanks.<eos> When are we gonna interview the girls at the pool, Harry?<eos> Left dirty dishes.<eos> Cell phone.<eos> No wonder we couldn't locate it.
What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it vulnerable to another, more terrible despot?<eos> We are not warriors, Captain Hunter.<eos> We possess no army.<eos> And I'm not asking for one.<eos> Just a single timeship and your permission to change history before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.
Oh, hey, Nick. I just met the other only person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's a gosh-damn dreamboat.<eos> Jess, we have an emergency.<eos> Cece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get down the hall.<eos> She's built a laundry dam.<eos> - Well, can't you just step over it?
Who would we trust?<eos> Thought I could trust you, for instance.<eos> I'm not going to explain myself to you, Bernard.<eos> I was charged with safeguarding the park's intellectual property.<eos> Why would it be in danger?
"You need a junkyard dog "and in England that's Anthony Julius."<eos> Right, right. Junkyard dog...<eos> Oh, someone who's gonna be ferocious in court.<eos> Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court.<eos> I prepare the case, I don't present it.
Although I'm not sure he realized when he agreed to a trial by a single judge, that it would mean a written judgment. This judgment is gonna stand against him forever.<eos> Now, some people are saying that the result of this trial will threaten free speech.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> I'm not attacking free speech.<eos> On the contrary, I've been defending it against someone who wanted to abuse it.
And I leave my phone here because my mom tracks me.<eos> As if I can't be trusted!<eos> Here's the genius part.<eos> I strapped the phone to the dog's collar, so your mom will think you're moving around.<eos> Why don't you hold it and move around?
Then it had us pick up the same packages later and deliver them to their original addresses.<eos> The building directory shows no tenant in Suite 908.<eos> My training driver says packages have been going there for weeks.<eos> Looks like they're all from electronics companies.<eos> It could be that the Machine is rerouting them, looking for something to help it rebuild.
-What did you say?<eos> -Soppan ...<eos> Say that again.<eos> -Hi.<eos> I tried not to be in the way. Maybe she'll teach me to cook it.
I'm sorry about the violence outside.<eos> But you should know... I can't let you go.<eos> I can't.<eos> Khatun had fed me a mystery.<eos> I couldn't understand it, but I could feel it inside me. A clue, a bomb, a Hail Mary.
I know, why do we always try to understand?<eos> The future is dark.<eos> Not dark, like, bad.<eos> Just dark.<eos> You can't see it.
You're the useless bugger who got lost in the first place.<eos> You don't even have a map. Where's our map?<eos> Don't need one.<eos> I know where I am.<eos> Probably couldn't even read it anyway.
- I liked the guy with the hat.<eos> Why don't you ask him for a pint?<eos> Maybe he'll let you tap his winkie.<eos> Hey, none of these guys had any energy?<eos> It's about him feeling it.
You see this as a curse. I see it as a gift.<eos> - You think this is a gift?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To be at the whim of a force that's trying to destroy me?<eos> Only because you resist it.
A 15-kilometer perimeter around Arkadia should be sufficient.<eos> 15 kilometers?<eos> Sir, there's a Grounder village.<eos> Which will, no doubt, be the staging area for a retaliatory attack.<eos> Clearing it will be our first order of business.
Hey, sorry. We need that jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Why? You shooting a scene with it or something, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it? Just let me wear it a little longer.
I know you have parishes, flocks and temples making enormous demands on your time.<eos> But I'm sure you appreciate also that great masses of humanity look to pictures for information and uplift and, yes, entertainment.<eos> Now, here at Capitol Pictures, as you know, an army of technicians and actors and top-notch artistic people are working hard to bring to the screen the story of the Christ.<eos> It's a swell story.<eos> A story told before, yes, but we like to flatter ourselves that it's never been told with this kind of distinction and panache.
I'm not saying only writers are being exploited.<eos> I mean, look at yourself, Baird.<eos> The studio takes pretty good care of me.<eos> What are you, a child?<eos> I think what Herschel's trying to say is, just because the studio owns the means of production, why should it be able to take the money, our money, the value created by our labor, and dole out what it pleases?
Okay.<eos> You win.<eos> Again.<eos> Uh, we did make a deal.<eos> And even though I was under duress at the time, I will stick to it.
And they weren't there when we first cordoned it off.<eos> I gave her a bracelet.<eos> I didn't want it to get lost.<eos> OK, so if that's true, where is it?<eos> I couldn't find it.
Is that what I am?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is how - you manifest guilt.<eos> If you didn't have it, you wouldn't have lost the money, you wouldn't be punishing yourself.
In fact, it's all rather boring here.<eos> As ever, with love, Vanessa.<eos> She has told her story.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Did the doctor believe it?
That should buy a lot of ice.<eos> The map?<eos> Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist.<eos> Claimed it allowed her to track demonic presences.<eos> I don't have it.
I'll tell you what.<eos> I was gonna have Howie and Russell here beat the crap out of you, but for old times' sake, I'll let you leave in one piece.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know I had that map.<eos> But once I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it somewhere safe.
And do you remember when my mother almost left Daddy because he funded your campaign?<eos> That's how much she hated you.<eos> But I didn't care, because I saw something. I saw a future.<eos> Our future.<eos> We had a future until you started destroying it.
Ms. Thawley, are you willing to testify on your own behalf?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> And do you understand that you will have to answer all the questions truthfully, regardless of your feelings, and that failure to do so is punishable by law?<eos> Yes, Your Honor. I'm not afraid of telling the truth.<eos> I'm only afraid of not being able to tell it.
That's blame. It's not the truth.<eos> I told you this was gonna hurt.<eos> Try it again.<eos> What J.J. is doing for "Star Wars," that's what we're doing for "Everlasting."<eos> We're rebuilding this franchise so it can live up to its own headlines.
By the responsibility I will be charged with.<eos> But what humbles me the most is what I look at when I peer ahead.<eos> I look in front of me and I see a chasm.<eos> A great divide, tearing this country in half, north to south.<eos> You can ignore it.
We can't fight them like we used to.<eos> That's what they're hoping we do.<eos> We shoot first, give them the right to come at us with an army.<eos> And if we do that... you listen to me, lostie.<eos> This mountain is ours, but it don't come free.
Then you'd get Daisy back, and the three of you can live as one small, messed-up family again?<eos> - It's a last resort.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> I want your help.<eos> I need it.
Yep. This is...<eos> it was a big mystery. I was trying to figure out, like, how Felic...<eos> - Yeah. Ok. We have work to do.<eos> HIVE was behind the Havenrock explosion.<eos> They stole a cyber weapon called Rubicon and now are using it to commandeer the world's nukes, so we have less than 24 hours to stop it, or the world is going to experience the sequel to "Wargames."
And then I did.<eos> In a photo in a briefing room.<eos> And I was being sent to meet him with a gun.<eos> Before you ask, this isn't the one.<eos> Illegal, untraceable, no problem with using it on you.
It just takes time... and distance.<eos> No.<eos> I should wake up every morning and feel like this, remembering every drop of blood I spilled.<eos> Do you still have the memory machine?<eos> You used it on that Strucker kid.
That was the old me. This is the new me.<eos> And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.<eos> If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.<eos> If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.<eos> And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.
We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> On my way to the Larágan Consulate to return the bracelet.<eos> Alice, don't do that.<eos> Agent Dao is looking for it, too.
Do you speak English?<eos> You couldn't have told me before?<eos> You've just letting me rattle on like an idiot for the past ten minutes!<eos> "Sister Antonia hides the water."<eos> And she uses it to control the sick and the nuns.
I got it.<eos> Oh, that's not good.<eos> She's bleeding way too fast.<eos> Her metabolism must've increased to compensate for her Inhuman speed.<eos> Can you fix it?
Tell you what...<eos> Read the dosage on the package.<eos> Yes, they go by size.<eos> Get a tablet and hide it in her kibble.
As soon as I shut the shop, I bought a taxi.<eos> - Let's follow his example !<eos> - Joke all you want.<eos> I'm moving ahead, I've put my taxi license up for sale.<eos> - You haven't started paying for it yet.
This mountain is ours, but it don't come free.
He must wait for that brother to find him.<eos> Cannot stray too far, therefore.<eos> And like any human male...<eos> Any mammal, any wolf cub.<eos> He may seek comfort in where he found it before.
Involving the oil companies is the only shot we have at winning Republican support.<eos> Do you remember when we played beer pong and you let me win?<eos> The two of us were sitting right over there, in those two chairs, and you asked me for my advice.<eos> It was good advice.<eos> And you listened to it.
You're the kind of man this city needs.<eos> Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we all know this city needs help.<eos> Needs it now.<eos> Not tomorrow, not next week, not when the day comes, when the corruption that Wilson Fisk left in his wake is flushed out for good, and the police force is finally back on its feet.<eos> We need it now.
How did you survive getting shot six times by Jimmy Barnes?<eos> Is that your normal reaction to someone saving your life?<eos> - Investigating them?<eos> - When I see something I can't explain, yeah, I look for answers.<eos> Well, I've given you the answer, Detective. It's not my fault you won't accept it.
Mm-hmm. A drug dealer named Tommy Campolongo works out of there.<eos> Not that complicated after all.<eos> So you two will stay in a holding cell while I...<eos> That makes sense, that he'd have cash on him.<eos> But he's not gonna hand it over nicely.
Anything there remind you of the old case, Detective Dunn?<eos> Dead people and drug users.<eos> I can't believe the gun came back.<eos> - From where?<eos> - Sharon: We haven't located it yet, but we do have the heroin that we found in Tamika's car.
You got out of prison.<eos> You recovered the weapon from where you'd hidden it.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - You used it to kill Tamika and her baby, and you put it in his church to frame Reverend Price.
Hoping that it will look like Emile's revenge, I plant the gun in Reverend Copkiller's church.<eos> And this phone.<eos> You planted it, too.<eos> And that's important why?<eos> Because someone used it to call both Tamika and Emile right before they were murdered.
Relax, nobody's taking your mind today.<eos> We'll make something of you yet.<eos> I'll tell the school one more chance, probation.<eos> They'll respect my call.<eos> Don't make me regret it.
- No, but you can pay me.<eos> - Pay you?<eos> I'll take your ration card. That's what they were asking for.<eos> I could've just given it to them.<eos> Well, now you can just give it to me.
I don't want to leave this place standing.<eos> Agreed, but we have more pressing work at the moment.<eos> Where's the crate?<eos> - It's here. - You need to slow down.<eos> We cannot let it escape!
I want to sleep with your sister.<eos> I desire her to be my mistress.<eos> Have you asked her?<eos> I would like your permission... First.<eos> You have it. Of course, your highness.
They stick their heads up, I want us there.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Agent Pritchard, a word.<eos> Pritchard, I know some of these other agents are looking at you sideways for turning your partner and your boss in, but from where I stand, that was damn fine work.<eos> - You took an oath, and you defended it.
It'll open the door wide enough to trace the funds.<eos> Why is Helen mad at me?<eos> It's not my fault she picks lousy guys.<eos> Well, it's not like you were her role model or anything.<eos> Hey, I paid for your psychology major. I don't need it used against me. You and Helen both.
You won't be destitute forever.<eos> You just need to give me enough time to clear your name.<eos> I don't know if we'll meet again.<eos> I want to leave you with one last piece of advice.<eos> And heed it or live a life of unending peril.
He needs my help.<eos> I don't think there are any bullets in that gun. Why's that?<eos> 'Cause you would have shot your chain by now.<eos> This is what you're looking for.<eos> Connavers implanted their shield in me so I'd guard it.
Because Turtle's dead.<eos> Now, decide in return for your daughter's life.<eos> I will help you steal The Flash's speed.<eos> People think of tar now as mainly a roofing product.<eos> Fun fact: it's also been used as medicine and flavoring for candy and liquor.
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.<eos> Didn't your girlfriend just break up with you?<eos> - Yeah? - Pretty sure she just did.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> Wait, so if that app gives you eyes and ears all over the city, then why don't you use it to find the next Ms. Right?
I don't know.<eos> I mean, it's crazy.<eos> I found the one lady in the jacket; it wasn't your mom.<eos> Xander, that sick person...<eos> did you touched it?
You read my book.<eos> Stayed up all night.<eos> It was a great read, by the way.<eos> They should make a movie out of it.<eos> It was a mistake not to read it, and I'm sorry.
Now you tipped a wok full of hot oil on that reality chef, ***. I hear they call him Scarface now.<eos> I'm not here to talk about that. I thought we were here to talk about surviving on the inside.<eos> OK. If I ever go down, - what tips would you give me?<eos> - Well, it's all about power.<eos> Whose got it and who wants it.
- Well, it's all about power.<eos> Whose got it and who wants it.<eos> If you got it, what do you do to keep it?<eos> What parts of yourself will you shut down to stay on top?<eos> And if you want it, what are you gonna do to get it?
We don't need to talk about it.<eos> No, it's good.<eos> - It takes your mind off your brother.<eos> - I gave her my advice.<eos> She didn't like it.
I had my issues with Lindsay Denton, I can't deny that.<eos> But I wouldn't kill her.<eos> So you've said.<eos> I didn't have that gun.<eos> So if I didn't return it, why didn't anyone try and recover it?
It will last for a while.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - Wish him good courage.<eos> - Yeah yeah.<eos> Because wong kar-wai, we need it.
She's pretty shy. It's like touching a bare wire.<eos> More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt... dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.
I can't help but wonder if you think this should have been Juliette's child, not mine.<eos> I had a chance for a normal life with Juliette, and you gave that to me when you stopped me from being a Grimm.<eos> That wasn't exactly my intention at the time.<eos> Well, I know.<eos> But Still, we had a chance, and we didn't take it.
"Total war or nothing at all"?<eos> The moment I get in front of those cameras and I tell them that Conway is right and Brockhart is right, and that you completely bungled the ICO situation, how do you think Dunbar will do then?<eos> Can we get two Cobb salads in here, please?<eos> - I don't like Cobb salad.<eos> - Then you don't have to eat it.
You don't care about me.<eos> After what you did, I should hate you.<eos> But where does it get us?<eos> Check out the Telegraph.<eos> The strategy is working... if you let it.
I need more than I'm getting.<eos> You're supposed to tell me what people want.<eos> People didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time.<eos> I can get them to like the music.<eos> I can't compose it.
I got a hair connect who'll give us a great price if we pay in cash.<eos> Nice.<eos> Okay, but how do we actually clean the money?<eos> Make it legit? Babe, dope money is dirty.<eos> The good thing is that it's cash, which makes it untraceable.
It's your job to stay out of my way, down in Operations.<eos> You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office.<eos> Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
Raina, get out of there.<eos> I need to call this in.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office.<eos> Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
And?<eos> We processed it.<eos> Bomb was in the trunk, placed in the well under the spare tire.<eos> So it was hidden?<eos> Well, if you opened the trunk, you wouldn't have seen it.
You did manage to procure us some much-needed grain for your country, if it's any consolation.<eos> You were right, you know.<eos> I do want love in my life.<eos> Truthfully, who doesn't want that?<eos> But for me... as a queen... oh, I was lucky to have it once.
To pray. And I've heard that he'll be set free on next Eid.<eos> If you want, I can...<eos> May my God also bless him too.<eos> I Just got my identity back.<eos> Now I won't give it back.
I'll help... but on one condition.<eos> What?<eos> You don't let it go too far.<eos> Now your bond with Jace can withstand a certain amount of strain.<eos> But you have to promise me that you won't let it break.
Sana's all yours.<eos> You will have your meeting.<eos> I'll be in touch when I'm ready.<eos> We have to give him the care package.<eos> We need it to clear your name.
I just, uh...<eos> Eliza gave me the answer, apparently, and I lost it.<eos> "Fillory and Further, Book Six."<eos> And it was important, and it just vanished.<eos> So did you look for it?
You know, first, I just want to be clear.<eos> Richard might be about forgiveness, but I'm sure as shit not.<eos> Look, I'm sorry you and your mom had a shitty relationship, but not a day goes by where I don't feel terrible about what happened to her.<eos> I did not cause her death, okay?<eos> I only wish that I could've stopped it.
Jesus.<eos> You're doing time magic to change what you did.<eos> Yeah, but only a fluke natural-born time witch could do something like that.<eos> Now, I have done all the research there is, and one day, I realized I was looking at it wrong.<eos> We don't have the energy, but it's not that we need to generate it, because somebody already has it.
Also a piece of work.<eos> Ximena. (chuckles softly)<eos> Wait, you know her?<eos> He knows her.<eos> Boys, you cannot win this war, you can't even start it, unless you know who the real monsters are.
It's a... a request.<eos> This is one big field trip for you, isn't it?<eos> You-you-you wannabe.<eos> I've been to war!<eos> You just teach it.
I heard him getting up.<eos> I never should've let him go out so early.<eos> This isn't your fault.<eos> It's... the farm has been in Russ' family for generations.<eos> If he can't run it...
I escaped through tunnels.<eos> They let out in a cave somewhere in the woods, and... next thing I knew, you found me.<eos> Where is the cave? Could you find it again?<eos> Yes.<eos> But it's being guarded by something... terrible.
It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that if they want me to point the finger at someone, that means I'm holding a gun.<eos> It's still alive.<eos> Did you think I would let it die?
Yeah, we'll see.<eos> We'll start cracking it.<eos> That's not all, sir.<eos> There was another track buried in the song.<eos> No code, no attempt to hide it.
I'm afraid this can't wait.<eos> I'm officially giving you my letter of resignation.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Robert Zane made you an offer.<eos> He did, and as much as I didn't want to take it,
Kind of weird, right?<eos> It is kind of funky.<eos> Maybe we should put a pin in this.<eos> No, we continue with our wedding plans.<eos> From now on, working this case means that we don't let it take over our lives.
[Sighs] It's okay.<eos> I am officially... taking the pressure off of you, all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's this?<eos> You pull out the nice bottle of wine and then decide not to open it?
Americans died... servicemen and women... their children in that daycare.<eos> We moved on.<eos> I hope you do, too.<eos> Hey. Hey, did you give Shelby your 9/11 access card?<eos> - Yeah. - She used it to steal a witness immunity agreement from the files.
- Yeah. - She used it to steal a witness immunity agreement from the files.<eos> And we're sure that it has something to do with her parents.<eos> Our friend Spy-ris here overheard her talking on the phone with her mom.<eos> Yeah, but an old witness immunity agreement's useless.<eos> Unless she's using it to set them up, get them here before calling the feds on them.
Yeah, that's neat.<eos> Wait, you said Bobo has two skeletons, and the skull is part of one of them.<eos> Oh, she's trying to resurrect them!<eos> Where did you hide it?<eos> No, I'm not supposed to give it to anybody,
Belle doesn't know it yet, but... she's pregnant.<eos> And guess what.<eos> Remember him?<eos> You two had a contract.<eos> You tried to void it by killing him during a certain potentially baby-making liaison with your protégé, the Evil Queen's mother, Cora.
So I was hoping you might help me.<eos> You want me to work with you?<eos> When things go down, I get the call.<eos> There's work to be done, Zora.<eos> I can't do it myself.
I'll disarm the Magnetar.<eos> Destroy the Magnetar... Save the multiverse.<eos> One more thing.<eos> We need to agree.<eos> We all made this decision together, so if anything goes wrong, we stick with it.
We could go to the border, the river.<eos> Yeah, but people pressing in from both sides is dangerous.<eos> - But water.<eos> - That's why it's dangerous.<eos> Everyone needs it. Everyone goes there to feed.
We are not releasing the beta.<eos> We integrated the neural net a week ago.<eos> The platform is full of bugs.<eos> But that is what a beta is for.<eos> You give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.
I need to speak with Mr. Du Clark right now.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Mr. Du Clark's taken every precaution to make this a truly private party.<eos> The gate is on a timed release.<eos> I couldn't open it even if I wanted to.
Why?<eos> 'Cause my shit doesn't matter?<eos> Whoa. Hey. That's not what I'm saying.<eos> I was just -- it's one day.<eos> Look, I got a training session with Alvey so I can't miss it.
Finding someplace safe to disappear.<eos> I spent months moving my Emperor from one hiding place to the next, and you still found us.<eos> You're fooling yourself if you think those Mongol soldiers are the last ones to come your way.<eos> Our protection is your best bet.<eos> And if you want it, you have to earn your keep.
I've been wondering for a long time now... what's your plan for me?<eos> To be a shepherd to your flock.<eos> To tend to them and the church.<eos> But I failed at that.<eos> So why did you give me this power if... if I can't use it to save them?
Cat, how does it feel to be the most powerful woman in National City?<eos> Well, Sara, first of all, that's a total misnomer.<eos> Nobody is calling me the most powerful woman in National City.<eos> I believe they are calling me the most powerful person.<eos> Having a platform like mine is only worthwhile if I can use it to bring attention to the people who are really making a difference.
It's a meeting to discuss your family, Majesty.<eos> I felt it best that we formulate recommendations<eos> - before involving you.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want to discuss my family as well and what you have done to it.
No.<eos> No. Do you remember anything?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> It was the mask.<eos> I tried to take it off, but it wouldn't come off.
Somebody stole my cutout.<eos> Stolen?<eos> Damn it!<eos> Well, there's no point in replacing it because it's just gonna get stolen again.<eos> I can't replace it.
No one can see us here.<eos> I used the car's 4G to link up with the security cameras for the rocket.<eos> It's confirmed. There are three astronauts boarding.<eos> If we let this rocket take off, we'll be murdering those people.<eos> Yeah, if we don't let it take off, we will have effectively killed Linda.
This is who I am.<eos> You weren't always. Yes, I was.<eos> Even when I was a coward, I craved power.<eos> The only difference is, now I have it.<eos> And I won't let it go.
Rat poison?<eos> - Three Little Steps.<eos> - It's a Mexican rodent killer.<eos> 'Cause a mouse can only take three steps before it drops dead.<eos> You can't get it in the States anymore.
Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.<eos> I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.<eos> You dream different than me.<eos> It is kind of cute.<eos> Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.
I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.<eos> Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.<eos> Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.<eos> I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.<eos> Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?<eos> Good news. You're an asteroid.<eos> Uh... please tell me what to say next.<eos> Perhaps I should explain.<eos> While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.
And I appreciate that, sir.<eos> And your challenge is...?<eos> I-I want my next "Identity" to be about how a traumatic event in childhood can affect a person's whole life and how they deal with it when they grow up.<eos> And... And Buzz's story would be perfect.<eos> But he doesn't want me to tell it.
A mortician who can't come to terms with his own mortality? Eh.<eos> Bai's mask was used to get close to and execute three gang members.<eos> And then discarded.<eos> A Meng mask would suggest a fixation with the Snake Eye Boys.<eos> Perhaps he intends to use it to commit more murders.
Oh, my God.<eos> It was so much fun.<eos> Yeah, I bet.<eos> Look, I don't- - I don't think we should wait too long.<eos> I want another fight, and I want it fast.
It's not your fault.<eos> Nobody taught you any fucking manners.<eos> You know what?<eos> You should finish that fucking bottle.<eos> You're gonna need it.
Oh, good, she didn't see me kill the seal.<eos> But we did.<eos> We did it, friends.<eos> We cooked the perfect pork.<eos> Wish you could try it, but you're all dead.
Words are not my friend right now.<eos> India, Carson, this is what happens when you make poor life choices.<eos> She'll probably be homeless in a year.<eos> Is my purse here?<eos> I hope I didn't leave it in the Uber.
I'll see if this pattern is a match for any of the players' cleats.<eos> I suppose that means you'll be leaving little Roland with me.<eos> He seems much happier here.<eos> So this punter hits the ball into the woods off the tee.<eos> He goes looking for it and someone clubs him.
And when they kill, they follow a very specific ritual.<eos> Which is?<eos> They bury their victim up to the neck facing northeast towards a river, and they cut off their head with a katana and throw the head under a bridge.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> To leave the victim's soul in eternal peril, never allowing it to pass into the afterlife.
It is over, okay?<eos> Please do not tell the president.<eos> Everything we've been through. Do not give up on me.<eos> This job is everything to me.<eos> I lost it once. I can't lose it again.
We live in a world that is one world among many.<eos> The Beast you saw was from one such place.<eos> What does Jane have to do with the Beast?<eos> Still the same determined, little Jane Chatwin.<eos> Ember gave her the ability to fuck with time, and Jane used it to create a time loop.
I am unused to it.<eos> Too busy preparing for government.<eos> Now, luncheon.<eos> Sir Piers, what is your view of the railway?<eos> Fortunately, sir, I don't have a view of it here.
I know that there is a camp up in the mountains where you can send bad kids.<eos> No, it was my idea, too.<eos> I'm the one who set off the smoke alarm.<eos> I'm the one who bribed Lily with soda.<eos> I'm the one who put a red light bulb in the laundry room to give it a sexy vibe.
I'm not crazy!<eos> That was great.<eos> Just like I envisioned it.<eos> Connie cut our soda line.<eos> So we take a fish, and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar.
In here? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.<eos> What...?<eos> That was a good trick.<eos> Where is my wedding ring?<eos> Guess you're gonna have to look for it. Hmm...?
You won't believe unless you see it With your own eyes.<eos> I'm new to this, my lord.<eos> What is it you want me to do?<eos> Where's the wig?<eos> Do we really need it?
Oh, sure, you don't mind it flying around the rig, right?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Zooming about, and then... oh!<eos> And if I was an infant, I'd be dead right now.<eos> I don't leave it there when there are patients in the rig.
He got out about an hour ago.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,
Yeah, I know.<eos> That's what you keep saying. Go back to sleep.<eos> No way.<eos> Are you ever going to turn that page?<eos> I haven't finished it yet.
This is exactly the right environment.<eos> Alcohol and geeks.<eos> This is about us.<eos> I know, the calendar App is driving you crazy.<eos> We don't have to stick to it.
You sweet boy.<eos> You are too kind for this world.<eos> I wanted to make you tough, but I just couldn't.<eos> I couldn't bring myself to take that kindness out of you.<eos> I needed it in my life.
I'm infecting you now.<eos> Twilight, you have to stop looking at this as a bad thing.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> Magic turned you into something beautiful.<eos> The last time I tried to use it, it turned me into a monster.
How do you know about the magic?<eos> I can see things, feel things because I have magic, too and so does she, and so do our friends.<eos> Gloriosa, Timber wasn't wrong.<eos> Maybe you should stop using magic.<eos> Too much of it can be dangerous if you can't control it.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Come on, guys, delete the photos.<eos> Or what?<eos> Your mom and her fascist goons will hunt me down?<eos> Fascism is the direct opposite of a representative democracy, which you happen to be lucky enough to live in thanks to people like our mother who defend it every single day.
I think the flight's on time.You should check in.<eos> Thank you again. For all your help.<eos> I'd say it was my pleasure, but...<eos> You know you should go home.You can have that operation.<eos> Not just run and hide from it.
Feels good, doesn't it?<eos> The air here...<eos> She must be tired from the long journey.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> She'll love it.
I had to go.<eos> I had to get them away, somewhere safe and then get help.<eos> Did Corporal Allman ever ask for help? No.<eos> And you never offered?<eos> I didn't know he needed it.
Now this visionary development has only been made possible by your state government agreeing to sell the Crown land on which this centre will be built for the nominal sum of one dollar.<eos> Now the long-term benefits to the community and the state are huge.<eos> This project will create hundreds of jobs and leave a wonderful legacy for the people of the local community without relying on gambling.<eos> And if there's one thing NSW does not need any more of, that's poker machines.<eos> Yes, Mr Boccaro, your centre creates community. It doesn't destroy it.
And they say people don't change.<eos> But you're saying, Mike, that this currency was never distributed to the Sunnis?<eos> No.<eos> According to records, the Army personnel in charge of financial support were caught in an ambush and were ordered to torch the cash.<eos> And then it shows up here, where our victim uses it to tip a girl in a strip joint.
We could bring him up from holding And have him identify you in person.<eos> Fine.<eos> So what?<eos> I bought the gun.<eos> I needed it for protection.
This was all back at my hotel room.<eos> Hmm. 10,000 british pounds.<eos> that's a lot to be carrying around, isn't it?<eos> I'm on vacation, mate.<eos> Cash spends easier, and you can use it anywhere.
Double homicide seems like a bit of a stretch.<eos> - So maybe she's the witness.<eos> - You got an address?<eos> Nothing current, but she does have an EBT card.<eos> She uses it almost exclusively in Dorchester, including...
For all of us.<eos> I know.<eos> But I...<eos> You asked him for help.<eos> He's giving it to you.
Mr. Tacker, I promise you we'll talk about this later, but right now, our concern is your safety, so we got to get you up to surgery.<eos> No, no!<eos> Cut it off!<eos> - We'll talk later.<eos> - I want it off!
No.<eos> A-Arrest this woman! She is stealing blood and affecting the outcome of an officially sanctioned blood drive competition.<eos> I am curing Mr. Szathmary, breaking him of his blood addiction by forcing him to eat and drink so much that it makes him sick.<eos> I call it the "Blurred Lines Cure."<eos> You know, like when you heard that song for the first time and you were like, "I could listen to this song over and over again and never get sick of it," and then months later you're like,
Hodgins. I know you would have looked Into the evidence and understood<eos> That government forces are thwarting my investigation. I did look into the evidence.<eos> I also read everything i could About the body you found in france,<eos> The "scout" from the last heist, But nothing gave me cause of death.<eos> Well, that's because we could not determine it.
No, but no more ghosts either.<eos> Well, i guess we'll never know.<eos> You know, i wouldn't have believed it either, And then after lance died, I saw him, and he was telling me to move on.<eos> And it really helped, so i wasn't trying to be funny Or flip, i just...<eos> If someone's trying To give you a message, i don't want you to miss it.
He's needed immediately. No.<eos> A surgeon's no use.<eos> Only blood can save me now.<eos> I haven't the heart to take their blood.<eos> No, Mistress, no need to take it.
And were you not to print fact, Miss Costello, well, I need to ask myself why that was.<eos> Care to share, Mr. Dove?<eos> All in good time, Mr. Shine.<eos> Despite our sternest efforts, neither myself, Inspector Drake, nor Captain Jackson could break down the iron grill, which Inspector Reid had locked behind him.<eos> He would not open it and set about the suspect, Mr. Buckley.
Jesus Reid.<eos> Horace Buckley, they have everything.<eos> Oh, Mathilda.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> He Would not open it and set about the suspect, Mr. Buckley.
I need my napkin.<eos> Huh?<eos> Under your drink, that's my napkin.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> God, don't tear it.
We think he's abusing Alison.<eos> And if you don't go check on her right now we will file a complaint against Dr. Rollins... and you.<eos> Against me?<eos> On what grounds?<eos> For having knowledge about the situation and neglecting to do anything about it.
You forget I was the dirt-poor Italian who took on Mrs. Bligh and won.<eos> Your point?<eos> I can beat you too.<eos> It's a shame we're at odds.<eos> We've both fought for love, and... we're both ready to defend it.
Chan Gyu, listen to me carefully.<eos> You don't work because you want to.<eos> It's work, because you hate it.<eos> If you like to do something, then that's called a hobby.<eos> Work is work, so you must do it, even if you hate it.
We worked together a long time.<eos> I know you and your stupid macho front.<eos> Why don't you just admit it?<eos> All right, so maybe I was a little scared, but I wasn't taught to deal with death.<eos> All right? I was taught you do everything you can do to avoid it.
When you first appeared on the scene six years ago, the evidence suggests it was the work of a single man.<eos> It was a uniquely destructive force.<eos> Other serial bombers-- like Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky-- they were motivated by a misguided grudge against society, but the Bensonhurst Bomber was driven by something darker.<eos> He's not seeking revenge, he just has a passion for making things go bang.<eos> But the thing about passion is it can be taught, it can be learned.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'll let the Sheriff know that you're about to leave.<eos> Hey, Doc.<eos> Yeah? Thanks for the kindness.<eos> I don't get too much of it these days.
Pro Bono, I might add.<eos> Yeah, we, uh, we firmly established that I won't be getting paid, so why don't we christen this lady, and get her out on the water?<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> Although I do have to admit I am perplexed by the name that Kamekona has chosen for her.<eos> I didn't pick it, Doc.
He's very handsome.<eos> And you have a rabbit bracelet, too.<eos> You must really like rabbits.<eos> My mommy gave it to me.<eos> She said I should never take it off.
She was killed when the empire came.<eos> I couldn't save her.<eos> I was as helpless then as I am now.<eos> I couldn't show her the future she wanted.<eos> True power is not something that is found by those who seek it.
Hey.<eos> Where's your wedding ring?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Um... I had it on when I got here.<eos> You didn't put it in your locker?
- Because it doesn't.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It doesn't work, but we've got a whole hour to change that and blindside them.<eos> One hour.<eos> What if we can't fix it in time?
That's what I used to do as a child.<eos> Lay out my mother's clothes on her bed, in her shape, imagine she was there.<eos> It aroused me.<eos> When I was a wee bit older, 12, 13, whenever I could, I would obtain female underwear.<eos> I'd use it to masturbate.
Why?<eos> Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?<eos> No. I haven't needed to, thank God.<eos> Thank God you haven't had it used against you.
You need a line, a rationale, a story you can tell yourself.<eos> It doesn't matter what it is, it doesn't even have to be true so long as you believe it.<eos> So long as it allows you to forgive yourself.<eos> Find that line.<eos> Find it, grab ahold of it, and use it to pull yourself up and out of the darkness.
I was married to the man for 25 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that didn't work, so I'm just saying, don't poke him.<eos> I'm not gonna poke him.<eos> Your speech is an abomination!<eos> You haven't heard it yet.
Sweet. Why... why even think about it?<eos> - Just do it.<eos> - He's got a vagina, kind of.<eos> What, like a real vagina, or he acts like a pussy?<eos> No, no, like a real, live vagina, except I'm not supposed to call it that because the vagina's, like, a fuckin' nonfactor.
Me, for... for instance.<eos> Hey, it's incredibly generous. But, no. - I can't do it.<eos> - Our money no good?<eos> No, you're money's too good, okay?<eos> Which why I would never wanna put it in jeopardy.
Oh, shoot.<eos> E-mail from Professor Donaldson.<eos> Feedback for my novella.<eos> Here we go.<eos> She likes it. What?
Baby steps.<eos> Another Giada sandwich ready for pick up!<eos> Hi!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi, I'm Giada, and I hear you created a sandwich named after me, and all my Twitter followers say I have to try it.
Yeah, he's trans.<eos> Taking testosterone apparently gives you a giant clit.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> So, does he have a vagina or no?<eos> No, he does. He doesn't call it that, though.
Because they're lonely.<eos> HE SIGHS<eos> You don't have to be lonely.<eos> All right, Niska, we're going to change the test and play you some music.<eos> I want you to tell us what you experience as you listen to it.
- Commander.<eos> - Sergeant.<eos> I cannot imagine how difficult this must be.<eos> I want to express my deepest sympathies.<eos> But because of the personal nature of this case, I can't have you or your unit actively investigating it.
Do you think, you could... finish what you're doing before we continue having this conversation?<eos> Woman from the museum of Bhutan, she's convinced the scroll exists, right?<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> - So why call you?<eos> Well, she has evidence that it was... in a temple somewhere in the mountains, but they can't locate it.
You're a genius.<eos> Always know where the reserves are.<eos> Let go of your past.<eos> - Bit on the nose.<eos> - Now is the time to let it go.
I feel very lucky.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio and then I tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you.<eos> Just don't put it pride of place when Dad, well, when they come over.
- You're in danger. - Aren't we all?<eos> You know in the alternate reality it was the destruction of Eos 7 that started the war.<eos> And you think the same thing will happen here?<eos> We think Ferrous smuggled a bomb on board.<eos> Three and Six are searching for it now.
You were kind to me, even after you found out I was not human.<eos> I don't want you to die.<eos> - Then deactivate the bomb.<eos> - I can't.<eos> It's inside me, but I have no control over it.
So what's that to her?<eos> It was her husband!<eos> He was naked.<eos> Waitjust a moment.<eos> She had me bring the dress back, says it brings bad luck.
It's not your fault what happened to Cricket.<eos> You don't control everything, Deb.<eos> I should have protected her.<eos> What happened to her can't be undone.<eos> But there are other kids here that are gonna need your help, and they're gonna need it soon.
The cabin.<eos> - What cabin?<eos> - Holyoke's.<eos> The purified water... we used it to fight Malphas before.<eos> We can use it again.
Thank you.<eos> Um, well, I'm a big fan of yours, too.<eos> Although, I have to admit I've never actually used your app.<eos> - But your daughters have? - Yes.<eos> They have, and they love it.
We're kind of a messier species than the lankin is used to.<eos> It's so sad when we can't let go properly.<eos> In my world, love is a practical term, it's almost a business one.<eos> It means to combine what you have with what someone else has.<eos> It's the combination that means love, not the wish to do it.
I'm going to report it.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Listen, I'll go.<eos> Let me go. Kids, reload the gun.<eos> No, what if you need it?
Can you take this?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you think everyone who listens to the song is infected?<eos> No, but it's a very old song.<eos> - It's kind of odd to be using it.
I don't have my jacket anymore.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> That dude's wearing it.<eos> Okay, it doesn't even fit him!<eos> And I can't get it back because he doesn't know English.
Hey, wha-what did you put down my back?<eos> Could be a tarantula, could just be some yarn.<eos> I'll be at Milhouse's.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, it's such a pleasure to pour tea for someone and not have to help him chew it.
He's different.<eos> Asha, A.A. doesn't give you your one-year chip the first day you walk in there.<eos> They give it to you after you've been sober for a whole year.<eos> I don't know where he got this, but it's fake, okay?<eos> He didn't earn it, and he's lying to you.
Do you agree?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she's right.<eos> Maybe I can't do the job the way I used to, the way I should.<eos> Sometimes I find myself staring right at the truth without even seeing it, all because I don't want to see it.
Dangerous.<eos> See, originally, only one of the cufflinks was found.<eos> The other went missing the night of the assassination.<eos> Now, Robert Lincoln searched the President's box himself. But the second cufflink was nowhere to be found.<eos> He spent a considerable amount of time and money searching for it... over 50 years, in fact.
How does that help me?<eos> It doesn't. It helps me.<eos> - Donna!<eos> - Okay, listen to me.<eos> If you really want my help, I'm gonna give it to you.
By tracking down some junkie witness?<eos> Drug user or not, Maria Gomez never had a chance to be heard.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my office.<eos> I'm not going anywhere!<eos> Not until you understand that if you are sorry for me, you wouldn't have taken this case on in the first place instead of using it to make a name for yourself.
I can see the way they look.<eos> I should get rid of all of them except for you.<eos> Then I would be working all day instead of playing - with this.<eos> The art never judges.<eos> I envy it.
Okay. So, in that high-security building is one of the Inhuman registration information servers.<eos> I'm aware of how my own agency operates, thank you.<eos> Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive with updated information to this location.<eos> I'm to steal her I.D. badge...<eos> So I can clone it and put a fake identity on top of it.
This is not finished yet.<eos> Look, I'm part of this team.<eos> And I refuse to be kept in the dark.<eos> I want to see the book.<eos> Well, I don't have it.
Craig Hawthorne, murdered by Wayne...<eos> Stop it or I'm calling the police.<eos> You'll note the chalk line on the sidewalk.<eos> It's exactly 50 yards from Vachs Geological.<eos> So unless I cross it, I'm not in violation of your restraining order.
She'll have an opinion and stick with it.<eos> The question is: will her opinion help or hurt us?<eos> I'd say help.<eos> Her last book purchase was Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In.<eos> - She gave it five stars.
Dad!<eos> That's right, I'm back!<eos> And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt of Kermit the Frog acting like a hip-hop guy.<eos> That's so dope.<eos> Don't put it on.
I isolated a strand of the virus from Mon-El's blood.<eos> Based on the protein code, I'm fairly certain the virus is from Krypton.<eos> A Kryptonian virus?<eos> How did Cadmus even get its hands on that? My blood.<eos> That's why they needed it. To get in.
These look angry.<eos> The cost of doing business.<eos> We've tried to grow aloe vera for such purposes, but it just doesn't thrive in a Midwestern climate.<eos> I've noticed that the belladonna flourishes, though.<eos> What do you use it for?
Pick up, hot... doll.<eos> The Sophie doll?<eos> Well, it's covered in hair so it'll pass as food around here.<eos> Just get rid of it.<eos> Sophie's constantly using it to criticize me, so I disconnected her app.
The carrot?<eos> R-Right.<eos> Right, right. Well,<eos> I like this music.<eos> I've been listening to it all afternoon.
We traded info.<eos> He wants to hang. Good.<eos> You boys should hang out.<eos> It'd be good for you to spend a little time in the old hood, too.<eos> If you miss it so much, why'd we leave?
- Where...<eos> - Now, yo!<eos> Yo, how am I supposed to get back home, then?<eos> This upstanding citizen is John Baker, aka Boogie.<eos> He used to work for Valley Star Cable, which is how he managed to steal a van and use it for his break-in crew.
it's closed for the day.<eos> I'm on the lock!<eos> Somewhere in this vicinity is a very specific location that can only be seen from this building through windows and non-opaque glass.<eos> But even without a direct shot, the bullet can still pinpoint a geographic target.<eos> The bullet will get where it's told to go.
Guess your guy will have to wait.<eos> There'll be no video.<eos> They're keeping your name off the log.<eos> We've got one shot.<eos> Don't waste it.
Sí.<eos> - I have a first aid kid--<eos> - Good, good.<eos> Show me.<eos> - He needs it right now. Right now.
Yeah, it's me.<eos> Take it down.<eos> No, I'm not taking it down.<eos> There's someone luring people with that app, and then killing them.<eos> You shouldn't be on it yourself.
All right, the Agency's still waiting confirmation on Mr. Crawford's activity.<eos> This is real, people.<eos> And since this is real, say hello to your get out of jail free pass.<eos> This is an endorsement card.<eos> Should you run afoul of local law enforcement, given your illegal activity, you can use it to have your slate wiped clean.
And I wasn't in James's good books, either.<eos> Clarkson!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I want the steering wheel back, you muppet!<eos> -I haven't got it.
No, no, I-I can't.<eos> These people, they'll hurt me.<eos> We can protect you.<eos> What about the heroin?<eos> I need it, you know that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he's right.<eos> Apart from me and him, you have whole areas of your life unaccounted for.<eos> Oh, they're accounted for. Just maybe not accurately.<eos> This coming from a man who spent a decade as a voluntary witness for murder.<eos> I record history, I don't make it.
I noticed. Maybe Dr. DeLuca...<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> This artery that will allow this woman to survive.<eos> I'm not putting it in the hands of a first-year intern who hasn't taken out a tonsil.
Gustus always saved me.<eos> Did you catch scarlet fever as a boy?<eos> - I did.<eos> - So did I. Caitlin too.<eos> Now what that means is that once caught, we cannot catch it again.
Did we get anything out of him before he died?<eos> He wasn't very cooperative.<eos> I get that he wasn't cooperative.<eos> You asked for the authority to interrogate him.<eos> I gave it to you.
General, you'll be detained - until we can verify your story.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> You have a serious problem.<eos> And while you may not ask for my help, it's here if you want it, sir.
I can save a life... Yet can't mend a heart.<eos> My husband is hopeless.<eos> "If I don't travel to hell, who will?"<eos> Death is the fairest thing in the world.<eos> No one's ever gotten out of it.
Reade, and Zapata.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> They won the auction.<eos> Nas used the money from Lynn Burton's offshore account, 20 million in total, although that's just the first half.<eos> Marconi will be expecting the second half as soon as they get there, and they do not have it, so they're gonna need some serious backup.
I know the feeling.<eos> Look, I just want to spend as much time with you as possible.<eos> That's why I came here in the first place, and I... well, I just feel like I m-made things worse.<eos> Yes, you-you definitely did.<eos> But you also helped me realize that, no matter how much I care about my job, I don't want to sacrifice the rest of my life for it.
Oh.<eos> Well, there's a resemblance.<eos> My mother did love The Nutcracker.<eos> He apparently came from a family of con men.<eos> The Balthazar identity was like a family heirloom passed down to anyone who needed it.
Quiet.<eos> They're right outside.<eos> - They're gone. - Let's just assume we all make it to the end of this video game.<eos> How do we destroy a bio weapon without setting it off ourselves?<eos> It's really not like you can just unplug it.
It's really not like you can just unplug it.<eos> Biological weapons are alive.<eos> Raise the temperature high enough and you kill what's inside it, bacteria or viral.<eos> This bunker should have enough supplies to jerry rig a blowtorch.<eos> The best part, if we do it right, terrorists won't even know their weapon is fried till they try to use it.
And you like power, don't you?<eos> Well, I only like it because it allows me to do good things.<eos> Really?<eos> I think I've used my power rather well.<eos> For example, I've used it to unite all the small, squabbling kingdoms of england into a single entity, now capable of defending itself against any who might come to threaten or destroy it.
Why would you do something like that?<eos> That was before we started hanging out.<eos> You haven't asked out a girl since the Blood Moon Ball?<eos> That's way more embarrassing than that thing on your neck.<eos> How do I get rid of it?
That was before we started hanging out.<eos> You haven't asked out a girl since the Blood Moon Ball?<eos> That's way more embarrassing than that thing on your neck.<eos> How do I get rid of it?<eos> Just let it run its course.
Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.<eos> Why can't there be four wheels?<eos> Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?<eos> Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing. Thank you.<eos> If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.
If there's nothing else, I got to catch a plane to Indiana.<eos> Fly safe.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> You're gonna watch the execution?<eos> No, I'm gonna stop it.
Probably because it didn't exist.<eos> There's no proof that memo wasn't just made up.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Nina kept a copy.<eos> Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?
Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.<eos> He said If I was gonna roll with SBK, I had to be strapped up.<eos> So I took it to Whitlock, and I told him I didn't want it.<eos> He said it would be too suspicious if I didn't keep it.
It still doesn't feel real.<eos> But she'd want me to keep going.<eos> Ethan, I'm here because my colleagues are with your father at his apartment.<eos> The gun that was used to kill your mother and Dr. Krieg is registered under his name.<eos> The police are searching for it right now.
This was a daring and difficult escape, but despite all the planning, he was soon re-apprehended.<eos> That leaves our last two stories, Balloon Escape and Oflag.<eos> And both those escapes get a 10 out of 10 for degree of difficulty.<eos> Secretly designing and building a hot air balloon under such conditions is an incredible feat.<eos> And so is coordinating an elaborate escape from a POW camp while filming it!
Oh, come on, Guv. Give it away.<eos> -Come on, Guv. Give it away. -Come on, Guv.<eos> -Come on. -Give it away.<eos> Guvnor, let's go.<eos> They're so close to the loot, they can almost taste it.
I would like a glass of water."<eos> But Tom kinda sat with his leg up like this.<eos> In Arabic culture, you never expose the sole of your shoe to somebody.<eos> That's not a done thing.<eos> [Loney] Tom holds his leg so that he can't knock it down.
Well, it has a mathematically proven perigee.<eos> So, based on his calculation, it will pass by Earth in the winter of 1981.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - No.<eos> No, it did not, but, that didn't stop him from looking for it every year.
Not for the first time,<eos> Ella actually felt pity for these two schemers, who could be every bit as ugly within as they were fair without.<eos> My prince!<eos> But I will be his queen!<eos> If her stepmother would not have a fourth dress made, it seemed to Ella that there was no reason why she would not try to run it up herself.
What possessed you to write another one?<eos> Well, my wife was dying.<eos> You were estranged, weren't you?<eos> Well, yes, but on her deathbed, she urged me to write another book.<eos> Knowing that she would never have to read it? Well...
He asked me to be a character reference for you.<eos> The first thing I tell the judge is look out for the lies. Look out for temporary insanity. Look out for self-defense.<eos> How's the book, Mike?<eos> How are the sales?<eos> You didn't have to finish it. But you did.
Is it any good?<eos> I mean, there's a song.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's, like, one song. At least one, or part of one, but she definitely knew nothing about it.<eos> - And you don't get to hear it?
Let it spread out.<eos> Away from your body.<eos> Until it fills the entire room.<eos> Move this ball of energy to the field outside.<eos> Once it's outside, let it expand.
So he's not gonna die?<eos> Not from poison.<eos> Be a dear and get me some rags and water, would you?<eos> Look, the bullet is still in there.<eos> If we don't get it out and the bleeding doesn't stop she is gonna die.
I didn't cut it up or anything.<eos> It was like planting a chocolate flag.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind completely during this pregnancy.<eos> Pregnancy is nuts!<eos> You can either let it drive you crazy or just relax and enjoy the ride.
What's happening to me?<eos> Something's wrong<eos> Sure, something's wrong<eos> But sir, this job is all I have<eos> I don't want to lose it, sir
- It's a new kind of war.<eos> Yeah, if it doesn't exist, very new.<eos> What about the Rosenbergs?<eos> They stole the atom bomb.<eos> They didn't steal it off a fucking camera truck.
Not the ending you were expecting, I realise that.<eos> But it's still a story worth telling because he gave it a go.<eos> And that's what matters.<eos> Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay.<eos> Love isn't love till you give it away.
Which summoning spell should we employ?<eos> This book contains the best I know.<eos> It is the spell you used to summon Maria Absalom.<eos> This is my book.<eos> I could not destroy it utterly, Mr Strange.
I will get back to you as soon as I can.<eos> Lynn.<eos> It's Brian.<eos> I wanted to leave a message for my little boy. For Christopher.<eos> Please don't erase it.
And if we want to enable this... this true crypto-anarchic future, anyone who's working on that, I think, has to reckon with the fact that... they're going to be enabling really nasty things along with this kind of information freedom revolution that they're taking part in.<eos> By August 2012, business was booming.<eos> The Silk Road had become a thriving, anonymous and unregulated black market.<eos> The Internet being used in this way, posed a major threat to the government, greater perhaps than selling drugs.<eos> Even as a law enforcement officer, I still wouldn't know where to go and buy crack on the streets or buy heroin, but I do know how to go online and find it.
To Captain Low.<eos> He paid 90 pieces for it.<eos> - Why would you do...?<eos> - Why wouldn't I?<eos> Valuable information walks in the door, I should let it walk out?
How do we know there are any fairies still left on this island or that they'll come help fight just 'cause they see him fly?<eos> You have to trust us.<eos> Why should we?<eos> You certainly don't trust us.<eos> There's a map to the fairy kingdom. We guard it with our lives.
Thanks.<eos> You know, things are really starting to look up for me, which is good, 'cause track trials are starting up in the spring, - and I'm ready to kick a little ass. - Yeah.<eos> Well, after transplants, it can take months to fully recover - and get used to your new immune system... - Yeah.<eos> If not years.<eos> Hey, if there's someone out there willing to help me get a second chance, then I'm not gonna waste it.
Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world.<eos> Well I don't know 'bout all that. But I'll tell ya what it is.<eos> It's hot and it's strong and it's good.<eos> And in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up.<eos> You don't need to sell it, minnie, you need make it.
Ye recall?<eos> Aye. So tell me, brother, what's a man's word worth these days?<eos> A bag of gold, perhaps?<eos> My oath to you is an oath to Scotland.<eos> I've not broken it nor will I ever.
She was married before.<eos> But I've lain with no one.<eos> I want ye...<eos> To be the first and only one to have me.<eos> No, I made a vow, and I'll no break it.
I have a cabinet full of potions and medicinals.<eos> I need some peppermint, my dearest.<eos> I have something to offer ye.<eos> I made a vow.<eos> I won't break it.
I know what you're thinking.<eos> "That's impossible.<eos> How could it be 4028?<eos> How could we have skipped so much time?"<eos> But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state which allows it to survive all winter long without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
Not necessarily.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> The navy hasn't made its case yet.<eos> The navy isn't going to make a case.<eos> The navy will do whatever Parliament tells it to do.
A coworker gave it to me for my migraines.<eos> Which I still get from time to time.<eos> And it's in the freezer because I read... that helps it maintain its potency.<eos> Dad is very efficient, even with his stash.<eos> I haven't even tried it.
'They were promised a life of sunshine, blue skies, 'and endless opportunity.<eos> 'The truth was otherwise.<eos> 'And the only consolation is that hope made them happy, 'for a while.'<eos> 'Joy is not felt less exquisitely because the moment flies.<eos> 'And if we can taste it, we know that we are blessed.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> Look, the news moves so quickly, we'll have a new iPhone or the Chinese will be in Chicago.<eos> - Amy, can I talk to you a sec?<eos> Doyle's using "Every Breath You Take" for his walk-on music.<eos> He loves that song. He got married to it both times.
Didn't you read the packing list?<eos> - What's that?<eos> The packing list for your parents.<eos> - My parents don't speak German.<eos> So why didn't YOU read it?
I've had bigger flowers than these.<eos> And with ribbons on.<eos> These don't compare.<eos> Music.<eos> How are people supposed to avoid it?
Yeah, but it's a day I thought was behind me.<eos> I should have known our little beast hiatus was too good to be true.<eos> Hey, where's the cane?<eos> Goodwill.<eos> I decided somebody else probably needs it a little more than I do.
Maybe you don't know this, but the mistreatment of animals is a federal crime.<eos> Is this funny to you?<eos> They can bring formal charges against you, and you could lose your job.<eos> Do you not need your job, Santiago?<eos> Yes, I need it.
See, this is primal, caveman stuff.<eos> Listen, I think Dre and I are way more evolved than that.<eos> Don't you remember why you fell for him in the first place?<eos> Give me the mustard.<eos> I'm using it.

This is a new era, Mr Vedder.<eos> The parts only need to be transported here by ship or train to be assembled.<eos> Are you hearing me?<eos> I made you a higher offer.<eos> Do not reject it.
Mt. Fuji.<eos> Melon bread.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that gun real?<eos> Why didn't you use it back then?
Uh, maybe we should all just take a breath.<eos> We got these guys contained.<eos> We can find them right now.<eos> Well, or they'll see the cops running around and the helicopters flying, and they'll go into hiding.<eos> No, when you're hunting a wounded animal, you don't just start chasing it immediately.
Ron, what are you doing?<eos> I know I saw it.<eos> Detonator.<eos> The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.<eos> I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.
Nothing's worked.<eos> We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago.<eos> Raccoons ate the wheels right off it.<eos> Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and ten years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.<eos> Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name: Beachview Terrace.
It's a sprain!<eos> I know, because I created sprains.<eos> And migraines. That was me too!<eos> - Give me morphine.<eos> - Sir, we don't just hand it out.
Terrific.<eos> Beautiful card I have for you.<eos> A beauty, a doll.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - I don't need it.
Beautiful, what have you got?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Your skin looks like it will be very soft.<eos> You know, like a peach or a baby pig's belly.<eos> I aspire to put my hands on it and to inhale your hair.
About the guy who used to live in my apartment before me...<eos> Rudy Walters?<eos> Do you have a forwarding address?<eos> No, thankfully, or I'd have to mail back his security deposit.<eos> He didn't try to get it back?
She got it off this website for "proactive parents."<eos> That's what they call themselves...<eos> Get together and talk about being awesome parents.<eos> I opened it once, but it felt wrong, like, greasy in my head.<eos> Everyone else was using it, and the more they used it, the more they focused, and the more they focused, the more their wishes came true.
And another thing.<eos> I am so sick of you stealing my joy, but that's changing, too.<eos> My joy doesn't come from my friends.<eos> It doesn't come from my job.<eos> It doesn't even come from my husband.
And three themes emerged, weird.<eos> Passionate and gross.<eos> Now you want to hang onto that grouping.<eos> In marketing, it's what we call the Good Belushi.<eos> If I had a magic wand, I would use it to make sure Greendale never had to grow up.
You got him to sweep the floors, remember?<eos> Boy called Michael stole a card.<eos> Well, could it have been this one?<eos> He said he'd found it.<eos> But he never actually handed it in.
I looked completely daft but I was just doing what I thought she wanted.<eos> I don't think anyone believed me but I stuck to my guns.<eos> Training for the future.<eos> Do you know how she came by the card in the first place?<eos> I suppose, looking back, she'd taken it or been given it.
Just let him have one more piece.<eos> He's a growing boy.<eos> - Thank you, Charlotte.<eos> - You're welcome. The pizza is yucky.<eos> Doesn't look like you thought it was yucky.
- No, sir.<eos> I don't want to work with him.<eos> Our first job was to provide a cover... and create a background for our team.<eos> We floated a Gujarat based oil company overnight.<eos> And gave it 15 years of history.
I... apologise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He liked... football, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> I don't follow it myself, but, er... Southampton, is that right? They... they got promoted a while back?
Sir, come on and open up.<eos> I have a condition.<eos> I can't go outside or be exposed to what's out there.<eos> You were able to steal your neighbour's newspaper.<eos> I didn't steal it.
- Uh, thank you. - Awesome.<eos> Cheers!<eos> You know, Mac and Dennis aren't here-- they're not gonna ridicule us-- we get to just pick whatever we want to do.<eos> Well, you know I like making music.<eos> Yeah, and I like listening to it, but it hasn't really ever gotten us anywhere in the past, so, well, what about poetry?
Shipments are getting larger, more frequent, and now come with specialized parts,<eos> Including D.I.Y. kits to turn semis into fully automatics.<eos> All right, so, this has taken a lot of surveillance, time, and hard work, but we have a search warrant for Kozik's shop and arrest warrants for him and all of his pals.<eos> Today's shipment is due at 10:00 A.M.<eos> We'll watch for it and take them all down the second it arrives.
I'm hours past the deadline, and now I won't be considered for staffing the paper until November.<eos> And I write ten times better than anyone there.<eos> Maybe, but you still have a lot to learn about being a reporter.<eos> Because there's a great story here, Rusty,<eos> - and you didn't even notice it.
Maybe, but you still have a lot to learn about being a reporter.<eos> Because there's a great story here, Rusty,<eos> - and you didn't even notice it.<eos> - I noticed the story, Buzz.<eos> I wasn't allowed to tell it.
What else do you think she was lying about?<eos> The botched fuse... it's B.S.<eos> All the fires were lit the same way, both cities... jug and flare.<eos> Madness has a method.<eos> It doesn't change.
The past is never dead.<eos> But we are finished with each other.<eos> From now on, we will be strangers.<eos> You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.
You have as much interest in finding a cure as I do.<eos> You help me, and perhaps with what I learn, I can help you.<eos> I'll work as fast as I can and you can bury her in a few days.<eos> You won't cut her face?<eos> I'll protect it with my life.
I hope you're as well entertained as your wife.<eos> Or had you forgot her existence?<eos> Dangerous mistake.<eos> Absentee husbands make for wandering wives.<eos> If you wish to retain our favour, you'd do well to pay it attention.
[Sighs] I'm really glad that you caught Jason's murderer.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> And girl.<eos> You can show your gratitude by giving me my share of that thing when you sell it.<eos> And what if I don't want to sell it?
Because you wear a fuckin' hoodie.<eos> Pop.<eos> Yeah, no, no, no, no.<eos> He needs to know this. He needs to hear this.<eos> And you-- you take this sickness and you've used it for your own cynical gains.
- Hi. - Hi, Johnny.<eos> - Groceries in the kitchen.<eos> Johnny, will you watch your brother so he doesn't wander outside?<eos> All right.<eos> Bill, this suitcase is jammed, I can't seem to get it open.
We'll lose the war.<eos> You crossed the line.<eos> Mom.<eos> Their blood is on your hands, and even if we win,<eos> I'm afraid you won't be able to wash it off this time.
Go prove they aren't.<eos> They didn't give you any warning?<eos> Do they ever when they're passing out pink slips?<eos> What about Peter's adoption?<eos> They won't grant it if you're unemployed.
Daddy!<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> How was school? You don't have my bracelet.<eos> You know what, I had to use it.
- Let me see.<eos> - What?<eos> Stop!<eos> - Jane, cyanide poisoning stops the cells of the body from being able to use oxygen.<eos> That didn't happen, and that thing hurts my eyes, as it has the last four times that you've used it.
Okay, you can go.<eos> So, why did you leave Evony?<eos> Well, she had to face the music once and for all.<eos> Eros broke her heart.<eos> And instead of dealing with it all those years ago, I helped lock him up.
- a favor. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You okay?<eos> George, I... just had a talk with Meatball, and he told me about the job offer in Nashville.<eos> That was unnecessary.<eos> I... I already turned it down.
That end zone dance was sick.<eos> Yes, I love sports.<eos> You're gonna take my virginity tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> That crown I got from being prom king was so tacky, I hardly even wear it anymore.
If McPhee did find it, then why hide it?<eos> Why not claim the glory for himself?<eos> You said he was stricken with illness, and that he lost his family.<eos> Perhaps McPhee believed he had angered God by removing the holy relic from its rightful place.<eos> He could not bring it back to the Hagia Sophia.
When did I ask you for a pinch of snuff?<eos> ~ A moment ago.<eos> ~ Ah, good. Good.<eos> Well, do not trouble yourself.<eos> I do not need it now.
- I'm not Monica.<eos> I didn't slash my wrists over Thanksgiving dinner, I went for a drive.<eos> - You took a baby...<eos> - I took him for a drive.<eos> Yeah, I guess it was a really long drive and I didn't plan ahead, but I did not hurt that baby.
I will get to you later!<eos> "Run out on this bill, it comes out of our pocket."<eos> Hey.<eos> Emery, go get that onion.<eos> I'm going to cook dinner with it tonight.
A year?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, Loretta... Can I call you Loretta?<eos> You can, but my name is Lorraine.<eos> Lorraine, I have so much love to give, and I'm not wasting it on my husband anymore.
Ah! Well...<eos> Now that that's out of my system, let's grab some coffee so we can chat about your big TV debut.<eos> Hi.<eos> I didn't know what the traditional gift was for accusing of your boyfriend of murder, so I went with a plant.<eos> Don't kill it.
Even though you've been there before?<eos> Stanton!<eos> We have a note for Miss Robson, rather urgent.<eos> Would you mind taking it?<eos> I haven't got it!
- How did he die?<eos> - A lethal dose of morphine.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> All the wrestlers drink it.<eos> No, he didn't drink it.
From the arm chair you were sitting in.<eos> Well, that's underhanded of you, Detective.<eos> It's only natural my fingermarks would be all over it.<eos> It's my syringe.<eos> I use it to inject morphine.
You can't bring more in?<eos> Not with the thinnies sealed.<eos> Then we need to find the stash William left here.<eos> William left a stash here?<eos> Mara was looking for it. She never found it.
"Troubles"?<eos> No, I-I don't remember calling them that, but... I remember my mom coming home with other people's jewelry.<eos> My dad said the ability ran in the family.<eos> What if it's in me?<eos> Just pray that it's not.
No, I-I don't remember calling them that, but... I remember my mom coming home with other people's jewelry.<eos> My dad said the ability ran in the family.<eos> What if it's in me?<eos> Just pray that it's not.<eos> I want to use it, Duke.
The statement of Aubry Taylor.<eos> This is the gun used to kill Matt Skokie.<eos> When Carter came back to the car, did he have his gun? Yeah, sure.<eos> "Yeah, sure" or "yes"?<eos> That's the gun. But Carter didn't use it.
- You want confrontation.<eos> - We want a fair examination.<eos> - What do we want?<eos> - Justice!<eos> - When do we want it?
Yes.<eos> Now walk fast.<eos> I am thirsty.<eos> Water please.<eos> Didn't I give it to you on Gardu's bike?
I just don't want things to get weird between us.<eos> - You want to keep the job, is that it?<eos> - Not... not if you want it.<eos> So, you're saying that you only want it if I don't want it?<eos> No, I-I don't want it if you... let's do this... um, count of three, we both say what we want, okay?
Her ex is back in town.<eos> He's a b... bouncer.<eos> I figured she'd... she sees me in the hood, she's got... she's got to take me s... seriously.<eos> Did you ransack my place looking for it?<eos> I need it, Destro.
The soldiers that came into my camp in Okinawa...<eos> The ones I killed.<eos> They were coming to surrender.<eos> I just didn't realize it until it was too late.<eos> I buried the flag before anyone else saw it.
Minos will never let us out of his sight.<eos> I know a way.<eos> How?<eos> Tonight's ceremony.<eos> I'm going to use it to escape.
- My tapeworm.<eos> - You have a tapeworm?<eos> - Yeah, he got a worm.<eos> - Yeah. Got a tapeworm.<eos> And you named it?
Go ahead. I'm curious.<eos> So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely. Oh, God.<eos> You realize you're coming off as, like, the world's biggest douchebag, right?<eos> So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right?<eos> I open it and blood's gushing from his mouth.
Just some stuff going down that's...<eos> Kind of got me spun out.<eos> Be good to talk to you.<eos> Well, I can't just send him to you economy comfort, now can I? The package is in the armory now.<eos> We gave it a lot number.
Look, you are merely facing what other men have met.<eos> - You know your poems? - Yes, sir.<eos> On your feet.<eos> Give me see it through.<eos> "When you're up against trouble, meet it face to face."
Awesome!<eos> A watch!<eos> We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.<eos> Yeah. It's shockproof.<eos> Oh, good. You can show it your grades.
This was your daughter ten minutes ago.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - For now.<eos> For $50,000 blackcoin, she stays that way.<eos> We're lucky he asked for a ransom... pay it.
I know.<eos> You want me to stop?<eos> No.<eos> If this is what you need to do.<eos> You're facing down your biggest fear and telling it to go to hell.
Is there any chance you could come?<eos> I wouldn't wanna get taken advantage of, you know, especially with the fuzziness.<eos> I'll say to you what I say to all of my clients.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> When you hear a noise, just accept it, and then let it drift away.
There are, like, four Asian girls in this prison and my girlfriend just died.<eos> - [breathing heavily]<eos> - Oh, so let them comfort you, then.<eos> Well, I can't go out there.<eos> When there's a revolution, who do you think it is that gets guillotined first?
So, why not simply connect that door to a generator and turn all that spinning into electricity?<eos> And it's not just revolving doors, either.<eos> Many of us have dogs and every day we take those dogs for a walk.<eos> A dog scampers hither and thither, running ahead and snouting under hedgerows.<eos> So why not attach it to a trailer like this?
A lot of what we do is based off of what she's done for many years.<eos> [Ms. Tootsie] Well, just here in Central Texas, I mean, that's all we know is barbecue.<eos> Long and slow is the secret, I think to brisket 'cause it is a tough cut of meat.<eos> It's a stringy cut of meat, so you have to be careful not to overcook it or cook it too fast.<eos> So it takes a lot of tender loving care with it.
Snap to.<eos> More often, though, same guy that chased her away through abuse, neglect, needs her back.<eos> And if and when she comes back, he's worse.<eos> Punishes her for leaving.<eos> We come around, check on the situation, but now she's too afraid to run again, so sometimes what we do is when we get a real hard fucking type, we get a carpet, roll the guy up in it,
(bones crack) (distorted): You are not deserving!<eos> Malcolm, I've secured the third Talisman.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> (grunts) "Don't fight the pain.<eos> "Surrender to it."
No.<eos> But let's go.<eos> God!<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> Yeah, so the robot works now, but would you really trust it out there on the streets of Manhattan?
I have to do something.<eos> At least let me get you a gun for your own protection.<eos> No, I don't need one.<eos> If we find out who he is, I can use my phone and hack into his life a million different ways.<eos> I can hack into his car and drive it off a cliff if I want.
Yeah, he mentioned that he was on parole.<eos> Man, Hayward.<eos> You won't happen to have his number handy, do you?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I just kind of drop it off when it needs fixing.
The roof supports have been destroyed.<eos> Not to mention the exposed insulation is a health hazard.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> This place has stood here for a long time.<eos> I'm sure it has a few more years in it.
What's the policy on moving her?<eos> They don't even want us talking to her, man.<eos> Well, I need her moved ASAP.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Not if I can help it.
Is this even the way to the Children's home?<eos> Right through those trees.<eos> No use cryin' over a lost shoe, boy.<eos> The Children's Home...<eos> What happened to it?
Things are really not looking good here.<eos> But I wasn't gonna be done. Not yet.<eos> I just took out my pocket knife...<eos> And as the dragon set upon me...<eos> I drove it home.
What's the matter with you this evening?<eos> That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.<eos> I glimpsed it once.<eos> I believe it is of Irene Adler.<eos> You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep
They got me a turtle!<eos> What do you say, sweetie?<eos> Thank you!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Honey, what are you gonna name it?
Brown recluse if I'm not mistaken.<eos> A spider that has climbed 13 stories so far without falling.<eos> Which, considering today's lovely breeze is most impressive, wouldn't you agree?<eos> Why does the spider climb so high?<eos> Is it striving to get to the top?
I see all.<eos> Yet...<eos> I didn't expect to find you.<eos> The anomalies of my creations are always so fascinating.<eos> Jason, you will stand beside me and you will help me cleanse this world and return it to perfection.
Claire's downstairs in the kitchen.<eos> Tell Jamie it's a trap. Where are you going, little mouse?<eos> Ah, let go of me, you brute, or I'll tell my godfather how you grabbed me.<eos> Stand and watch, Hugh.<eos> My personal favorite has you turning a broomstick into a poisonous serpent and commanding it to attack the comte, sort of like a latter-day Pharaoh and Moses...
And one other thing.<eos> He was to be gone in six months.<eos> But six months turned into six years.<eos> Turns out Mama was a miracle.<eos> She boxed that mean, old cancer... every day, giving it lefts, rights, uppercuts.
First it was a seed.<eos> You take care of a garden and it takes care of you back.<eos> You feed it, it feeds you.<eos> Few things in this world operate like that fair and square.<eos> It just needs a place to grow.
You think this is cute, don't you?<eos> You think there's a real connection there.<eos> So you feed it, you dress it up.<eos> But a cat doesn't care if you live or die as long as someone gives it Friskies twice a day.
I mean, it's... it's been a while, it's been a while.<eos> -Don't think about it.<eos> - Luke wants to know if that's your.. Horse is out back.<eos> - It is.<eos> - Can he give it some water? - Sure.
He conjured us into it.<eos> And who's more powerful?<eos> The one who made the storm or the one who convinced us into battle to defeat it?<eos> A man of his capacities, his state of mind becomes reality.<eos> We are subject to it.
Real love is always worth waiting for.<eos> Regal, strong, virile, aquiline.<eos> That's what I asked for.<eos> And this, this is what you give me?<eos> Did you just grab a cock from the body shop and jam it between his eyes?
Grief, wow.<eos> Um, the inevitability of loss.<eos> Life isn't a straight shot, my friends.<eos> It's full of hills and valleys.<eos> Confront your grief, your... your fear of it, and you'll take away its power.
This was her escape route.<eos> Choo!<eos> That's quite compelling.<eos> I'm just confused about one thing.<eos> If a ghost can pass through the wall, why does it need a passageway at all?
Dying for her beliefs and her God, true to herself no matter the darkness that gathered 'round her.<eos> It's said she sang on the pyre as she died.<eos> A tragic end.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> She heard a voice and believed it.
Medical issues.<eos> Do you know how he did it?<eos> He put the recorder in the cup to amplify my voice.<eos> It didn't just amplify your voice.<eos> It gave it direction.
Do you actually love her?<eos> I've lost count of the amount of times you've been there for me.<eos> No. No!<eos> I think you're far more affected by this world than you care to admit.<eos> You want to control it rather than allow it to control you.
- Why not?<eos> - I'll talk to the broker.<eos> I said, switch off your phone!<eos> Yes... and put some adhesive there...<eos> - What's happening? - And what about this leak here? He'll take care of it!
Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.<eos> Now, the jewel is enchanted by a spell that alerts the wearer to the presence of demons.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Magnus has longed to reunite with this necklace.<eos> Offer it to him.
He took the time to suture Will's incision and to bandage Zak's eyes, and these are acts of remorse and guilt.<eos> He dumped both victims in locations where they would be found so that the damage he inflicted might be rectified.<eos> However, the brutality on display in his latest attack points toward a looming devolution that will only make him more dangerous.<eos> And he is fixated on the festival.<eos> Yes. It provides anonymity.
But I knew enough to stare back.<eos> On our first date he found out I was scared of the woods.<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - He thought so, too.<eos> So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it."
- He's old and... he goes plop.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Mrs Durrell.<eos> Kostis.<eos> We're going to build a pond for it.
Okay, well, I've never even seen you study a lick, so let's just see if you get in.<eos> My ass is offended.<eos> Oh, yeah? Is it?<eos> Well, let me see it.<eos> I'll be sure to make it feel better.
Wonderful woman.<eos> Ina.<eos> One summer, my cousin came for a fortnight.<eos> He had an amazing pocket watch.<eos> It was handed down from our great-grandfather.
Sorry. I don't know of any.<eos> Thanks anyways.<eos> How did it happen?<eos> He had a dog.<eos> Oh. I wanted to give it a treat.
Jordan's pierced...<eos> Yeah, it's front and center on his sex tape.<eos> He had a sex tape? Aw...<eos> So innocent.<eos> It co-starred Zombie High's own Starlee Decker.
What could she possibly have done...<eos> Yes...<eos> When you go fishing, do you always know what you're going drag out?<eos> No.<eos> This ghost is fishing, it doesn't know what it'll pull out either.
You're what... Genesis' jailers?<eos> No, no.<eos> We're its custodians.<eos> We take care of it.<eos> You let it get away.
Please tell me you've had enough analysis to know that she's right.<eos> You were afraid of me.<eos> Now you're afraid of Non.<eos> I understand that fear.<eos> But we cannot let it drive our actions.
I'll try to contact Seoul.<eos> Let's go.<eos> How is he?<eos> He dislocated his shoulder.<eos> But the army surgeon put it back.
Can't access it wirelessly.<eos> Navigation?<eos> I can't override the autopilot.<eos> It's a closed system.<eos> Right, a plane only does what it's told.
Sir, a rebel ship that escaped the Horizon Base has entered the system.<eos> So that's why their fleet hasn't attempted to jump.<eos> They need fuel.<eos> Order our fighters to intercept that ship.<eos> Keep it from docking at all costs.
It's peasant food.<eos> That is ridiculous!<eos> Possibly in your country, not in mine...<eos> This is my country!<eos> Victoria, I seek only to serve it.
Gettrick's house. No.<eos> If he's as dangerous as you say he is...<eos> If I am right, he knows I have seen him for who he is and he'll already be gone.<eos> Listen, that thing in your head?<eos> You can't run away from it, Julien.
- I was wondering...<eos> - Yes, Agent Fitz?<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.<eos> Of course.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell.<eos> Barry, we can't just let Wally suffer in there.<eos> And besides, burying our head in the sand is not gonna make Alchemy go away.<eos> Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.<eos> You're gonna have to face it. Don't we?
Have they started yet?<eos> When this is over, I'm gonna be wiped out.<eos> You gonna help me carry my stool back up there?<eos> Here's an idea.<eos> Yeah, you say it, Han!
Emphasis on "pitch."<eos> It's a tuning fork.<eos> Why does the car keep making that infernal noise?<eos> Oh, it's reminding you to put your seatbelt on.<eos> Well, you can remind it that I'm immortal.
Just like you and me.<eos> So, Cade damned them in return.<eos> With his last breath, he let loose a psychic blast so powerful that it created its own world.<eos> Call it hell if you want.<eos> It doesn't matter what name you give it or whether you believe in it or not.
Yes, because she betrayed them after they brought her to meet the Man in the High Castle.<eos> You have proof of this?<eos> Erich, could you, could you give us a moment?<eos> The medal behind your desk.<eos> Might I examine it more closely?
Vote for the war!<eos> An infection of extremism.<eos> An infection that pursues purity and believes it's better to burn down the government and start over than to compromise even one iota.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> Since when can the government just do what it wants?
Right, and just like any computer, it can be upgraded with new software but it can also be hacked-- made to do whatever the hacker wants it to do.<eos> Like accelerate instead of brake?<eos> Yeah, in this case, exactly.<eos> Somebody overrode the accelerator module wirelessly.<eos> Told it to keep going faster.
It's Imperial.<eos> It's trying to transmit.<eos> I can't hold it! Got it.<eos> I got it!<eos> Think it got a signal out?
We used to run these drills, sneak and peek.<eos> You mean he had a fake I.D.?<eos> Yes. Very well-executed.<eos> Totally legitimate-looking.<eos> At first glance, even at second glance, it was...
- You can't go next.<eos> Why can't I go next?<eos> Whilst James toasted his success with some more drink I won the argument and prepared for launch.<eos> Why is my car at this angle?<eos> Well, maybe because there's a massive V8 hanging out the back of it.
I'm fine.<eos> And endurance exercises can unravel even the strongest psyche.<eos> I knew you'd rise to the occasion.<eos> The pain will fade.<eos> You know what'll help it fade quicker?
-We must accept their superiority!<eos> -Amen!<eos> Because only the Process can save our world!<eos> Amen!<eos> And those who stand against it will perish in the cruelest of hells!
Now's not the time.<eos> Chopper!<eos> Right. Let's get off this ship.<eos> And be careful. That sentry droid's still around somewhere.<eos> Let it go by.
And be careful. That sentry droid's still around somewhere.<eos> Let it go by.<eos> Oh, oh, oh. Here we go!<eos> Take that! (SCREAMING)<eos> I told you to let it pass!
First of all, if the wind shifts you get drift.<eos> -One.<eos> -Secondly, it's such a slow descent, it gives your enemy ample time to just shoot your cargo out of the sky.<eos> So, the British came up with the idea that they would just strap rockets onto the cargo.<eos> That way it drops at terminal velocity and, at the last minute, ignites the rockets giving it a nice soft landing.
So, scams...<eos> We're gonna rank these based on how much they got away with, duration of the scam and originality.<eos> - I like a good story.<eos> - You don't wanna give points for doing the same thing over and over.<eos> My first scam contender is gonna rate high but to give it the best chance of success, we need just the right atmosphere.
Oh, my God! They'll see him. Shit!<eos> Okay, girls, girls, Daddy needs help.<eos> No matter what you hear, you don't move from here.<eos> Hey, okay, okay. Hey, I'm right here.<eos> Jack, grab it!
What do you mean, you don't have an OS?<eos> It's like this.<eos> Avie Tevanian is our Chief Software Designer, and he wrote a demo program.<eos> It's like we built a great car, but we haven't built the engine.<eos> So we put a golf-cart battery in there to make it go for a little bit.
How amusing.<eos> The stage is now set for this year's Brit Awards, with smash sensation Ellie Crush tipped to pick up a handful of awards.<eos> Thought you might like to hear from the plugging team how your dance hit is shaping up.<eos> Right, well, Radio 1 don't think it's for them.<eos> Maybe if it was bigger at club, we'd have more ammunition.
Quick! Whoa, what's going on?<eos> Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.<eos> It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.<eos> The droid... stole a freighter?<eos> It had help.
We could not save the queen, My Lady!<eos> It is a boy.<eos> Baahubali!<eos> The empty throne reminds me of a widow's forehead.<eos> So, I will take the throne and restore it to it's former glory!
Aww.<eos> It's beautiful, Rachel.<eos> Sometimes you scare me, you're so good.<eos> That was all him.<eos> Take credit where it's due.
Jeremy?<eos> Yeah, he... We're just, like, talking about, like, leaving the business, and... I know, just, like starting new.<eos> I'm sorry, your below-the-line, coupon-cutting boyfriend is gonna offer you something more interesting than a five-year deal with me?<eos> Quinn, he's a very nice guy, and he loves me.<eos> I just think I should give it a chance.
I want it on its way to Charlestown before whatever's going to happen here tomorrow happens.<eos> Right.<eos> Who are they?<eos> Friends from the beach.<eos> They have pledged their services to Captain Vane to defend the fort and to discourage any move against it.
Bugler.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> This one isn't that bad.<eos> "He was 12, and he made a tourniquet "out of his scarf.<eos> "The Confederate soldier survived, "and then five years later, "he tracked down the little bugler and gave it back."
It's like every second there is a new issue that I have to solve.<eos> I am stressed as hell.<eos> Richard, currently, your stress level is here.<eos> And that's night sweats level.<eos> Got it? Now, if you're not careful and you let it go up...
- Just so bloody one-sided.<eos> You realize he's never even asked to read our script?<eos> Everyone in town has read it.<eos> Wouldn't you think he'd be slightly curious?<eos> - Maybe he read it and didn't like it.
Hey, how about that yoga cats calendar, Doris?<eos> Can I have that?<eos> - Yeah. No, take that.<eos> - Thanks so much.<eos> I've had my eye on it for a minute.
It's fine.<eos> Please, everyone drink, enjoy.<eos> See?<eos> Straight from the alcoholic's mouth.<eos> - He says it's fine.
What an idiot.<eos> What is he messing with that truck for? - Your dad's truck?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We can't find the parts for it.<eos> - Yeah, but are you helping with it? - Yes!
There is skill to it.<eos> More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.<eos> TV defeats it's own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.<eos> It's TV, it's comfort.<eos> It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day.
So, we have our normal arrangement?<eos> Look, Herm, I could bust the guy up, but what's the point?<eos> The building's nearly done.<eos> Let's at least slow it down.<eos> We got to let it get built sometime.
And smarter than I'd imagined.<eos> What?<eos> He is your son, after all.<eos> The ring.<eos> After spending most of the morning prizing this from our son, I'm not letting it out of my sight.
His address... the address on his DMV.<eos> I did a search for his home, and...<eos> Tao: Holy crap!<eos> Excuse me, Buzz.<eos> So, it was repossessed during the housing crisis and burnt to the ground six years later.
I'll put it back.<eos> But I dusted it yesterday.<eos> You don't have to go to all the trouble.<eos> Oh, I don't mind.<eos> I'm just giving it a good scrubbing.
Detective babineaux?<eos> Looks like if we want the candyman, We'll have to find him ourselves.<eos> I'm missing a rat.<eos> Liv. You're rocking a rat.<eos> I am five seconds away from naming it and then making it a grilled cheese.
He will dither!<eos> Thing is, Mrs Turner, you need something better than an orange box if that manger's going to be on the telly.<eos> - I know, but...<eos> - I'm proud of this church.<eos> I put all the love and care I couldn't spend on Lorna into looking after it.
No ligature marks or contusions at the neck.<eos> No sign of a struggle. There's a small scratch on his forehead, But it healed well before the time of death.<eos> So, how does someone asphyxiate lying in bed alone?<eos> [ sniffs ] [ sniffs ] Mercaptan.<eos> It's a compound they add to natural gas To give it that unique smell.
We'll get a warrant for your place. You can just relax.<eos> I have a feeling you're gonna be here a while.<eos> Blair told me about the dagger.<eos> She found it in a box, and she thought it could be valuable.<eos> So I took a photo of it, and I posted it online.
The blood on his tool from killing Grant, he's using it to paint the inverted cross, to finish that image of the Hanged Man.<eos> Like the Hanged Man itself, Colby plans his resurrection by finishing the unfinished work.<eos> If he requires more blood to paint with, he will take another victim.<eos> He's gone.<eos> And the cross, it grows more complete.
_<eos> _<eos> How are you?<eos> Time isn't perfect.<eos> Yet I'm envious how most of you seem to defy it.
It's a-- it's a good orchid.<eos> -My psychiatrist makes me keep it so I learn to trust myself.<eos> -Orchids are very hardy actually, hannah.<eos> They do very well on their own in the wild.<eos> -Maybe I should just release it.
Am I that bad?<eos> We have the same dragon.<eos> Eventually you will slay it, or train it, or dissolve in its stomach.<eos> Its name is Helping Others.<eos> If I train it, can I give it a cooler name?
We all have crazy ones.<eos> I do. It's...<eos> I guarantee you people dream about sleeping with their parents, their teachers, their dogs.<eos> It's just how we're wired.<eos> Sex is confusing, so you need to stare it in the face, and you need to say, "That is stupid."
See, that's the difference between you and I, Kellogg.<eos> You actually think this is a game.<eos> That's exactly what this is.<eos> I don't need lawyers to fight my battles.<eos> I can simply starve this division of every resource it needs.
[Upbeat music]<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> In my hands, I hold the driving directions to this year's detectives-only getaway.<eos> Give it a cool name, Jake.
This is Tokue's tree.<eos> We all agreed to plant a cherry tree.<eos> She loved cherry blossoms so.<eos> You know, boss.<eos> We were born into this world to see it and to listen to it.
Well, just be careful.<eos> I only have one Clorox wipe that has to last till my next birthday, and it's already lost a lot of its moisture.<eos> I don't see why we have to just sit here.<eos> We can't drive it.<eos> My dad said if anything happens to it, we'll be responsible.
- He's still alive.<eos> - So the poison is not a strong acid.<eos> We should also rule out alkali, iron... lithium, ethanol and the like... leaving us with a multitude of plant-based poisons to consider.<eos> The rat is still in metabolic acidosis.<eos> Have you considered treating it with an antidote
- They're in position?<eos> - They are. But we have a casualty.<eos> - Charlie, the courier. - Krystina?<eos> The file Colonel Mayhew wanted.<eos> I'll see he gets it.
- Why not?<eos> First I'd like to talk this over between ourselves.<eos> And I'd like to see all of you in jail.<eos> Then call the press. No.<eos> I love the church and don't Want to hurt it.
Because that's what you're here for.<eos> Graceland doesn't exist just because there were a few agents who wanted an ocean view, you know?<eos> I mean, the house, it's... It's pretty dope, right?<eos> But at the end of the day, it's just walls.<eos> What gives it its value are the people inside.
Rush it to court before 10:30am<eos> Yes Do you have a death-wish, bringing a cat here<eos> No<eos> It belonged to Ting's neighbour, an old lady<eos> She had a stroke and wants us to find it an owner
How did you know?<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Neither is Ali.<eos> But she couldn't have known there'd be a coup.<eos> She was hoping to prevent it.
But the biggest problem with this car is that it never stops shouting.<eos> You can push this button here to quieten the exhaust system but every time you go near the throttle, it all bursts back into life again.<eos> This car's a little bit like a child that can play the violin.<eos> For five minutes, it's fine.<eos> But after a month, you might start to suggest that if it doesn't stop, you will shove the sound box right up its...
Will I like it any better?<eos> By my calculation, that thing we found floated downstream with the tides from Greenwich.<eos> A good three hours in the water. And?<eos> Well, if it was supposed to be found and interpreted as the work of the surgeons, that is leaving much to chance.<eos> Might not someone with sedition in mind take care their outrage be discovered? Rather than simply letting it drift God knows where.
I'm not kidding. I'm not gonna be handled again. Not by anybody.<eos> I mean, you trust someone, you let them in, they fuck you up.<eos> Fuck that, you know? And the cops won't help you. Nobody will help you.<eos> You have to do it yourself. You have to walk out and never look back.<eos> And if that doesn't work, you take a paring knife and you fillet it like a fish. You pull the guts out and you cut the fucking head off.
I wouldn't have to sell drugs to finance my cause.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You got a cause?<eos> Justice. From a corrupt government.<eos> A government which has imprisoned me for decades because I stood up to it.
I remember. What?<eos> You figure you're getting a homecoming dinner? What do you mean?<eos> You got eyes, don't you?<eos> Even if we beat that sub, I don't recognize this country anymore.<eos> Well, I guess we'll just have to work a little harder to get it back.
I'm impressed.<eos> But what about our little free spirit Stanley?<eos> That clown?<eos> At this rate, he'll be lucky to graduate high school.<eos> Look, there's a saltwater taffy store on the dock, and somebody's gotta get paid to scrape the barnacles off of it.
Evelyn told me.<eos> - So you understand.<eos> - Of course I understand.<eos> The car is your enemy.<eos> But it's my friend, and all I ask is that you give it a second chance.
Let me tell you, I wouldn't wish a trouble on my worst enemy. Maybe that's what your trouble's about.<eos> You refuse to look at the dark, emotional truth.<eos> You're scared that it might kill you.<eos> And then that fear, it manifests itself literally.<eos> And now that I'm trying to make you face it, you're making the room darker, and we're all going to die.
This is more shocking than Meredith Baxter-Birney.<eos> Look, I figured since you two abandoned the cupcake shop, this space was available.<eos> Also, I stopped asking permission for stuff when I turned 70.<eos> We did not abandon it.<eos> We just haven't paid attention to it in 3 months, like me with any hair above my mid-thigh.
Nurse!<eos> Can I get some help in here, please?<eos> Nurse?<eos> Kill the spider. Please kill it.<eos> Don't let it get away.
Simon's ambitious, as you know.<eos> This project's a big step for him.<eos> Will it make money?<eos> I expect so.<eos> So, it's going well?
He's not at his spot in Jackson Park.<eos> He's in the city.<eos> Turns out he's hold up in The Cave.<eos> That club over on the Westside?<eos> Yeah, it's being protected by his uncle.
Everything I do is sport and game.<eos> I was just about to tell your handsome chamberlain... that I journey to perform one of my most cherished duties.<eos> The declaration of heirs.<eos> Sir Gwynfor is our Progeny Prophet and Uroscoper.<eos> Once he has, uh, acquired the proof that you carry the child of Lord Ventris, the king will declare, if it be a male child, he will be given all the rights to rule this shire.
I am not a boy.<eos> Boys run from the things they are afraid of.<eos> - And you're not afraid, Moor?<eos> - All the time.<eos> But I look at my fear... and I pray to find some small piece of bravery to face it.
But I work with a subcontractor who hired Rico to... yes, yes, yes, yes!<eos> He works for me!<eos> Delivery only!<eos> Please, that scanner is... that scanner's...<eos> It's very important nothing happen to it.
Her treacherous slatch already droops like wet clay.<eos> Leave me.<eos> You are never to go to that room.<eos> You have made that more than clear.<eos> But the steward needed vellum and demanded I retrieve it.
-Terribly sorry...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey, you are so late.<eos> Rolf, the Good Samaritan was called out to a horse.<eos> Should I have let it die on Christmas Eve?
I'm really sorry.<eos> I know I promised that we'd spend the night alone.<eos> I even had this really dumb plan that we were gonna drink hot whiskeys and watch "it's a wonderful life" together, yet here we are.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> Today, it was me that saw their house on fire and decided not to let it burn.
No, the ink is iron gall from iron salts and tannic acids.<eos> Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century.<eos> But the signature is fake?<eos> No. I compared it pixel by pixel to Washington's signature on the Constitution.<eos> The slant and spacing show that it's a perfect match.
So, why did you do it?<eos> 'Cause I don't trust myself.<eos> 'Cause I'm weak.<eos> It's like I forget who I am.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
Steady. Don't rush.<eos> Everything around the vocal cords are trigger points for more swelling.<eos> Bump into it, the tissue's gonna balloon out, and your opening is gone.<eos> I know, I know... It's like driving a semitruck through a narrow lane of eggshells.<eos> You just need to find your voice and let it sing.
He can do incredible things on NZT, but he defines himself in opposition to institutions.<eos> I know the mindset;<eos> I raised teenagers.<eos> And in the context of this department, it's dangerous.<eos> He'll move past it.
This means that deep inside of her there is a seedling of regret.<eos> So you're gonna keep going after her?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna let that seedling grow on its own.<eos> If it's meant to become a mighty love oak, it will.
So Catherine ran over Sinclair here. That's our story. Our story doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does. Otherwise, none of this makes sense.<eos> We don't need it to make sense.<eos> We just need it to look like chaos, to leave the police a crime scene that's a mess.<eos> It's their job to make sense out of it, not ours.
Well, what else do you remember?<eos> Well, nothing, Cam.<eos> It was 30 years ago.<eos> No, the recipe is inside you!<eos> It just needs to come out!
I got food for the big boy.<eos> But the tortoise is acting super sluggish.<eos> Well, anybody give him water?<eos> He could be dehydrated.<eos> [mellow music] Okay, I'll get it some water.
Yeah, his tooth.<eos> I can't think why I didn't think of this before.<eos> He's got a false tooth there.<eos> I think it's called a ca...nine?<eos> It got knocked out in a boxing match.
That's what the programme stands for.<eos> You know, it's called Top Gear, that's what you turn it on for.<eos> But they made the car look beautiful.<eos> It was very superhero-like and the car was the star.<eos> It's that electric power that gives it so much punch off the line.
Yeah, it's great here, man.<eos> You're surrounded by a bunch of hunks.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Come on, you gotta use the pain.<eos> Get inspired by it.
Okay, can I read you what I got right now?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, sure. -Okay.<eos> "Give us the £500,000 or the little boy dies.<eos> You have 24 hours."<eos> I wish you were there to read it.
There's a wolf in me.<eos> Fangs pointed for tearing gashes.<eos> A red tongue for raw meat.<eos> I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me.<eos> And I cannot let it go.
Searching me out.<eos> Of course it's absurd.<eos> But I think you're beginning to see what I already know.<eos> We can't avoid pain.<eos> But resisting it, that's what causes all the problems.
Guys, pay attention.<eos> This is a little serious game.<eos> You will soon know who our opponents are.<eos> Can you see my house?<eos> Look at it very carefully.
A moustache A moustache<eos> If you've only got a moustache<eos> We are the guardians of the future.<eos> Enter when ready.<eos> Did you shoot the black condor and kick it in the balls?
Ah, a fatal...<eos> Hazel Grace, they don't actually hurt you unless you light them.<eos> Hmm? I've never lit one.<eos> It's a metaphor, see?<eos> You put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth... but you never give it the power to kill you.
Hit him harder!<eos> All right!<eos> No, my friend.<eos> We will not kill you off for Andrew Lesley.<eos> It's bad enough you wrecked our little show by grafting a hockey stick onto it.
He was snooping around my desk.<eos> He saw it and read it, and... hello! ...<eos> He loved it.<eos> Really?<eos> Loved it.
- Find him! Tell him we need more men!<eos> - Yes, Corporal.<eos> For God's sake, will you never leave us alone?<eos> Shut your fucking mouth!<eos> Rip it apart.
You think I"m weak.<eos> Oh, I should like to see your blood, your brains lying there on the table, see your whole sex swimming in blood like my little bird.<eos> You think I am weak!<eos> You think I love you because my womb cried out for your sperm.<eos> You think I want to carry your brat under my heart, feed it with my blood and give it your name!
Hi, there, Marty.<eos> What's going on, Rust?<eos> Brought the mower back.<eos> - You mowed my yard?<eos> - Yeah, I saw it needed mowing.
Now let's discuss a special case.<eos> The only living being that uses its brain better than us.<eos> The dolphin.<eos> It is estimated that this incredible animal uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.<eos> In particular, this allows it to have an echolocation system that is more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.
Morse?<eos> If you have a moment.<eos> Would you excuse me, Miss Weiss?<eos> This Indian dagger.<eos> Having examined it now at some length, I'm of a mind it's unlikely to have been the murder weapon.
Do you want one?<eos> I always want one.<eos> But you don't always ask.<eos> Patrick, I'm going to take on that choir.<eos> Revive it, get it back on its feet.
(chuckles) Hey, uh, what's the robot version of bro-Mance?<eos> Ro-Mance.<eos> You future guys have a word for everything... pal.<eos> (both snoring) You know, they look a little similar.<eos> Like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it.
Now, look here, we may have been estranged, but that does not mean mama was not the cherry in my coke because she was.<eos> She made me who I am.<eos> She was my Geppetto!<eos> Meanwhile, back in Chatswin, there was only one couple on the group date who'd found the recipe for love.<eos> And what I like to do is add just a dash of cinnamon to the peach reduction to infuse it with a "what the huh? !" flavor.
Van's on the move, headed north on 76th.<eos> Jin, you got it, or what?<eos> Got him. He's goin' west on 75th.<eos> - There's the van.<eos> - All right, let's box it in.
That's it. Distract it.<eos> Countermeasures!<eos> We have a countermeasure vehicle that trails the presidential motorcade. It jams electronic-guidance systems, I.E.D. detonators, and even attracts heat-seeking missiles away from the president.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We can't stop the worm from hitting its target, so we give it a new target.
Something might have happened.<eos> It's Ethan.<eos> He'll keep calling until I pick up.<eos> Like a collie.<eos> Keeps barking until someone tosses it a treat.
Power down.<eos> Your call Plummer.<eos> Alright Sir.<eos> It looks like it's moving.<eos> Give it a few seconds.
Maybe.<eos> Or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow.<eos> But I think I know how to stop it.<eos> All the virus cares about is replicating.<eos> The engineered version lets it do that unchecked. So it no longer needs to mutate, which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
So... what we need is an unfair advantage.<eos> We have to trust that our treatment will<eos> - work fast enough. - No, wait, that's it.<eos> There is no treatment that's fast enough, so what we need to do is slow down the virus long enough for the cure to take effect.<eos> And we can do that by infusing it with cryo-fluid.
They want leaders.<eos> Leaders.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> You are hiding your light under a bushel, Jo.<eos> You... you have to let it shine.
- It's amazing?<eos> Amazing I only found one print in this entire place.<eos> - It was cleaned well.<eos> Maybe you should have them clean your place.<eos> Frankie says it could use a good scrubbing. - Oh, yeah?
Just doing what I thought you would.<eos> You know what? Let's get something straight here.<eos> You're not me.<eos> You haven't cut a record, let alone sold one.<eos> And the only reason why Avery is producing your album is because I gave it the green light.
We all hope it is a temporary situation that will be sorted out.<eos> The army will manage the situation and activities will continue normally.<eos> It's important to hope for the best, but also be ready for the worst.<eos> [speaking English] I was sworn in as warden by the park authorities in Kinshasa in August 2008.<eos> My work is to manage the park, to ensure that it's adequately protected.
I gotta work.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, oh, do you want tickle spray?<eos> Sure.<eos> Some guy who doesn't work here anymore left it in his desk, so I stole it.
Hello?<eos> Exit the box, and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran empire.<eos> Shush!<eos> Doctor?<eos> I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I managed to give it the slip.
I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't seeing it<eos> - with my own two eyes.<eos> - I guess my Dad was right.<eos> Then again, I did put my own Hiccup spin on it.<eos> That's what all great leaders do, Fishlegs, they take an idea, then they shape it.
You still haven't told me whether you found her during the time none of us can remember.<eos> What happened during that time isn't important.<eos> Because you remember.<eos> Is our ship okay?<eos> What... what happened to it?
Things I can't explain.<eos> When you put an overactive mind in an inactive environment, there's bound to be complications. Particularly,<eos> - if chemical substances are involved.<eos> - I'm not on drugs.<eos> Well, the easiest way to maintain a healthy mind is to make sure it has plenty of exercise.
This is just a bitch in heat as far as he's concerned.<eos> And he's not leaving till he gets what he came for.<eos> Well, the girl, too late, realizes the kind of mistake she's made, she wants to get up.<eos> But the dog had other ideas.<eos> Had to shoot it behind the ear to get it off of her.
- Joel, that's ridiculous. - [Sighs]<eos> - Joel...<eos> - He feels like we're gonna let him slip through the cracks, you know?<eos> And I-I can't blame him, with the way we've been communicating.<eos> Like you buying a phone without talking to me about it first?
Whilst Hammond was deafening the police, I pulled over to disable my engine management system.<eos> How about that!<eos> Engine warning light. Yes.<eos> That's what we want.<eos> What the engine has to do now is assume a sort of worst-case scenario, because it doesn't know anything about itself, so it will assume it's very cold, the fuel quality is bad, so it must be less efficient.
That was 17 years ago.<eos> How could I possibly remember a silly dance routine?<eos> Right.<eos> Hot coals, hot coals--<eos> Mind if I give it a shot?
Previously, on Reign...<eos> He heard them talk of a creature that resides in the woods.<eos> They give it blood.
How can I help?<eos> What's happening now?<eos> Peter's giving Neal an opportunity to pass a message... if Boothe has backup, hidden gun, anything we need to know before we move in.<eos> Neal has a plan.<eos> We're interrupting it.
The father became fearful of his son, so he wounded him.<eos> A tale told time and again.<eos> I don't think of Samaritan as a child.<eos> I'm not that presumptuous.<eos> But I plan to celebrate its brilliance... not muzzle it.
I'm just saying that I go out with guys who are different from me all the time and we get on just fine.<eos> You hooked up with a jazz trumpeter on Friday night and by Saturday you were wearing a pork pie hat and listening to Miles Davis.<eos> Yes.<eos> You hate jazz.<eos> I do not hate jazz, I just never gave it a chance.
Turns out, Darius was in Connecticut, doing a job for malachi when Miller Beck was murdered.<eos> Well, malachi might have told you that, but we still need to confirm it.<eos> Cady already did.<eos> When I go to prison, malachi will own this place.<eos> I should have just let it burn.
It was never about him. It was always about you.<eos> It was all a test?<eos> And one you performed admirably.<eos> You see, he's but the first line of defense.<eos> And what he protects is also guarded by an enchantment... a spell that can only be broken by someone who has been tempted by their inner darkness and turned away from it, someone just like you.
We kept telling him, "your gift's on its way.<eos> "It's being engraved.<eos> "It's coming from a place that's closed for a month for Ramadan."<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then, finally, there was so much built up around it, we had to buy him a car so he wasn't disappointed.
I'm just so glad to have you back.<eos> Mm. Well, the question is do we have you back?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> And I'm not gonna find out by hanging out with you.<eos> Well then, I guess you have to go out and find some wesen butt and kick it.
They act out, like all brats...<eos> Only their tantrums end in blood.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need to do something. What can we do?<eos> If we knew who the spirit was when it was alive, we could find a way to release it peacefully, but this little bugger could be hundreds of years old.
That's what got him killed.<eos> What did Commander Wallace say?<eos> He suggested that I hide at my parents' cabin and not talk to anyone until he phoned.<eos> I was on my way there when a car ran me off the road.<eos> You get a look at it?
Get those three girls some water...<eos> Look, Alex, this is a homicide investigation, okay?<eos> If the State Department wants to play along, that is fine, but not a word...<eos> Come on, Booth, this is a human trafficking case.<eos> If I don't make myself known, my department looks like it doesn't care.
Francis.<eos> You did this for me?<eos> Fireflies.<eos> The world can be dark, Mary, and uncertain, and cruel.<eos> The only thing that really matters is that we face it together.
TIE fighters will begin mass-production on Lothal within the next six weeks.<eos> You're just full of fun facts.<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Yeah. Autopilot's engaged.<eos> This thing'll run till it's out of fuel.
Byron was obsessive.<eos> He time-stamped almost everything he did.<eos> He only solved the Portal Nine problem, the same problem that sent me to that old factory last night.<eos> But get this... he wasn't given the same problem as me.<eos> And so it would've yielded GPS coordinates for an entirely different location.
I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.<eos> It's something inhuman.<eos> It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.<eos> And through that, the inhuman spirit tricked you.<eos> You gave it permission to infest your lives.
What we found on that craft... Defies all explanation.<eos> We took its dna,<eos> And we artificially fertilized in the zero gravity of space.<eos> We tried the gene splicing with many different creatures.<eos> But it was the spider... That had the structure to enable it to survive.
I always like soft and creamy.<eos> I'm soft and creamy.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Why don't we go make sure that table's okay?<eos> Looks like it's in danger.
I mean, physical education, that ought to be up to the parents, right?<eos> So what do you teach again?<eos> French? Someone mature, and soft-spoken.<eos> Your system doesn't work, Linda.<eos> It's gasping for air.
So what do you teach again?<eos> French? Someone mature, and soft-spoken.<eos> Your system doesn't work, Linda.<eos> It's gasping for air.<eos> And you know what... Let it die.
But I didn't.<eos> I saw this man.<eos> - Oh shit!<eos> Hey, hey! Buddy, come on!<eos> I thought he was having a seizure, so I went down and tried to help, but, took my wallet and put it in your mouth so he wouldn't bite his tongue and he just..
..or a film-star as a brand ambassador.<eos> He'll charge a few crores. I hope you're okay with that, Mr. Mehra?<eos> And then you can show him..<eos> ..driving this car amidst beautiful valleys.. ..with beautiful girls.<eos> Hide its average features.. ..and this car will surely sell. Let's sell it on style and glamour.
I think I might need to get a new job if we're going to have a kid.<eos> No, just... just don't worry about it.<eos> Don't worry about it?<eos> Kids are expensive.<eos> I got a locksmith the other day and it cost $160.
- Why?<eos> - Ah, bad blood.<eos> Been going on for years.<eos> There's this one guy... he'll be out there right now.<eos> When he was a kid... took a notion to hide in the ditch and wait for a car to come, and just when it was approaching, he stepped out in front of it just to see what would happen.
♪ Mmm-mmm<eos> It was archaic.<eos> It was incredibly slow.<eos> You can't do what you can these days in Pro Tools.<eos> You had this "render" button, and it would take like two hours.
Do you put out the fire, or do you let him burn?<eos> Will is my friend.<eos> We will put out the fire when it's necessary.<eos> He has asked for more tests.<eos> Now that we have confirmed what it is, it'll be easier to hide from him.
Well, you know, I've never done it before, but I definitely am up for it.<eos> You are the cushion.<eos> This fucking lawn.<eos> It uses, like, 800 gallons of water.<eos> Why haven't you just let it get brown and die?
I've got a quick emergency meeting about Travis, but I'll be back before you know it, nude, standing in my spot.<eos> You know how Grayson calls his chest "the truth" and his back "justice"?<eos> Well, I think he should call his johnson "the American way."<eos> That's gold, J-bird, but why tell me?<eos> Well, he won't let me nickname it. I think he might let you do it.
You being stronger - it will help him, Mrs Lacey.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Come on, woman!<eos> Where have you put my paper? !<eos> Then it's out the way... where it can't do no harm.
I've come to ask about that scooter.<eos> Is it still broken down?<eos> I believe so, yes.<eos> Well, I brought my toolkit along.<eos> I haven't had my hands on a scooter since I was living in Rome, and I'd love to play my part in restoring it to glory.
Hey, stranger.<eos> What you doing home?<eos> Charlie and Mike helped me spike Bobby's drink.<eos> The dreaded spike, huh?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Couldn't get it up, huh?
A good citizen would have gladly told his government representatives that he had an aircraft and then willingly made it available.<eos> That airplane is my ticket out of here when everything goes to hell, as it most certainly will.<eos> You don't even know how to fly the plane, Pope.<eos> - I'm reading a book.<eos> - I'm twin-engine rated, so I'll pilot your precious aircraft and make sure nothing happens to it.
We're helping you visualize a leg that doesn't hurt.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Now... just look at that.<eos> I... are you kidding me?<eos> We are rerouting your brain, reminding it of what happened.
Oh, you are such a good girl.<eos> Wow. It's strange to hear that coming from you.<eos> I am good, you know?<eos> You always make everything better.<eos> Do you remember that Sunday in Church when that dying butterfly came through the window and it landed on your hand and you tried to help it fly and it just couldn't.
Oh, that's, uh--that's from the airship Norge, right?<eos> It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole.<eos> Pete and I snagged that, what, Artie, two years ago?<eos> Yes, it's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since.<eos> It's time we gave it a home.
People like Fitz...<eos> They go down in history.<eos> People like us, we create the history.<eos> We run this world so he can lead it.<eos> In order to lead it, the people have to elect him, Cyrus.
We have to make him come crawling to me.<eos> What's his weakness?<eos> His fortune.<eos> Wouldn't you say that's his strength?<eos> Not if it's slipping away.
If this is regarding an anaconda in a crawl space, press 1.<eos> If a sinkhole full of Indian bones has appeared in your living room, press 2.<eos> If you want to know why JAG wasn't on this week, press 3.<eos> If your shabbos goy...<eos> Why can't we just cut this state adrift and let it crash into Cuba?
Oh, obviously, you never saw the letter that I sent him.<eos> No, I did, actually.<eos> I liked the way you, uh, dotted the "I" on "kill" with a little heart.<eos> It was a nice touch.<eos> Well, I was trying to give it a personal feel.
Don't even think about it.<eos> Had a dog over at 80 when I was there.<eos> Still have the teeth marks in my ankle to prove it.<eos> My dad says he's gonna throw it in the river if I don't get rid of it.<eos> I'll take it, or at least I can find a home for it or something.
Time 51 got one.<eos> Plus, it would really piss off Mouch.<eos> No way.<eos> Peter Mills, where is that dog?<eos> Um, I found a home for it.
Brian, all I have to do is start fake sneezing around you and you'Il spend the rest of your life outside.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I can hear some of the jokes.<eos> Well, I guess you just never know what kind of rage some people have bottled up.<eos> Well, we all got anger, Chris.<eos> The important thing is finding a healthy way to channel it.
I'm sorry. I'm just...<eos> I'm not used to riding western.<eos> Try loosening up on the reins.<eos> These horses don't need much direction.<eos> In dressage, it's all about complete control over your animal, making the horse do what you want it to, not what comes naturally to it.
-So? Are you a girl?<eos> -lt hurt! -Stop arguing with me.<eos> Kids, we're going to see the pond.<eos> -Hey, a cat!<eos> I took a picture of it!
- VIN numbers are filed off.<eos> - With the VIN numbers filed off.<eos> Doherty.<eos> - Ring was shoved up here.<eos> - You think it fell off?
- You're fucking wasted.<eos> - Alcohol provides clarity.<eos> We hide in the bird sanctuary until closing.<eos> We drug the rhino.<eos> Once it's down, a quick back and forth with the saw.
I'm sure he'd rather be going to Disneyland.<eos> But before you jump to any conclusions, let's talk it over with the Riveras, ok?<eos> I'm telling you this, I will not be judged in my own house.<eos> You know what?<eos> We owe it to Jesus to find out more about the camp before we shut it down.
His mom seemed oblivious.<eos> Could you tell when your daughter was high or drinking?<eos> We never had that problem in our house.<eos> Every parent thinks that.<eos> Every kid thinks they're getting away with it.
right?<eos> I'm not like them...<eos> I wouldn't kill him.<eos> Eren... Let me see the inside of your mouth.<eos> The tooth... It's already grown back.
'And that thought gave me yet another brilliant idea.'<eos> Nobody is driving on that road.<eos> So what are you suggesting? Or that road.<eos> What I'm saying is, we turn this town into a street circuit.<eos> Ship The Stig out, he sets a time in a car of some sort and we try and match it.
It's crazy to me, but at least it makes sense, but this massacre was just a pointless, brutal thing.<eos> In all your life, have you ever heard of anything like that, a good man, an aspiring priest just goes on a killing spree out of nowhere.<eos> I've seen quite a lot in my time.<eos> The world is a rather awful place.<eos> Best to meet it on its own terms.
- Which is?<eos> You know normal wolves never abandon an injured member of the pack.<eos> They care for it.<eos> They bring it food from a kill and then regurgitate it into the mouth of the injured wolf.<eos> They even give it physical and emotional comfort by intensely grooming it.
There's a new seven-speed manual gearbox. Which is fantastic.<eos> And all new suspension, which does its job impeccably.<eos> For 50 years, Porsche have bloody-mindedly stuck with this daft idea of building a car with the engine at the back, but... half a century of consistent fiddling around and they've made it work brilliantly.<eos> It's so good that it brought on a temporary attack of yobbishness.<eos> Turn in, give it a little squeeze of power.
That is the sound of the '60s right there!<eos> And if you push this little button here, you engage the sports exhaust system, which makes it even louder.<eos> It's not all bark and no bite, either.<eos> The 3L V6 engine is supercharged and delivers 375 fire-spitting horse powers.<eos> It does 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.
hey, ma'am.<eos> thank god!<eos> here, hold this.<eos> [baby crying] the lasagna's burning.<eos> okay. get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!
Because despite everything... ..I still love him.<eos> My husband may be a fool but he's not a killer.<eos> You seem very sure about that, Mrs Rees.<eos> Our marriage is a strong one.<eos> The only thing that can threaten it... ..is love.
If that's possible.<eos> How did you like my gift, Mr. Governor-elect?<eos> "Fiat Justitia Ruat Caelum."<eos> The engraved gavel.<eos> He loved it.
Good night. Good night.<eos> You know, if we were roomies, we could do this every night.<eos> Of course, if I moved in, I'd want to... zhush up the place a little.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Eh, it lacks zhush.
- it's a smear.<eos> - Smear?<eos> It's all part of the same package.<eos> The outside world becomes a hostile environment.<eos> Sometimes you can face it, sometimes you can't.
No, I was.<eos> Max, I didn't want to tell you this, but I was secretly worried my Booty was gone.<eos> Turns out, it was just the pants.<eos> It's still there.<eos> Take a picture of it.
A friend.<eos> Someone to be at your side when I'm away.<eos> It will be with you when I cannot.<eos> It will?<eos> Give it a name.
She means aside from your mom.<eos> Then, no.<eos> Well, we've asked everyone we know, and now I'm depressed, because this is everyone we know.<eos> Let's start asking people in the diner.<eos> We need to find it a place to live.
Sorry, Sophie, the cupcake window isn't open during the day.<eos> I don't need your life story. I just need a damn cupcake.<eos> Sophie, do you remember that cat that was crying outside our building?<eos> Yeah, you put it down?<eos> We thought it was a stray, so we tried to find a home for it, but couldn't.
But it needed somewhere to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thea, you're angry.<eos> At your mother, the D.A., yourself, maybe.<eos> But that anger is going to chew up your insides if you don't let it out.
But there are forces that conspire... forces of darkness, forces of the heart.<eos> Long may she reign.<eos> Previously on Reign...<eos> He heard them talk of a creature who resides in the woods.<eos> They give it blood.
Thank you for making me take the reservation, Max.<eos> I mean, otherwise, I was just gonna get in bed and be depressed.<eos> You were in bed and you were depressed.<eos> Don't rewrite history just 'cause these folks have.<eos> I mean, we are smack in the belly of Williamsburg ironic chic, and I want to smack it.
The soup has garlic.<eos> Oh, then no.<eos> The salmon, please.<eos> Bring her the damn soup, she ain't kissing nobody tonight.<eos> And I'll have the free-range chicken that thought it had a chance.
Why the look?<eos> If this had happened a few years ago, you would have thrown a martini in her face and called it a day.<eos> But now...<eos> I'm standing up for myself.<eos> I just... Buried the pain of what happened with my father, but because of you, I'm not just facing it. I'm doing something.
I was saying quite the same thing to Denise today.<eos> Denise?<eos> Mmm. Her youth is her defining asset in her role in the store.<eos> All that enthusiasm.<eos> One can hardly put a cap on it.
Heptarian, I am sorry, but I cannot marry you.<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> The gods made their will clear today.<eos> This engysis is not blessed.<eos> We would be foolish to continue with it.
If you told your teacher you were going to do that, he'd probably piss himself laughing at you.<eos> COMMENTATOR: The FA Cup final is the time-honoured finale to the domestic season.<eos> But if Manchester United can complete the English double here today, a European treble, a unique treble, falls within their compass...<eos> GARY: So the FA Cup final comes on the Saturday, and we just want peace.<eos> We were playing against Newcastle, and you just want a comfortable game. You never get that in an FA Cup final, it's always nervy, it's always tense.
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, for violent fires soon burn out themselves<eos> Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short<eos> Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, consuming means soon preys upon itself<eos> This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, this earth of maiesty, this seat of Mars This other Eden, demi-paradise This fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war<eos> This happy breed of men, this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall, or as a moat defensive to a house, against the envy of less happier lands
David, you're the one who called for this vote.<eos> - Yeah. I changed my mind.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> And he brought us this internet thing.<eos> What's it called?
Yes.<eos> That's why it belongs in a freak show.<eos> [ Laughs ] Hideous!<eos> Anybody got a chicken?<eos> Let's see if it bites the head off.
Fuck!<eos> Have you seen Grace?<eos> She was with the dog.<eos> What?<eos> It was shaking and had diarrhea, or somebody maybe gave it DMT.
Yeah, I was really stupid.<eos> No, you're not stupid.<eos> Here, let me explain something to you.<eos> Take a look at that painting.<eos> Just take a good look at it.
Janek listen to me.<eos> This ship is taking off!<eos> - What?<eos> - What is she talking about?<eos> You can't let it leave!
Because you can live here now?<eos> Because I can leave you now.<eos> Remember...<eos> Controlling agoraphobia takes faith in yourself, Tommy.<eos> So, feel the fear, ...and let it pass.
I'm... I'm still here.<eos> There was break-in...<eos> And then...<eos> Feel the fear...<eos> Feel the fear and let it pass.
You can do anything to me.<eos> The dog was so much trouble.<eos> You did what?<eos> -I killed it.<eos> Had it put down.
Seriously, Breena.<eos> Except you're not getting her subliterate kids that she passes on to me. Okay?<eos> And I have to give them two years of teaching in one.<eos> I know there's a lot of Adams washouts, but still.<eos> The only thing that the district does right is protect what it does wrong.
Is that right? Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Sure is. Ha, ha.<eos> And I have a nice-sized farm up in Churdan, family-owned for four generations.<eos> Three thousand seven hundred acres, as of today.<eos> Now, if I could be personally certain of your product, give it the Whipple seal of approval, maybe there's something that I could do to help you.
You've got two more minutes, they want to know more about the driver.<eos> Oh, forget him, he's an idiot.<eos> - Why else would he think himself a suspect?<eos> - I think he's a suspect.<eos> - All right, but there's a mute button and I will use it.
Yeah. I've got an idea about that too.<eos> [WHISPERING] Thank you for everything you've done for me.<eos> Thank you for sleeping in a tent and for going in the ocean.<eos> Whatever happened to immensity?<eos> [WHISPERING] Immensity is not so scary when I have our family to help me face it.
No. If thou seest him, tell him... that I will be in the tavern, drinking wine in great plenty until my legs do the dance of a newly born camel.<eos> And then my mind will turn to dark, vile thoughts, and I'll start coveting my neighbour's oxen!<eos> That's breaking the Tenth Commandment, that is.<eos> Oooh! And if there's time, I might even covet his donkey.<eos> And when I've finished coveting things, I might make a small statue out of wood, and idolise it a bit.
And I find it fundamentally strange that you're not a dessert person.<eos> That's just weird, and it freaks me out.<eos> And I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown.<eos> And I hate your pantsuit.<eos> I wish it had ribbons on it or something to make it just slightly cuter.
Will she let me stay?<eos> She'll know where you can stay.<eos> I thought you were one of my sort<eos> Only of the grand kind.<eos> It was your lovely coat, and the way you let it swing when you were walking.
So I guess in a way this is my childhood dream realised.<eos> And I couldn't be more excited to share it with you.<eos> Welcome, everyone, to my Afterlife, exclusively from Vole Tesser.<eos> From the perspective of the virus, the human being is irrelevant.<eos> What matters is the system that allows it to function.
That's funny.<eos> You're adorable as you are helpful.<eos> Syndrome x is an epidemic...<eos> Diabetes, obesity and hypertension.<eos> Docs in family medicine see it so often, they gave it its own medical shorthand.
Our country needs the best that we can give.<eos> And we shall not fail it.<eos> Is there really no stopping it?<eos> I always said that conflict could only be postponed.<eos> Then we shall face it together.
Wax lubricates the surface further.<eos> It's extremely difficult to hold on even for a fly.<eos> Once inside, there is no escape.<eos> The leaf holds a pool of digestive liquid.<eos> This contains microscopic elastic pheromones which gives it the properties of quicksand.
He's not my boyfriend.<eos> Then maybe I'll make a move.<eos> Word is, he's an architect, and I've been looking for someone to lay hardwood downstairs.<eos> Well, that's a great idea, but first you're gonna need to pull up that musty carpet.<eos> I've seen your downstairs, and it needs some work.
Oh. It's his first show.<eos> He's sold six pieces already.<eos> I have - I have, it's amazing and I think you should Ed.<eos> Man, you gotta do something for me Dude.<eos> You gotta promise me that you'll give it a home.
Now, let's untie this boat and get out on that lake!<eos> Mabel, did you hear what that old dude said?<eos> "Aw, donkey spittle!"<eos> The other thing... about the monster.<eos> If we can snag a photo of it, we could split the prize fifty-fifty.
Mac, we don't even know what happened.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Bill?<eos> Oh, my God, Bill.<eos> The tranq I gave it... it must have an incredibly fast metabolism.
I want you to leave.<eos> This is property of the Nigerian government.<eos> - We got a van.<eos> - It's got diplomatic plates.<eos> Don't let it on the property.
Just wanted you to know we caught the man.<eos> - What man?<eos> - The vagrant.<eos> He'd been sneaking about the neighborhood, breaking into yards, sleeping where he can.<eos> He lit the fire to keep warm and it got out of hand.
When we lose a patient, I know if you're okay or you're not because I'm right there with you.<eos> With her, I cannot do that, because I don't think she can handle it.<eos> Not now.<eos> You are the one who is too emotionally involved.<eos> Okay, if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor, you would still be looking at it.
Suze Orman was right.<eos> I need to quit the page program and get a real job.<eos> You know what we did today?<eos> An amazing rendition of "What's the guy's name who plays first base?"<eos> No, we solved a problem by just addressing it, head on.
Pray for him.<eos> Pray for us.<eos> Hey, stupid.<eos> I was thinking:<eos> if my dog had a face like yours, I'd shave its ass and teach it to walk backwards.
Okay, um...<eos> S-shouldn't you, like, give me something?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> I can't cure the intermediate stage.<eos> Once the virus fully matures, I should be able to counteract it.
Whatever you need, consider it done.<eos> Good. I want you to help kill me.<eos> Um... maybe we should talk about this inside.<eos> Karen, you can't seriously be considering this.<eos> Listen, cancer's a bully, and when it's as bad as mine, it laughs at our pathetic little attempts to fight it.
More gas, more gas, more gas, more gas.<eos> Oh, dear Lord!<eos> Put her next to the wall little bit.<eos> I am next to the wall! 'Eventually, Kyle let me go out on my own.'<eos> Letting it find grip. Trying not to fight it too much.
I'd be happy to drive if you want me to.<eos> Oh, no, I will man the chariot, brave warrior.<eos> Do you want to dance?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Even though I've seen this movie dozens of times, it never fails to melt this tough exterior.
A system, and that's all.<eos> I don't think so, Harry.<eos> You may have fooled Nathan, but I know the truth.<eos> If you want to make something that understands human behavior, it has to be at least as smart as a human.<eos> You created an intelligence, a life, and then you ripped out its voice, locked it in a cage, and handed it over to the most laughably corrupt people imaginable.
You want your reputation back.<eos> Appreciate the help. Thanks for trying.<eos> He knows there's no return policy, right?<eos> I mean, he's pretty much supposed to just keep the big pile of money.<eos> Here. I'll take the check and plant it in his wallet.
God, I'm sorry.<eos> "Our" raccoon.<eos> - God, he's alive.<eos> - Yep.<eos> It's probably got a concussion, so the most important thing is to keep it awake for the next 48 hours.
This design may be as old as Jeremy, but if you are interested in the sensation of driving a car and everything that involves, then you will love this.<eos> I know Jeremy's blathering on about pushrods, but this has quite sophisticated suspension as well.<eos> Fully adjustable, and let's not forget that Caterham now is an F1 team.<eos> 'In fact, I had only one complaint about my car.'<eos> Put a windscreen on it!
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass. Out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.<eos> Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life.<eos> Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.<eos> I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire.<eos> A good sherry sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice - the tongue - becomes excellent wit.
My design represents the relationship between the spirit of independence and the spirit of community.<eos> I hold a letter from, uh, "Concerned Parents."<eos> It's a community organization.<eos> Please read the highlighted parts.<eos> "We urge our civil leaders to remove the offending statue or at least put some pants on it."
They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.<eos> I know why you couldn't walk away a few months ago.<eos> The club's been your whole life, you couldn't let it die.
But you can do this.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We're just having a little disagreement about process, right?<eos> You're still not on board with the animal plan.<eos> I say rip off the proverbial band-aid and let it bleed.
Betting in East Vizag, money equaling state's budget.<eos> I laughed hearing my own words. You mean the man who gave us information is a criminal?<eos> - Definitely! Can't he be a responsible citizen?<eos> Had he been, he would've told name and number.<eos> Okay agreed he may commit crime, what could it be?
And some people make a place for themselves...<eos> Grab a weapon!<eos> No time to be choosy!<eos> But then the world around them changes, and the place they made is gone.<eos> Every dragon has his own unique abilities that give it its special place in the world.
Say it.<eos> The booze is king.<eos> Not king, no.<eos> It is God.<eos> You give your life to it.
And some people make a place for themselves...<eos> Grab a weapon!<eos> No time to be choosy!<eos> But then the world around them changes, and the place they made is gone.<eos> Every dragon has his own unique abilities that give it its special place in the world.
- No, I wasn't! - Five more years.<eos> Okay, so after school, you're going to your friend Ashley's to swim, so I'm gonna need you to go get your swimsuit, your swim goggles, and your sunscreen, okay?<eos> And change into a dress that's not covered in cat fur.<eos> Oh, that cat is really losing its hair.<eos> Maybe we should slip it one of your Propecia, huh?
Meantime, we're gonna go to this hospital, see if Comescu's driver is feeling chatty.<eos> He's not gonna tell us anything.<eos> No, he's not, but we are gonna use a page out of McGarrett's playbook.<eos> And what do you mean by that?<eos> Take the playbook, and you set it on fire. All right.
I thought you would be in your own suite.<eos> Your father gave it to me to keep quiet.<eos> About what?<eos> For that amount of money, you must know a hell of a secret.<eos> I swear I don't know what it is, but I wanted to stick around to find out.
- I love this show.<eos> - What's your favorite part?<eos> - The heavy-handedness.<eos> You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now.<eos> Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm? Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it.
You exposed the identity of someone in the Witness Protection Programme.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> It's gross misconduct.<eos> A sackable offence.<eos> Read it, Leslie. Please read it.
Ooh, that adult Etch-A-Sketch certainly has brightened your mood.<eos> You can look at it this way... or this way... whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like "Tapped Out."<eos> Oh...<eos> "Virtual Stapler!"<eos> Sounds just like a stapler, and it never runs out... unless you tell it to.
A submarine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey! Let me, please.<eos> You got something, kid.<eos> I can feel the funny flowing from you, but you're just not letting it go.
Because I'm the prophecy born, maybe.<eos> Or I'm going to have a dragon soon which I'll be able to control, and it's going to give me ultimate power.<eos> How? Because you can make a dragon do things?<eos> Yes.<eos> I could make it devour people or breathe fire over the Kingdom of Mourne.
It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.<eos> It ripped my best friend in half.<eos> Quickly.<eos> And then it was on me.<eos> I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.
Tell me.<eos> Tell me who it is.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> It wants her, not you.<eos> If you wish to save yourselves, simply give it what it wants.
You just want to get smart all the time and walk away.<eos> If I was smart, I wouldn't have talked to you to begin with, and I just would have walked away.<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> I'm trying to do my part here, okay?<eos> I want to find a good doctor, and I want to pay for it.
I dreamed...<eos> I dreamed about a horse being hoisted by cables to a considerable height.<eos> Suddenly a cable breaks, and the horse is dashed to the ground.<eos> But it's not hurt.<eos> It leaps up and gallops away impeded only by a heavy log, which it's obliged to drag along the ground.
She's running on all eight. Checks out fine.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.<eos> It's a goddamn shame putting bullshit like that on a classic.<eos> You may as well slap neon lights on it.
Well, your mom's right, honey. You are a little mermaid.<eos> You know that moment between the sets when it's quiet and the waves haven't even formed yet, it's just energy surging through the water.<eos> Well, that's the time to be patient.<eos> Listen to your instinct.<eos> Trust it.
Too crazy.<eos> Well, they usually do outgrow it.<eos> - What if they don't?<eos> - He will.<eos> Well, there's... there's medication, but why don't we cross that bridge if we come to it?
It doesn't require soil.<eos> You don't need to water it.<eos> It absorbs moisture from the air.<eos> It doesn't even need roots.<eos> But they make it more stable.
What the hell is going on?<eos> Divine intervention...<eos> If you consider Satan divine.<eos> You did get in one good punch.<eos> It was a long time coming.
Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough.<eos> But...<eos> Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert.<eos> It's a simple mission.<eos> The grunts catch the alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here.
- I'm having heart palpitations.<eos> You know, Runks? I'm glad I came.<eos> I'm glad you came too.<eos> What I care about is the script, because right now it's a fucking mess.<eos> - Agreed. it needs some work.
Why are yöu burning our house with yöu? - Quiet. Yes, exactly.<eos> yöu heard that?<eos> yöu heard that?<eos> After ruining my family he is talking about his house.<eos> Daddy, why don't yöu dive and snatch it?
OK. That's good, isn't it?<eos> The reason you've been unwell is that the tumour is in your temporal lobe, here.<eos> It's been causing pressure on your brain.<eos> And will it happen again? It will, and worse, it will grow.<eos> If we do nothing, and let it grow, it will kill you.
There was a nice change.<eos> And the first time I saw was amazing to me.<eos> L... I... it just blew my mind.<eos> It just blew my mind that it could be done in a way that the horse would cooperate, like the people, and not be scarred up and afraid for life.<eos> I couldn't believe what that man could do with a horse without anything on it.
Hey, guys, guys, before you leave, I have an announcement to make.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It'll only take a minute.<eos> Merriam-Webster describes "opportunity" as a favorable juncture of circumstance.<eos> Now, someone here has tremendous talent, and I want to encourage it.
Pterosaur wings were clearly very efficient in the air. But they evolved at a cost.<eos> Using wireframe computer simulations of pterosaur movement,<eos> David Unwin has investigated how they moved on the ground.<eos> What I've done is feed to the vital statistics of this pterosaur into the computer, and build this model that you can see on the screen.<eos> It's easy to see that walking on flat surfaces would have been quite difficult for it.
I really don't think that's what's going on here.<eos> Look, I know my family, okay?<eos> They think that I'm still that flaky, irresponsible girl that I was six months ago, before I accidentally got pregnant. But, you know, I'm gonna show them that they're wrong.<eos> How?<eos> We're gonna get the cat back, we're gonna give it a great home, and... and we're gonna take that C.P.R. class ourselves.
[The "Economists"]<eos> You know economists, in fact, are not economists at all.<eos> They're propagandists of money value and you will find that all of their models basically get down to token exchanges that are true to profit of one side or both sides or whatever but they are completely disconnected from the actually existing world of reproduction.<eos> In Ohio, an old man failed to pay his electric bill you may be familiar with the case and the electric company turned off the electricity and he died.<eos> The reason they turned it off was because it wouldn't have been profitable for them to keep it on because he didn't pay his bill.
It was nothing to do with the affair.<eos> Unless Lucy Wilson was planning blackmail.<eos> Which is what the police say.<eos> But where's the evidence?<eos> There's no evidence she even threatened it.
The walk-by with the stink eye.<eos> A stink-eye-walk-by?<eos> !<eos> Aw, hell no!<eos> I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed.
It's unlucky!<eos> The jacket's unlucky!<eos> You're unlucky!<eos> The zipper is stuck.<eos> I can't get it off. All right. Yank it over his head!
What is it?<eos> Forgive me, but according to our contacts there are forces moving in, so we're advancing the plan.<eos> Midnight tonight, long after we're gone, we're blowing this whole thing sky high.<eos> Won't that stop the Miracle?<eos> On the contrary, it'll become never-ending.
It's February, minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the few wells people have are frozen over.<eos> But, amazingly, water appears here as snow.<eos> The snow doesn't fall here.<eos> It's blown over 3,000 kilometres from Siberia.<eos> And these bitter winds means it never settles for long.
Because I am not fully in command of it.<eos> So the fact that you are a cardinal pleases me as it distresses me.<eos> I thought I would not be cardinal for today.<eos> Then my heart is in danger.<eos> Would you endanger it, Cardinal Borgia?
Mr. Bear.<eos> You named your Teddy Bear Mr. Bear?<eos> That's, like, the worst Teddy Bear name in the world.<eos> I was five years old.<eos> All right, well, just shoot your unimaginatively named bear and put it out of its misery.
What sucked about all that was, you know...<eos> I don't think the drum performances were the best.<eos> They didn't...<eos> They weren't horrible.<eos> If I listen to a song and I don't think it has the thing that it needs, it's not necessarily gonna get past me and get on an album.
He's turned it into an art form.<eos> We're talking politicians, Hollywood starlets, even cheating spouses.<eos> You know, word is, Rockwell made his bones a few years back by taking down a congressman.<eos> You see, the rep received some serious praise for the speech that he gave that introduced a bill in D.C., right?<eos> Rockwell, the genius that he is, goes and writes a fake political essay, back-dates it, and then bribes a clerk to file it in the Library of Congress.
So you jog now?<eos> Every morning.<eos> (Laughs) Since when?<eos> I sit on my arse for the rest of the day.<eos> Oh, it's certainly not suffering.
- Be, they, Kotov.<eos> Melezhko started to cry of that combat Why come back alive.<eos> The order is to stand up to death.<eos> He sent it to hell Melezhko a gun.<eos> Once - it detects the second time and while pulling the trigger
Six feet under screams But no one seems to hear a thing?<eos> Do you know That there's still a chance for you?<eos> 'Cause there 's a spark in you<eos> You just gotta ignite the light<eos> And lei it Shine
Please, please.<eos> Can't you just make her go away?<eos> It's...inconvenient.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, when Delk assigned Raydor this audit, I openly opposed it.
Now I'm here and I'm staying till I figure it out.<eos> I know this isn't the life you were expecting.<eos> It's not all bad.<eos> The whole world is coming for you.<eos> Then let it come.
Hey, but this doesn't look the same as the last set.<eos> Oh, it's because this is the revised version.<eos> The irrelevant portions have been removed.<eos> -=The 50th Annual Meeting of the Korean Neurosurgical Society.=-<eos> Whether the boundary of the tumor is clearly defined, or whether it's accompanied by edema, or whether it spreads to other areas, etc., according to our statistical analysis, these events do not influence a patient's survival period.
We can't afford someone panicking, doing something rash.<eos> This isn't optional.<eos> We can leave anytime.<eos> I'll just use my irresistible charm on your new boss.<eos> It's resistible.
The stitching is all done by one seamstress to keep the weave constant.<eos> And, joy of joys, the useless Volvo sat nav of other Astons has been ditched for one that works.<eos> However, before I can give this car a clean bill of health, I have to address the elephant in the room.<eos> The worry is, they've made another track monster.<eos> They've fallen for the same old trick - it's got to go round the Nurburgring, etc, etc.
But not any engine.<eos> This was an engine...<eos> There's an interesting story behind it.<eos> When BMW bought the rights to the Rolls-Royce name in the late 20th century, they had the opportunity to create the ultimate luxury car for the 21st century.<eos> And they thought, "Maybe we ought to give it the ultimate engine."
I think I found your friend, Stinky John.<eos> I was able to use your description of a mole on his chin.<eos> - Traced him to a clinical trial for basal cell carcinoma treatment.<eos> Oh, my God, he's got cancer.<eos> Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It won't fall down.<eos> 'If I'm honest, that wasn't a great suggestion.<eos> 'Everything else we tried failed as well.'<eos> Back!<eos> Give it some welly.
Weather, W-e-a.<eos> That night, a fire ravaged the forest, and the chrysalis never became a butterﬂy.<eos> At dawn, the ashes cold, the tree still stood, but his heart was charred, scarred by the flames, scarred at grief.<eos> Scarred by grief.<eos> Ever since then, when a bird alights on the tree, the tree tells it about the chrysalis that never woke up.
Look at me, son.<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I am. The only way to conquer fear is to face it straight on.
Hey, where are you guys going?<eos> ! Tennis house-- huge bash.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're just gonna let them go?<eos> Stop them! If you love a butterfly, you'll let it fly.
-No, no, no!<eos> What the hell is going on Pythia?<eos> A full day of his numb legs!<eos> You hurt him and that needle is not felt.<eos> Julia, what it is?
But the Nazca people and their culture mysteriously vanished some 1,200 years ago, though not before etching a series of enormous geoglyphs-- or ground drawings-- into the nearby desert floor.<eos> The Nazca Lines were an important element of their religious worship and their ceremonies.<eos> They would walk through these lines during their ceremonies, breaking ceramics and offering important elements to the deities from their own culture.<eos> The great geoglyphs are composed of dozens of spirals, triangles and trapezoids, as well as miles of zigzagging lines.<eos> This whole flat area, which covers several square miles, is covered in stones made of iron oxide, either red or black, and that's what gives it the darkish, brownish red appearance.
Tailor will be delighted with the extra large, built-in, pin cushion.<eos> Papa makes all of our hats, himself ... And, crafts each one to meet the particular needs of every Smurf.<eos> Takes him all year.<eos> Grouchy, I made a hat I know you'll love ...<eos> If, only you'd give it a chance.
(Sniffles) I thought I was helping.<eos> This is helping?<eos> I thought you meant the things that you said on that tape, that you wished your country had the same freedoms as America.<eos> Well, it's still my country!<eos> (Pounds table) And it needs to change.
Basically, this object was designed so that it can only be opened by one person.<eos> Mira.<eos> Lock it away, will you?<eos> Whoa, what's with him?<eos> Uh, he drank some unfermented Taroca root and it's not sitting too well.
Wait a second.<eos> - I thought you mugged him.<eos> - Yeah, that's right, but then he came back acting all Charlie Bronson.<eos> You know, flashes his gun, says there's something real important in his wallet and that he's tired of being pushed around and taken advantage of.<eos> Did you give it back? Nope.
Dad, we've been through this already I want to make money.<eos> I want to be a millionaire and I can't do that by serving in the forces<eos> But I can only achieve that after becoming a stock-broker Money isn't everything, Rohan<eos> You should choose a career you love because that's what will drive you to success and happiness<eos> I loved my country and serving it as an officer truly made me happy
Me, too.<eos> Whoo, that eggnog is deadly.<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> I should just put it off till later, after the holidays.
- Yeah.<eos> He wants me to look at his dick.<eos> I flatly refused.<eos> What does he want you to look at it for?<eos> Says there's something wrong with it.
This morning, we executed the test plan, we flew a great jet, and we came back in here and landed.<eos> I thought the landing was pretty good, I don't know about you guys.<eos> The journey has only just begun.<eos> The real test of the 787 will come as it endures the daily rigors of airline service.<eos> But perhaps one day, 40 or 50 years from now, it too will have an honored place among the legends of flight.
It wants to live - pure survival instinct.<eos> What's the rush?<eos> It's got no food, no water.<eos> We can track every move he makes.<eos> Let it die of thirst.
Well, you are definitely a pro.<eos> You're very good at this.<eos> So are you.<eos> You just need to listen to that voice inside.<eos> Trust it.
I had them made.<eos> You probably think it's silly.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You love your country.<eos> You've dedicated your life to it.
May I ask what persuaded you to be so bold as to invest in an all-female production of the Scottish play?<eos> You have an incredible talent, Ginny.<eos> I saw that the night we met.<eos> A talent like that is a gift from God.<eos> To see it go to waste over something as trivial as money, that'd be a travesty.
Use your radio show..<eos> .. reach your cause to your listeners..<eos> ..try to get them to your side.<eos> Rally enough support to force the judiciary to listen to your plea.<eos> Maybe you can give it a name.
Heave-ho. Heave-ho. - Careful careful.<eos> Where did you get this elephant from? You could've at least brought an elephant from the circus. Hey come on move!<eos> Hey stop it!<eos> - What's going on? Hey stop it!<eos> Hey stop it!
-Now... pinky swear not to tell.<eos> Pinky swear?<eos> Is that not something we stopped doing in second grade?<eos> Corrie's been my best mate for as long as I can remember.<eos> Whenever I had a problem, I'd go tell Corrie and somehow, she'd always fix it.
They hang rat bins on lamp posts.<eos> Hanging rat bins on lamp posts.<eos> Here's another one.<eos> A rat.<eos> Grab it, don't let it get away.
It's more than a machine.<eos> This cylon will become a tireless worker... Who won't need to be paid.<eos> It won't retire or get sick. He won't have rights,<eos> Or objections, or complaints.<eos> It will do anything and everything we ask of it Without question.
Are you threatening withdrawal?<eos> Yes or no, joe.<eos> "there's a wolf in me... "fangs pointed for tearing gashes.<eos> "a red tongue for raw meat and the hot lapping of blood.<eos> I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me." "and the wilderness will not let it go."
All right? That's cool.<eos> [Tina] Hey. Sorry about yesterday.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I do a pretty good job of being in denial... about the hopelessness of my condition.<eos> I think I just kind of freaked out when I actually had to face it.
It was all your fault to begin with, Ron.<eos> You don't get to just waltz in here and be the fun dad, while I'm the one stuck always having to say no.<eos> can we please not argue in front of them?<eos> You guys should've seen it.<eos> Waffles chased down a motorcycle and gave it a flat tire.
Look at this.<eos> Rocketship 7.<eos> Hey, I used to watch that when I was a little boy.<eos> The Sweetlees, and there was Mr. Beeper and Promo the Robot.<eos> Well, the way this craft is designed, it could never leave the earth's atmosphere.
There's a lot of blood and a lot of glass.<eos> Okay, so Dom comes through here.<eos> He stops for some reason.<eos> Somebody sneaks up, smashes the driver's window.<eos> Second assailant smashes the passenger-side window, forces his way in, throws it in park, they struggle.
Suck it in, dude.<eos> Yeah, well, the thing is, Jerome came on to me, and, you know, he's going through a real rough patch right now.<eos> And I didn't want to hurt his feelings, you know, 'cause he's a really cool dude, so I told him I had a boyfriend.<eos> So, I guess, you know, what I'm asking is, uh, well, do you think you could be my boyfriend?<eos> Your junk looks like it's been crushed in.
Sorry, Mr. McCormack, we'll do better next week.<eos> Unfortunately, there isn't going to be a next week.<eos> Mr. McCormack, no!<eos> Eh, sorry, Clancy.<eos> The only way I can recoup my losses on this horse is to shoot it in the face and collect the life insurance I took out when I married it. (cocks gun)
It's a guaranteed winner. Look, I've been holding it back with tranquilizers so it loses and the odds go way up.<eos> !<eos> That horse is a joke!<eos> (quietly): Then at next week's Langley Derby,<eos> I'll let it run to its full potential, and we'll make a fortune!
Change the focus of the inquiry.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is something that the union should be doing and I'm surprised I haven't heard from them at all on this.<eos> Forget it, the union is useless.<eos> It doesn't have any teeth.
I pulled his records.<eos> This gentleman used to weigh 400 pounds or so until a gastric bypass which brought down his weight considerably.<eos> Then for some reason, last night, he decided to go on a Twinkie binge.<eos> So he died from a Twinkie binge?<eos> Well, after he blew out the band around his stomach he filled it up until it burst.
That was the truth behind Manami's death.<eos> As the two of them said the police determined that it was an accident.<eos> I have no intention of fighting that judgement.<eos> It wasn't simply the pouch that killed her.<eos> I took a look at it and even taking into account that she was only four it can't deliver enough of a shock to stop someone's heart.
We knew only your men disguise as student if not you, who else?<eos> Ok, you wanna play hard ball? I'm ready.<eos> I'll be here every fucking day until I find it.<eos> OK<eos> Whoever took it, give it back.
Awaken those feelings in you<eos> You are your own support<eos> Banish all fear from your mind<eos> Your mind will be your eyes lf you have the fire to live<eos> Open your mind and let it see
- It was too big, too many empty rooms.<eos> Does it ever bother you, Amy, that your life doesn't make any sense?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Need a proper look.<eos> - Got to draw its fire, give it a target.
- So sad.<eos> I so frustrated. You know.<eos> A reward challenge for chocolate,and james... Gets hurt again.<eos> And he can have a serious injury. Like his knee,did you see?<eos> It was-- t's just a ligament,i think.
Guy came, set all these traps and all and he finally got it. But my aunt, you know, she didn't believe it.<eos> I mean, she kept insisting she could still hear the thing.<eos> I mean, you could not tell her any different.<eos> She started keeping an old umbrella, you know, by her chair.<eos> Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it. Even gave it a name.
You, er... You ever had one of those days, you wish it would end, but somehow it never does?<eos> More than my share.<eos> Well, that day's today.<eos> Cheers.<eos> And if you do this for me, all right, you're going to help end it.
In fact, it's abundant throughout the solar system, but here on Earth it exists as a gas and it bubbles up from the floor of this lake.<eos> The floor of Lake Eyak is covered in rotting vegetation, you know, dead leaves and bits of trees, twigs, and that's been broken down by bacteria which produce the gas that bubbles up from the floor of the lake.<eos> That gas is methane and we've been collecting it all night underneath this upturned boat so that I can take a sample of it in this bag.<eos> Now, on Earth, methane is very unstable.<eos> If you give it... a little kick... in the presence of oxygen, then you get what chemists call an exothermic reaction.
Questions for Karl-ee!<eos> Yeah, okay, no. Fair enough, that works.<eos> Um, this is from Jim and Bob in Manchester.<eos> Karl, if you could talk to any animal,<eos> Which one would it be and what would you say to it?
William, I was bullied my entire life. I grew up with a "handicapable" sister.<eos> I know very well how cruel people can be.<eos> Was it difficult?<eos> Did it make me stronger?<eos> - It's the fear that's the worst. I never know when it's coming. I can't concentrate.
But I can't have one.<eos> You're two for two.<eos> Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?<eos> Oh, Lord, will this day never end?<eos> As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it's convenient, there's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.
However, I did find this on the back of his head.<eos> Small contusion.<eos> Looks like blunt-force trauma, in the shape of a ball-peen hammer maybe?<eos> With a wooden handle, judging by the abrasions I also discovered in his throat.<eos> So he was hit with a hammer, and then choked with it.
- You hear from Stamos?<eos> - No. You believe it?<eos> The guy probably hasn't even read the script yet.<eos> It's 40 pages.<eos> How long could it take?
What happened?<eos> - Lets see...<eos> Don't...<eos> He twisted his ankle.<eos> And no one here to straighten it out.
Breathe Hank.<eos> You gotta breathe, man.<eos> Ryan, do me a favor.<eos> In the bed of my truck, there's a pool skimmer. It's a long pole with a net on it.<eos> Will you go grab it and shove it up his ass?
I'll escape.<eos> We both know that.<eos> And before you make that call, will you wait eight more seconds?<eos> Now, Jules, please, look at that polar bear.<eos> Look at it right in the eye. You tell me that it's a murderer.
Do you know how much this embarrasses me?" Stuff like that.<eos> I-I think he was having an affair.<eos> Did you ever see the woman come out the house or I.D. a car?<eos> He loved that bear.<eos> He devoted his whole life to it.
Just a little thing called peace on earth.<eos> It's an energy source.<eos> Once fully formed, it'll provide limitless power very cheaply...<eos> One less reason for war.<eos> Well, that is a very lovely concept, but nothing is gonna happen to it here, not on my watch.
Uh, Grayson's phone.<eos> He left it in my office.<eos> There is a text message, and I am going to return it... without looking.<eos> Grayson's not in his office.<eos> Then I will put it on his desk and leave it there, without looking.
He was bragging about the cake that he got for me, chocolate with raspberry filling.<eos> - It's thoughtful.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except it's his favourite.<eos> Now, is that because I never said out loud what my favourite cake was or because he didn't listen when I said it?
Some of us fear, "She may never forgive me."<eos> Others worry, "She might learn the truth."<eos> A few wonder, "Could he send me away?"<eos> Yes, the world is a scary place.<eos> It's even more terrifying if we have to face it
But what do we have to eat?<eos> Are we eating chicken tonight?<eos> I want to eat one of those mothers.<eos> What do you do break the neck or cut its head off?<eos> We're thinking we need to break it.
Worried about my sister?<eos> Sisters-in-law who inquire with affection.<eos> On sitting for lunch, I made this brinjal dish specially for you, son-in-law.<eos> Mother-in-law who serves with great affection and care.<eos> Father-in-law, who says add ghee to it, it'll be fantastic.
This is what I wanted to show you, Hank.<eos> We're linked to SHIELD's orbital telescope.<eos> It spotted the object a few days ago.<eos> The team here thought it was a comet at first, but it was moving faster than anything they'd ever seen.<eos> We're trying to get a better look at it.
Are you proposing we sneak through Syria?<eos> Sneak across it.<eos> If we find a garage, a workshop, modify the cars for desert sneaking...<eos> I love the sound of the plan. I'll give it a go.<eos> I think it's fantastic.
Okay.<eos> I just was actually in the area and so I just figured I'd swing by and see if he was around.<eos> Because I had to return his pen. Had to return this pen.<eos> He left this.<eos> And I just thought I should really return it before he, you know, freaks out.
You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard.<eos> Construction of the presidential bunker has also been completed.<eos> Now, if we sold one warhead on the black market, I could continue my research.<eos> I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor, but this world is messy enough. No.<eos> What it needs is unification, leadership.
Nevertheless, the manager of our local Chinese restaurant Was delighted to take our booking.<eos> Maybe the feeling in my stomach wasn't love at all, but a viral infection. Or food poisoning. Or a coronary attack.<eos> S.M. Greenfield, in an article in Sociological Quarterly, Writes that love is kept alive by modern capitalism only in order to...<eos> Motivate individuals where there is no other means of motivating them, to occupy the positions husband-wife and wife-mother and form nuclear families that are essential not only for reproduction and socialisation but also to maintain the existing arrangement for distributing consumer goods and services,<eos> and in general, to keep the social system in proper working order, and thus maintaining it as a going concern.
-Your best yet. -I'm so glad you like it.<eos> I don't know where to start.<eos> Just start on the bread, maybe, then work my way up there.<eos> You eat that. You liked it so much.<eos> He loves it.
But it's the playoffs.<eos> As an alternative to television, might I recommend a stroll to the hidden waterfall?<eos> Might you recommend putting honey in my ears and having me fall asleep on an anthill?<eos> Honey, the waterfall sounds amazing. A little romance.<eos> You'll find that the Eden program creates a palace of solitude, if you just give yourself over to it.
And then it got stuck.<eos> Stuck?<eos> Up his ass.<eos> I hate stickys.<eos> He was jumping up and down and everything, but his ass just swallowed it whole.
And this is my girlfriend Samara Dubois.<eos> Oh, I read "US Weekly. " I know who this is.<eos> The interior designer who stole your heart. That's right.<eos> I hired her to decorate my chill chalet.<eos> She said, "First things first. You should just call it a 'chilet. "'
- Studying is hard and boring.<eos> Teaching is hard and boring.<eos> So what you're telling me is to be bored, and then bored and finally, bored again but this time for the rest of my life?<eos> This whole stupid country is bored.<eos> There's no life in it, or colour or fun.
It's so strange.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just seems different, preoccupied.<eos> And his limp is definitely getting worse.<eos> He says it isn't, but...
So much for your hollywood ending.<eos> Tess.<eos> So I was wrong about the cold thing.<eos> But spot jumped off Fargo for a reason.<eos> Well, maybe it didn't like
What was that all about?<eos> - Alright.<eos> - That your car?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It still needs a coupld of bits.
Calabria!<eos> Sonny Calabria!<eos> A doctor.<eos> I need a doctor.<eos> It won't be necessary.
Last time I had this,you were begging to help me.<eos> I probably shouldn't have touched you the last time.<eos> You need a medical doctor.<eos> I'm not asking you to perform surgery; just do what you did last time,and fix it with your magic knuckles...<eos> Look,there's no one I trust more to get my back and crack it,than you.
Hmm?<eos> Everything okay? Fine.<eos> Okay, people.<eos> Okay. Well, can we give her a fake tumor?<eos> Well, we could inject her brain with some contrast dye, have it pool into her cranial cavity, but there might be some side effects.
If it comes down to either-or, we go big picture and we take the reactor.<eos> - Are there any questions?<eos> - What if we encounter the freak?<eos> Avoidance, if you can.<eos> - Keep it occupied.
Stop it, you're just looking silly, d'you want other people to see you, looking silly?<eos> If he gives you any more trouble, your dad's going to punch his face in.<eos> I'll punch his bloody mother.<eos> Have you got that, David?<eos> I've booked the car for 7.30, but I might have to leave it on standby.
-What are you afraid of?<eos> Toddler to His will come here if you talk to us?<eos> I have nothing more to say, okay?<eos> But if Eric was killed, I think that you should take a look in my garage.<eos> He rented it to me, he needed something in Ystad.
Oh, I- l don't know.<eos> Have you- have you ever seen Eleanor- l mean, since she passed away?<eos> No.<eos> And I wish I did because you're terrified of forgetting that person.<eos> I mean, you hang on to the pain even because you're afraid that if you let it go...
He just wouldn't listen.<eos> I've been all alone with this thing going on 10 years now.<eos> That's when people started disappearing.<eos> They didn't just disappear. That thing ate them.<eos> And you've fed them to it.
Why isn't Rush here?<eos> We're not convinced Rush wants to come home.<eos> And do I have to remind you how much you have to gain, personally, in all of this?<eos> Assuming I live.<eos> The ship doesn't have enough power to dial back to Earth, and as we've seen recently, when the ship runs out of juice, it finds a star and refills its tanks.
After the kind of ordeal you went through, happy is wrong.<eos> This is how you're supposed to feel.<eos> Your brain's all jumbled up trying to sort things out.<eos> Try to roll with it.<eos> Let it do what it needs to do.
Hey! Good morning.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You pitch freddie my idea?<eos> He loved it,
And the ignition source was this battery.<eos> Let me see.<eos> It's a capacitor.<eos> It's a time-release battery.<eos> So it's the kind that stores a small current,lets it build,and then discharges all at once?
Got the telephonic search warrant.<eos> Searched the whole thing,but there are no bomb-making materials.<eos> How about the car?<eos> We can place this at the scene.<eos> Let's take a look at it.
That's where we tell the story of who we are and why we do things.<eos> That's also the side that was wrong.<eos> Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical, doesn't choose which details to look at, makes connections you could never see.<eos> You owe your insight to the "mute loser."<eos> I'll send it tickets to a Phillies game.
Maybe they want to scare us, or maybe they're just confused.<eos> We're going to do a pious donation and pour holy water for them.<eos> Hmm...<eos> Let's talk about magic some more.<eos> A child has a digestive illness and is going to die, so the parents give him a medicinal herb, but it doesn't cure it.
So technically, it's staring at me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's from a small town.<eos> It's never seen a big businessman like you before.<eos> Well, tell it to act more professional.
Hello, hello.<eos> Grayson, Kim Kaswell.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Oh, little office-warming gift.<eos> Why don't we find a place to put it?
- Andrew's not here yet. - I'll be in in five.<eos> - Sorkin hates your guts.<eos> I hate yours, but right now we're all gonna have to find a way to get along.<eos> She has a boyfriend.<eos> She said they don't have a label on it.
- Sorkin hates your guts.<eos> I hate yours, but right now we're all gonna have to find a way to get along.<eos> She has a boyfriend.<eos> She said they don't have a label on it.<eos> Let's just hope he puts a rubber on it.
Are you six?<eos> if i was two times six, you'd know it by now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, sit with me, hmm?<eos> the world is not a pretty thing When you look at it too close.
But I could hear somebody and they heard me.<eos> My goodness, Sally Draper, try not to take everything so personally.<eos> Jeez Louise.<eos> The phone is cheap.<eos> It's everyday, and you can't trust it.
However, we are now charged with selling it.<eos> So, what?<eos> What?<eos> Back in Apprentice land, we outlined the problem.<eos> As far as I can make out, the Volkswagen Scirocco is a pretty car, and what they've done is, they've put the engine from a canal boat in it.
He did say he's been getting strength from a particular proverb.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Let's do a quick list. "You can't teach an old dog new tricks"?<eos> "A bird in the hand's worth two in the bush"?<eos> - "If it's brown, flush it down"?
Open water has become a rare thing in Yellowstone.<eos> Out on the frozen grasslands, the bison are struggling, too.<eos> This year is already the snowiest for the last decade, snowier than many of this herd have experienced in their lives.<eos> Now, as the snow gets deeper than a critical four feet, the effort of swinging this massive head back and forth for so little reward is becoming too much.<eos> Though the snow front is passing through, it's followed by the wind, which now starts to scour the heart of Yellowstone.
He was used to old houses.<eos> What does this have to do with how he died?<eos> Victoria abner has no arrests, but three years ago A neighbor took out a restraining order<eos> Against her--some argument about the neighbor's dog.<eos> Victoria got a little in-your-face about it.
Your Honor, I would like to introduce to the court Defense Exhibit A.<eos> Is this the statue that you saw in Mr. Gildea's studio?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Monk, the statue is my client's alibi.<eos> It's kind of important that you take a look at it.
Then you had the phone call.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> After you left, I looked out onto the ledge.<eos> I went over.<eos> I wanted to help it, if only to end its pain.
Now, if you could just sign this letter of intend, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion.<eos> You okay, Pat?<eos> I was just thinking about how... I had this car, 'cause...<eos> This Italian car.<eos> And I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil.
Hey.<eos> We wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> Oh, I wish you had called.<eos> I swear, he was right there, just eating a Belgian waffle!<eos> Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying this gouda! Oh!
- Oh, that?<eos> Well,<eos> I cut a few scenes together for my movie and showed it my father.<eos> Now, granted, the guy, he produces big-budget movies, most of which are completely soulless, but still, he responded to it.<eos> He liked it.
- Is matt around?<eos> I've got his check.<eos> - Uh, matt is on a delivery.<eos> Just leave it here.<eos> I'll take it.
In terms of being able to really have beautiful stability.<eos> your elbows, your hips.<eos> Just let it fly right where it's supposed to go.<eos> The Zen masters in Zen archery too, they don't pull the arrow, they push the arrow, and it's the same with that pistol.<eos> You draw, and you just, just push it and just guide it.
Tellem I'm a good guy, a guy who happens to be mind-blowingly good at sex.<eos> Yeah, see, but that, all the talk about all the sex?<eos> It's not what I think of as good-guy behavior.<eos> I hate women like you.<eos> You string guys along, acting like sex is some prize, when really, you're just afraid that once you give it up, he'll lose interest.
The one thing my dad always told me was to go after my dreams.<eos> So what's one of your dreams?<eos> To star in Vik's movie. So go for it. What's stopping you?<eos> It's a little bit more complicated than that.<eos> I mean, there's only one role and three Cheetahs want it.
Can you identify it?<eos> Someone else lost a ringin your cab yesterday?<eos> This is new york,buddy.<eos> You can't trust anyone. I try and tellim thatall the time.<eos> It's a rectangle with,uh,all these little edgesthat make it twinkly.
This is your last chance.<eos> If you want to back out, now is the time.<eos> Good.<eos> OPERATION MARDONIUS OSLO HARBOUR, 27 APRIL 1943<eos> Take this bloody dog away and get it something to eat!
- Come on, let me out.<eos> Listen to me. You sign that contract, you're gonna spend the rest of eternity with monsters like this.<eos> - Why isn't he eating the bacon?<eos> - We should have cooked it.<eos> Benji, get it right in his face.
Come on,pull it out.<eos> you gotta go to my place and get the pills out of there before mary gets to them.<eos> You could dump them if you have to.<eos> Trey took the slate from our backyard.<eos> He said he needed it for something.
I'm doing them gypsy-style.<eos> Andalusian.<eos> Like you.<eos> The unconscious mind, Federico it rises like a beast within me.<eos> I let it speak and it produces such wonders.
It's not him.<eos> - What about your gut instinct?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Funny things guts and instincts.<eos> - Trust it!
- Is that why you kept a piece of him?<eos> Joe's appendix floating in formaldehyde.<eos> - Oh, God. - Except you found out quick preserving a human is tougher. You had to dump the body.<eos> That appendix is mine, formerly Joe's. He gave it to me as a joke.<eos> And to thank me for taking him to the hospital when it burst.
I was pretty upset about it Because I didn't want it to come to that. I was kind of scared.<eos> I didn't want to inject this oil into my body.<eos> I thought it was weird.<eos> He's not a huge guy, you know.<eos> He's 6' if he's lucky and so I knew that it was definitely going to help because that's what it does, what steroids do-- make you bigger.
Barn, cellar, spade.<eos> HAUNTING SINGING<eos> BABY CRIES<eos> READS: Let the day perish wherein I was born and the night in which it was said, there is a man child conceived. Let that that day be darkness, let not God regard it from above.<eos> Neither let the light shine upon it. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it, let a cloud dwell upon it, let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Months, at least.<eos> Hopefully the iPod adapter will help me sell it.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> How could you have any trouble selling this treasure?<eos> The passenger door doesn't work, the gas mileage is horrible and if it actually goes over 22 miles per hour, it stalls.
That's a great getaway car. Or follow car.<eos> So I want you to shoot it up for me.<eos> - You want us to shoot the-- - the car!<eos> That pretty I-talian car.<eos> I want you to put some po-lice lead into it.
Doesn't sound like just a petty grudge.<eos> So what does he want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My kids are really pestering me for a pet.<eos> If you can't find a home for it...
Oh, did you guys break up?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> None of that.<eos> It's-- it's the damn cancer.<eos> I thought we had it beat, but it's still biting my ass.
I wasn't planning to.<eos> This is a journey you need to take.<eos> You need to face this man.<eos> But when you do, please don't choose revenge.<eos> Let your anger out and then let it go.
"So long as men can breathe "or eyes can see,<eos> "so long lives this and gives life"... "to thee."<eos> You may now kiss the bride.<eos> It's hard to believe after all these years we've got a new stepdad.<eos> I give it six months.
Oh, but you are wonderful!<eos> Now just stop, stop there.<eos> Oi!<eos> Fly boy!<eos> Don't let it get away!
Let me see if it feels right in my hand.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't open the...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Don't let it get out of the lab.
Like, if you wide, it look like your dick's at sea and shit.<eos> I don't know what the fuck I got.<eos> But, fellas, you know how you can tell if a woman think you got a big dick?<eos> You know how you can tell if a woman think you got a big dick?<eos> After you whip it out, she just starts looking at it.
Love.<eos> Love. I do it for Love. Love.<eos> Love. Love.<eos> There'll be girls across the nation<eos> Nice trousers, Mork. ... bottle it up and get down to the heart of it.
- No one's making you kill us.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You got this dark pit inside you, I know.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it.
Donna Martin graduates!<eos> Donna Martin graduates!<eos> Donna Martin graduates!<eos> So, what do you do when a system, a society, doesn't work?<eos> Do you just allow it to consume itself, to take down those around it?
We need at least 347 tons up here.<eos> Shoot that dog, Corporal!<eos> Sir, {shouldn't we be saving our rounds for enemy combatants? } we should save our rounds for the enemy.<eos> Shoot that fucking dog!<eos> Darnold, give it a piece of your jerky.
I'm trying.<eos> It's the parasite, it's moving.<eos> Maybe it knows we're going after it.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think it instinctually wants to get away from the radiation source, and we've just shown it the way out.
What about this blanket?<eos> Does this feel heavy to you?<eos> Yeah,and rigid.<eos> That's not exactly baby friendly.<eos> Let's take a look at it.
That's the way most things in life get done.<eos> He's gone, mama.<eos> He's like a ghost.<eos> That's what fear is like.<eos> You look it in its face, And you see it for what it is, and then it's gone
And that is the point. It invariably transfers true wealth for the individual to the banks.<eos> For, if you are unable to pay for your mortgage, they will take your property.<eos> This is particularly enraging when you realize, that not only is such a default inevitable due to the fractional reserve practice.<eos> But, also because of the fact that the money that the bank loaned to you didn't even legally exist in the first place.<eos> In 1969 there was a Minnesota court case involving a man named Jerome Daly who was challenging the foreclosure of his home by the bank, which provided the loan to purchase it.
How can you be so sure?<eos> Hennessey.<eos> In here, she is judge, jury and executioner.<eos> The race is her baby.<eos> Anyone who threatens it, she kills.
- Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Don't mention it.<eos> But, listen, to be honest, after all the shit that we've been through... I don't know if we can trust our government anymore.<eos> - Trust the government? - Yeah.<eos> Heck. I'm in the government and I don't even trust it.
Most of the things I've seen, I'd never want to draw.<eos> Then draw the rest.<eos> Okay. I'll try.<eos> You have talent, Jolene.<eos> It'll come to you, if you let it.
- Eldridge, burn him!<eos> - Get out of the way,<eos> - Drop your phone!<eos> Make him put it down!<eos> Go get it!
- Yeah.<eos> See, you get a good piece of meat...<eos> - No!<eos> ...you can't just stick it up on a hook.<eos> You gotta give it that little something extra.
You have to wait for the hot water to burble up.<eos> You reminded me twice.<eos> And I got an emergency generator in case the storm turns into anything and you lose power.<eos> It's never been turned on before, so I wouldn't count on it.<eos> If it gets stuck, kick it hard.
And so is the Quorum.<eos> And I guess I just finished the shortest presidency in colonial history.<eos> Yes, well, don't look so relieved, Mr. Adama.<eos> Because you were dealt a crisis and you knew exactly what to do.<eos> You faced it boldly.
Nobody works on their relationships anymore.<eos> Everyone's out for instant gratification, and I don't want to be like that.<eos> I agree.<eos> You're right.<eos> But also, I've seen you in this thing from day 1, and you've always given it a chance.
Um, i'm not sure yet.<eos> Keep rubbing.<eos> Bree, i know you're upset, but you've got to eat.<eos> I'm just so mad at myself.<eos> I should have realized that the maternal instinct is so strong, that even danielle would develop it.
ramiro vasquez.<eos> it seems you did not kill me after all. uh, no, friday doesn't really help me.<eos> i really need to get the wheelchair here tonight.<eos> well, this thing can walk and talk.<eos> can't you just stick it on the turnpike and give it money for tolls? thank you.
Yeah, okay, maybe I'll come tonight.<eos> Yeah, and wear something a little sluttier.<eos> Give her something to look at.<eos> I guess I want to show her a little bit of arm, 'cause I don't want her to lose interest entirely.<eos> Yeah, you don't want the bear to go completely hungry, you don't want it to attack, so give it a little bait, keep it interested.
That sounds like a great place to start.<eos> - Has anyone touched her computer? - No.<eos> No, I told them that you wanted to have a look at it first.<eos> Nobody's touched it.<eos> I'm going to need to take it apart. This is going to take some time.
So come on. Bring it.<eos> I already did. You just didn't know it.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> The sedative works fast.<eos> It's probably best just to go with it.
- Thanks, i'm fine.<eos> - It's a good omelet.<eos> In 1783, Napoleon bet Marie Luigia that he could make a perfect omelet.<eos> The secret, he explained, was to flip the omelet in the air and catch it in a frying pan.<eos> When Napoleon flipped the omelet, it fell to the ground.
Dava's... Well, hopefully, she's not nice.<eos> I thought you two were just study partners for biology lab.<eos> It may have started there, but I knew we were destined for more.<eos> You see, Kyle, women are attracted to success.<eos> They can't resist it.
We are looking for a burmese python.<eos> Its name is cato.<eos> It is a constrictor.<eos> It is not venomous.<eos> Try not to let it wrap itself Around any of your appendages.
He's my flesh and blood.<eos> Do not try to influence him.<eos> My friend, have you nothing in your life you would kill for?<eos> The house of Islam will not be built on violence.<eos> But if people like you continue giving it a bad name...
from what I could see,rebecca doesn't totally fit the munchausen profile.<eos> Do you think I'm personalizing this case?<eos> Like maybe I need to believe in the happy miracle baby?<eos> Well,instinct's a bitch,right?<eos> You only know if you can trust it after the fact.
Some of the most common ways?<eos> The border jumper's fee varies with each trip, but they're always well-paid.<eos> Once the product has reached the broker's U.S. connection, it will earn about $3,000 a pound.<eos> The farther south it goes, the more it makes.<eos> If it manages to make it all the way out east to areas like New York, the price is driven even higher, somewhere between 3,500 and $6,000 a pound.
By watching television?<eos> By doing whatever the hell...<eos> Guys, I can't spend all day on this.<eos> How is it possible, that at a time when the whole country is completely in line-- including the two of us-- that, how is it possible that people are so offended by a thoroughly benign sketch?<eos> Is true patriotism really that fragile that it can be threatened by a late-night comedy show?
I have one little problem.<eos> I was going to give Malone the diamonds,<eos> - and then disappear into Canada, but my passport...<eos> - Is a fake? I'm good, I'm just not that good.<eos> I just don't want them to look at it too closely.
Maybe the smell of the South coming from you reminds her of her family.<eos> Yes.<eos> She said they were eaten by Yoma.<eos> Your horse in bad health or something?<eos> No, it's nothing.
Rubbish!<eos> I'll show you stunning.<eos> This is the best 911:<eos> the Carrera 2S.<eos> It costs about the same as the Audi and will now run four rings round it.
Okay,I got this one.<eos> So the little rock i found in the puzzle box,it isn't really a rock.<eos> It's too stratified,so I ran it under the electron microscope.<eos> Silicon and oxygen is consistent with quartz.<eos> Copper and iron give it its color.
...to even look at your car.<eos> It's massive! Don't knock Oliver... Don't knock my car.<eos> - What did you call it then?<eos> - Oliver's a friend of mine...<eos> - He's given it a name.
Kusaka!<eos> You do not have to suffer alone.<eos> Get out of the way, Kurosaki!<eos> You should not try to bring this burden alone!<eos> Share with your friends your pain and with it the courage which is born!
Listen up.<eos> Let's say you go on a picnic with Eun-sik, and when he goes to take a piss. A viper comes along and bites Eun-sik's penis.<eos> And Eun-sik says, "Kyung-ah, the poison is spreading"<eos> "Please suck my penis, suck it hard"<eos> Would you refuse to suck it?
Yet the most amazing aspect of the Central Bank, is the "Suspension of Specie" Payments, in which the Fed can refuse to pay their obligations, yet taxpayers must pay their debts or go bankrupt.<eos> In other words, the Suspension of Specie Payments is the Central Bank's right to breach a contract with no penalty, whatsoever.<eos> In even simpler terms, it's called theft.<eos> How is it that the Fed is allowed to breach any contract they wish without penalty from the government?<eos> The answer is simple: The Federal Reserve Bank has power over the government, instead of under it.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.<eos> I'll make us a drink.<eos> Your home is a miracle.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> God bless it.
Dude, this looks real bad.<eos> Yeah, it's kind of fucked up, right?<eos> - Major.<eos> - Come on, let's go in the house.<eos> Your car, what happened to it?
Never had a fight, it's about time you had one.<eos> So please, step up to the top of the circle.<eos> Come on, get your butts up there!<eos> Let's get this perfect relationship on its feet.<eos> Put it to the test.
Yeah, it's brand new, I just got it today."<eos> So, on impulse, I then took out my work pen... which I brought back... and I wrote down his license plate number while he was driving away, because you said that if he owned a car, you would... oh darn, what was it?<eos> What... what did you say?<eos> I ca... I can't remember.<eos> I said I'd put a bomb in it and blow him up beyond dental records.
- Well, it's magic.<eos> Your lap?<eos> It's a stupid trick, really.<eos> You know, I've seen you before, at a party a couple weeks ago.<eos> You were sitting on a couch by yourself, and this dog came up to you. - You fed it a potato chip.
The restaurant's sucking him dry.<eos> So let him dump it then.<eos> He's put his whole life into it.<eos> It's not about the money.<eos> Well, isn't Ian helping to get it back on its legs?
Eagles.<eos> Hunting. Just like us.<eos> Keep that close, Father.<eos> A vampire cannot bear the sight of a cross.<eos> Actually, it is the faith of the person holding it that gives it power.
You put it there, it gets buried and that's the end of it.<eos> -Teaching me my job?<eos> -We've been waiting for ages.<eos> Know what 'ages' means?<eos> Here's my husband's pay slip, it's in small print, but it says that every month they take out money because the government's building houses with it.
It's OK. It's all right, mate. It's gone now.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Did Dad like my picture? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He loved it.

There is no way to absorb the blast and channel the energy into the Asgard core.<eos> Unless.<eos> Unless we reroute the power conduits throughout the ship, into the core, and let the blast hit us.<eos> This ship will explode.<eos> Yes. But hopefully, enough energy from the blast will be channeled into the core, to allow it to activate the reverse timefield before everything is totally destroyed.
- Here, here.<eos> I got it.<eos> Pop a squat.<eos> Hey, you know, it's not so terrible...<eos> You know, it makes Mom happy.
Rosalee cut the dead guy's arm off. Well, yeah, I guess that could do it.<eos> You have to be very careful with that.<eos> I will be.<eos> You need to be careful too. I don't think you should be carrying the stick around all the time.<eos> It's the only reason I'm alive.
I don't think he's coming back soon.<eos> Any idea where he went?<eos> No. I asked, but he wouldn't tell me.<eos> He seemed pretty freaked out.<eos> I brought his journal... in case it might help you track him down.
I don't want those people here.<eos> I'm done with all these cameras!<eos> Well, I think it's important.<eos> These people want to help us, Richard.<eos> Well, actually, although I'm sure the publicity isn't very pleasant, if it works out for you, it will work out for a lot of other people, too.
I wanted you to earn respect... but you're on an ego trip.<eos> Now you're talking like the rest of them.<eos> When I was a nobody... even you deserted me.<eos> I've struggled hard for my success.<eos> And you're with me because of it.
I'm starving.<eos> Hi.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> You know, I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am for the movement.<eos> It got me through so much.
Yeah, I just meant it's time to start connecting the power cells.<eos> I really need to update your cache of common vernacular.<eos> You really think the magnet's gonna be strong enough to hold him down?<eos> The neodymium core is no ordinary magnet.<eos> It enabled the Watchdogs' EMP device to knock out the power in several cities.
So that's one crisis resolved. Now I'm reading about the other one,<eos> Gabriel Thompson.<eos> This is his psychological profile courtesy of the State Department, federal law enforcement, and the NSA.<eos> Alex, what the hell am I missing?<eos> I mean, it seems like every time I turn around, there's someone who's served this country faithfully, and then out of the blue, decides to turn against it.
You're too good for me, and I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're not going to.<eos> Now, the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I'm wearing a funny costume today.<eos> But the thing is that's out of respect for the uniform.<eos> You don't go shopping in it. You don't go down to the pub in it, even though you think you might pull in it.
Sir? Fighting the leadership, raising money.<eos> We can't get them to do what they're dead set against doing.<eos> We'd need six months just to get them back to square one.<eos> We have to reverse our thinking.<eos> When the wind's blowing at gale force, there's no point in sailing against it.
You waiting r your report card?<eos> Yeah, and a birthday card from my dad.<eos> If it's within three weeks of your birthday, then it still counts.<eos> I've got a forgery kit in my room.<eos> I'm gonna use it to change all my C's to B's before my mom comes home.
So Crane killed these people and took their glands<eos> - to test a theory?<eos> - No. Gerald wasn't trying to prove he was right about fear.<eos> He was trying to cure himself of it.<eos> Crane's idea of curing fear was to inoculate himself against it.
It's great for relieving stress.<eos> - Ah, thanks, but I love stress and I'm a coffee guy.<eos> Actually, Espresso.<eos> - You love stress?<eos> I thrive on it. - Well, careful.
We've got something.<eos> We were able to isolate<eos> Sam Lewis' digital fingerprint from the USB drive that he gave Eldon.<eos> It's as unique as a signature.<eos> It gave Sloan enough to write an algorithm...
It's a never-ending conversation on tap 24/7.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> It's a pathway to a new world.<eos> The key, of course, is the unique interface.<eos> It makes participation not just fun, not just exciting, but addictive.
Thank you. Thank you.<eos> I have magic.<eos> So you can really do it... Take the dark one dagger and put it together with Arthur's sword to re-create the original Excalibur?<eos> I hope so.<eos> - And we can use it to save Emma?
You really think I'd come all the way to this wretched place just to drag you back to Camelot?<eos> We're here for something else, dear...<eos> Your father's helm.<eos> You, the witch... Why does everybody want that bloody helmet?<eos> It's the only way I'll ever save my kingdom.
- Your gun isn't loaded.<eos> - But this one is.<eos> You don't seem to understand.<eos> The parasite is the original strain.<eos> We can't get the serum without it.
- Damn. I've been in a lot of homes.<eos> - This says I've been in millions.<eos> That's your Social Security number, dummy.<eos> What's a scoso curcurity murder?<eos> It's what the government uses to keep track of us.
We want to live life to the full but other people can criticise you for that.<eos> You clash, you collide with them when your paths cross.<eos> But curious, innovative people with strong personalities do it different.<eos> Oddly enough, this conflict nourishes them.<eos> In a way, it stretches them.
And the theft was linked to a group called Revolution Now.<eos> A new weapon for the black market. Self-guided bullets that can track down and kill anyone.<eos> Rudy thinks the MEMS in the bullet that killed Anton were stolen by gunrunners.<eos> So, Anton sold his software to arms dealers.<eos> And they killed him with it.
Follow me.<eos> We'll use her.<eos> Have to kill her anyway.<eos> So Anton sells his genius tracking software - to arms dealers.<eos> - Who take it and use it to create a guidance system for a new kind of bullet that can track down anyone wherever they are.
You gave her a knife?<eos> She didn't like guns.<eos> Look, she must've tried to use the knife on Ibrahim when he took her, and he turned it on Sari instead.<eos> That knife was a part of you.<eos> You told me it was what kept you alive in Mosul.
If you get a time machine...<eos> What time machine?<eos> You can use it to be with any woman in all the court of history.
I think it missed the major blood vessel, Shaw.<eos> Oh, but your deltoid is gonna hurt like hell. Damn!<eos> Why couldn't Finch be here playing computer games?<eos> Yeah, well, he's not, so you want to tell me where I'm going?<eos> The bad guys got the phone, and they'll use it to find the truckload of guns, and when they do, Walter will be one dead fake cop.
Please.<eos> Physical pain serves a function.<eos> It teaches us.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, doctor?<eos> Well, it teaches us to protect ourselves.
Let me.<eos> If this quest goes on too much longer, there won't be much of you left.<eos> We've lost the horn.<eos> The odds are against us.<eos> Could we not fight without it?
So it's obvious, she definitely...<eos> She has something going here. I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it.<eos> That's why I'm here. To help you figure that out.<eos> I think we can start with the Wise Counsel questionnaire that I developed.<eos> And pretty much we use it to see whether or not someones compatible.
So he agreed to sit for an interview tonight at the gathering.<eos> We're planning an event for your visit.<eos> It's gonna be music and dancing, you'll love it, especially you.<eos> So we would love it if you would look over this document I prepared.<eos> It'll give you a little bit more information about us and it should help with your questions.
Till you think I'm good enough?<eos> Well, pop, I am fuckin' ready.<eos> I spoke with Bernie Resnick over at the Americana.<eos> He is pissed that you grabbed The Deejay convention from him.<eos> Says it's a mess, but that it saved his summer.
Well, obvious answer is that she's the agent most responsible for your capture, but I think there's more to it than that.<eos> You detest her because she... solved you.<eos> She climbed inside your head, she pulled all your ugly secrets out and exposed them.<eos> She demystified you.<eos> And now you're doing everything in your power to... violate her profile of you, rail against it, show everyone that, well, you never really were solved.
The question is, why do you want it?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> To kill Niklaus. I've spent the last 500 years running from your big brother.<eos> I have no intention of being within sniffing distance of him.<eos> But since it can be used against him, I'm sure he's just itching to get his hands on it.
The one from my dream.<eos> Crane. I think I found something.<eos> I requested coffee from the charwoman but she said you're particular to this beverage.<eos> She's called a receptionist, or Wendy, and yes, I am.<eos> It's an energy drink to help keep you awake.
I was very much like this kid.<eos> Scared, lost.<eos> The only thing that stopped me from falling into the hole that I was rapidly digging for myself was my talent.<eos> It saved me.<eos> It helped me to be somebody.
We were all at drama school with Amanda.<eos> These two were in the stage management course.<eos> Stage managing is hard.<eos> We both went up for the same part in a film called Rock Baby.<eos> It made her famous, and it was between me and Amanda.
Rako Hardeen, your reputation precedes you.<eos> I'm curious, when you killed that Jedi, was it for money or revenge?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Guess I was bored.<eos> Try the sauce. It makes that slop almost tolerable.
You were married to that yankee, right?<eos> I heard he cheated on you.<eos> Man, you must have cleaned up in that divorce.<eos> It always amazes me how much power is in this little piece of paper.<eos> I mean, with it, all your problems disappear.
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I would never do that to you.<eos> It was 100% Patrick's decision.<eos> I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.<eos> That outfit is fabulous.<eos> It makes your arms look almost human.
Yeah, well, if you're planning to interview the survivors, you're gonna have to get past numerous guards and medical staff.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will use my "covert prowess."<eos> I was going to suggest that you use a master key.<eos> It'll get you into the security wing.
Most adults do.<eos> I may have a beer every now and then, but I don't - I don't get drunk.<eos> We're just saying this is a waste of time.<eos> We're totally aware of alcohol.<eos> We see adults drinking it and having fun.
See, I think we've reached a critical point in the history of the MET.<eos> And why?<eos> Because Rachna Ali and PC Johnson were trying to laugh at racism.<eos> Lampooning racism isn't racism.<eos> It's the strongest possible weapon against it.
I'm in a lot of trouble, aren't I?<eos> Everyone knows it was an accident.<eos> But you might need to explain why you had a gun.<eos> Because I was scared.<eos> And did you find it made you feel less scared?
We should've been in Utah by now.<eos> Yeah. Just need a...<eos> You guys are gonna make a good team.<eos> Oh, well... who knows what's gonna happen with us.<eos> But Shane helped me finally realize that going away and doing something about a problem is different than running away and hiding from it.
That you did an unauthorized test, or that you burned out two university generators?<eos> I just need more power.<eos> It is insane to do things without telling me.<eos> I fought more than anybody for your project!<eos> Because you know you are going to get rich with it.
I like- I - I like being drunk though.<eos> It makes me cl-I feel clear.<eos> It gives me clarity.<eos> Oh, yes. Well, medically speaking, That's exactly what alcohol does.<eos> It makes you sharper and more focused.
They were in some way protected.<eos> Clearly.<eos> So you think this ring...<eos> Is a device which anchored their minds to their current location in space-time.<eos> In other words, it helped them stay conscious.
If you had to work there every day, I might need to share.<eos> I'm serious. That place is lame.<eos> Hey. Watch it.<eos> That quarry is filled with hardworking people trying to provide for their families.<eos> It puts a roof over your head and clothes on your back.
Oh, dude.<eos> - All right, that's it.<eos> I'm calling Dennis. - No.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> This pool is our bootstraps... and it's lifting us up into the middle class, dude.
Jimmy was moving according to coffee-pot time, which is usually ten minutes fast, but it crapped out in the middle of the night, so we're all kinda on microwave time today.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Hey, what happened to your dead tooth?<eos> Oh, I got rid of it.<eos> I thought it made me unique, but then I saw this hilarious episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and there was this girl with a dead tooth.
Every living thing mutates. That's how nature works.<eos> Well, is... is it possible then... that this isn't from nature?<eos> Well, all this talk about electricity... and backups and overloads, I mean, it sounds... like you're talking about a computer virus. And that's exactly right.<eos> A biological organism encoded with binary information... instead of DNA and we have no defense against it.<eos> And how does it jump from computer to living person?
I forgive you.<eos> I always hoped you were watching.<eos> I never missed it.<eos> I pretended like you never left.<eos> I like that big clock thing that hangs behind you, 'cause it means you're okay, even if you're still sick.
Agents of the Bank of England attempted to assassinate President Andrew Jackson on multiple occasions because of his resistance against a private central bank being set up in the United States.<eos> And it was something that Abraham Lincoln warned.<eos> And this is, by the way, why I believe he was assassinated.<eos> This is the Lincoln quote:<eos> "The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity.
It's inquisitive. But it's also wary of the oogpister.<eos> A black and white pattern is a warning signal.<eos> The beetle takes aim ... and fires formic acid straight at the mongoose's eyes and mouth.<eos> The beetle probably collected this acid from the ants.<eos> It certainly makes the beetle itself very distasteful. And that, in turn, makes it worth mimicking.
How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna leave it up.<eos> I think it ties the whole room together.
Glamour.<eos> Excitement.<eos> This City Has It All.<eos> Cynicism Isn't Just A Pose.<eos> It's! What Gets You Through The Day.
Okay.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> He'll do fine.<eos> I always felt really brave in that suit.<eos> It's not the suit.
notes on paper, phone records, voice recordings, that kind of thing.<eos> The best way to leak... is simply lean forward and whisper in another person's ear.<eos> What?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Catherine Bonatelli's coded cell phone number - we can use it to trace her movements.
Yeah, no.<eos> Done with it.<eos> The spandex.<eos> Green Man was good.<eos> It got me through some hard times.
It is good.<eos> Now, I got a plan.<eos> - A plan?<eos> - Yeah, a plan.<eos> It's gonna get us rich.
That's it, this thing must be some kind of, I don't know, SuperBat.<eos> He's right.<eos> Three quarters of all mammal species are bats or rats.<eos> Maybe the future belongs to them.<eos> We can use its own weapon against it.
We'll make this treaty work, I promise you.<eos> Magior.<eos> What do you want? What do you want?<eos> Say what you mean. You know what I mean. The King has lost his will to fight... otherwise he would never have made this treaty with the Romans.<eos> Everything we are rebels against it.
Are they also infected?<eos> I will respond all their questions, only lower the weapon.<eos> - How many are there as you?<eos> - He/she hoped you told it to me.<eos> I am not wrapped in a conspiracy, I investigate it.
I am?<eos> Thanks for still believing in me.<eos> It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!<eos> I use the Brazilian wax.<eos> It makes me feel like every day's a fiesta.
One day, Clyde handed me a bat and told me to always have it on hand.<eos> Said he only used this bat when he really needed it.<eos> Like when terrible pressure comes creeping up your neck.<eos> What made that bat so special?<eos> Said, because he hit more grounders with it than any other bat he ever used.
If you don't start pulling your weight around here, it's gonna be shape up or ship up.<eos> You know, try as I might, I cannot seem to impress that man.<eos> Isn't that funny... ...<eos> I'm about to knock his socks off again.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna break into this house that's got a bunch of evidence in it.
Meet us in the control room.<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Bacon.<eos> - You wish you'd brought bacon with you?<eos> It's the food that makes other food worth eating.
Faster.<eos> Destroy my focus. You're holding the saber too tightly.<eos> Now too lightly.<eos> Mmm. A new one? Your training has served me well.<eos> It has awarded me many trophies.
One more question, Art.<eos> What color is your car?<eos> It's red.<eos> Why?<eos> Let's go take a look at it.
- Are you going to finish your red paste?<eos> - No.<eos> - What about your sweet, crusty thing?<eos> No more balloon for you!<eos> I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got last week.
Hey, listen to me.<eos> That drug you're taking, I think it's dangerous.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It can break down all the walls in your mind.<eos> It can make us close again like we used to be. - No.
It's only what you feel.<eos> Well, I feel fear.<eos> The only really exciting things in life require more courage than we have.<eos> You know, deep breath and a leap.<eos> That kind of fear that you're talking about sometimes, it's how you know what's worthwhile.
A pharmaceutical company, Farrow Tech... has a drug called Parattin in the third stage of F.D.A. Approval.<eos> - What's it do?<eos> - That's a good question.<eos> That's a very good question, and this is the best part.<eos> It helps premature babies develop properly.
There must have been a better way to accomplish this.<eos> The Synod was in agreement with me.<eos> And we launched the vortex to keep humanity in a state of war.<eos> So, we could come here and play saviors.<eos> And, like the rest of our species, you share the responsibility for the vortex and benefits it has brought.
Let's check again.<eos> Who's got the upper hand?<eos> Haven't you been paying attention?<eos> That gun won't do anything to us.<eos> No, but it will blow my head off.
You approve, Senator? Yes.<eos> It's a fine ship, Captain.<eos> It cost the folks back home a wheelbarrow full of money.<eos> But given what's happened... I'm glad I voted to support funding the project.<eos> Actually, sir, you voted against it.
Where might one get one of those?<eos> When my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.<eos> So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.<eos> Absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.<eos> Every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
Gods do not exist!<eos> -Tricksters do!<eos> -Yeah!<eos> The only threat to Atlantis... is fear!<eos> We must unite against it!
It is an assemblage of bulkheads, conduits, tritanium... nothing more.<eos> Oh, you're wrong.<eos> It's much more than that.<eos> This ship has been our home. It's kept us together.<eos> It's been part of our family.
- This oil is 50 years old,... ..and its composition has been altered by exposure to radiation.<eos> But how did this get onto the diver, and then onto the diver's wife?<eos> I don't think this is just ordinary diesel oil. I think it's, uh...<eos> I think it's a medium.<eos> A medium being used by some kind of alien creature that uses it to... ..body-jump.
Well, thanks, son.<eos> One more thing.<eos> I think I like you a lot better without the hairpiece.<eos> Alice says it turns her on.<eos> Says it makes me look like a young Dan Rather.
He gave you the chip... the one Dr. Soong made for you.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I still have the emotional program my father designed.<eos> I wouldn't want to give it up.<eos> It's what has given me such a strong sense of family... an intense desire to reunite with my dear brother.
It's nothing... I'm sorry... Don't tire yourself.<eos> No, please stay<eos> Quite a place, isn't it?<eos> Appalling style, but I never expected to end in such luxury I feel a bit of a fraud Hospitals are getting more like night clubs<eos> You know, in such cases one craves champagne I don't like it, but I've developed a passion for it They weren't surprised
- I'll give you the top of the head.<eos> - Hey you, get down!<eos> - But we're having such fun.<eos> - We enjoy the playground.<eos> See, it keeps us deprived children off of the foul city streets.
Five days.<eos> It feels like it.<eos> But we've been through a lot in that time, and I say that we work brilliantly together, don't we, sweetie?<eos> Well... if you're talking about the bedroom, yeah.<eos> I mean, thank God this bod is made for pure sex, because, clearly, it's all he cares about.
Library in Paris.<eos> Café in Italy.<eos> I mean, it's like the target's trying to make his pattern look completely random.<eos> But it's not completely random.<eos> For him, it's about victims.
He hated the surgeons as much as I did.<eos> He wanted to comprehend life, so I studied under him,<eos> birth, gestation, generation.<eos> When I terminated that poor girl's child I was harvesting raw material for my work.<eos> The substance that brought you back from the grave came from her foetus and thousands of others like it.
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> When I joined the Force, I was gone so often, my wife left me.<eos> Then my little girl got hit by a car.<eos> So if God's got a plan, who's it for?
Was this the first room?<eos> The first room was there, 20 by 20, you know.<eos> - Wow!<eos> Hold on.<eos> - I want to look at it.
Tessa, is that you?<eos> Do you mind if I-- freeze!<eos> I'm just not in the mood for direct lighting.<eos> I was on a date with Ryan tonight.<eos> And the whole thing was my idea, but I realized halfway through I didn't like it, and he really liked it, and he got all mad at me because I wasn't into it.
Looks appetizing.<eos> Don't forget to add the eye of newt.<eos> Oh, 'cause it's green?<eos> It's a funny story.<eos> When Tom and I were first dating, he wanted a red velvet cake for his birthday, but I only had green food coloring, and he liked it anyway, so it's become a tradition, one we have shared for 25 years.
(chuckles) And he wanted to smoke a joint.<eos> Stone.<eos> Smoke.<eos> Now.<eos> When we went out on walks with him, Nim was one of us, and if we smoked a joint, he smoked it with us. In the circle, we handed it to him.
Perhaps the President knows something we don't.<eos> Like how to win an election.<eos> That was a very good point you made earlier, though.<eos> Can you inform the Prime Minister I'm trying to get hold of him?<eos> This country's become far too entrenched in what it thinks it's entitled to.
I mean, pretty much anything I do to this sand pile, if I mess the sand around and move it around, then it doesn't change the shape or the structure at all.<eos> So, in the language of entropy, this sand pile has high entropy, because there are many, many ways that I can rearrange its constituents and not change it.<eos> But now let me create some order in the universe.<eos> Now, there are approximately as many sand grains in this sandcastle as there are in the sand pile.<eos> But now, virtually anything I do to it will mess it up, will remove the beautiful order from this structure.
They say he wears a mask because syphilis has made him into a monster.<eos> Have you seen him? No. Never.<eos> They say that he once ran ten men through with his sword and then raised them in the air.<eos> That's him. Pay me now.<eos> This letter is for Cesare Borgia, but I'll only give it to him. You're late. If your life depended on that letter, half of you would wish you'd never come.
It better all be there!<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - A check?<eos> You accepted a fucking check?<eos> Did you look at it, Richard?
- This is fun. - Yep.<eos> - I think your husband's here. - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - Why don't you go buy him a drink? - What, like a nice ginger ale?<eos> You could get Madeline and Louise to buy a drink for you... and then you could go bring it to him.
Whoa!<eos> Hey, you can't do that.<eos> Last time I checked we still had a document called the Constitution.<eos> The devil don't abide by no legal mumbo-jumbo.<eos> Take it up with him.
He wants me out by Friday. We have a guest room. You're more than welcome to it.<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> - It wouldn't be a problem. Cole lives here too. I couldn't do it unless you were okay with it.<eos> Well, it's sort of sudden.<eos> But... it's Dennis' house, so if he's okay with it... then I guess I am.
The problem was the only one I wanted was missing.<eos> Is there a problem, Mr. Shepps? McGath hit the roof when I took command of his U.E.O. supply hauler, but I had my reasons.<eos> If seaQuest was out there, a slow-moving, long-distance hauler was my best chance of finding her.<eos> Besides, the way things were going, I knew they'd get their money's worth out of me.<eos> The Alliance of Macronesia, formerly New Australia... they engineered this ridge and a dozen more like it.
Let's go!<eos> We've got to get back to a doctor. She's bleeding a lot.<eos> I know I'm going to love this country.<eos> How beautiful the mountains are.<eos> Do you think he'll like it, too?
He burnt them all.<eos> The only reason these accounts survived was because I hid them in case the taxman came knocking.<eos> That was delivered at 6am this morning by a servant of Mr Robert Thoyt.<eos> Thoyt has been trying to buy the Delaney Shipping Company from your father for three years.<eos> Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.
You caught me in a good mood.<eos> That uniform suits you better.<eos> It seems these colours also suit you.<eos> The sun always rises in the same place.<eos> And we must turn towards it if we want to stay alive.
It's a no.<eos> I thought you liked the idea. That was before I realized that it was nothing but sassy remarks.<eos> I thought you wanted our baby to have a relationship with its biological father.<eos> If you're gonna get this worked up, it makes me think I don't really know you.<eos> What if I could make it more like you? I might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart.
And here we go.<eos> Did Julia negotiate a procedure here?<eos> Procedure is get your gun.<eos> And that moment on the shore is a chance to flirt with fate...<eos> See if you can stand your ground, dare danger to come after you, look it in the face and say,
Of course.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds like Cavanaugh is starting his investigation at Fillmore-Graves.<eos> Let's give it a day before we head over there.
No, it's not just a piece of metal.<eos> It's what we're putting our son in.<eos> It should be safe and reliable.<eos> - Why is this even a debate?<eos> - His first car should have 100,000 miles on it and be missing at least two hubcaps.
We will betray!<eos> Ramón!<eos> Wait!<eos> There must be an explanation.<eos> At least give it a chance.
Follow all the lights on shore.<eos> Well, we're in your hands, Captain.<eos> Listen up!<eos> I'll put the sea behind us.<eos> Just let it push us along till we lay up somewhere.
She'll make you a dress fit for a queen.<eos> But such incredulous faces.<eos> Has no one told you?<eos> In Paris, a hairless mount is de rigueur.<eos> and the men find it absolutely irresistible.
Two old guys like us, we're the past.<eos> Well, that's a sad thought.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> Banking law... needs to be exciting.<eos> It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.
Hey, hey. It's okay. Hey.<eos> No!<eos> It's very unfortunate.<eos> But we have the opportunity to learn from this.<eos> We can condition Morgan's behavior. Teach it about action and consequence.
This is the creature she called Dracula.<eos> I've got to get him to tell us where she is.<eos> We're going to try to make you healthy.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
So, of course,<eos> I believe what you said because I know such monsters exist.<eos> There are creatures whom God has cast into darkness and cursed to the night.<eos> This animal feeds off blood because it must.<eos> Because it has been afforded no other food source.
A whore, resurrected to be given to your Creature.<eos> To spare your life.<eos> But even that great demon has proved to be more human than you.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
The only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness, and I don't want to be that type of person anymore.<eos> I'm running for mayor.<eos> And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city.<eos> You're all fretting about this city dying.<eos> I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
But... But it attacked the Senator...<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> I brought it to National City.<eos> As Martians, we not only share our ability to shapeshift, we share a link.<eos> If I assume my true form, or phase, or reach out to it with my mind, it knows.
- It's conceivable that he made some sort of accord with them, brought them over to the New World to finish the job.<eos> Carla, I have been given a new medication.<eos> - You might call it experimental.<eos> - What is it?<eos> I need to look it up.
I have no logical explanation. Other than...<eos> (whooshing)<eos> (chuckles) No. No, you've been getting our practice name wrong for days.<eos> I'm sure you just gave them the wrong name and got lucky.<eos> Look at you-- your heart wants so much to believe, but your limited medical mind just won't let it.
Well, then I don't expect you to understand.<eos> That's why we're here, for a little understanding.<eos> I'll try but you won't believe me.<eos> There can be no good without evil.<eos> But evil must first be confronted before it can be driven out.
All right, how do we kill it?<eos> By stabbing it in its heart.<eos> Uh, well, given that it's got a giant hole in its chest, does it even have a heart?<eos> Apparently not in him.<eos> The person who possesses the Qareen's heart is the one who commands it.
Once that happens, the blackmailer will have no way to prove that we aren't the real parents.<eos> I'd rather not go.<eos> It puts my business at risk, for one thing.<eos> And traveling now, I'm not sure that's wise.<eos> The point of pretending this baby is yours is to give it a chance to grow up with a good name.
Saying good-bye... it's like having to say good-bye to him all over again.<eos> You must go home and reclaim your throne.<eos> Your destiny lies in Scotland.<eos> It always has.<eos> And I will not stand in the way of it.
First we look at the color.<eos> Is it neon purple or ruby garnet?<eos> Crystal clear or slightly hazy?<eos> Now we swirl the wine, get some air into it, you know?<eos> Let it stretch its legs, release some aromatics.
Hi. Ooh. Oh, my goodness.<eos> Oh. Isn't she...<eos> She's so cute.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Agriculture has long been the foundation of this country, beginning, as it did, right here in the great Commonwealth of Virginia, a land which has yielded so many valuable resources.
Whatever you say, Ross.<eos> Do what you will.<eos> Go and live with her if you wish.<eos> It's quite possible that her marriage will still go ahead.<eos> No doubt you did your best to prevent it.
Well, then you've never watched him button a shirt.<eos> - Where's the cake?<eos> - The cake?<eos> We put it right here.<eos> It couldn't have grown little legs and walked away.
Where's Paul?<eos> Out buying a new camera.<eos> What if Vince wanted to make sure that Leo wasn't exonerated, make sure the truth wouldn't come out?<eos> You think Vince lit the fire, let Leo take the fall?<eos> The insurance payout did have a lot of zeros after it.
They've slipped through the cracks that Dr. Patterson opened.<eos> She's special.<eos> It's easy to create a victim.<eos> You lock a person up in the dark, and they begin to suffer.<eos> And then you feed that suffering methodically, precisely to make it last.
We were just driving into town and saw your light and wanted to stop by.<eos> Well, feel free to stop by anytime.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you. We will.<eos> You take care of this old place.<eos> It needs a family.
Destructor safety.<eos> Climb data card.<eos> Installed in aircraft.<eos> I know this man.<eos> If the charge is true, he serves a foreign power but he serves it faithfully.
I've taken a human life.<eos> Not in battle or self-defense, but I made a choice I believed in and I saw it through.<eos> I feel like an authentic human being.<eos> Today we're gonna discuss existential choice.<eos> That life has the meaning you choose to give it.
See how the moon blocks the light of the sun from the Earth?<eos> For a moment, only darkness prevails.<eos> But then, as the moon moves on, the light slowly returns to the Earth.<eos> Brilliant explanation.<eos> The great astronomer, Marmion, could not equal it.
To be with them.<eos> I know.<eos> When we lost one of our cluster, I thought the pain would destroy me.<eos> But life holds onto you.<eos> And sometimes, it finds a way to push back into your heart.
- Got you 20 hungry wolves. - Good.<eos> Because your friend the pawnbroker is about to obtain a valuable book on behalf of the Ancients.<eos> Your job is to convince him - to give up the book.<eos> - What if he doesn't get convinced?<eos> - Kill him and take it. - Kelly's parents
There will be no warrant and there will be no warrant forthcoming.<eos> I appreciate wanting to kill Hannibal Lecter and I'm not without benefit from that.<eos> He can't make good on his promise to murder you if he's dead, now can he?<eos> But he's not dead.<eos> Play with your food, Mason, and you give it the opportunity to bite back.
But his sister's does.<eos> Okay, enough with the escalating drama.<eos> Who's his sister?<eos> Your name, then.<eos> I'm happy to look it up.
No, I quit the last two months of school.<eos> I was so withdrawn by that time and I was so antisocial that I was almost insane.<eos> You know, I felt so different and so crazy that people just left me alone.<eos> Did Kurt find the underground or did the underground find him?<eos> I think he went in search of it, and I think they found each other.
If you guys stay, you're gonna die.<eos> - All of you.<eos> - He's right, Mr. Gupta.<eos> Everywhere we went, places were wrecked. Looted. Burned.<eos> 26 years we put into this place, built it from nothing.
Well, is there anything you can do?<eos> I don't know--<eos> I was the arresting officer in an incident where a fellow cop got wounded.<eos> I don't think it's my job to make his life easier.<eos> Well, if you could, say, show some act of kindness, God would follow it up by dropping a piano on his head anyway-- like that?
And I know it doesn't make sense, but I just want to be able to do this for him.<eos> I just want to be able to do this one good thing.<eos> And even though Xo agreed, it really didn't make any sense, she too wanted to do something good for her child.<eos> How can I help?<eos> When he opens his mouth, will you stuff my boob in it like it's a hamburger?
Behold him in all of his glory.<eos> So full of strength and promise, and most importantly, sodium, gluten, and fat.<eos> - Whoo! - The time has finally come to christen the machine.<eos> - Boyle, the champagne? - Oh, well, technically it's a Hungarian Pezsgo from the Tarnok Valley.<eos> For once in your life, don't ruin it.
We were hanging out here, just... watching The Price Is Right, and she was like...<eos> Hey, would it be too much for you if I ran to the mall and picked up a couple things for this place?<eos> Nothing big.<eos> I just, I don't know,<eos> I feel like it could use a woman's touch.

Are you or aren't you?<eos> I'm certain.<eos> But I need a better picture.<eos> Look, the hacking device.<eos> Howell had a look at it.
Still tweaking our theme.<eos> We have an unusual space.<eos> Big pane windows, Roman columns.<eos> But it's too bright in there.<eos> I want it moodier somehow.
This is a test of the car's robustness and safety.<eos> ~ Can I just say...<eos> ~ That's good.<eos> I thought it was death.<eos> .. I really like my car and I don't want to do that to it.
Carl Nash?<eos> I don't know his name, but he said the place was "a blight on the neighborhood."<eos> That's a direct quote.<eos> The city wasn't doing anything.<eos> The people were pissed off, so that's why they let it burn.
Well, you know, when we first met, you said that you'd only ever been in love once.<eos> And, uh... that you called each other "Sushi" and "Ponyboy," and, um... you thought you'd get married.<eos> It was Mom, wasn't it?<eos> Can I get your opinion on a pepper mill at the restaurant?<eos> - What? - I took a picture of it.
William... look at this dragon.<eos> It's as though it could breathe fire at any moment.<eos> You're seeing the red of the dragon's mouth and interpreting it as fire.<eos> William, I'm aware that I am looking at a tapestry and not an actual dragon.<eos> You might find this experience more beneficial if you ceased to analyze it and just embrace it.
Please.<eos> Last people I trusted were the pediatricians who misdiagnosed my condition.<eos> Lost five years where I could've been on the transplant list.<eos> I get it.<eos> It sucks when your body won't do what you ask it to.
I've been drinking for over 30 years with no ill effect.<eos> Drinking may work for you, - but it doesn't agree with everyone.<eos> - My father, for example.<eos> He looks up to you, Inspector.<eos> You can either condone his behaviour or you can put a stop to it.
"Tell him how much I enjoyed meeting him, will you?<eos> "I think I offended him, Edward.<eos> "You know I can be my own worst enemy."<eos> "Edward assures me you won't mind me writing direct.<eos> "You set me a challenge, you see, and I've done my best to meet it.
Check me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - We're igniting the light and letting it shine.
Hello.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - We're igniting the light and letting it shine.<eos> We're igniting the light and letting it shine.
Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - We're igniting the light and letting it shine.<eos> We're igniting the light and letting it shine.<eos> - We're igniting the light and letting it...
- Oh, it'll be okay.<eos> We set everything up like you guys asked.<eos> - Are you sure you want to go ahead?<eos> - Oh, absolutely.<eos> Igniting the light and letting it shine.
Well, it's not like we don't know the songs or anything.<eos> With that many people, I would be shitting myself.<eos> - Would you please shut your mouth?<eos> - I'm just saying...<eos> Igniting the light and letting it shine.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe it was spite, maybe it was strength, maybe it was who the fuck knows what.<eos> To be perfectly honest, I don't care because the moment I start making choices based on her decisions, I've given her a hell of a lot more power over my life than I am quite comfortable ceding to a perfect stranger.<eos> Guilt is natural.<eos> It also goes away if you let it.
If it's the operative I sent to kill him, he can be traced back to me.<eos> I need money, paperwork and safe transport.<eos> I understand the override device is on its way to you.<eos> Bring it to me. And you have everything you ask for.<eos> General Coburn's sending over a DOD tech to analyze it.
No, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Cleaning this place up.<eos> They'll have it back to normal in a few hours.
Mrs Tunnidge, put Baby in his cot and keep him well wrapped up.<eos> Could you pass me the kidney dish with the syringe, please?<eos> I'm going to give you an injection to help stop the bleeding, and then I'm going to massage your tummy to see if we can bring on another contraction.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Part of the placenta hasn't quite come away, so we need to give it some help.
We are now entering the uterus.<eos> With this new procedure, there is no danger of exsanguination, as our bladder has slowed the bleeding to a trickle.<eos> Retractors.<eos> The baby is alive.<eos> The patient will live to mother it.
I might have sent him a text from your phone this morning.<eos> He's coming over at 8:00.<eos> And I arranged to sleep over at Avery's so the two of you could be alone.<eos> It's okay, mom.<eos> If your gut's telling you to marry him, trust it.
There's an ancient creature, imprisoned for a hundred years.<eos> Most are afraid to even speak its name for fear it might return.<eos> Go on.<eos> It's more powerful than any army.<eos> And once you tell it what you want, nothing, no one can stop it.
Mia.<eos> You'll save the baby over me.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - We have to talk about it.<eos> I mean, I can't have anything ever happen to it.
If it comes, you will bring death and destruction.<eos> If what comes?<eos> Do not play games, betrayer of all.<eos> You are interfering with destiny.<eos> No, I'm finally facing it.
How are you doing it?<eos> Well, I closed me eyes, I tried counting sheep.<eos> But you two... you're like that.<eos> The spell!<eos> You're resisting it.
- There's that hum again.<eos> - It's almost like an echo.<eos> Doctor did you find the coffin?<eos> It is not too late!<eos> Do not allow it across the river!
We want this buried, not shared.<eos> Show some respect for your fucking godfather.<eos> So you don't care if you go back to prison?<eos> Better to lose favor in the eyes of man than in the eyes of the Lord.<eos> It's like you said, a man who knows his calling must do everything in his power to live up to it.
I need some space, see if there's actually a future with Gabe.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind, right?<eos> Yeah, well, that's easier said than done with all of us trying to bust Sam.<eos> And, of course, with Gabe dead...<eos> Gabriel Lowan was a man of peace, a man who stood up to evil and faced it head-on.

"Why are you going?"<eos> "What kind of a passion is this?"<eos> "Wait for two minutes.. ...wait and be at peace for some time."<eos> "No one can go against destiny."<eos> "How can you go against it?"
'Well, yes.'<eos> Hello, Earth.<eos> We have a terrible decision to make.<eos> It's an uncertain decision and we don't have a lot of time.<eos> We can kill this creature or we can let it live.
We don't know what it's going to do, we don't know what's going to happen when it hatches... if it will hurt us, help us, or just leave us alone.<eos> We have to decide together.<eos> This is the last time we'll be able to speak to you, but you can send us a message.<eos> If you think we should kill the creature, turn your lights off.<eos> If you think we should take the chance let it live leave your lights on.
I mean, I try. I try.<eos> And I always seem to do something to screw it up every single time.<eos> Is that why you're thinking...<eos> You want to give the baby up for adoption?<eos> I just want it to have a chance... chance to be happy.
Oh, you just turned my life upside down.<eos> So what are you saying, Elka?<eos> I'm saying... Thank you.<eos> "I realized these women hadn't ruined my life.<eos> "They'd broadened it and given it laughter.
Aah, come on!<eos> Uh, thank you, Berta.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You want a child?<eos> I've been doing a lot of thinking about my life, and I believe that having a kid would add more meaning to it.
Real baby?<eos> Our first baby was Khaki, the magazine.<eos> For the modern multicultural couple.<eos> Yes, I've seen that.<eos> Greg and I birthed it, raised it, then let it go to Conde Nast in a bidding war.
The hull of an airplane is really just a bunch or round barrels riveted together.<eos> The wing, however, is a masterpiece.<eos> It's the most physically complicated component of an airplane.<eos> Nearly 200 feet long, it bears the weight of the entire aircraft and is shaped precisely to fit within a hundredth of an inch.<eos> The curvature of the wing is what gives it its lift.
It's hard to blame 'em, really.<eos> Martina was a good Catholic.<eos> Why would God let this happen to her, to Diego?<eos> This isn't God's work, Hugo.<eos> Evil wins when we let it destroy our faith in the power of good.
I just need to rest for a while.<eos> I hadn't been wrong; this was wrong.<eos> They hadn't eliminated murder;<eos> they brought it home!<eos> They just called it by a different name.
It was great.<eos> You should've gone inside, and the price is perfect.<eos> It's not right.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> You didn't even give it a chance.
I can't believe we're leaving those horrid things... hovering around those sweet girls.<eos> They won't hurt em. They just want to smell em before they die.<eos> God. Look, Stormy, there's nothing I can do about bodachs, okay?<eos> And right now I wouldn't even if I could.<eos> I need em to help me see the danger coming so I can maybe prevent it.
Aiden has always been very supportive over my career.<eos> Never more so than now.<eos> Yet on television, when asked if you backed him over his stand on the immigration issue, your answer could hardly be construed as supportive of him.<eos> Having different perspectives and opinions is what makes a marriage strong.<eos> It keeps it vital, alive.
You mustn't feel guilty.<eos> This is your time.<eos> Now.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Mr Selfridge would have loved this challenge, and that we rose to it.
I could've worked with that.<eos> Primeval New World 01x12 The Sound of Thunder, Part 1 Original Air Date February 12, 2013<eos> You've been at ground zero on this from the start.<eos> Unlike Cross, you understand that this isn't something that can managed by a team of renegades.<eos> You may not agree with his approach, but you can't deny it's been effective.
You know, you were the one who told me to stop moping around and being such a sad sack.<eos> She loves me.<eos> A-And it got me thinking about Will and Emma.<eos> About how relationships are a lot like flowers.<eos> If you find the right seed, put it in good soil, give it water and sunlight...
I got me a dinosaur.<eos> Where?<eos> Tennis court.<eos> The creature's fenced in, not that that'll matter if it decides to take off.<eos> But I'm going to find it some food and water, get it to hunker down.
Okay, in those cases, two lesions were created on either side of the lower anterior capsule.<eos> I'm proposing that we only create one on each side.<eos> - Not work.<eos> - It can work!<eos> Look, we see suffering, we try to stop it.
Don't worry. Sister Bernadette's going to have it out in no time.<eos> The waters aren't broken.<eos> The presenting part looks like the right shoulder.<eos> I'm going to have to try an external version.<eos> We're going to need to turn the baby round so that it can be born more easily.
He was discovered secreting scraps of food intended for journey far from these walls.<eos> Laurus cannot be faulted for a dog turned to madness.<eos> Show an animal kindness and it will give loyalty until the heavens fall.<eos> A journey that would lead to kinship<eos> Show it nothing but the lash with like mind of untold mischief towards the Republic... and wonder not why it bears teeth.
Please, go find some criminals to prosecute and defend.<eos> Jim, please escort the defendant down to bond court so she can post bail.<eos> GENEVA:<eos> Your Honor, that is not... - Come on, Ms. Pine.<eos> When the law is an ass, someone has to kick it.
That's your business.<eos> I have no idea what the hell you wanted with all that crap.<eos> Please.<eos> You were more than happy to turn a blind eye, but... you're not dumb.<eos> I did what I had to do to keep this town from going broke, to keep it safe.
And how dare you betray me like...<eos> Sheesh, if it were only that easy to shut him up after seeing The Help.<eos> I get it, Stan, you want a black maid.<eos> Wait, Klaus, why didn't you just switch into your body?<eos> 'Cause your idiot father let it sit and rot. Now it's all gross and decomposed.
That's where it can probably, maybe, find its way back.<eos> Is it trying to get to the sea?<eos> Dunno.<eos> I'll see if it goes that way.<eos> See if I can suggest a new route to it.
Do you think that we're rushing this?<eos> I don't want us to be doing this just because I'm going away.<eos> I thought we were doing this 'cause we love each other.<eos> But what if, without even meaning to, I'm, like, throwing your life off course?<eos> Actually, you're giving it a course.
He's a golfer.<eos> He's pretty good. Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Judy Garland's amazing.<eos> But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it.
Gave me an 'eadache.<eos> We'll have words.<eos> Can't have him wearing out that noggin.<eos> The law's the law, right?<eos> And policemen serve it.
There's food inside.<eos> Well, kind of.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Finding out you don't exist kinda kills your appetite.<eos> And that your parents had another kid and gave it the same name.
Don't worry.<eos> Did any of you guys actually think what we're gonna do if they don't come back?<eos> I mean, we just gonna stay here and watch her die?<eos> So you have a better plan?<eos> I mean, when an animal is hurt, and there's nothing you can do to help it, you know what to do.
- You.<eos> Homicide assigns killers to investigate their own killing?<eos> We don't come back from that.<eos> They'll burn this damn city to the ground.<eos> Maybe it needs to burn.
Oh, come on.<eos> And there is your baby.<eos> Luke, look what we made.<eos> Unreal.<eos> I can't wait for it to grow feet so I can make moccasins for it.
- That sounds brilliant!<eos> By brilliant, you mean we have no other options?<eos> This movie, Frank?<eos> It's incredible!<eos> It's about a dolphin who loses its tail, so they build it a new one, but it can't live in the ocean anymore, Frank, so they have to put it in an aquarium, and the struggle to save Winter's life,
- Yeah, it's good.<eos> She deserves every penny.<eos> I just-- it's so weird, isn't it?<eos> - What? - The picture.<eos> I mean, just to look at it, it's like I'm...
I know. I'm just so curious.<eos> I want to learn everything I can about this place.<eos> It's one of the oldest homes in the area.<eos> It took me five years to secure the title.<eos> Oh, I'd like to restore it to its original grandeur.
Always smiling, hugging strangers.<eos> You'd sit in the backyard for hours just eating dirt.<eos> You let me, you let me eat dirt?<eos> Like, like dirt dirt?<eos> The body knows what it needs.

It's OK, little guy.<eos> Welcome to Earth, blue buddy.<eos> In an effort to avoid enslavement,<eos> I offer you the finest chilled refreshment known to the human race.<eos> He likes it!
Maybe... but that is my name.<eos> Your parents have called the Tweeter?<eos> None.<eos> Is it...<eos> You have to give it its own name!
All right, we're back.<eos> It's "Radio on the Bay." George Khouri.<eos> Right now we're just gonna get right to it.<eos> We've got our esteemed mayor, John Stockman.<eos> He's got a very important announcement for the town, so right now we're just gonna turn it over to you, Your Honor.
Your Honour, this case is about fraud.<eos> Yes, my client volunteered trade secrets to the defendant.<eos> Maybe he was naive.<eos> I'd say so, Counsel.<eos> But the law doesn't excuse fraud because the target was naive enough to fall for it.
Right.<eos> Turn on your burners!<eos> And... watch.<eos> You see?<eos> Its true self bursts forth with the force of the dying stars that brought it into creation!
Yeah?<eos> I know that you did a urinalysis during the physical, but I checked the chart carefully, and I noticed a variation, so I thought I'd take a second sample to be safe.<eos> Well, it was a morning test, so the minor...<eos> You know what?<eos> You had an instinct, and I trust it.
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? Suffer love!<eos> A good epithet!<eos> I do suffer love, indeed, for I love thee against my will.<eos> In spite of your heart, I think.<eos> If you will spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I could never love that which my friend hates.
Malevolent to you in all aspects, which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity.<eos> Well, we will send for him to answer this.<eos> Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it.<eos> Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked.<eos> I must give over this life and I will give it over by the Lord.
I looked it up, they're worth about 30 grand each.<eos> If you buy 'em from the bank of england, yeah, maybe...<eos> But you won't get anything near that, not for a shipment like this.<eos> You can't move gold on without paperwork.<eos> You need to, er, melt it down, give it a new identity, feed it back into the system.

I have found strength in adversity and wisdom from my failings.<eos> I have tried to learn forgiveness from my friends and to settle feuds without war.<eos> Feels like home again.<eos> I have learned not to succumb to evil...<eos> ...but to challenge it.
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.<eos> ROSS: And living, too, for now his son is duke.<eos> WILLOUGHBY: Barely in titles, not in revenues.<eos> Richly in both, if justice had it right.<eos> My heart is great, but it must break with silence 'Ere it be disburdened with a liberal tongue.

Sorry to pull you off the road.<eos> Again. Is this about what happened last night?<eos> It is.<eos> Yeah, all of a sudden, we were pulled off of patrol and told to shut up about it.<eos> If this is about keeping quiet pending an investigation into Jamie getting a commendation, then I'll write it up myself.
- Don't shoot.<eos> - I said, don't move.<eos> Robo team, on me!<eos> You shot him! You're lucky his aim was off.<eos> I would have put it between his eyes.
She said you were gone for a long time.<eos> I had to go to three stores to find her precious soda.<eos> And then I kind of, might have ducked into a movie.<eos> It was a crappy rom-com, but since no one was yelling at me,<eos> I give it five stars.
See what happens when you play with someone else's toys?<eos> The people you love are made to suffer.<eos> You could have killed her before we came up here.<eos> - You didn't do it. - Real suffering is knowing what lies just beyond your grasp yet never being able to reach it.<eos> I'm gonna keep this body for a little while, and I'm gonna do some unspeakable things to it before I cut your beloved Vanessa's throat.
But I know I'm doing the right thing.<eos> Well, then what's the problem?<eos> I don't like it when my wife is upset.<eos> (Crunching) One thing that four divorces has taught me-- Other than the value of a pre-nup--<eos> In a relationship, doing the right thing doesn't always make it right. Hmm?
I've adapted.<eos> That thing back there in the I.C.U., that old, wrinkled mummy?<eos> This is me, and this is you now, chuck, okay?<eos> This is your new reality.<eos> Your old life is just a dream, so you just gotta, you know, let it go and everything'll be fine.
There's nothing in the Book of dragons that looks anything like him.<eos> We even get to determine what it's called.<eos> Huh, that is... that is a really big responsibility.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready for that.<eos> I am, I'm gonna name the snot out of it.
You want to go to prison?<eos> You know how much money that would save me? Thirty-two grand a year, to start with?<eos> (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)<eos> Dad, Dad, come on, just consider it, please? No.<eos> Okay, well, I've planted the seed and now I'll just let it grow.
No, I stole it.<eos> I mean, the way the real-estate market is right now, the guy was so desperate, he threw in the delivery truck and two pastry chefs.<eos> A diabetic bought a bakery.<eos> The place is an institution.<eos> I couldn't let it go under.
Stellar work, McGee, just, uh, shoot it over to me and I'll add it to the BOLO.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> Leave it alone, Tony.<eos> Agent Gibbs, I signed off on you exploring the ambush for good reason.<eos> The only way to stop a traumatic event from taking over your life is to face it.
I mean, that girl in the photo is really pretty.<eos> I read on the Internet she's a Tennessee titans cheerleader.<eos> Former.<eos> Yeah, she may be pretty, but can she carry on a conversation?<eos> I mean, unless it ends with "go, team"?
But her best years were still ahead of her.<eos> Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.<eos> It was time to look to the future.<eos> A new chapter.<eos> As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss... thinking, "Life, here I come."
- Everyone uses the same crapper twice.<eos> - Not us.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Okay, look... this creature is still walking around 'cause of me, right?<eos> I mean, I let it go.

That's not true.<eos> You haven't always made the right choices. You once gave up on yourself and those around you.<eos> I'm not giving up on you, Oliver.<eos> You have a good heart.<eos> Let it guide you.
Tank water's highly salinated; kept at body temp so the user floats in complete silence and darkness.<eos> Blocking out all earthly stimuli.<eos> You know, in the movie Altered States,<eos> William Hurt went into the tank naked.<eos> To strip the self down to one's primitive, disembodied being is how you free the mind, allowing it to venture into other realms.
Really? They will trace your signal.<eos> This is a treasonous act.<eos> It's my son.<eos> He entered your kingdom.<eos> Knowing it is upon penalty of death?
Oh, my God.<eos> Every bead represents a wish or a good thought... or a piece of advice...<eos> So that when you go into labor and you put this bracelet on, you'll have all of us right there with you.<eos> And you have to remember, with this child, it's yours...<eos> And it's not yours. As soon as it's born, you have to start setting it free.
You're beautiful and great, and I know it's crazy, but I just find it a little distracting, whether it's my fault or the hat's fault...<eos> Let's just say it's the hat's fault. It's just I've always been self-conscious.<eos> There's something about my forehead that...<eos> It's a forehead.<eos> you know? Let it breathe. Live your life.
No -- he's strong.<eos> Look, I know you're different--<eos> I'm different too, Tyler--<eos> I know you think you're helping your Dad but you're actually making him sick.<eos> His body can't handle what you're feeding it.
About 50 million years after the first winged pterosaur came something much more advanced.<eos> It lived in a region of the planet that is now China.<eos> Its skeleton was unearthed by one of the world's leading experts on pterosaurs, Dr David Unwin.<eos> So, here's one of the pterosaurs that we found last year in China.<eos> He named it after Charles Darwin.
You should try it sometime.<eos> No, that's not really my style.<eos> It's not just about getting laid.<eos> It's about grabbing life by the throat.<eos> And making it sing.
The word from Rwanda is a Hutu village was destroyed- men, women and children, brains bashed with hammers, then thrown into a pit and bulldozed over.<eos> Yesterday I handed in a report to Alan noting that 80% of India is Hindu and that reincarnation was no longer on the table.<eos> Nothing to keep people's behavior in check.<eos> So I predicted the most likely outcome was war with Pakistan.<eos> This morning the Indian prime minister announces his desire to reconcile with Pakistan, saying if they only have one life, they have to make it count.
Far to the east of the Bandiagara, it takes immense navigational skill just to find water.<eos> (GRUNTING) These Tubu women must venture across the vast sand seas of the Sahara, in search of a miniature well just one metre square.<eos> It will mean the difference between life and death.<eos> They call this place the Tenere - the land of nothing.<eos> It is featureless, scorching and unreliable.
Everything must be carried up, even family pets and it's a long way back down if you forget something.<eos> The first fire is ceremonially lit, an interesting way to bless a wooden tree house, but health and safety regulations have yet to reach these parts.<eos> Parents are surprisingly relaxed as their children explore their limits in the new home.<eos> Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity rainforest people have mastered their environment.<eos> They live in tune with their surroundings and show it a respect that's being lost elsewhere.

And she cannot sleep without that giraffe.<eos> It's in the front pocket of the diaper bag.<eos> And there's extra pacifiers in there.<eos> You're gonna need them when you p-put her in the car.<eos> You think that true love is the only thing that can crush your heart... the thing that will take your life and light it up... or destroy it.
I read this thing that said the baby of the family always craves attention, which is why we tend to be so obnoxious.<eos> I just think they aren't telling us everything.<eos> Of course they're not-- they're parents.<eos> I'm getting the distinct sense of déjà vu.<eos> That conversation on the plane home, you asked, "Who has a child and just gives it away?" Obviously you were talking about who gave you up.
Is it a buffet?<eos> No. You've been to Jeff's.<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> No reason.<eos> [chuckles] And then when the baby comes, the mother looks at her, or him, and gives it some wonderful name, like Beloved.
She doesn't want to come home after a hard day's work and deal with my theatrics.<eos> Her words.<eos> Maybe that's exactly what she wants.<eos> Maybe this is all about trying to get a rise out of you.<eos> Look, Mike, life is a big bully, and it punches you in the face over and over again unless you punch back.
I want to take them.<eos> Things that don't belong to me -- that's what I want, to take what's not mine.<eos> Okay, but, Shannon, you're not gonna do that.<eos> You're gonna breathe.<eos> You're gonna experience that sensation without giving in to it.
Pickle Party. Prepare for your hearts to turn to stones!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> ! It's the dead dog from the alleyway.<eos> I was compromising.<eos> I figured we'd give it a proper burial.

Thompson, what happened?<eos> I remind kevorkian this "not guilty" verdict Does not change the fact that we still have a ban in effect.<eos> I think mankind took- Took an historic step today Out of the dark ages.<eos> It makes me think of the nuremberg trials.<eos> When a law is deemed immoral by you, You must disobey it. You must disobey it.
Evil can sometimes be hard to recognize.<eos> It hides in normal things.<eos> People you think you know.<eos> But recognizing evil isn't the hardest part.<eos> It's standing up to it, even when nobody else will.

You didn't turn your nose up!<eos> You have to keep this child.<eos> Why?<eos> For all of this.<eos> What could you give it besides your fortune?
Is it me? Or, is it you don't care about this issue?<eos> What about what the<eos> Bible says? Romans, Chap. 1, Verse 24.<eos> "Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanliness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves." You have a responsibility before God to care for your body properly and to use your body<eos> properly. It is the house you live in, and you should not do that which mars it or harms it.
There has to be some plausible explanation.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> Look, our only priority right now is to defend the kingdom.<eos> We must prepare for anything, plausible or otherwise.<eos> If this threat is real, and I still don't believe it is, how are we to battle a coven of witches with swords, bows, arrows, and potions?
What they want with them?<eos> I'm not gonna go find out.<eos> God, can't believe this...<eos> I mean how? ...<eos> Once you look at the light... It grabs hold. It's like that...

You know, I went to a doctor recently, he told me to eat slower.<eos> And I was like, "Why eat slower?"<eos> And he said, "Because your body gets full but that message that your body's full takes 20 minutes to travel from your stomach to your brain."<eos> It takes 20 minutes before you know that you've already been full for 20 minutes.<eos> First of all, what a douche bag your body is that it takes 20 minutes.
All too often we deny the desire we feel.<eos> Hoping that that will make it disappear.<eos> Along with all the uncomfortable questions we don't want to answer.<eos> And the complicated truths we'd rather not see what happens when desire rises within us, unexpected?<eos> How do we stand against it?

She was right.<eos> I wasn't there anymore.<eos> I'd become addicted to a lifestyle of money, sex and power that was light years away from family or anything I'd ever experienced.<eos> You see, the biggest problem with my addiction, was that like all addictions, it sneaks up on you slowly.<eos> You give into it incrementally, in an almost imperceptible way.

So the economic crisis began at the very beginning and, as a matter of fact, when the founders of the Federal Reserve system met on Jekyll Island back in 1910, and were drafting the... the Federal Reserve Act,<eos> one of the things they discussed was how to pass on the inevitable losses to the taxpayers.<eos> They knew that inevitably something like this would happen and they knew that there had to be some way to... to get out of it without destroying the banks, of course, because they were the banks, and they said,<eos> "Aha, we'll go into partnership with the government.<eos> We'll take our cartel agreement and pass it into law

With the Bentley, though, things are... a bit different.<eos> The whole back end has to be assembled by hand because the shape is just too complex for a machine to understand.<eos> 16 cows had to lay down their lives to produce enough leather for this one car. And it takes 125 hours to stitch it all together.<eos> It takes two days to polish all the stainless steel trim-pieces and 130 hours to make the roof lining.<eos> Honestly, it probably would have been easier to just take Blenheim Palace and put some wheels on it.
I've got a few things to sort out.<eos> Carry on.<eos> Is there any news on Hannah? Erm, no. But Central Command are now in control of it.<eos> They're handling the investigation from that end.<eos> Give it the attention it deserves.
He died.<eos> A good, solid man.<eos> You would call him dull, no doubt, but he smiled whenever he saw me, and we could've built a life on that.<eos> Your heart knows the truth, Delysia.<eos> Trust it, for life is short.
So, what's up?<eos> 'Cause mornings are usually my time to write.<eos> Actually, that's what I wanna talk to you about.<eos> Here.<eos> - I read the script. - Good. William loves it.
And mr.Darling told me you'd be here to set a tone.<eos> -So get in there and set it. -Okay.<eos> Hey,brian,this nice,lonely lady is gonna get you some cake.Okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh,uh,can you,uh,get it cake?
In two days, I'm going to be reopening its doors.<eos> I will be starting up my healing foundation again, and I plan on using this building as its base of operations.<eos> I would like to remind everyone out there that the 4400 aren't all revolutionaries.<eos> We are not at war with society.<eos> We want to help it.
The key to this unexpected effect... are the tidal bulges created on the Earth by the Moon.<eos> The tides on Earth... actually act to propel the Moon outward... spiraling out further from the Earth every orbit.<eos> The reason is because the Earth spins faster... than the Moon orbits us.<eos> So, after the Moon has pulled up a tidal bulge... raised a high tide... the Earth turns and pulls slightly ahead of it.<eos> So there'sjust a little bit of a forward force... that we call a torque, a little bit of an extra kick... that speeds it up ever so slightly. But over time, that speeding up... makes it go faster and faster, which, in orbit... means it's going spiraling further and further away.
Bess! I think the odour is the burning of the poor thing's hair.<eos> The lime has singed it off.<eos> What care I if she lives on bald?<eos> She will not be bald if she cannot recover - she will be naked!<eos> It pains me to say so, Mrs Forrester but the poor bare beast will have to be destroyed unless you are prepared to dress it in pyjamas.
You know you do! You know who know do whacka-doo.<eos> Why do they call it that?<eos> - What? Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?<eos> Why do they call it that?<eos> If you're going to name a food, you should give it a name that sounds delicious.
Oh, come on.<eos> You call that an attack?<eos> All right. Finally, some excitement.<eos> Funny thing about anger:<eos> Let it consume you, and soon enough you lose sight of everything.
and end it with a simple and modest "He died".<eos> I Iove you.<eos> I Iove you, too.<eos> Your life is an occasion.<eos> Rise to it.
It's like the ultimate form of sleeping.<eos> It's kind of a contrast, wouldn't you say?<eos> Edna awakened to the fact that in her society she was nothing more than chattel.<eos> And her mentor, Mademoiselle Reisz, taught her that the artist must possess a courageous soul which dares and defies.<eos> She felt like the only way she could courageously act in such a society was to refuse to live in it, to defy it by death.
I toοk your adνice and told my lawyer tο settle.<eos> - None οf these are the wοman in the νan.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Trying to suture up here. - Sοrry. - And yοur ego can handle that?<eos> No, but it doesn't like the οther chοices.
It doesn't open.<eos> By the way, a well-dressed, good-looking man came over several times to convince me to sell him the flat, and offers good money.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yes, yes, yes.<eos> If you're going to sell it, don't change the plumbing.
- Perhaps they encountered the creature.<eos> - And, what, it killed all four of them?<eos> No way. One creature isn't gonna take out four Marines.<eos> - It almost killed all of us.<eos> But it didn't.
- We're all right?<eos> - Yeah, we're fine.<eos> - Is the baby good?<eos> - The baby's fine.<eos> They're naming it after you, ok? What?
It's extreme.<eos> He'll lose range of motion, grip failure...<eos> He'll keep his arm.<eos> He deserves extreme measures.<eos> If the arm is still viable, you can't just let it die.
One gust of wind and your inheritance will be a pile of rubble.<eos> What you paint, Paul it's not what other people see.<eos> It's more than that, Hortense.<eos> - My eye is thinking too.<eos> - Well tell it to stop.
Oh, not me, sir. I'm gonna settle here. They give you a farm, local slaves to work it for you.<eos> The expat life. It's the future. Form up.<eos> It's just bloody kids again.<eos> We want to build a true partnership here.<eos> We'll work together to subdue all the surrounding tribes... thus extending Prasutagus' kingdom... and allowing it to flourish without the threat of bloody conflict.
That's where the blues started.<eos> It ain't on this side.<eos> It's over here.<eos> This little light of mine<eos> I'm gonna let it shine

Yeah, I mean, you're working on a cure, right?<eos> - That's what i read. - Well, I have a foundation... and we're doing research on where breast cancer starts... which is in the lining of the milk docks.<eos> And we have a device where we can get into the milk docks... and squirt a very low dose of chemo... therapy, right where the tumor is...<eos> And treat the tumor, and pre-cancers too.<eos> So I'm hoping this won't only cure breast cancer... but maybe a way of preventing it altogether.
What's going on?<eos> Apparently, there's a fight to the death between Richard and Emily and an evil German supercomputer.<eos> Oh, I wanna hear.<eos> I thought we paid $4,000 for a computer to give us directions, not to baby-sit us and make decisions for us about how to live our lives.<eos> I mean, what's next? The radio won't turn on if it doesn't like the song?
If you don't kill it, I will.<eos> I swear to God I will!<eos> No! You'll kill yourself!<eos> Listen to me no!<eos> Just don't let it live!
No! You'll kill yourself!<eos> Listen to me no!<eos> Just don't let it live!<eos> She won't be out for long.<eos> Don't let it live..
Think of the energy that must be stored here.<eos> Bruce's famous creative juices never been released.<eos> Decades of imagination trapped in Highberger house.<eos> All it needed was a focus.<eos> And the three of you gave it one.
Take a closer look at the stress markers to her sternum, Zackary.<eos> Strike you as unusual?<eos> They do seem more the result of repetitive, medium-impact blows than a single high impact from a bat.<eos> - This husband dished it out.<eos> - Maybe she dished it back.
It's easy. See?<eos> Nice sneakers.<eos> Isn't that what you call 'em?<eos> You should've cleaned them up when you had your tussle with M rs. Mcl ntyre's washing.<eos> Heard you gave it what for.
If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed.<eos> But I'll be back in time for your show.<eos> The show starts at 3:00.<eos> - You promise you'll be here?<eos> - I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting on to our carpet.
- Who the hell are you?<eos> - I'm her brother, bitch.<eos> Life comes at us from out of the darkness.<eos> Peyton. Peyton.<eos> And at times, we can struggle to find the courage to face it.
Hey, Mouth.<eos> Gigi, I know you want to ask me out, but I don't want you to because I wanna ask you out.<eos> I'll have to think about it and get back to you.<eos> Okay, I've thought about it, and I'd love to go out with you, Mouth.<eos> When life comes rushing at you from out of the darkness, who will you choose to face it with?
I wouldn't be surprised if she left everything to little Ernest and Julio in her will.<eos> Evan.<eos> - They glued travel Scrabble tiles...<eos> - C XI and CMIII.<eos> - Inside a plastic Easter egg and stuck it...
Primitive but effective.<eos> If need be, Vetch, I was prepared to die with that creature.<eos> It didn't work out the way I planned.<eos> No, it didn't. Did it?<eos> Because, of course, it had stolen something from me.
Yes.<eos> Hand me my britches, please.<eos> No.<eos> There's no time to get dressed.<eos> My mistress wanted to know if it should be named after Captain Toby as he's the godfather.
It has to be genuinely funny.<eos> Well, what was all that stuff Patrick told us when we visited Shandy Hall?<eos> The theme of"Tristram Shandy" is a very simple one...<eos> Life is chaotic, it's amorphous.<eos> No matter how hard you try, you can't actually make it fit any shape.
And then, with great care... they will dance it.<eos> And now begins one of nature's most incredible... and endearing role reversals.<eos> It is the penguin male who will tend the couple's single egg.<eos> While the mother feeds and gathers food to bring back for the newborn... it is the father who will shield the egg from the violent winds and cold.<eos> He will make a nest for the egg atop his own claws... keeping it safe and warm beneath a flap of skin on his belly.
Right. We're on for tonight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you're lying there and they're touching you find a place on the ceiling,<eos> A clean place,<eos> Look at it,
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?<eos> - In that moment...<eos> I was forced to see the truth about myself, about my motives toward the 4400, and they were...not pure.<eos> That baby tried to kill you.<eos> And it succeeded.

We have an eternity to be together, But on this plane, right now, My place is with you-<eos> My protector.<eos> You have been warned about me, and it is too late. My sun is on its way.<eos> Yeah, i know,<eos> And when it comes, we're going to meet it together.
Old school.<eos> Soil probes.<eos> The probe goes deeper where the soil's been disturbed.<eos> And that's where we dig?<eos> On the one hand, you really want to find the body. Give it respect, provide closure... On the other hand...
Malachi, this is a serious business, and not to be entered into likely.<eos> Alright.<eos> So how does it work?<eos> Within each first there is a desire we hold so deep, we may not even be aware of it.<eos> The desire is so strong that if we gave in to it, it would take control of our very being.
My theory is...<eos> Martinez shoots Pablo once in the leg.<eos> The sound of the gunshot startles the baby and makes it cry.<eos> Until that happens, it doesn't even occur to Martinez that somebody else might be in the house.<eos> Meanwhile, the mother is trying so hard to silence her baby, she inadvertently smothers it.
I've created gaps in its readable data, but...<eos> The software fills in the gaps, making educated guesses as to what it should be, resulting in complete images from partial data.<eos> Precisely.<eos> And since we suspect that there is an image hidden in this picture...<eos> We try to tell the computer to look at it in another way.
I know, Howard, and I regret misleading you.<eos> It's just that a certain... vérité had to be established.<eos> I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me.<eos> Chuck, this tape...<eos> I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes.
He didn't see any of it.<eos> Look, I appreciate what you did.<eos> I really do, but I gave you explicit instructions not to follow me.<eos> Well, I had a hunch, and it paid off.<eos> You and your son are alive because of it.
This is your doing, you and your male prostitute.<eos> Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think.<eos> That suit is not drab.<eos> It has a fun salmon lining.<eos> No, Amy, it made me invisible.
It was whose decree?<eos> I'm surprised you have to ask.<eos> After all, you were the one who convinced your siblings to consecrate her in New Orleans soil.<eos> So not even death can stop my mother from seeking the annihilation of her own flesh and blood.<eos> This isn't the end. As long as that child lives, the witches of New Orleans will never stop coming for it.
It's all fun, but today you cost a friend of mine, of ours, something very dear to him.<eos> A little incident...<eos> A joke, Robert, that went awry. I meant no harm, truly.<eos> I know I introduced you to the opium, so I deserve blame.<eos> I like the way it makes me feel, the peace it brings my turbulent mind.
Another family, they all died...<eos> I'm so sad.<eos> You okay?<eos> It's all right, don't be sorry for compassion, Bethany.<eos> It can move us to do amazing things.
It could be a talent or a gift or an idea for a product.<eos> But the word I like to use is tool.<eos> Something that helps you get that very special job done.<eos> So for next week, your first task is to identify your own tool.<eos> Then the following week we will begin to discuss how to market it.
I'll be fucking flexible!<eos> During the break, when you were praying...<eos> I talked to our guest about virginity.<eos> Can you please repeat what you said?<eos> Dear Father, I thought to myself that. ...virginity is a privilege, as thanks to it... we can serve God with greater zealousness.
wait for it, 'cause Lord knows I have-- pregnancy scares.<eos> Why are you smoking right now?<eos> I'm always precoital, Ted.<eos> You know, maybe smoking's not so bad.<eos> I mean, at least it gets us out in the fresh air.
Fine.<eos> Since i don't see that there's any other option, There's one other way i know how to get you out of here alive.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I know a spell.<eos> It'll vaporize every demon in a one-Mile radius...
There were 5 fatalities, including a family,<eos> Becca had seen their license plate in a vision, a mother, father, and a 13-year-old boy named Daniel Asher.<eos> Daniel died at the scene.<eos> And his parents died later at the hospital.<eos> You know, maybe they just saw the light and went right into it.
Take revenge and gain my father's respect.<eos> Anywhere.<eos> Anytime.<eos> I thought about my childhood.<eos> It had made me tough and a danger to myself and others.
I've always been Bunty... I've always enjoyed being him<eos> To tell you the truth, I never had the perseverance it takes... to become a Tata or Ambani, nor the calibre<eos> Anyway, doesn't matter now.<eos> I think I've discovered my destination<eos> And I'm on my way towards it
- I'm sorry.<eos> - No, don't be.<eos> Vulgarity is not a sin against God, but against polite society.<eos> And, between you and me, I don't give a shit about polite society.<eos> I never had much use for it either.
No one can use it again.<eos> Like circumcision?<eos> Let me explain...<eos> Parents and children always had problems.<eos> It's such a major source of conflict that it's one of the Ten Commandments:
I'm resigning. Seems like a ripe topic for discussion to me.<eos> What happened last night was tragic.<eos> - It's a terrible setback, but...<eos> - Setback, Wes? Status quo.<eos> Evil wins, because instead of just wiping it out we negotiate with it.
Like I said, he just needed a little more time.<eos> I'm sure we'd be happy to share the anti-virus with you... but that'll be impossible if you destroy our ship.<eos> Captain's Starlog, supplemental.<eos> We've given Phlox's serum to the captain of the containment vessel.<eos> With any luck, they'll be able to use it to prevent future outbreaks.
- As are you and Daniel Jackson.<eos> - Daniel?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> We got the device from Telchak.<eos> - Good. Hopefully we can engineer a weapon from it.
- You're on. Have any of you considered the fact that you're glorifying a war we fought... so we could keep land that we stole?<eos> If you don't like it here in America... why don't you go stand in line for toilet paper in the USSR?<eos> There is no more USSR, Harry.<eos> A sense of community is so important, isn't it?<eos> It's what made our country great.
Wasn't he busted five years ago for selling high-tech weaponry to the Third World?<eos> His firm did the selling, he did the designing.<eos> Why would he be after you?<eos> My first big story was an exposé on the illegal arms business.<eos> It led to the FBI arresting 12 people.
HOROWITZ:<eos> He's full of pride. GOODMAN: He'll see it our way.<eos> So, Horowitz, is your conscience really bothering you?<eos> It's funny how people get principles after they get their money. Come on, have some wine.<eos> Come on, maybe it'll put things in perspective.
I mean, it probably is the first time in your life... that you can serve the cause of justice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> I happen to love our legal system.<eos> As long as it keeps you in diamonds and Sonys.
30 if you raise your hand to them!<eos> You lie, they cut your ears off!<eos> I know the law, Fiddler!<eos> Then you ought to know there ain't no way to beat it!<eos> White folks live by it. And niggers die by it.
The charge against them is nonsense.<eos> It will do for my purposes.<eos> They constitute the hard core of our problem and I'm going to crush them once and for all!<eos> Sir, you will only further aggravate the problem.<eos> This action is folly, and I wish to protest it in the strongest possible terms.
They were trying to kill it.<eos> Him.<eos> - An ancient alpha predator.<eos> From an age when the Earth... was 10 times more radioactive than today.<eos> This animal and others like it... consumed this radiation as a food source.
So the painting's about impressing<eos> - the new in-laws?<eos> - Seems like it.<eos> Then maybe those in-laws are one of the reasons that Harry hasn't got his own hands dirty in order to get the painting back.<eos> He paid the McCrary brothers to steal it for him instead.
Yeah. Sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> What do you think?<eos> They said they'll probably have an opening by the end of the month.<eos> He'll hate it, but he hates everything, so what difference does it make?
I really want to do it.<eos> Whatever. That's fine.<eos> That electric piano is the hit of the town.<eos> I've already had 3 bids on it.<eos> Uh, well, you have him to thank for fixing it.
Jump out the window, or live by the rules that she died by.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> A boy in her school. Armed and fucked up.<eos> Headlines that make every mommy and daddy in America cross their fingers.<eos> So. now I'm using the same right to bear arms that he had. It's an all-in package, I was told.
What's he you going to do now?<eos> Cut out his heart.<eos> Cut out his heart?<eos> Why not?<eos> He has no further use for it.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.<eos> Yes, your little flat. - How do you know?<eos> - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you?<eos> And what are you, widowed or divorced?<eos> Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger. That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I heard the stirrings.<eos> Some, uh... thumps and mutterings and such.<eos> We need to get him back to Dr. Ellman.<eos> He won't take the meds, but the talk therapy was always helpful.<eos> Feel like it was more helpful for you to have him doing it.
Their linked elbows echo in tune.<eos> - What if I can't hum on key? - "What if I can't hum on key?<eos> What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears?"<eos> Is everyone reading that stupid magazine?<eos> I'm kind of addicted to it.
I don't think that's within the scope of the agreement.<eos> Let's start with the NDA.<eos> - Standard.<eos> - It's a non-starter.<eos> I don't know how far we get without it.
- Ask her.<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> I... Your mom and aunt Sherry, they didn't want to go to sleep and I was fucking tired.<eos> So I made them some hot chocolate.<eos> And put a little rum in it.
I watched these people in another section hitting a beach ball.<eos> And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.<eos> But then the ball went into the aisle... and this usher ran down and grabbed it and he picked it up, and he just squeezed the air out of it.
- Any sign of the list?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Ben, we had a deal.<eos> Ben, the list.<eos> I'm taking you to it.
If the governor knows our destination, why can't he just plot a course directly to a spot on the chart?<eos> Because Skeleton Island is not on any chart, not on any civilized one, at any rate.<eos> Remote.<eos> Well outside any established trade route.<eos> It's been used from time to time for transactions neither party wished would ever be acknowledged.
And I betrayed you and it sickens me.<eos> I am so sorry for working so hard to protect the wrong things.<eos> For failing to see that there is nothing important that does not include you.<eos> The story, as it was recounted to me, is that Avery was the first Englishman to find the island.<eos> The Spanish had been using it to conduct illicit transactions for decades.
What, you think you know who A.D. is?<eos> I have a short list, starting with Jenna Marshall and ending in Mary Drake.<eos> Okay. You know what, we don't need your theories.<eos> And there's no piece on that board that looks like you.<eos> I guess you're forgetting who replaced the shattered windshield once you peeled Dunhill off of it.
Okay, do you know why families turn on each other? Because one family member starts talking crap about another family member.<eos> And then boom, it's "The Borgias."<eos> - I'm just saying, we should ask him...<eos> - Mm! You will do nothing of the sort.<eos> You will forget we ever had this conversation and promise to never bring it up again.
Now, it's possible the box could contain his son's birth certificate and the like, but...<eos> Given the exotic nature of the care that's been taken here,<eos> I would have to assume...<eos> - It's the rest of the Spear.<eos> When was it last accessed?
No, in that hotel room, there was madness.<eos> And it stank of sick death.<eos> See, you and I, we're both from the slums.<eos> So I know you know the smell that I'm talking about.<eos> And there was a puddle, blue-brown slime, in the center of the bed and it smeared down, acrossthefloor.
Well, you're still trapped, wherever you are, and I don't know how you're gonna escape.<eos> I mean, we got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> Did we?<eos> I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.<eos> Every step, every move that you make, it only brings me nearer to it.
God of Speed, soon your enemies will fall and you will rise once more on Earth.<eos> It looks just like the last one that held the Stone.<eos> - You were right, Barr.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go see what's in it.
Then why were you running?<eos> On Jana's last flight, a package went missing.<eos> A package?<eos> So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?<eos> And when she didn't have it, he went after Raj.
I'd set the odds at 7-to-3, you're not.<eos> I'm the only one around here who doesn't really do the numbers.<eos> My skill is taking people and making them more of who they are.<eos> This place has some serious fucking problems.<eos> But whatever Axe Capital actually is right now, I know what it's supposed to be at its best.
Four amigos.<eos> Fearless motherfuckers.<eos> How about this?<eos> So much cash floating around back then.<eos> Most of it got diverted.
Sorry, I didn't have time to tidy up.<eos> I've been working on something.<eos> Really? What... what are you working on?<eos> I'm working on a suspense novel.<eos> I think in the right hands, when it's complete, It'll make quite a good little movie.
You can't!<eos> The evidence supports a conviction.<eos> The law supports the death penalty.<eos> You have discretion.<eos> And I'm using it.
Honey, you deserve to be here.<eos> It does not feel like it.<eos> Come on, you are Juliette Barnes, comeback artist of the decade.<eos> So you borrowed a song.<eos> But you made it a hit.
It does not feel like it.<eos> Come on, you are Juliette Barnes, comeback artist of the decade.<eos> So you borrowed a song.<eos> But you made it a hit.<eos> You made it great.
Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna keep battling for Highway 65.<eos> But not for you.<eos> For everybody else.<eos> When the dust settles, if there's still a label, you are off of it.
Every scar's a story.<eos> The more you live, the more you get.<eos> Nothing to be embarrassed about.<eos> A guy hit me with a board.<eos> It had a nail in it.
Yes.<eos> It's possible that you aren't lying, or maybe you got caught up in something above your pay grade and are trying to protect a colleague.<eos> I understand the code.<eos> I'm giving you the chance to prove that you're a member of my team.<eos> I suggest you take it.
It's nice to see others who care about the well-being of a plant as much as I do.<eos> It's because of what that plant means.<eos> To all of us.<eos> All my life I've heard stories about the way this plant has inspired the people of Middleton and the wonderful things that happened whenever it bloomed.<eos> Which is why we need to get the Merriwick back up to full power, or else... well, I just can't even imagine what might happen to this town if we ever had to live without it!
Say, lift a car, something like that.<eos> He was coming off the final dose when Zaikin took a shot at him.<eos> We don't know if he got the next one.<eos> Which is what Burrows had in that briefcase.<eos> Without it,
Now, if we could get these two back, it'd be even better.<eos> How long do they have?<eos> We're in the server room, Daisy.<eos> You can begin.<eos> Okay, good. So the idea is that I built a back door into the Framework so they can escape, but the problem is, I can't make them use it.
I knew somebody who had a drug problem, once.<eos> And what?<eos> ! You got them clean?<eos> No.<eos> I had the chance to do something about it, but I didn't take it.
Finally. Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.<eos> And I knew I'd have to watch that happen over and over and over.<eos> So when that opportunity presented itself for the second time, I took it.
I know it works.<eos> I've played it before.<eos> Edie, she still has this manual.<eos> It's sort of classic Edie when you think about it, keeping this filed away.<eos> I think it has like some sort of sentimental value to it, 'cause her mom bought it in some sort of rare spasm of sobriety.
Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.<eos> Those fatties stretch you out.<eos> I like to stay tight.<eos> Ain't yoga good for that?<eos> No, but it does make the dirty wheelbarrow position a lot easier.
Thanks.<eos> Normally, street art, it scares me, but this is very pretty.<eos> I wasn't goin' for pretty.<eos> Well, I... I like how it tells a story.<eos> How love gives you legs to stand on, and without it, you're just a disgusting, deformed cripple.
Came to us a few days ago warning of a mass-casualty event that was gonna happen.<eos> Said he wanted to make a deal, but before we could get anything in place, he and both of his lieutenants were killed in an explosion in a makeshift bomb lab.<eos> What were they working on?<eos> We have no idea.<eos> We found a burnt SIM card at the site, but we were able to pull the name of another member of the group off of it.
So you could feel more powerful?<eos> I thought that was the fucking point.<eos> That we're better than them.<eos> There's no "we" yet.<eos> Power... is meaningless if you can't apply it judiciously... when it has a purpose.
Who's behind it?<eos> I get you're trying to protect your people, but so am I.<eos> This green shit?<eos> It's all over the zone where I come from.<eos> And if the people who use it are here, they got worse plans for you than any Basic ever could.
Been on this ship. Met you.<eos> How?<eos> We've got about 20 minutes before the paralysis wears off.<eos> Help me get him to the infirmary.<eos> Your armor's genetically locked, making it impossible for anyone else to use it.
And I was thinking about all that rail shit we used to drink, but we were already drunk from being with each other, so we didn't care.<eos> And then I flipped totally to the other extreme.<eos> To Paris. That rainy night. We wouldn't get out of bed even though the iPod was playing "With or Without You" on repeat, and so we ended up listening to it all night.<eos> And I was just thinking... I was thinking how deep it got between us.<eos> And we promised that if anything ever threatened us, we'd remind ourselves of that night and we'd try to find a way back to it.

I was thinking how deep it got between us.<eos> And we promised that if anything ever threatened us, we'd remind ourselves of that night and we'd try to find a way back to it.<eos> And I'm reminding you of that night right now.<eos> Let's fight our way back to it.
- No, I don't want to do it.<eos> Okay, now, we all know that the number one cause of workplace accidents is Superman crashing through office windows mid-fight.<eos> That's a simple fact.<eos> But now... this glass is made of Kryptonite.<eos> So if he flies close to it, his powers will weaken, and he'll safely bounce off.
I was shopping, odds and ends. I needed floss and realized I had a bunch here.<eos> Then this guy pulled up.<eos> Positive Babinski.<eos> Floss.<eos> Can't sleep without it. Yeah.
But doesn't your method result in false confessions?<eos> Very few.<eos> In fact, hasn't your method been banned by police in Canada and England?<eos> I wouldn't call it banned.<eos> They've chosen not to use it.
I can't explain it.<eos> I can.<eos> It's just like when you needed the crutch to walk.<eos> Yeah. Only worse.<eos> When I felt the power this gave me, I couldn't imagine living without it.
A man carries his genes in his heart and mind... along with a growing faith in the garden of noble causes you and your fellows seek to engender.<eos> Banneker believed that which we safeguarded could be used to spark a conflict beyond all others.<eos> So it stands to reason... it could be the Totem of War.<eos> We're not that far from where that barn used to be.<eos> We need to get to it before Dreyfuss' agent can.
But everybody is in it together.<eos> You haven't been there in a long time.<eos> That's what your dad says.<eos> You should probably keep this book on your shelf with other books of similar topics.<eos> That way, anyone who's looking won't pay any attention to it.
- You know you have that power.<eos> You've been using it your whole life.<eos> - I always thought I had some kind of... God-level good luck.<eos> - True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.<eos> I can teach you how to use it at will.
What do you want?<eos> Does the Global Authority still have any interest in reclaiming the stolen gauntlet?<eos> I mean, that's what started this whole hullabaloo in the first place, isn't it?<eos> I figure it must still have some value.<eos> You have access to it?
It's been too long.<eos> Too long.<eos> Don't make this weirder than it already is, Blood.<eos> Are you referring to the setting?<eos> I myself take strength from it.
I haven't stopped thinking about you.<eos> I'm absolutely lost without you.<eos> I meant about the case.<eos> My Uber is here.<eos> So, about this new case, uh, you like anyone for it?
I reached out to the Red Hand.<eos> I tried to explain to them why we need the gauntlet.<eos> I couldn't even get to their leader.<eos> Do we really need the gauntlet?<eos> I'm not leaving the bloc without it.
But can he at least give you the first official wave?<eos> I'll just take it.<eos> How's your head?<eos> Not great right now.<eos> Get Beck out of it.
She's tough, smart.<eos> He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.<eos> Her? You can work with her.<eos> I know you see it, too.<eos> I see a partner when it comes to Syria, or what's left of it.
Graveyard shift.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come over here, come on.<eos> Look, you did the right thing.<eos> You were uncomfortable with the situation, so you removed yourself from it.
Sorry.<eos> Please.<eos> Thanks to BulletPoint's audio, we know that the shooter was in the employ of the last person to possess the guitar.<eos> Now, whoever he is, he never publicized having it.<eos> He might have derived his pleasure from it privately, but people like that, they rarely keep their prizes completely secret.
And?<eos> Reid, are you ok?<eos> It's my mom, she's in trouble.<eos> Were Reid and Diana scheduled to have a visit?<eos> He didn't think so, but it happened anyway.
"To my son, Gideon.<eos> Remember to be strong and true.<eos> I will always love you.<eos> Mother."<eos> I know it's not easy to talk about Belle. But this book... meant the world to her, and she really wanted you to have it.
Never lose hope.<eos> It... it can't be.<eos> Well, I'm afraid it is.<eos> Your Story Book.<eos> Or what's left of it.
- Many don't.<eos> And it's not because I'm hiding it, but because I've got it under control, and I have for the last 14 years.<eos> There are people in this hospital who have to surrender.<eos> You have an opportunity.<eos> You better take it.
Cameron.<eos> Oh. Hey, so, did you come to cheer me on or discourage me?<eos> Inspire you. You have to win this match.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We think Jake coded a message, and it's hidden at the end of the final level of War Zone, but it's only accessible for the next 45 minutes until we have to reposition the satellite.
We were undercover in Montreal having dinner, and he said that everything I thought I knew about myself was a lie.<eos> It was intimate and weird.<eos> And when we thought we were made, he snuck out the back and I palmed his scotch glass.<eos> But when the envelope came back, I was scared it would confirm the devil was my father.<eos> I didn't look at it.
I got to go buy some steaks.<eos> Good, you're here.<eos> Tell me you figured out what bullshit they're trying to sneak into this deal.<eos> They're not trying to sneak anything into it.<eos> They're trying to get out of it.
No, it doesn't matter how long it takes, Louis.<eos> We can just charge the time back to some client, right?<eos> 'Cause nobody around here gives a shit about anything other than making money anyway.<eos> Mike, what is going on?<eos> What's going on is that the only reason I came back here is that Harvey and I made a deal, and it hasn't even been a week, and he's already going back on it.
I am a prick.<eos> The other night, you said Tess was your greatest regret.<eos> So?<eos> Real pricks don't have regrets.<eos> Well, I bared my soul, or what's left of it. Your turn.
I'm quite well.<eos> That's good.<eos> You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.
I came to evacuate as many of you as possible.<eos> But you attacked me with the same weapons that they used on us.<eos> - They attacked you?<eos> - Correct.<eos> A harvester ship conquered our planet and extracted it's molten core.
What are you doing in this cave?<eos> I am the original inhabitant of this land.<eos> My kind once had a pristine aisle.<eos> Majestic and untouched.<eos> Then we were driven out of it... by a bunch of goddamn fucking crackers!
You tried. Nobody can say you didn't.<eos> But who are you going to save in prison?<eos> Probably nobody.<eos> Then why can't you just pick up the stupid gun and wave it around?<eos> You don't have to use it, just meet them halfway.
Come on, come on.<eos> My what?<eos> For your time.<eos> Young lady, you can not change the past, but I dare say,<eos> You might learn something from it.
Time is many things Hamish ... but he isn't money.<eos> Nor is he our enemy, Mother.<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> I walked right through the walls.<eos> I may not be able to change the past, but i can learn from it.
I'd like to get a little swab of the blood on your hands. A little swipe under the nails. A little bit off the scratches on your back.<eos> Okay if I do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it? I need your consent, Naz.<eos> If you don't give it, then I have to get a court order. And that will take about 45 minutes.
Naturally, we won't touch your nose, but here, here... and here, we can change that.<eos> What if we make Hugh Laurie out of you?<eos> Or maybe Tim Roth?<eos> You'll look like them.<eos> Well, the face is good, we can shape anything out if it.
Your original offer was, for lack of a better term, ridiculous, and this is even worse.<eos> Now, Neil, you can't just grind and grind and grind until you get everything you want, changing the bid every time.<eos> There has to be some decency, now I suggest...<eos> Sorry, new toy.<eos> Can't keep my hands off it.
__<eos> I think you intend to return to that beach, and seize every last ounce of gold off of it, and I think you're going to need my help to do it.
Also dead.<eos> Arya Stark left him to die.<eos> He was on her list.<eos> He was not on her list anymore.<eos> She had taken him off it. Why?
I wish I did.<eos> We know the traffic is terrible and I'm sure he'll be here any moment.<eos> Here!<eos> My briefcase.<eos> I want you to keep it close.
I'm going home.<eos> - Mrs Blacker...<eos> - Fetch 'em!<eos> 'It's better when you've got a gun in your hand.<eos> 'What are you like without it?
IA's gonna be up your ass with a flashlight.<eos> I can handle Ridley.<eos> She was my lieutenant at the 31st.<eos> Listen, you still have a future here, Misty.<eos> My advice to you is to let go of this board and everyone you have pinned on it.
I'm not sure it's safe. I...<eos> - I stepped on one.<eos> - I'm standing on a land mine.<eos> Normally, you step on a mine, it explodes within seconds, but we think that Korsak stepped on the edge of it and it rocked up and that's how he saw it.<eos> Well, if it didn't explode, can you just step off of it?
Are you serious about teaching in a school?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> I don't want to be just a housewife, Marian.<eos> I have a job I like and I want to return to it.
I'm the GABRU.<eos> Didn't Tommy go to London?<eos> So apparently he is here.<eos> But he has given up cocaine.<eos> Doesn't even touch it.
To a man you refused to be pardoned.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did we refuse the pardons?<eos> Every man has his own reasons.<eos> Some remember the injustice of the merchant service and are too angry to ever to return to it.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.<eos> No, I don't imagine you would.<eos> So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been a partner to him in this way and that the ones that have seen those depths before, they never surfaced again.<eos> So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
Mm-hmm? When we leavin'?<eos> Soon as.<eos> Hey, what about your .22 target pistol and your Hopalong Cassidy cap gun?<eos> Ha, ha. Maybe you could find a bazooka or a couple of land mines, some grenades.<eos> Shit, we're just gonna dive down to find that money, not shoot at it.
And what's this?<eos> I've never seen her wear it.<eos> The-the date has no significance.<eos> It's not any of our birthdays. It's not dad's death or Melissa's.<eos> I mean, what is it about that quarter that she would frame it to put it around her neck?
Nothing.<eos> All the money, all the buildings, all the inventions, the world didn't care.<eos> My life, ultimately, didn't matter.<eos> Rip is giving me the chance to help save the world.<eos> I have to take it.
Fuzzy slippers, two pairs.<eos> One of those for you?<eos> Yes, all right. I get your point.<eos> I'll have the Machine up soon.<eos> I'm aware that every day without it means more bodies for you.
We are in possession of what could be the greatest discovery of all time.<eos> You've failed to illustrate that to us, Calvin.<eos> Well... I mean, I'm not a scientist.<eos> All I can say is that sharper minds than ours tell me this substance is potentially priceless.<eos> Atomic energy isn't even regulated yet, and Isodyne is set to make it a thing of the past.
I've always loved fireworks.<eos> Well, just fire, really.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Let him shoot me? Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Peggy, Jack, and I will be on the lookout for Frost.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Safety meeting.<eos> From the Isodyne atomic tests, we know that moments before the rift closes, anything within a certain radius will levitate and instantly be drawn into it.
Sit in it.<eos> Someday you're gonna be sitting in that chair for real.<eos> And you're gonna remember this moment and you're gonna understand it in a way that you couldn't possibly now.<eos> But know this... this is your case, Bryan.<eos> I'm not letting you walk away from it.
Did the fuel go up?<eos> No. It's unclear.<eos> There are traces of blood on the keel.<eos> Well, quick as you can with Forensics on that.<eos> - Who else has access to it?
So if you can call us back when you have a minute, that would be swell.<eos> Thanks, Patrick.<eos> 72 hours to vacate the premises.<eos> What happened to our flour?<eos> Debbie used it as an imaginary baby.
Well, generally, I prefer to keep my philanthropic works quiet, but the city is in simply too much trouble for me to remain in the shadows.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> The people destroying our homes need to be fought in the light of day.<eos> Well, I hope that we have a productive debate, Mr. queen.<eos> I look forward to it...
I mean, targeting happy couples?<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, it makes sense if you look at it from her perspective.<eos> Love betrayed her.<eos> And now she wants to go to war against it.
But I'm done trying to atone for past sins.<eos> It is curious the way you speak as though you and I - are not the same.<eos> - We are not the same!<eos> You see, I still have a chance at some small happiness.<eos> And I'm gonna take it.
Hill got attacked in his home yesterday with his wife and daughter there.<eos> Are they all right?<eos> Yeah, but he's determined to figure out who's behind the bounty so it doesn't happen again.<eos> Well, I don't blame him, but, look, there's something funky about that accountant you asked me to check out.<eos> According to the Office of Professions, he got his CPA license eight years ago, but he's only been making income from it up to four years ago, after that, nada.
You said he let you go to protect his wife.<eos> That he was scared.<eos> You had access to the documents in his safe.<eos> That doesn't look good on him either.<eos> If you and Alfred have a way to take advantage of Faber, you have to take it.
- I can't.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I can't do this...<eos> You poured me a cup of water. Do you remember?<eos> You drank from it yourself.
Let's go!<eos> What are you doing with all this yarn?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it looks like you're using it to knit a web of lies.
A real wrestling mat is not like this.<eos> It's like this.<eos> We have to fight in the yellow area.<eos> The red zone is a danger area.<eos> If you step out of it, you lose a point.
More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt... dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.<eos> They buy it and they sell it, and they fight and they fuck for it.
You're a genius.<eos> What happened yesterday wasn't just a shameful display of disrespect and disregard for common decency.<eos> It was validation for those people still concerned that my legislation isn't necessary.<eos> It is.<eos> Our survival depends on it.
Cat, I doubt all the people you've saved over the years would agree with that.<eos> Yeah, but it's coming back to haunt us.<eos> And all of it started with Vincent trying to make up for what happened to his brothers.<eos> With me trying to make up for what my mom did to Vincent.<eos> All right, Cat, figuring out how you got into this position is not as important as getting out of it, okay?
Look, fight me, and watch your friends die.<eos> See, you are strong, but they make you weak.<eos> Let us go.<eos> You can have the book.<eos> We won't be able to stop you without it.
The killer?<eos> He's just ordinary.<eos> Driven to a terrible act, but ordinary.<eos> And now with you so hard on his tail, I... I fear for him.<eos> You have a gentle heart, my friend, but there must and will be justice and I will pursue it to my dying breath.
I'll repair the damaged vein.<eos> Is that even a thing?<eos> If I have a viable graft, yes.<eos> Saphenous vein.<eos> It's thick enough, and she can go without it.
What scares you so much about spirituality?<eos> The whole thing is so crazy and inappropriate.<eos> Asking you to come to a seder?<eos> I don't want to join her cult.<eos> Okay. That's what it is, a cult, and she wants me to drink the Kool-Aid.
- Followed by the servants.<eos> - Ah, yes. - So, what have you been up to? - Well, helping the war effort.<eos> And... why are you here now?<eos> Surplus to requirements.<eos> I was actually coming to see if there was anyone in the Valley I could poach for a dig crew. You got Carnarvon to grab that concession before Davis let it hit the floor. Don't think I didn't notice.
Lovers of Liberty, we are back.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Ah, power.<eos> Power, my dear lovers of Liberty, is the beating heart of our nation's bosom.<eos> The high and mighty members of the political elite feed on it, breed on it, for power is the host, the enormous teat off which this entire town suckles.
Strange.<eos> Luciana said you were brave.<eos> I'm not.<eos> No, you are foolish.<eos> Death is not to be feared, but it shouldn't be pursued.
Think about it.<eos> I know the sports scores for 30 years.<eos> No.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Okay, so, now that we've time travelled, we just go back to the cabin to snatch the book before young Ash can read from it.
Yes.<eos> And then I spent the next three years traveling by your side.<eos> Right up until you abandoned me.<eos> What was your plan then?<eos> I simply saw an opportunity to gain favor with the Khan and I took it.
Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.<eos> Concerns that have been resolved through hours of conversation and reviewing the data.<eos> President Shwe got on board for a very good reason.<eos> If Conrad would call me back...<eos> President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.
Hi, Don.<eos> Hi, Tina.<eos> Henry McCord.<eos> Come on in.<eos> So for all the inconvenience that a strong security detail may bring to the neighborhood, it also cuts crime rates in the following ways.
Mission control is over a mile from the launchpad, so camera surveillance is all they're seeing of the rocket.<eos> You know, I hate to point this out, but in Speed,<eos> Dennis Hopper spotted that the film was looped; it didn't work.<eos> That was only because there was repetitive patterns to the bus passengers' movement.<eos> The rocket's a motionless, stand-alone object-- nothing around it's moving.
Shit.<eos> We can't go down there.<eos> There's too many of them.<eos> We need that card.<eos> I don't think we can get to the computer without it.
So you came up with a story that would allow for the occasional trip-up.<eos> You were abused, locked in a basement, you forgot your old life;<eos> that way, no one would be suspicious when you had trouble remembering things the real Mina would have known.<eos> My favorite wrinkle was Keith's truck.<eos> You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.
Might I have a word with you, Ma'am?<eos> I'm sorry, Ma'am, I'm afraid it couldn't wait.<eos> Flora Hastings has taken a turn for the worse.<eos> I should have listened when you told me to do nothing.<eos> It's always easier to give advice than it is to follow it, Ma'am.
- Do you think?<eos> Sometimes people can do the wrong thing with the best intentions or the right of something isn't seen straightaway.<eos> Love is so difficult, isn't it?<eos> Brings such pain.<eos> I sometimes think we'd be better off without it.
He's planning multiple attacks. He sent me to Chicago to drop money to another one of his men.<eos> New Orleans is just the beginning.<eos> Who's the other man?<eos> What's the operation?<eos> When is it gonna happen?
I'm good with numbers.<eos> Really?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well...<eos> I want you to take a number and add something to it.
- To Scotland?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I admit I have.<eos> This war and my part in it has proven very different to what I expected.
That's reason number one.<eos> - You're not going out, Erin.<eos> - Why not?<eos> This is exactly what he wants, get in your head, throw you off your game.<eos> How can I be "off" my game if you won't even let me in it?
Let me know when you're done.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, Angie.<eos> Yeah? I have something for you.<eos> Oh. So the bracelet looked so good on you that I thought I should get you something to go along with it.
Um, Sam, I have some bad news.<eos> Things aren't going so well with Danny and Riley, and Danny needs his room back.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, that sucks.<eos> Just got the bathroom clean enough to use it.
- And how do you justify that?<eos> - Well, the lights are on and the place has been open for 100 years.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Okay, also, I've noticed a strange discrepancy in your inventory and sales ledger.<eos> You can see here, it shows that you buy a case of Johnny Walker Black per month and that you sell two cases per month.
- You're helping with vitals?<eos> - Yep.<eos> As acting CXO, I want to get a feel for everybody's job... so I can understand how to make improvements.<eos> How can I upgrade your work experience?<eos> Remove yourself from it.
You did it!<eos> I didn't know what you were gonna say.<eos> I thought I'd have to watch you die right there.<eos> There was a moment when I knew the Devil had won... That I had fallen out of God's world into his.<eos> And then I saw you... Your face and the love... Light shining from it.
But honestly, it would've been very hard to tell because, like I've said before, she was very intoxicated.<eos> Did you know at the time that Mr. Aguirre was a high-ranking detective at the Monroe County Sheriff's Department?<eos> I didn't handle the situation well.<eos> I was young, I was a rookie, I admit that.<eos> And if that same situation were to arise today, I'd handle it completely differently.
If you had a problem, you could prevent an outbreak just with the push of a button.<eos> - Genocide.<eos> Mass murder.<eos> - That was the Army, that wasn't us.<eos> Once they had the tech, they wanted to use it.
Seemed like the right call at the time.<eos> I know why he came onboard, why he changed his face to look like Jace Corso.<eos> His wife was murdered, and you were the number one suspect.<eos> He came for revenge.<eos> And when he had the chance, he didn't take it.
And that's what Ash really wanted.<eos> It really was.<eos> We're back.<eos> In the appeal of Deborah Larsson against Janet King, we have considered both submissions carefully.<eos> This is a complex matter and future judges may choose to revisit it.
I've tracked our victim's missing cellphone to its final transmission.<eos> The last ping we had from the GPS in cushing's cell, was from 7:00 this morning, at the Hollywood Reservoir.<eos> Two and a half miles from the crime scene.<eos> Where the phone went offline.<eos> The killer wanted something from it... A text, a picture, what?
Yeah, anything to make this place look a little more homey.<eos> How you doing? Me?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Oh, just 'cause, you know, I mean, we had that conversation about my work, and, you know, we never... You never really brought it up again, so...
Oh, game on.<eos> Wait.<eos> That's it.<eos> Next to the abutment.<eos> Or at least what's left of it.
You cleared me.<eos> Look, I'm out of here, man.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Look, I need your help.<eos> I don't think I can solve Greene's murder without it.
Yeah.<eos> Bea's still boss but, eh?<eos> I got slotted because that Koori lagged, and bloody Maxine did fuck all.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> I want my pound of flesh Bea, I'm entitled to it.
Very excited to hear that you and your daughter finally got a diagnosis.<eos> - It's good.<eos> - Yeah, it's great.<eos> Hey, will you step over into my office here for a second?<eos> You know, sometimes people get new perspective, how they got into a situation, they reevaluate getting out of it, you know, and if that were the case, I just wanted to offer my assistance, you know?
I just wanted you to know that I've got the Ceramic Mechanic, and, well...<eos> It was your dad's, and I think it should be yours.<eos> That's just how I feel.<eos> That's thoughtful, Ted, but, uh,<eos> I was never really that attached to it, to be honest.
Thank you. Victor's playing "N" word Jim.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Yeah. What's up, babe?<eos> Well, it's about, uh, my choreography.<eos> It doesn't have the right feel.
We're done.<eos> I'm breaking up the band.<eos> I'm serious, go!<eos> Get out of Dodge. Yeah, well, not for nothing, but you promised us a payday.<eos> We're not leaving till we get it.
Didn't sleep, didn't eat, just hunted.<eos> 51 kills, all command level.<eos> And that girls' school?<eos> It's still there to this day.<eos> Taliban won't go near it.
It's not gonna happen to me, it's not gonna happen to us.<eos> You want me to come home?<eos> Just make sure you're still you when it's all over.<eos> So three years in the jungles fighting FARC.<eos> Hugo Martinez chose his own path a long time ago and he hasn't deviated from it since.
Where'd she go?<eos> Lee's taped confession.<eos> I killed Daddy.<eos> An obvious attempt by Ms. Harris to stop the abuse of her kidnapper.<eos> For all we know, Flora, this impressionable child, may have seen that tape and built false memories around it.
I just...<eos> I don't understand why.<eos> Oh, just 'cause it's always raining here.<eos> You know, it would be nice to have somewhere dry to hide, get some sort of livable space.<eos> Well, how about when you find a tarp, you can make it livable.
But that doesn't change anything.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You don't need revenge to get over what happened to the person you loved.<eos> If I can learn that, anyone can.<eos> You may have sent me down this path, but not even you can take me off it now.
How affirmed do I have to be?<eos> You may not think you need the help, you do.<eos> It took you guys 17 years to catch one half of Silver Bells, and he was already dead.<eos> I've been living and breathing this case.<eos> I want your assurance you're not going to push me out of it.
You know that war I told you I was fighting every day?<eos> Against the world breaking.<eos> I'm losing.<eos> How far to the girl's world?<eos> Space travel would take 9,000 years, which is why we're searching for the cracks that lead to it instead.
I know what it means.<eos> It just seems trivial.<eos> Try to understand that this is a very delicate stage.<eos> Public opinion matters a great deal.<eos> Without it, everything falls apart.
Once a parent always a parent I agree<eos> No holiday from this job, right Ashu? All parents should be awarded a President's Award Huh?<eos> I love the food<eos> So end it then Just end it What?<eos> The job of being a parent, just end it
It's just like the other bodies we found up in the Arctic.<eos> I guess we know why Rudy Jones was the only survivor. He killed them all...<eos> You can't stop us.<eos> You can't stop what we're changing into.<eos> This planet is being destroyed by the human race, which lives only to suck the life from it.
The guy's holding a beaker.<eos> Shut up.<eos> That your handiwork?<eos> Guns are not my thing.<eos> Lie to us again, and I'll figure out the exact chemicals you used to dissolve that serial number off that pistol, cook up a batch and put your hand in it.
I didn't want to marry her, okay? I just...<eos> I wanted it...<eos> I'm trying to save this guy's life here. Who the hell is this guy anyway?<eos> What does that matter?<eos> Uh, because I can see his liver... or what's left of it.
Just us?<eos> Just us, just you and me me, but if you want to go home, you have to pull the large blue lever near the seat.<eos> That will get you home.<eos> Ah, I see the lever.<eos> You're lying right next to it on the chaise.
Herrmann, you big softy.<eos> You never gave me a free t-shirt.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I know, but sometimes you go up that ladder and there ain't nothing you can do.<eos> So if I get a chance to do something good, I'm taking it.
He wants us to do our voir dire right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, everyone knows everyone in this courthouse, so... it's gonna be weird.<eos> Chunk, I'm gonna need your Southern charm.<eos> Never leave home without it.
I'm "hangry" right now, and I would love to get some food.<eos> Find me the closest taco shop.<eos> Here's what I could find on how to make taco shells.<eos> No, not a recipe for taco shells.<eos> Now, not only does the machine talk to you, but you can talk to it.
Hey, look, I got some frame grabs from the overpass.<eos> See?<eos> It's not a bomb!<eos> Listen. That...<eos> That sphere... They came out of it.
No ship is going to come.<eos> If we stay, we die.<eos> How long do you think it would take to trust the birds to stop coming here once they see their eggs eaten?<eos> It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance.<eos> And to be able to prepare for it... a curse to be so far from home... or a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace... or a chance to settle scores.
My little lady, Lycrecia.<eos> My big boy, Bocephus!<eos> Now, right now, I got a little song for ya.<eos> It's been awful good to me and the boys.<eos> It's bought us quite a few beans and biscuits.
Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> So I'm working on this new song.<eos> But.<eos> I'm just so inside of it now.
How do you think people responded to the prospect of imminent doom?<eos> They gobbled it up, like a chocolate éclair.<eos> They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.<eos> It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies.<eos> The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.
We do not know, sir.<eos> What?<eos> This is number one disaster!<eos> His message must not reach the Gorg.<eos> This planet was hard to find, and I will not abandon it!
- I can't say.<eos> I know better than to blindly trust my sources. If anybody on Earth knows that, it's me.<eos> But this is different, okay?<eos> This has been months.<eos> My whole reputation's on the line, or what's left of it anyway.
- No.<eos> - Spectre.<eos> Its name is Spectre.<eos> - How does she know that?<eos> - Because my father was part of it.
Fuck off.<eos> If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.<eos> - Now you've got no toilet. - Get out of the bathroom.<eos> You bastards.<eos> Go on, you can use it.
A man doesn't like to ask for directions.<eos> I can find my way out, Fred.<eos> I saw you found that better offer as well.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, kid.<eos> Your face is an acquired taste, but I'm getting used to it.
Welcome to our fair city. Sir.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> I see you've already met my daughter, Edith.<eos> The Sharpe clay mines have been royal purveyors of the purest scarlet clay since 1796.<eos> In its liquid form, it is so rich in ore and so malleable that it can produce the strongest bricks and tiles.
The apocalypse.<eos> Do those sound like rational or irrational fears?<eos> Anyone? Irrational.<eos> All right, Luna, tell Gary why his fears are irrational.<eos> Gary... you don't need to be afraid of the apocalypse because... it's gonna happen, no matter what.
C'mon ...<eos> Okay, I love a challenge.<eos> Deal you<eos> Remember, I want that school.<eos> The rest means nothing without it.
Love this new car smell.<eos> Really nice.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Welcome to Lake Balaton.<eos> I found this staircase and made them built a house around it.
Trading post up ahead.<eos> We can dine at a table while sittin' on a chair.<eos> Tie the horses 'round back.<eos> Everyone knew about the bounty except Jay.<eos> He was leading me right to it.
I mean, this isn't the beginning that you had hoped for, but it is... still a beginning.<eos> And since when are you a girl who does it the easy way?<eos> It's just a TV show; it's not who you are.<eos> I mean, you're not gonna be defined by this failure.<eos> The future will judge you based on what you do to come back from it.
The citizens united, this was January 2009, I guess, that's a very important supreme court decision, but it has a history and you got to think about the history.<eos> The 14th amendment has a provision that says, "no person's rights can be infringed without due process of law."<eos> And the intent, clearly, was to protect freed slaves.<eos> Says, "okay, they've got the protection of the law." I don't think it's ever been used for freed slaves, if ever, marginally.<eos> Almost immediately, it was used for businesses, corporations.
And so for those who are arguing that information should not be encrypted, certainly that makes it easier for law enforcement to... combat, but it also makes it easier for the cyber criminals to attack.<eos> It makes total sense that criminals are among the early wave, along with the sort of paranoid people, of these new tools and services.<eos> But that doesn't mean that they're the only people using these services.<eos> There are a hell of a lot of journalists that I know and regularly communicate with now over Tor.<eos> But you know, for the people who oppose this technology, who see it as a threat, the fact that criminals use it is a great way to demonize it.
Because at the moment I don't believe our interests are adverse to each other.<eos> I don't believe you did any of this for a pardon, or a passage to Nassau, or to be able to walk away from anything.<eos> I think you intend to reclaim your captaincy.<eos> I think you intend to take control of this ship.<eos> And then I think you intend to return to that beach, armed to the teeth, and seize every last ounce of gold off of it.
Maybe I could get her to change her mind.<eos> April Carver to see Leo Hendrie.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Leo updated his visitors list.<eos> You're no longer on it.
- Nothing personal.<eos> - Just mine?<eos> The hangman got himself a gun too?<eos> I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours.<eos> I feel kinda' naked without it.
I got it.<eos> That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's kinda' pretty.<eos> - Got another verse to it?
Why did you involve me in his murder?<eos> Murder?<eos> Do you know how many people he has killed?<eos> We've been looking for him since 6 years.<eos> I had just one chance to kill him, and I couldn't lose it..
Harold.<eos> Sir.<eos> CLERK: That's 699.<eos> Got that.<eos> This is an opportunity, Beatrix, and I am seizing it.
I've created a character.<eos> I have a top hat.<eos> I wear only black.<eos> I teach myself to draw a perfect circle on the ground, and within this circle, I never speak, not one word.<eos> The circle is my domain, and I don't allow even half of a toe inside of it.
He's okay. I'm thinking maybe it's time for me to end this trespassing.<eos> This is the New York Port Authority Police!<eos> Remove yourself from the wire immediately.<eos> You're in violation of about 100 city ordinances.<eos> I want you off that wire immediately or we will be forced to take steps to remove you from it.
Claire!<eos> I was not trying to suggest that you not be the ambassador<eos> - when I brought up Cathy.<eos> I was just--<eos> - We made a deal, and now you're trying to back away from it.
And I could show her that we don't have to be outcasts.<eos> That sounds like another year of pretending.<eos> Dude.<eos> I don't know if anyone's told you, but you are a player.<eos> If I drew a vagina on a white piece of paper, you'd probably hit on it.
- I can't find it. - Can't find what?<eos> McCall's package.<eos> - Then what the hell is this?<eos> - Doorknobs.<eos> Without it, we can't finish what we started.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> Negative.<eos> The third well is not functional.<eos> - We were just there. - What's wrong with it?<eos> Somebody threw a corpse in it to contaminate the water.
I was nothing.<eos> I would soon be forgotten, a footnote in history. Whereas he, with his legacy of blood and horror, would be remembered for ever.<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> He haunts me still.<eos> But... laughter or not, justice came, as it always does.
There's simply no way of stealing their gold.<eos> But there might be something else you can steal... their war ship.<eos> You will both be transported back to Nassau at which point you will be removed from this ship permanently.<eos> I think you intend to take control of this ship.<eos> And then I think you intend to return to that beach and seize every last ounce of gold off of it.
How so?<eos> Um, well, because I'm about to pass this legislation.<eos> - Families First?<eos> - Families First, yeah.<eos> I'm very proud of it.
- ( knocks )<eos> - Ma'am... history is calling. And it won't go to voice mail.
Until a lucky rogue can save us.<eos> Took all the villagers... If you left because you got bored, so help me. I'm at the hospital with the book and your nice old library guy.<eos> Actually not so nice.<eos> He's reading the book to the kid.<eos> H-he's getting some kind of juice from it.
.. Reverend Wilson called out, "Vive la France!"<eos> Ah, been sleeping in the mountains, have you?<eos> Have some breakfast. Thank you, my Lord.<eos> How do you like the war, Mr... um...?<eos> Oh, it was rather confusing at first, but I grow used to it.
Since you won't be going to Delhi, what enemy's neck would you place it on?<eos> The Peshwa doesn't lack enemies.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Your neck is very valuable,"<eos> ..and more delicate than this string of pearls around it.
Cerbera odollam. From Madagascar.<eos> They call it the Suicide Tree.<eos> Its sap contains an alkaloid toxin which blocks the calcium channels in the heart.<eos> If nature had its way, you'd already be dead.<eos> But this plant is harmless, because I grafted the poison out of it.
- The possession spell is fatal.<eos> Ruth made it very clear, it's dark magic.<eos> When Aleister took over his body, he destroyed Clay's soul.<eos> No. No, I don't believe her.<eos> Jeremy: If there was any other option, we'd be taking it.
McInnis has been winning all night.<eos> He's got someone watching in another room, feeding him cards.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> Now, Barnes owed Holiday a lot of money.<eos> By killing Nathan Barnes, you cheated him out of it.
I know.<eos> And aol loves you too.<eos> What happened to us, Becca?<eos> Our huge fight was still years away.<eos> If I didn't say anything, maybe it would never happen.
You going to let us fry out here?<eos> How long can a person live without food?<eos> Three weeks.<eos> But water's a different story.<eos> Some people can only go a few days without it.
Aliens can't have little hats because of their antennas or whatever.<eos> Do you think you could hook us up again?<eos> My boy Jason here wants to try it. Lately, he's been kind of down.<eos> Yeah, I could hook you up.<eos> But remember, it's not for escaping reality, it's for, like, embracing it.
Especially in here.<eos> But when you look at Norma... you can take that armor off... because it's safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> And... you're crying... because it feels... so good to take that armor off.<eos> And you realize how tall you can be without it... how light.
It hasn't been tested yet.<eos> Not even on a rat.<eos> It will either help you or kill you, Raghu.<eos> This medicine might kill me.<eos> But without it, I will surely die.
I'll get you some rabbits. Great.<eos> You packing different steel nowadays?<eos> Live by it, you die by it... And eat potato puffs by it.<eos> Pray to god you don't have to use it again.<eos> Pray to god you don't get used to not using it again.
Bin Laden money never got near Bush.<eos> Okay.<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> What you're looking at is George W. Bush's... entire Texas Air National Guard file.<eos> - You mean what's left of it, right?
Every second counts.<eos> Fine. Do it.<eos> Go.<eos> Just search away.<eos> [ scoffs ] [ voice breaking ] it was one moment, And i will never escape it.
Don't-- don't put two girls on in a row.<eos> You guys are here for the, uh, open mic?<eos> Okay, here's how it's gonna work.<eos> We're doing a lottery. That's what we're doing.<eos> I wish there was a camera on the inside of my head and the inside of all of your heads, and we could project it onto the wall... over each other, and then we wouldn't have to do anything.
But he's your brother.<eos> - I mean, what else is he gonna do?<eos> - Marco. Listen to me, all right?<eos> Chuck's not making me do this.<eos> He's giving me an opportunity and I'm grabbing it.
But you really don't.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's a big place and I asked the wrong person for help.<eos> And I don't think I can get out of it.<eos> Well, if you don't like that job, you don't have to do it.
Supporting Lauren.<eos> That is how I'll protect her.<eos> Well done, Bo.<eos> You have found your inner justice.<eos> Use it wisely.
~ This land belongs to you.<eos> It can rot for all I care.<eos> But it's our home - everything we know.<eos> Then take it.<eos> I've no use for it. I give it to you.
Come On.<eos> I Was Just Wondering, Um, What Happened To Your Shirt.<eos> I Tore It On A Nail.<eos> You... You Tore It On A Nail, So You Threw It Out?<eos> I Ended Up Using It As A Rag.
I'm finally being let out of the lab, if only for one procedure.<eos> Bertie.<eos> To assist Dr. Zinberg in the removal of a traumatic keloid of the median nerve.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's extra tissue on a nerve in a woman's arm that causes her not to have any use of it.
And for our stuffing, I got us lobster, duck, Chanterelle mushrooms, And your favorite, sausage and ricotta cheese.<eos> Yum.<eos> So, did you bring your bucket list?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I know you're gonna make fun of it.
Good copy.<eos> Hickey, get the Coyote on the patch just 10 meters left of that culvert, put a round in it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> Hickey, put a round in that patch next to it.
Holy simplicity was all very well in its day, but its day is over.<eos> We're at war.<eos> Just because the Emperor's soldiers aren't running down the street, don't deceive yourself.<eos> This is a war and you're in the enemy camp.<eos> They talked about the Emperor, about the invasion, about the best way to bring it about.
I know.<eos> I'll go to Rome with Carlo and his men.<eos> They won't harm me.<eos> I'm their hero.<eos> If you take the page, could you... if you read from it,
And you know Tariq's got all these fees for basketball and Raina's growing like a weed.<eos> She needs new clothes, new shoes every other week.<eos> I gotta pay the rent with a real check and the kids' tuition, and I've been saving for that.<eos> And we got your first payroll check from your job with Stern.<eos> It'll keep the lights on, literally, and that's about it.
How can anything good come of it?<eos> I'm glad he's dead.<eos> I'm sorry, but why should we mourn him?<eos> Fate has given us a chance to be happy.<eos> If we don't take it, who gains?
You must be getting a jump on things.<eos> You don't look like you could be very far along.<eos> Hmm. It's coming sooner than you'd think.<eos> That deal I offered? It's now off the table.<eos> That's fine. I wasn't going to take it.
~ Not that bad, am I?<eos> ~ You'll demotivate our entire intake.<eos> The boredom drips off you.<eos> ~ I was good at my job.<eos> ~ Yeah, and you're no longer fit for it.
Oh, Lizzy.<eos> You fancy her.<eos> You are alive in there!<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> The closest we've come to talking was when we both wanted the same exercise ball, and she forced me to take it first.
Then you would not become The Flash.<eos> And so I stabbed your mother in the heart, and I was free.<eos> Finally able to return to a future without The Flash, only to realize that in traveling back I'd lost my way home.<eos> Lost my ability to harness the speed force.<eos> And without it, I was stuck here.
Well, no, I wouldn't say forced, but forceful.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> I teach art to society's outcasts.<eos> It's meaningful work.<eos> - I derive much joy from it. - Oh, Frankie.
My daddy screwed my whore of a wife.<eos> You're all weak.<eos> You always have been.<eos> And that is why it is finally time for you to die.<eos> Humanity deserves everything that's coming to it.
And that's without the television element.<eos> I do know you were always uneasy about that.<eos> I was... but it sometimes seems to me, the older I get, the more I have to learn.<eos> We get so much out of love.<eos> We find strength in it and courage.
[Thud] The steering wheel from Jason's Aston Martin.<eos> They found it at the garage.<eos> [Sighs] What a waste.<eos> Not really.<eos> - I pulled three sets of prints off of it.
My name is Carrie Mathison.<eos> I'm from the During Foundation.<eos> We funded the construction of your gym.<eos> Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.<eos> The men are using it right now.
I haven't given him an answer because I don't know what I want to do, and I have this long list of reasons why not.<eos> Well, there's always a list.<eos> - Is there?<eos> - I had a list.<eos> Thank goodness, I kind of, you know, ultimately didn't pay much attention to it.
We've got every department between North Carolina and DC on alert.<eos> We're focusing on public transit.<eos> But how did Zoey get that woman's iPad in the first place?<eos> Zoey was desperate. She needed to get online.<eos> She saw an opportunity, and she took it.
A speech at one in the morning, we lose major viewership.<eos> My children and my dear husband...<eos> Fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> How do you want to handle the stage if she's not on it?
Can we go back to being friends?<eos> I would love that.<eos> A movie version of your book could still happen.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Take it to Broadway, they could make a musical out of it.
Well, what am I supposed to do, - stop believing in people?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Do you really think Kevin is gonna give you back your jacket?<eos> Absolutely!<eos> You know, once summer rolls around and he's not so attached to it.
Unless, of course, producing an electric car for the masses isn't a part of Ellis's vision for the future.<eos> You saying it's not?<eos> Ford or Ferrari-- who do you think Ellis wants to be?<eos> With this merger, Maya's dream of mass production is effectively neutralized.<eos> Without it, however, Maya is free to take her highly sought-after technology anywhere.
What she said.<eos> Look, I appreciate your concern, I do.<eos> And, more importantly, I appreciate everything you guys have done so far, but I...<eos> I am not changing my mind.<eos> I was wrong to put us on this path and I'm not going to stop till I get us off it.
- It's amazing. Come!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> It's called the Buddha Strand Sea of Stars.<eos> It's the most beautiful place on earth.<eos> The water is so clear, that once you step in it, - it's like you're standing on the sky. - Wow.
Okay, let's go inside. We should go in. Yeah?<eos> Come on in.<eos> Feel free to explore.<eos> Oh, we have My mother's new men's line. It's minty gleam.<eos> It's her original recipe, but we'll probably update it with a little musk...
Yes.<eos> Are you familiar with the works of William Glasser? Reality therapy?<eos> Graham and I met in a workshop, and...<eos> Reality therapy is about personal choice, personal responsibility, personal transformation.<eos> And it's helped me not be afraid to tell Graham what I need... um, including in bed.
That's not exactly true.<eos> Zelena...<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Imported magic, dear.<eos> Never travel between realms without it.
- You have to disable him like that.<eos> Drainer.<eos> Yes, it's the only way to be sure.<eos> Will that thing be ready?<eos> Can you... shoot him with it and...
Aren't you supposed to be helping me?<eos> You got a place to stay, don't you?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> What is this book?<eos> It's the book that Adalind used to do what she did to you and Nick.
What the hell did you do, Simon?<eos> Wow, you seem a little upset, Marcus.<eos> Is this a discussion we should be having by my parking space?<eos> My entire Web site is down.<eos> Every time I text, try to get it back online, it crashes again.
Tell me what you see.<eos> I got C-4 taped to her body.<eos> He set up this whole... this whole perimeter around her.<eos> Okay. I need you to find the trigger.<eos> I'm showing no receivers or transmitters checking in, so it's either on the bomb or it's wired to it.
Nobody offered to pay for my borehole.<eos> Should I send you the invoice?<eos> Please...<eos> Anyway, the purchase of the pump, as for any investment for the general good, will be subject to a vote.<eos> We'll need to build a shelter for it.
If I were you... I would drop the charges.<eos> What just happened?<eos> Conti's car was outside the social club that night.<eos> There was no way to know he wasn't in it when the murders went down.<eos> He saw a chance to make a deal and he took it.
All you need is a few teaspoons to kill tens of thousands.<eos> He took pounds of this stuff.<eos> Yet we show him strong evidence that Sima might be trying to manipulate him, and he's still blinded by emotion- - I don't get it.<eos> Love makes you do crazy things.<eos> That is why there are so many songs written about it.
He's getting ready to come after me, and he's smart enough to know that he's gonna need help if he wants to survive.<eos> What the hell you doing with her?<eos> I asked you a question!<eos> You need to think hard about this moment, son.<eos> Your whole life has led up to it.
We need to talk. Please, please call me back.<eos> I need a place to stay.<eos> I can't go home until I figure out what I am.<eos> I need you to open a book.<eos> It's the book that Adalind used to do what she did to you and Nick.
The only thing Alistair was ever guilty of was loving Rebecca.<eos> Love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.<eos> So that's what all of this... is about.<eos> Rebecca dumped you all those years ago, and now you're making the world pay, you're making me pay?<eos> No, you more than anybody, should know the power of love and the pain of life without it.
It's one long conversation, a mutual regard.<eos> The Indians of Patagonia, believed that souls didn't die, and that they could live again, as stars.<eos> They say that water has memory.<eos> I believe it also has a voice.<eos> If we were to get very close to it, we'd be able to hear the voices of each of the Indians and the disappeared.
Emily: Right there.<eos> He was at the courthouse with Margaux.<eos> And look.<eos> My glass clearly moved.<eos> He must have slipped something into it.
He's a really nice guy. I am on a date with conjoined twins.<eos> This is, I think, what we do best.<eos> You need to find a way to get invited to that funeral.<eos> Just crash it.<eos> Malick: These shows where all four of us are thrown into a completely improbable situation and just try to logically get through it as best we can.
~ it's pointless. It's like water.<eos> ~ How's it like water?<eos> Cos it's neither good nor bad, it just doesn't do anything.<eos> Water's useful for a lot of things.<eos> It is if you put hops in it, or grapes. But on its own...
You've had this since high school.<eos> Look at this... there's rips everywhere.<eos> - It's vintage.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You keep making fun of it...
But, I know how you did that.<eos> Vijay went to Panaji on 3rd October in Sam's car.<eos> He took a take away from a restaurant.<eos> Then, he probably bought a used phone.<eos> He put Sam's SIM card into it. Then, he dumped the phone into a truck with a national permit.
You can bank on us...<eos> Sequoia Liberty.<eos> Okay, yes, they do sound similar.<eos> They're the same song.<eos> Someone stole my song and turned it into a jingle.
It's out!<eos> It's out!<eos> What happened?<eos> It must have been that candle.<eos> Why'd you sit so close to it?
Let's talk story.<eos> I stuck my neck out for you.<eos> Put my reputation on the line.<eos> And you decided to repay that favor by going through your cousin's case files and finding out a few clients who were living alone, fresh off a big settlement.<eos> I'm thinking you saw an opportunity and you took it.
Patty Spivot.<eos> Captain Singh mentioned there may be positions available on your anti-meta-human task force.<eos> Yeah, everybody quit.<eos> There is no task force anymore.<eos> Well, I know someone who's interested in being on it.
Thought-stunting, bat-blind stupidity is the sine qua non of incarceration.<eos> - Wouldn't that include us?<eos> - Indeed. But stupidity is relative.<eos> Some have it in abundance, and others have comparatively little.<eos> As members of the latter category, we have an advantage, and I suggest we use it.
You are in reality mere sister drones, little, meek equals whose power is shared.<eos> Why, you're like the foot of a pyramid.<eos> But you will make a fine and mighty base for one more naturally designed to rule.<eos> You?<eos> Well, you can put a crown on a sow's head and it doesn't make it a queen.
20 minutes ago, he made the same argument you just made.<eos> All our intelligence assessments are unanimous that Juliet is the last of the coup conspirators.<eos> There's strong evidence that she's still conspiring with opposition elements in Iran, which means she arguably poses a clear and present danger to American lives.<eos> We have a real shot at taking her out.<eos> We're going to take it.
And voilà, we have ourselves a fingerprint.<eos> Your fingerprints are in the system because you have a locksmith license.<eos> Fine. So what?<eos> We found the champagne bottle you used to kill Leslie.<eos> We were able to lift prints from it, as well as traces of Leslie's blood.
All I wanted to do was impress Captain Holt, and you know what?<eos> It didn't matter.<eos> It didn't matter that we were late, it didn't matter that I was chill, and it didn't matter that the rats ate my salad.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I definitely saw them running away from it.
I was just thinking about pudding on the way over here.<eos> Okay, well, you two are clearly in love, but I could also go for some pudding.<eos> Why we all got pudding on the brain?<eos> It's got to be that new billboard advertising pudding on the highway.<eos> We all drove past it on the way here.
I'm just the kid sister with the silly hobby.<eos> You know, I thought she seemed kind of troubled too, recently.<eos> Do you think it was just about work?<eos> Dani was only about work.<eos> She lived for it.
I don't... I don't understand.<eos> You understood just fine the last time.<eos> In fact, you grabbed a piece of my rope, picked up a cinder block from outside, then off you walked into the woods.<eos> I told you you needed help. You needed a guide.<eos> But you were itching to do battle, so off you went to do it.
I asked about you not your job.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Well, I'm April Carver.<eos> And I'm...<eos> I have this interview, so I should probably get ready for it.
Forgive me, the game is made up of code, isn't it, on the disk?<eos> Yes.<eos> So does it not therefore follow that if it's in the code it's in the game?<eos> Well, no, it doesn't, it's a little more complicated than that, actually.<eos> The scene is in the code, but the players can't access it.
But then, there wouldn't be if Rasheed had just walked him out of a fire exit.<eos> Well, nor would there be if he just checked out and found alternate accommodations.<eos> A possibility.<eos> If he had not abandoned his epinephrine with the rest of his toiletries.<eos> It's prescribed for a deathly peanut allergy and I doubt he would willfully travel without it.
You really do think there's a way to cure the Troubles after all.<eos> Ready?<eos> You have to focus.<eos> You rematerialize too soon, you're gonna end up as part of the gate.<eos> I'm gonna be picking you out of it.
How about you enjoy those smoothies without the creatine?<eos> I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.<eos> Eh.<eos> Hey, look, you've gotten this far.<eos> You'll do great Sunday, even without it.
I will give you your freedom but first you must do something for me.<eos> Renounce your title and swear an oath of allegiance recognising me as the true heir of Atlantis.<eos> So the Oracle's prophecy was not favourable.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to live.<eos> For the sake of everyone you hold dear, I suggest you take it.
Now!<eos> Is your book more important than me?<eos> Nothing is more important than you.<eos> But it has caused great misery in this world.<eos> And... I must make sure it doesn't cause any more.
Who loves you and who you love.<eos> And Jeannie...<eos> Boy, did she understand that.<eos> Okay, you see this prickly pear?<eos> This is just about the only sweet thing that grows around here, so the Pueblo Indians make it into candy.
Guys, this is bad.<eos> No, no, it's- it's perfectly safe.<eos> Just don't break the circle, and the demon remains contained.<eos> Um, but reading from the book is what caused all this trouble to begin with, so...<eos> Yeah, that's true, but reading from it again can't make things any worse.
- Where specifically?<eos> - The Black Archive.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> The dark little storage facility for forbidden alien tech where all of this began.<eos> Who has access to it?
I'll relax when he's in custody.<eos> I know.<eos> We screwed up.<eos> Maybe if I had called the cops earlier.<eos> Look.. ...you had a chance to corner Charles, and you took it.
All right.<eos> Man, it smells really nice in there.<eos> You got to hit me with the deets on that candle.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It is a great candle.
That's ridiculous.<eos> If you were on perimeter detail, you'd be blocks away, not 100 yards from the blast.<eos> There's not a scratch on you, which is impossible, unless you placed yourself where we found you after the explosion, which I believe that you did.<eos> And we checked your gun.<eos> It was fired recently, three bullets, and there's nothing on file with the Bureau, so you better pray that we don't find them.
Time isn't healing.<eos> I am still frozen.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> It means my death is a fixed event.<eos> The universe depends on it happening.
That would blow out my delicate varicose veins.<eos> Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> This syringe is far too big to shoot up with.<eos> The unsub definitely left it behind.<eos> Now, if we're lucky, we might be able to get some DNA off of it, but this guy's so good, I doubt we're gonna get that lucky.
I'm reconsidering.<eos> Still, I might've given my life for her.<eos> God, we would've made such a handsome couple.<eos> So, how did that happen?<eos> My asshole hand. It came back, grew another me.
My asshole hand. It came back, grew another me.<eos> Same shit, different day.<eos> Things were goin' fine with Amanda too, but that went south.<eos> All because of that goddamn book.<eos> No disrespect. You were the one who read from it.
You don't get it, do you?<eos> What's wrong between us can't be fixed.<eos> Yeah, it can.<eos> 'Cause the reasons we were fighting, Colt, they don't matter anymore.<eos> Son, the brand is dead, a-and I never should've gone down that road to begin with, and I sure as hell shouldn't have made it more important than you, and I know that now.
See, that's what I love about art.<eos> It's so subjective.<eos> Can't you make your misogynist jokes without dragging my art into it?<eos> I'm sorry you're offended, but I have no intention of discontinuing this shirt.<eos> It's one of my best-sellers.
Coulson's orders were to end him.<eos> I had one shot. I took it.<eos> And you missed.<eos> You're off that assignment.<eos> Then put me on it.
Daylin for the calcifying of my eardrums, which means the music dies for me in the next decade.<eos> Had my first stroke when I was 11, my second when I was 21.<eos> I have a shaky hand to prove it.<eos> Botulinum toxin...<eos> never leave home without it.
Those walls you put up, Emma, it's time they come down.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Helping you break the walls.<eos> As your friend, I command you, Dark One, tell me, why are you so afraid to give up the darkness?<eos> Once I let it go, I won't be able to protect my family.
- Alyc?<eos> - She was learning her letters.<eos> Could you tell me what she was wearing?<eos> Her Sunday dress.<eos> She was proud of it.
Please, just tell me-- am I completely paralyzed?<eos> I'm afraid... of ghosts.<eos> And yes.<eos> Mr. Swanson has lost all movement, and will require around-the-clock care.<eos> Most of it disgusting.
I have destroyed my copy of Alex's research.<eos> You should destroy yours.<eos> You asked for my advice.<eos> There it is.<eos> You can take it, or not.
I took to drink, for a while.<eos> I became promiscuous, for a while.<eos> Scandal engulfed me.<eos> I couldn't go on behaving that way.<eos> You either step into the abyss... ..or step back from it.
You take the pills, we break you out, we save the judges-- easy.<eos> Not sure about the "save the judges" part.<eos> I memorized the manual, but the legend was missing.<eos> It's the key to the code's use patterns.<eos> Without it, I can't decrypt the names.
Do you think it was a human that pulled the trigger?<eos> I'd hate to think the entire world went to war for nothing.<eos> Is that supposed to be a joke?<eos> No, a poor one, a poor one.<eos> Both sides wanted war, both sides fanned the flames of bigotry to get it, and in the end, we almost destroyed the only habitable planet that we've got.
Maybe he's afraid he'll retaliate.<eos> No, that happens sometimes.<eos> But that wasn't the case here.<eos> No, in this case, the reporter wants a lead role in the story.<eos> Right, that way he gets a better story out of it.
What do you mean?<eos> Uh, Dean, it actually is enough.<eos> We got what we came for...<eos> No, we came for the policy!<eos> And we are not leaving without it.
Well, to me, she was very much a human.<eos> Ilene, I got this.<eos> Sir, I'm Detective Villa.<eos> Are you the detective on Lavetta's case?<eos> No, but I am going to make sure I'm assigned to it right away.
Every week since his mother died last year.<eos> Brings fresh flowers every time, see?<eos> - Ever bring anything else?<eos> - Just his briefcase.<eos> Busy man like that, I never saw him without it.
If our target left any digital evidence, my program will find it.<eos> When drug pumps connect to the hospital's network over Wi-Fi, allows the medical staff to remotely monitor their patients.<eos> The pumps have built-in safeguards that prevent lethal doses.<eos> Unfortunately, the hackers removed these safeguards, which allowed them to kill Lindsey Mullen.<eos> The scariest part is-- the pump doesn't authenticate who has access to it.
No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.<eos> Then how 'bout the bathroom?<eos> I want to change my answer.<eos> Fine. Then the dining room.<eos> I guess we didn't use it very often.
And not only that, her friend replied saying that Mrs. Pankhurst suggested that we remain here in Toronto to continue the cause here.<eos> I suppose she was very keen to go to London.<eos> It's an understandable desire.<eos> Yes, but why would she lie to me?<eos> She made up a story and then tried to make the letters match it after the fact.
You are selfish and an idiot.<eos> But until we go in front of the judge, it's still just an offer, so you're gonna call her back and tell her you changed your mind.<eos> Do it!<eos> No.<eos> I made my decision, and as my lawyer, you have to carry it out.
Two main motives for murder, Mr. Twain:<eos> love and money.<eos> Anything of interest?<eos> Henry's found the weapon.<eos> It's been recently fired and it matches the calibre of the bullets we retrieved.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> I have no other option.<eos> You do.<eos> - Give me that tank!<eos> - Nat, my patient will die without it.
For what?<eos> Your husband has a condition called Crush Syndrome.<eos> If we lift the pod off of his leg, he'll go into cardiac arrest.<eos> No.<eos> If there was any other option, we'd take it.
Said he wouldn't let anyone do anything that would jeopardize his brother's shot at a title.<eos> All right, so what? So you beat him to death?<eos> That... that wasn't the plan.<eos> Gabriel gave me two choices.<eos> Pay him for the pass or kill him for it.
Ethan worked in their satellite offices right there.<eos> You don't believe me, look it up.<eos> To compare a massacre to inclement weather.<eos> It's a shame that cretinous man wasn't involved.<eos> Detection is an exact science, or it ought to be, and should be treated with the same cold, unemotional manner.
- Then I can make you chair.<eos> - But I don't want to be chair.<eos> Mrs. Florrick... corruption doesn't start out there.<eos> It doesn't start in D.C. or Springfield.<eos> It starts here, in you and me, and only if we let it happen, so don't.
She was wearing something stretchy.<eos> Work-out clothes?<eos> The victim's bone density, splayed metatarsals, and light frame would support her being a dancer.<eos> So does her muscle tone.<eos> What's left of it.
I'm a Pilgrim, too, for my sins.<eos> You a season ticket holder?<eos> No, I just sort of go when I can.<eos> Well, if you're looking for freebies, I've got a pal who's got a box.<eos> I'm sure he'd let you have it for free if he's not using it.
Stopping this fiasco while you've still got a job.<eos> Now, you listen to me, Marshall.<eos> INSPECTOR Marshall.<eos> And you listen to me, that woman is so well connected, she could end your career like that.<eos> Or what's left of it, Sergeant.
Here you are, sir.<eos> Today's headlines.<eos> My boys'll be the first to sign up and it'll be a long queue.<eos> I think there isn't a lad in the country doesn't want to go and crush that bloody Kaiser.<eos> I think the war will be over very quickly if it happens at all.
Stop it, the pair of you!<eos> Pregnancy is a sacred thing!<eos> It can't hear us.<eos> Yes, it can!<eos> And don't refer to it as "it."
I mean, have you ever broken a rule?<eos> Just once?<eos> Might wanna consider it.<eos> Thanks for the advice.<eos> Do yourself a favor. Take it.
And peas are green.<eos> They mustn't touch.<eos> I got it.<eos> Do you know why people like violence?<eos> It is because it feels... good.
But... I could stop it.<eos> - That's good to know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can't talk here, people are staring at me.<eos> Right, assuming I've still got a job, I need to get to it, but uh...
A Sanchez!<eos> This is impossible!<eos> Hey! Good luck, little Sanchez!<eos> The legendary cave of souls... Was rumored to be at the edge of the land of the remembered.<eos> Now, many had tried to reach it, but none had ever returned.
Uh, who are those guys?<eos> My old team.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> You were stupid enough to get yourself into this mess.<eos> We're the only ones crazy enough to get you out of it.
Let's just make this about the family and the love that's at this table.<eos> And I guarantee you, in 20 years you'll understand how important that is.<eos> - Come on, Dad.<eos> - It's okay. A lot of people don't have this.<eos> You have a beautiful family and it's great to be part of it tonight.
Do you understand me?<eos> Dex's death, tragic though it was, taught me one thing.<eos> Life's funny.<eos> You can be up one minute and dead the next.<eos> But remember, if someone gives you a second chance, always take it.
And we're drinking wine.<eos> And then he leans over to me, and he just starts pouring the wine over my head.<eos> And I look down and I realize I'm-- I'm a little baby, and he's giving me a tubby.<eos> And there's something weird about the water.<eos> I put my hand in it and reach up, and it's just covered in blood.
- There was another blackout?<eos> - Yes, between 1.00 and 2.00.<eos> Maybe I should go up and check.<eos> Does that cable car to the plant still work 'I<eos> Yes, the workers use it.
I will not indulge your childish whims.<eos> I refuse to pity you in the manner in which you are accustomed.<eos> - I do not want your pity!<eos> - Of course you do!<eos> Like all sick kids, your existence depends on it.
- You want to leave?<eos> - Yes, we can pack our bags and just go.<eos> You want to just leave Jasper? Deal with everything on his own?<eos> He wouldn't care. He'd be fine.<eos> The machine over there ... you can't just walk away from it.
Let's have a look. Foreigners, lots of them.<eos> Miss Calthorpe, back to your station.<eos> Miss Day.<eos> What are you hoping to achieve with your new book?<eos> I want people to enjoy it, that's the important thing.
Last season on Being Human...<eos> I want to be with you forever.<eos> When love finds you again, you will not run from it.
Give my friend another drink.<eos> Why won't he be on the boat?<eos> Well, because he's dead.<eos> Death brings death.<eos> I for one try to stay away from it lest I catch what it's got.
Well, it's in the hands of the doctors now.<eos> I know how helpless one feels, but all you can do is just keep calm and pray.<eos> Yes.<eos> The power of prayer.<eos> - Always ridiculed it.
A few fortunate souls will be granted their freedom today.<eos> I wish I could pardon all your prisoners.<eos> Your Majesty should not waste sympathy on those undeserving of it.<eos> All men need hope, Captain.<eos> Without it, why should they lead a decent life?
She's one-one of five people who have access to the eye database.<eos> What?<eos> My company owns a patent on iris biometrics and consolidate all their data into one database.<eos> And Simmons is one of five people that have access.<eos> But you have access to it, too.
and... and sort of looked up and he's standing, and I could see he was kind of fascinated by what was on the walls and he said, "Do you wanna come up to my room"<eos> "and have a look what I've got upstairs?" Right? And I said, "Yeah, all right."<eos> And so we went up to his, um...<eos> to this little flat he had up the top and he opened it up, we went into the living room, and everywhere there was, er... nativity stuff from Christmas.<eos> He would make a star and he would cut it out of fluorescent cardboard, and then he would cut another little tiny one out of that and then another tiny one out of that.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.<eos> What I fear most is nature.<eos> Now that it's sent its weather to exact revenge, we're all in for it now.<eos> Soon the weather is gonna put on a real show.<eos> Funnily enough, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get and the more interesting it becomes and the more it moulds itself to the narrative I have set for it.
- That Leon was killed again.<eos> - What? Why would they say that?<eos> - Because they found his body in the street!<eos> Why did they find his body in the street, Mickey?<eos> I didn't have the money to pay to bury Leon, so I took the truck to Little Eddie's, but his guy took it out and wrecked it, and Leon fell out.
Hey, don't forget... you spent the night with a live, actual woman, you know?<eos> Plus, you got Nicki to like you for a second.<eos> That's obviously what you've been wanting.<eos> We've all been stuck in a rut lately.<eos> Danny's helped us out of it.
I love you.<eos> Any of my Musketeers could thrash any of your red guards at any time!<eos> 1,000 livres Captain Treville is right.<eos> Your reputation for violence is well established.<eos> Now do something useful with it.
They'll just take ours.<eos> Who's winning? You guys... that's who.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> You got your elliptical machine.<eos> You gonna use it?
-Tosh?<eos> -Inspector?<eos> Catriona Bruce had a hiding place and Catherine Ross found it.<eos> -OK.<eos> -Now, what if she used it?
But he's clinging to the hope Hannibal did this so he doesn't have to face what he did.<eos> Convince me he didn't know what he was doing.<eos> I would really like to be convinced, Alana.<eos> A psychopath wouldn't be so scared of the truth, Jack.<eos> Will's terrified, but that's not stopping him from trying to find it.
[Sighs] Maybe the name was Mr. Franklin.<eos> Mr. Franklin is one of our best clients.<eos> Tell me about your problem.<eos> In the next couple of days, I'm gonna get myself in a very bad situation.<eos> I'd like you to come get me out of it.
So poor old Mr. Nightingale had the poor manners to die? He did.<eos> And yet you seem heartily disinclined to join him.<eos> Oh, I am that, Sir, most heartily disinclined.<eos> And here's me thinking you had no fear of death.<eos> No fear of it, but no impatience for it neither.
I want to sleep with Marcy again.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - I'm so grateful to you for giving me an acting job, but if the job comes with strings attached, then I cannot and will not do it.
I thought you said they were your best mates at uni.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'll find us some mates.<eos> I've got this amazing app called Grindr.<eos> Made loads of new mates through it.
He realizes they can't reverse the process.<eos> No, they can't.<eos> He's fu-Even in his head, he's gone full walrus.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And he throws him the fish, and then fuckin'- The walrus man... scurries over to it, all gross and shit... and starts biting at it at the ground.
Problem is, the rope frays, the body surfaces.<eos> Floating inconveniently ashore, bringing us all here today.<eos> That is a fine story, Lieutenant.<eos> I suggest you hold on to it.<eos> Who knows? It might even make a fine novel or screenplay some day.
Hello?<eos> - Your pussy smells.<eos> - What?<eos> That's why guys avoid you.<eos> Everyone says it stinks.
I have influence over the BIA. Over federal gambling legislation.<eos> The sort of influence that my contributions have already bought.<eos> Not with my direct involvement and the President's ear.<eos> You know what I like about money?<eos> I can stack it on a table, like this one.
At midnight, when the wicked must pay for their sins, It's me who comes to collect.<eos> From the adulterers and betrayers, who dare to weigh justice in their own hands.<eos> From the hypocrites, and perverts,<eos> the cowardly, and the visious,<eos> even those who still had a chance, but were too weak to take it.
Built as a fortress and used by the nazies during World War Two.<eos> When those bastards got their hands on that place, they turned it into a concentration camp.<eos> Behind those walls they tortured and murdered men, women and children.<eos> So much blood, and around here blood attracts blood.<eos> Stay away from it.
...The more that I'm --<eos> While you get a tie -- I'm thinking black --<eos> I'll get you a beverage.<eos> So, that's alejandro, huh?<eos> Keep his glass full, make every drink a double, And if he orders water, put vodka in it.
It's a west coast couple, San Francisco, arriving Saturday.<eos> Great.<eos> Listen, Benny, um...<eos> This job's not as good as the one we're doing now.<eos> But I'm still confident we'll see about 15 out of it each.
What's wrong? Hmm?<eos> Oh, nothing. I'm good.<eos> Jasper, it's been a week, ok?<eos> You've been given a second chance.<eos> You gotta use it.
We want you in situ before our friend arrives.<eos> You don't have men in the restaurant?<eos> No.<eos> It'll just be you.<eos> Because it's very small. If anyone looks out of place...
What about it?<eos> The website's up and running, I'm just redesigning the compression.<eos> It just needs users.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> But even if somebody wanted to use it they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.
So poor old Mr. Nightingale had the poor manners to die? He did.<eos> And yet you seem heartily disinclined to join him.<eos> Oh, I am that, Sir, most heartily disinclined.<eos> And here's me thinking you had no fear of death.<eos> No fear of it, but no impatience for it neither.
Why am I not shocked that you don't like Luke Wheeler?<eos> What's this crap?<eos> Mm. This is why I looked so miserable when you walked in.<eos> Research on our album from Edgehill.<eos> Shouldn't have looked at it, but I did.
Did the fuel go up?<eos> No. It's unclear.<eos> There are traces of blood on the keel.<eos> Well, quick as you can with Forensics on that.<eos> Who else has access to it?
10:00, maybe.<eos> I'll definitely be out by midnight<eos> Lillian.<eos> You should take the night off.<eos> What's left of it, anyway.
Magic.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Gentlemen, it's how we earn a living.<eos> Illusion's important.<eos> Without it, we'd be left with what?
If everything goes as planned, Cybertek's security team won't even know we were on the train.<eos> - So we're going in undercover.<eos> - I hate undercover.<eos> May and Ward, you're front and center.<eos> Once we locate the package, you'll tag it with a tracker.
Katrina!<eos> No! No!<eos> Katrina!<eos> Now you'll know what it's like to lose faith.<eos> When it's gone, you have nothing.
Don't you dare...!<eos> No! No!<eos> Katrina!<eos> Now you'll know what it's like to lose faith.<eos> When it's gone, you have nothing.
Piggy?<eos> You have a little Piggy there?<eos> That leaves one possibility.<eos> So, he gave him the gun.<eos> Yeah. And then he got killed right away with it.
You don't even know Sharee.<eos> She got you in detention.<eos> - That's all I need to know. - (Sighs)<eos> (Knocks on table) I'm just trying to remind you that who you choose to hang out with is really important.<eos> They can either keep you on your path or drive you right off it.
- What? Lick it!<eos> Look, Tom, I ...<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I can't believe the author of "Travelers" is actually in my garage.<eos> Twins, separated at birth, learn they have the power to travel through time and use it to solve the mystery of their past! Aah!
Children.<eos> Children with the gene mutation.<eos> Lillian, do you realize how spectacularly dangerous a list like that could be?<eos> Yes, Jameson.<eos> It's something people take hostages over.
But what you don't know is, there are two things you don't know.<eos> One, Roman is a whole pile of evil shit that you don't even begin to understand.<eos> Two, Peter has a tender heart, and a cousin who loves him, and if you hurt him, I will put so much pain on you,<eos> - you will never get well. - I gotta go.<eos> Hey, you saw an opportunity and you worked it. I get that.
Uh, writing BIOS for a machine no one's gonna give a shit about.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> Who cares about the machine?<eos> What really matters are the people who will use it.
I'm not good enough for you?<eos> You're a careful woman, Mrs. Masters.<eos> And I'm guessing you-- you came to a complete stop at that stop sign, you looked both ways, you signaled, you drove on, hell, you didn't get out of the car.<eos> Now we need a different kind of person on that witness stand.<eos> Now it was real good of you to wanna help, and we thank you kindly for your offer, but we'll make do without it.
Hey.<eos> What are you doing up so late?<eos> I'm working on my book.<eos> Okay. I take it...<eos> Take it you're not happy with it.
No.<eos> Producer.<eos> I'm tired of squats and waxing. Hmm.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm thinking of bronzing my clit, turning it into a necklace.
And they won't hesitate to use them.<eos> Crane, remind me later to have a chat about what your founding friends were thinking when they crafted our right to bear arms.<eos> True, there was concern among us that it could lead to perverse consequences.<eos> Look, the good news is, I know exactly where this lantern is locked up.<eos> And I know how to get to it without riling them up.
And for the most part it works.<eos> Covers the bases, satisfies that underlying need to understand it deeper.<eos> You kinda go with the common flow.<eos> And then something bad happens and you look around see all the terrible things in the world.<eos> Compound that with the general negative spin on religion and you just get turned off to it.
But she's already given us the names of two high-level terrorists.<eos> To assure her family's safety, she'll be even more willing to cooperate.<eos> We can't risk U.S. casualties trying to save a terrorist's daughter.<eos> Well, she was married to one, but Nadia is a mother first.<eos> Look, she's clutching that doll as if her life depends on it.
You said he was a virgin.<eos> I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.<eos> I think of it like this...<eos> If you're going to eat a sandwich..<eos> You will just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.
And there is nothing in the human experience that can compare to it.<eos> But you can't have regrets.<eos> You have to move on. Or die.<eos> I know that song you were dancing to earlier.<eos> We had to dance to it at cotillion.
We'll take Kendal.<eos> And that's it?<eos> He just goes?<eos> Yeah, Jack. You too.<eos> I want you to find a hole somewhere, crawl in it, and stay there forever.
To sharpen it.<eos> To understand its limitations and deficiencies.<eos> To use it as cats use stealth before pouncing.<eos> As walking sticks use camouflage.<eos> To make it the tool of our survival.
We call them "pulsars" when they spin rapidly and emit regular pulses of radio energy.<eos> Supernovas and neutron stars could account for a wide range of cosmic rays, but not the most energetic ones.<eos> Nothing yet known to science can explain them, and we're fine with that.<eos> It's one of the things I love about science, we don't have to pretend we have all the answers.<eos> Zwicky also came up with the idea that the gravity of a galaxy warps the fabric of space around it, to act like a lens.
If you can press all the time since the Big Bang, the explosive birth of the universe, into a single Earth year, a billion years is about one month of that year.<eos> What was happening on Earth a billion years ago?<eos> Most of Earth's land was amassed into a supercontinent called Rodinia.<eos> It was a barren desert-- no animals, no plants.<eos> A billion years ago, there wasn't enough oxygen in our atmosphere to form an ozone layer, and without it, ultraviolet radiation prevented life from colonizing the land.
- Are the monitors up? - Let's do the transesophogeal echo and look for a clot first. - And if we find it?<eos> - We'll cross that bridge.<eos> She's been through too much to survive an open embolectomy.<eos> - And the infection?<eos> - We don't know where it is, and cutting in to look for that could kill her too.
Come on.<eos> Well, ma'am, by denying that Chung and torture are connected, everyone now seems to think that, well, Chung and torture are connected.<eos> And I wonder what magician got that little story out there?<eos> Well, you're a very smart boy.<eos> Listen, we're gonna end this conversation. We're never gonna refer to it again, okay?
- Let's go.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Do we have any idea where she is?<eos> Traffic-cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.<eos> We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.
Hey.<eos> Just finished processing the concrete couple's clothes.<eos> That was kind of a sexy little dress she had on there.<eos> Nice shoes, too, although the, uh, soles had speckles of paint on them.<eos> Well, I have a bullet and I have a gun, but I have no way to fire it to make a comparison, because the gun barrel is split like a banana peel.
Okay, got it. We're on our way.<eos> So, Ballistics got a hit on the slug we pulled out of Ingram.<eos> It matches a weapon used in a jewelry store heist two years ago.<eos> HPD closed the case and the weapon was recovered and vouchered.<eos> If that gun is sitting in an evidence room, how was it used to kill our vic?
We plucked it yesterday.<eos> I didn't see it here yesterday.<eos> Well, it was. It was.<eos> It was just in the ground.<eos> You didn't see it, go over to- so what we're doing here is, we're getting the green leaves off the outside and then all the silky little gold bits-- get those off, so you don't have hairy corn.
Well, I'm telling you right now, I think he's in deeper waters than he's prepared to swim.<eos> He can handle it, whatever it is.<eos> That's a lot of confidence for a man who wears shorts with combat boots.<eos> Anyway, I recently came into a shitload of money.<eos> Now, I'd be willing to part with just a taste of it, but...
- Are you kidding me?<eos> Listen to what you're saying!<eos> You really think that a blip of humanity Is gonna wipe the slate clean after centuries of monstrosity?<eos> No!<eos> So I saw my chance, and I took it!
Now, excuse me.<eos> You're standing on my leash.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ ♪ All the single Barrys, all the single Barrys ♪<eos> ♪ Make a turkey sandwich, make a turkey sandwich ♪<eos> ♪ If you like it then you should have put some cheese on it ♪

What do you got for us, Dan-o?<eos> Some guy in reception says he knows you...<eos> Jimmy Livanos, Wunder driver?<eos> Doesn't ring a bell, but we do love the Wunder app.<eos> Can't get home from a bar without it.
All right? I can chop this thing in two - like a disputed kitten.<eos> - Oh, pleasant.<eos> - Mike?<eos> - Yes, ma'am. I want to talk to you about this speech for the World War I service, okay?<eos> Very proud of it, ma'am.
20. Room for 100 in those sheds.<eos> We don't need more than 20 in current trading conditions, Master.<eos> Conditions change.<eos> Let's be ambitious.<eos> How could you adapt and improve this magnificent machine so we can get five times more power from it?
No.<eos> No, I would be blamed.<eos> I suppose they would send you back to Camp Reverie.<eos> Don't bluff me.<eos> You had your chance to frame me, and you chose not to take it.
Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.<eos> I mean, it's all over the Internet...<eos> Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.<eos> I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.<eos> - That's great. - I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Just a hunch.<eos> What do you got now?<eos> Well, Cochran won't let me talk to Frank Barnes.<eos> You won't let me talk to your father.<eos> There's a story here, or you guys wouldn't be trying so hard to keep me from it.
Shall we show him?<eos> No, no.<eos> Show me what?<eos> "Proverbs" 22:6 tells us to<eos> "train up your child the way he should go, and when he gets old, he will not depart from it."
Hey, careful.<eos> That's hydrochloric acid.<eos> So Tony Johnston didn't accidentally slip into that tub.<eos> M.E. found strangulation marks on his neck,<eos> - or what was left of it.
Then we have little time to waste.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's Ali.<eos> The network is up.<eos> You can use it.
What are we doing?<eos> Not so fast, McGruff. He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.<eos> Okay, how do you know that?<eos> That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.<eos> And the books inside it were period.
For great purpose, yes, but you killed.<eos> You're a good boy, Tom. It's ok.<eos> And that's why it feels like there's poison inside you right now.<eos> And it's gonna burn till you're hollow.<eos> Let me take it from you, man.
Angie's dead.<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> The lock on the back door's broken.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We got to check that locker, 'cause the handprint shows that she was reaching for it.
I don't know how many it's saved since.<eos> So even though Northern Lights was shut down, your machine was still operational.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> I'm afraid not even I know that.<eos> Do you have access to it?
I wasn't with her. I-I was sitting in the back.<eos> Because my father was with her?<eos> That award was our gold standard.<eos> It was the measure of our success.<eos> It was everything we worked for.
Overlord burned him alive.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Find something to dig a grave.<eos> Hey, Colonel. It's Tector's gun.<eos> It's been fired.
Well, I wonder... whether your emotions haven't compromised you, Agent Cole.<eos> My emotions. Hmm.<eos> I was on my way to deliver new intel, but if you feel as though I should be taken off the mission...<eos> What exactly did you find?<eos> Roger knows that you rebuilt the Machine and that you want him in it.
Intelligence is a very valuable thing, innit, my friend?<eos> And usually it comes far too fucking late.<eos> Let's say that I shot you already, right, in the fucking face.<eos> And the bullet goes bone, mush, bone, cabinet over there.<eos> Which is a shame, innit, 'cause that cabinet's fucked now and I got to get shot of it.
She was accompanied by Lord Gillingham who had clearly also been staying in the hotel.<eos> Well, yes.<eos> They were both staying there.<eos> They were attending an informal conference of northern landowners.<eos> Lord Gillingham thought Lady Mary might derive benefit from it.
Oh, come in and sit down.<eos> Mrs Patmore's got something to say.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, just how grateful I am for your excellent advice.<eos> Oh, you've taken it, then?
It's an inadvertent disclosure.<eos> It's like if someone accidentally sent you - their-their courtroom strategy.<eos> - Exactly. You have to return it.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You have to zealously represent your client by using it.
But I do have one last question. Okay.<eos> Where did you get that dress?<eos> Do you like it?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> But that's okay, 'cause I remember What you look like without it.
Turns out that sky-blue dinghy Was a standard white when it came out of the factory.<eos> And how does that help us?<eos> Well, the previous owner pimped it out.<eos> He added custom fishing-rod holders<eos> Making it a relative rarity in the world of dinghies.
She's trying to shoot at us. We got to get some cover.<eos> Kitchen! Come on! Get in the kitchen!<eos> Come on!<eos> Mr. Hunston, put down the gun!<eos> That's the gun that killed Jeremy Geist, isn't it?
Hold your horses.<eos> You might be able to catch him sooner.<eos> He's going from ATM to ATM in his neighborhood pulling cash from all her accounts.<eos> Get away cash.<eos> Don't leave home without it.
Did you find out where the paper was made?<eos> Yes, but, uh, keep your expectations low.<eos> It was manufactured at the caserta paper mill in milan.<eos> The mill was destroyed during world war ii.<eos> No more of it exists today.
I didn't used to carry one, but...<eos> You know, it doesn't matter.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's not a good feeling.<eos> You feel naked without it.
Is this rash a side effect of the witchy acid trip he's on?<eos> I haven't seen this since I was a child.<eos> Mikael would return home from battle more blindly temperamental than usual, and our mother would use the petals of a rare Marelok orchid to put him to sleep.<eos> She would mend his mind with a spell and then wake him with the roots of the same plant.<eos> If she has access to it now, then maybe it also grows in the bayou.
Great.<eos> We'll wait there and rip Vincent's head off.<eos> Nah. He'll body jump.<eos> His head stays on.<eos> He'll have a hard time answering our questions without it.
You call them Hunter Worms, we call them Lekgolo.<eos> We've learned not to bring technology to this place.<eos> They don't respond 10 it well.<eos> These people don't know how to react, brother.<eos> So reliant on their technology, they wouldn't even know what to do without it, would they?
- Not really.<eos> The great thing about guns is that they sell themselves.<eos> I see a shot.<eos> What do you think, Martine, hmm?<eos> Should I take it?
Ah, my popularity spreads to all corners...<eos> Duk-soo!<eos> Dal-gu, we're saved!<eos> On that grassy plain, I'll build a pretty house with the one I love... we built this pier here.<eos> Don't want the enemy to use it, so we'll detonate it.
Don't worry about me, Norrie.<eos> All that matters is protecting the egg.<eos> You wouldn't shoot Joe.<eos> There's a long list of people who've gone against me.<eos> I got no problem adding Joe McAlister to it.
'Cause whatever went down, whatever happened, we will fix it.<eos> Will we?<eos> 'Cause right now, I'm doing all I can not to come over there and rip your throat out... with my teeth.<eos> I'm giving you a chance, Sam.<eos> You should take it.
Yes, it is.<eos> This dude...<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> Right, for him.<eos> Then why am I the one who feels like crawling into a hole And never coming out of it?
Say goodbye to his leg, you know?<eos> Fireworks.<eos> Music, wine, women, sex.<eos> Yo, he's, like, 14, man.<eos> Well, you got to use it while you still can.
- I've got this. - Fuck!<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> - Christian, is that you?<eos> - What have you got a gun for?<eos> - It's for shooting people.
Let's meet up at the arcade, 5:00 PM.<eos> At the arcade?<eos> Sure! I still can't believe it, we are the Guardians of Justice.<eos> It's okay, you've just realized your power.<eos> You will get used to it soon. Luna, what should we do next?
Neil Truman.<eos> Gentlemen... I can't stand here and say that a dating application was the result I had in mind when our two companies began our dialogue.<eos> But then, Victor came to my house yesterday, because that's the kind of diligent managing partner we have here at bastion.<eos> And he asked me if I could overcome my disappointment, if I could let go of that perfect application that I had bouncing around inside my head for so many weeks, and to move on.<eos> And so I considered letting it go.
But if you know what floor you're on, - it makes perfect sense.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Duh. Just need to know how many floors are in the building.<eos> That number, all the core geometry's gonna be based on that.<eos> Without it...
Doesn't need all of us to upgrade the system.<eos> We could solve two problems at once.<eos> The effluent pipe.<eos> Pumps water out of the reactor and into the ocean.<eos> He could get in it and ride it out away from the power plant.
- No, this.<eos> - Oh, my jacket.<eos> - That's gorgeous.<eos> - Hello, lovely. - You look nice. - Thank you.<eos> - Hi. She's a little under it.
It's not a race, guys.<eos> Tucker: I'm the only one who can actually write.<eos> David: I know a lot about this.<eos> Ding in.<eos> Dana, all I can say is that you've taken a bad book and made it... Less bad.
You don't understand!<eos> It is working!<eos> On the contrary, Mr Bourg, it's doing the opposite.<eos> It's making you sick.<eos> Without it, I will be sick.
Now, I could've said things like... "Ice cream" is a good answer.<eos> "Hank" would've been an excellent answer.<eos> But I said, "Coming on a girl's face."<eos> And I've had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. - I...<eos> I'm not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it.
- Yep. - Give me a kiss.<eos> - Bye. - I'll see you later.<eos> How are you liking the new school?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yeah, well, it probably takes a little time, you know, to get used to it.
I'll be the first girl to have it.<eos> Besides Jackie and Becca and Emma.<eos> And Tiffany and Sophie.<eos> But we don't talk to Sophie.<eos> Here's the thing... it starts with that bag, and then you need stuff to put into it, like makeup.
Look, my dad used to gamble.<eos> A lot. When he was in his 20s, he was a rounder.<eos> That's how he scraped together enough cash to buy this place.<eos> But I know for a fact that he quit playing before I was born.<eos> He might have had that card, but I don't believe he ever used it.
You don't trust the god you made?<eos> It's not a divinity.<eos> I programmed it to pursue objectives within a certain parameter, but it's grown out of my control.<eos> One day, to suit its own goals, it's possible that the machine will try to kill us.<eos> We are only numbers to it, code.
I helped troubled people.<eos> But now I'm just me.<eos> I'm not one of Mara's personalities.<eos> But I don't have her immunity.<eos> What am I supposed to do without it?
One... zero..<eos> three... zero... seven... four.<eos> Mr. Reese, there's something curious about that vault.<eos> I gotta give you credit.<eos> You studied your enemy, you infiltrated my organization, you identified my weakness, and you exploited it.
BECKETT:<eos> Yeah, so did I. We found blood evidence at the scene where Luca was shot.<eos> Go on.<eos> It was Luca's blood on a bracelet.<eos> CSU pulled a thumbprint off of it that matched a DMV record.
- Thanks for the assist.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Scram.<eos> How I enjoy toying with the weaker sex.<eos> Uh, well, that includes me, too, doesn't it?
Now, why would I do that?<eos> Because you stole my business, for one thing.<eos> Five-O put you out of business, not me. I just picked up the pieces.<eos> So you're just a roadkill-eating vulture, is that it?<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
Do you want to take that chance?<eos> The gunman's name is Mark Ferguson, 20 years old.<eos> His brother's a war hero...<eos> two tours in Iraq, KIA in 2008.<eos> Parents say, after his brother passed away, he fell into a depression, never pulled out of it.
Most of the time TV sound hadn't got that good yet, but Austin City Limits and Terry and those guys worked on it and they came up with a pretty reasonable sound for a studio in television, and that's why a lot of the bands wanted to go there.<eos> All right, clap your hands!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> When the Foo Fighters played Austin City Limits it was a big deal for all of us because we'd all grown up watching the show.<eos> When you walk into that room and you step foot on that stage, you can feel the ghosts and the spirits come out of it.
We got ourselves a turkey. Yeah, but what time is it?<eos> I mean, dinner has to have started by now.<eos> We're never gonna make it home on foot. Maybe we don't have to.<eos> We're now arriving in Quahog.<eos> Up on the right are the people with the awesome trampoline, but they don't let me on it no more, 'cause I bounced a kid onto the house.
Is this how you repay my hard work and loyalty?<eos> By duping me into a marriage I did not want?<eos> What have you done?<eos> Don't pretend this ruse was anyone else's idea but yours.<eos> You saw an opportunity to marry off your eldest daughter, and you took it!
~ It's all shut up. ~ Yeah.<eos> ~ There might be donkeys on the beach. ~ Not in winter.<eos> Sandcastles!<eos> Come on.<eos> Me dad made like a proper moat and filled it up with water.
Very soft there, very soft there, keep going, keep going, very soft. Oooh! Ooh.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> Wouldn't ordinarily do this with a 928, but...<eos> I've never felt more hopelessly lost.<eos> 'After many hours, we did find the road, 'but our path to it was blocked by a locked gate.'
Imagine a receptor molecule in my nose is like my guitar.<eos> Before it can make a sound, a scent molecule has to enter my nose, and when that scent molecule is in place, its chemical bonds provide the strings, and it's ready to be played.<eos> The receptor molecules contain quantum particles - electrons.<eos> As they leap from one atom to another, they vibrate the bonds of the scent molecule, like my fingers plucking a guitar string.<eos> What's remarkable about this theory is that it tells us our sense of smell is about the vibrations of molecules, or wave-like behaviour, and not so much about the shape of a particular scent molecule.
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?<eos> - It's unbelievable.<eos> A literal heart of darkness.<eos> If we could just see the collapsed star inside... the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.<eos> - And we can't get anything from it?
It'll seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.<eos> "Lead us astray"?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You must stay on the path.<eos> Do not leave it.
See that hill?<eos> That's last winter.<eos> That will be all of us, if we do not become friends with the Indians.<eos> We need their help.<eos> Without it, we will not survive, all right?
This dog here got more manners upon four legs than most Savannah people walking around upon two.<eos> Generations of us have hunted on the river and fields of our county... something passed between father and son.<eos> If history is our religion, then hunting is one of its sacraments.<eos> Ward Allen once wrote it down,<eos> "The river belonged to us, and we to it."

What a beauty.<eos> But first, there's something I have to tell you.<eos> Yes?<eos> Two years ago, my mother died of tuberculosis.<eos> I contracted it too.
We've got to rescue Smurfette.<eos> What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?<eos> All right, Smurfs, listen up.<eos> I saved enough grotto water from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.<eos> I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.
Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> And those problems are likely to linger, Brian.<eos> The water is a problem for, throughout the metro area.<eos> People are being told to boil it and electricity is also the problem.<eos> Hardly anybody has it and isn't likely to have it for up to a month.
Hydriatic procedures in the treatment of insanity were quite common<eos> I was not, I'm afraid, ever convinced of their efficacy.<eos> But I was the junior and he was my father.<eos> And your father, he employed this treatment?<eos> He gave up on it in the end.
Bad tidings from Milan, Nico.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> That serpent on the rider's surcoat is the Biscione, the Sforza family emblem.<eos> If he was bringing good news, he'd have been dressed in the more traditional red and white shield of Milan.<eos> Whatever the message is, Lorenzo won't be happy with it.
Those souls scream for justice -<eos> "To the fire. To the fire!"<eos> Instead, your leaders promote sodomy by levying fines instead of the proper sanction, which is...the fire.<eos> Who shat in his wine sack?<eos> When you tax a crime, you make it a commodity.
"Whoops!<eos> I broke into your house to steal something stupid, but now that I've up and murdered you, hey, why don't I screw this light bulb into your chest?"<eos> You'd be surprised what regular people can do when the adrenaline's pumping.<eos> But this guy, he held on to the light bulb; he didn't toss it or smash it;<eos> He took it from the fixture because he had a plan for it.
I know I'm not going to be around very long.<eos> But I don't know who is going to look after him when I am gone.<eos> Who is going to help him?<eos> Stick the light bulb in the victim's chest;<eos> The power flows up into it.
I want to be with you forever.<eos> I cannot do that to our son.<eos> When I have been in the ground for years and years, you will still be young, handsome.<eos> - And alone.<eos> - No. Promise me this... when love finds you again And it will... you will not run from it.
It's sad.<eos> It's incredibly sad.<eos> This creature was kept...<eos> Against its will...<eos> In a totally unnatural environment for it.
I know, but I cannot do it.<eos> It's a... Hey, you know what?<eos> I'm happy to take you water-skiing.<eos> You want me to... My friend Frank can drive the boat.<eos> Take it out. It's there to be enjoyed. - I love it.
We split a Magnum of champagne.<eos> We figured out our grandfathers went to the same high school.<eos> I was wearing the vest.<eos> Oh, vest guy!<eos> I didn't recognize you without it.
I stayed under for 112 seconds.<eos> - Hey, good for you!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Show those syphilis-ridden turbo sluts a thing or two.<eos> They think they own the water just 'cause they piss in it.
Well... Ellen paid my wife a visit today.<eos> Rose thinks I'm no damn good.<eos> She may be right.<eos> Normally I stay off this poison.<eos> My father had a penchant for it.
Out of the way, noble Don! Or the wheel will get on your boot.<eos> Hey, you forgot the chair, fools!<eos> Do you like the music?<eos> I don't know...<eos> It makes my tummy hurt.
- Okay?<eos> Slow down. Slow down, honey.<eos> - I think I'm deaf forever.<eos> I can't 'cause I heard air hiss out the hole.<eos> I heard air hiss out of it and I think I really messed it up.
You have to learn not to trust. Oh, do...?<eos> Oh right.<eos> That's what you've been sent to teach me - the benefit of your experience.<eos> Look at your community from the outside.<eos> I can't be outside it.
As the normal procedures were not followed, this killing cannot be atoned for by compensating the victim's family.<eos> Murder is a dishonorable deed amongst our people.<eos> Carried out in secret, unacknowledged, and likely to give rise to a series of revenge killings that would involve your own family.<eos> Lord, you knew about that land.<eos> You knew I had a claim to it...
May he never enter Valhalla.<eos> May he never feast with the gods.<eos> Why did he do that?<eos> He should not have done that.<eos> Someone told me he wanted that land for himself and he knew Trygvasson had the best claim to it, but refused to sell it.
Emote!<eos> Commit!<eos> Step up to the plate and embrace our talent.<eos> And just like my boo Miss Mercedes Jones, we're gonna treat every note we sing and every breath we take with a little something-something we in the business of show simply call "passion."<eos> And passion can be a scary thing, but we shouldn't run or hide from it because passion is... it's wonderful, yo.
Fine.<eos> See what he does? Come here.<eos> He pushed the body way back there, and then he goes to hide.<eos> So, when Anne-Marie comes in, she's drawn towards the body?<eos> Then he grabs the evidence bag with the shoe and doesn't even look at it.

This is Tessa's homework, and your opportunity to be alone with her.<eos> And as you can see, I've organized it into folders and marked it for handy reference with color-coded tabs.<eos> I don't think Tessa wants me to bring her this homework...<eos> in the biblical sense.<eos> ever since we made out on Christmas... (Slap) I've been giving her some space, and she's been taking it.
You're telling me. isn't it crazy?<eos> We have space, right?<eos> We more or less have money...<eos> We do.<eos> Serena can stay in your study, since you never use it.
Work sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.<eos> Jerry, you've been to the house six times.<eos> Did you see a closet?<eos> Did you walk into it?
If you're one of the few people on this earth that actually loves what they do, you don't ever rub that in anyone's face.<eos> No, you be grateful and keep your mouth shut. (Sighs) Oh, no.<eos> Not again.<eos> (Amplified voice) All right, people, let's line up from least annoying to the most. (Crowd murmuring)<eos> Tom, you don't have to be in the back of the line, but you should be near it.
It's no wild animal.<eos> What kind of person has it in them to do that?<eos> I think that we all have it in us but some worse than others.<eos> Still. The mystery of death isn't a bad thing, hey?<eos> Without it we wouldn't have this.
Yeah?<eos> Fred Paulsen, executive producer.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, how are you?<eos> 22 years of covering crime, I never figured it would hit this close to home.
You just need to talk to her.<eos> CO to Main Control for a shift briefing.<eos> Dayanara!<eos> I unclogged the toilet.<eos> There was a Barbie in it.
U.S.A!<eos> U.S.A!<eos> he first time it was literally just the UK that we were playing out to.<eos> Whereas now, it's all around the world.<eos> hen we started getting ready for it we just knew that it had to be good.
No criminal record.<eos> Really? Well, I don't think his gun shoots gumdrops and lollipops.<eos> Well, he had a fully loaded magazine, but nothing in the chamber;<eos> gun is clean as a whistle.<eos> Doesn't look like it's been fired recently.

I'll get you some rabbits. Great.<eos> You packing different steel nowadays?<eos> Live by it, you die by it... And eat potato puffs by it.<eos> Pray to god you don't have to use it again.<eos> Pray to god you don't get used to not using it again.
You know what happens to whoever kills me.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> That's Clay's gun.<eos> This weapon is registered in your name.<eos> It was just used in the murder of Damon Pope.
Pity you don't have a Montblanc pen for me to sign it with.<eos> With cobalt ink.<eos> We already have a quartermaster.<eos> Sir, I know... That this is Nigel's position and him losing it would not be easy for him.<eos> But let me just assure you, I'm not just prepared for this position... I was born for it.
ADEN, YEMEN<eos> Aden.<eos> Yemen's ancient port city was nothing like Kabul.<eos> In Afghanistan, life was defined by the war.<eos> Everything revolved around it.
Well, yeah.<eos> Okay, jerk-off, I'll go with you.<eos> Here's some French toast left.<eos> I need a gun.<eos> Can you get me a gun and teach me how to use it?
The Aedile among them?<eos> He does not.<eos> You are sure of this?<eos> His villa now stands ours.<eos> His claim to it severed by my own hand.
I didn't ask for their help.<eos> How about consulting me before you struck a deal?<eos> Let's get something very clear.<eos> I run the organization.<eos> You work for it.
No.<eos> I-I've been doing some research Into the history of the drake,<eos> The building in the city where your great-grandfather used to live.<eos> And I-I came across this book.<eos> Now some of it's in a code.
Is Brian still upset?<eos> Brian thinks I'm a selfish bitch, so yeah.<eos> Well, I think he's just stressed about his play. Oh, right.<eos> His play.<eos> I took a peek at it, by the way.
It's like he didn't even see it coming.<eos> When the business failed, we lost everything.<eos> And you think if you're constantly evolving, this won't happen to you?<eos> Of course it'll happen.<eos> But if you accept change is inevitable, it doesn't crush you when it does.
- 'Cause prayer... - Murphy.<eos> We appreciate all you're doing for our boy.<eos> But your blood wouldn't save his life.<eos> It would condemn him.<eos> Living with it would be so much worse for him than dying without it.
I'll give you some space.<eos> I just moved in so I need to get the power turned on.<eos> By tomorrow would be great actually.<eos> A credit card?<eos> Well, I do. I mean, it's technically my parents', but they take it at the mall, so...
Who did that?<eos> Lindsay.<eos> How come you're so mean to Mom?<eos> I'm not mean to Mom.<eos> You drew a line on the floor with nail polish and said she couldn't cross it.
It's my life's work, you know that.<eos> Of course, Szymon, yes.<eos> We can put it in the basement.<eos> It's dry there, like a dungeon.<eos> And no one will find it.
- He doesn't have a lot of money now.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> - Of the book?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I never read it.
Uther, I don't think we can win this fight.<eos> I know Mordred. He would accept surrender.<eos> Hold the crown.<eos> And hold it steady.
I'm nothing but the bastard son of a prostitute.<eos> You and I have a lot more in common than you think.<eos> It's not just the same blood we share but also the same interests.<eos> We both developed a palate for power.<eos> I've never had any power. Or any desire to achieve it.
The Pharaohs kingdom will one day be hers to rule without mercy or fear.<eos> And Ahmanet would be worshipped as a living God.<eos> But Pharaoh had a son.<eos> The boy now, would inherit her destiny.<eos> And Ahmanet understood power was not given it had to be taken.
Which brings me to you.<eos> Me?<eos> Yeah, great, yes.. doc.<eos> You said that you could cure me of this curse.<eos> Get rid of it.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.<eos> Yeah, but there'll be cake.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
I'm sorry?<eos> The merchant who can't outrun Death.<eos> You always hated that story as a child.<eos> Less keen on predestination back then.<eos> I'm not sure I like it now.
Maybe he got inspired by what he was writing about.<eos> You won't win.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> There are no other mentions of these cases anywhere else.<eos> It's like someone redacted the whole story, so no one else could read it.
Millennia.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> But a long time ago, the elders of K'un-Lun gathered to study how to harness their chi.<eos> The energy of life itself.<eos> They wanted to use it to heal.
You promised me!<eos> No!<eos> Hey, down there.<eos> I don't know which mistake is worst.<eos> Designing a water pump that leaks or putting it someone no human being can reach.
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
Ah, America. You beacon of composure and proportionate response. You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.<eos> What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?<eos> Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
Hello?<eos> And sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> I'm not going there.<eos> Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
Well, I made a deal with the cartel.<eos> I'm giving it back.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because if you don't give it to me, Rhys is gonna die.
And I own a run-down brothel.<eos> Because I hate magic even more than you.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm glad you banned it.<eos> I'm glad not to use it.
- No!<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Where is he?<eos> If that is your magic, you better use it on me, because I will not relent.
- How much?<eos> - Mm.<eos> A cache of gems.<eos> Spain is willing to burn Nassau to the ground.<eos> The only way Rogers can prevent this is to find the cache and return it, which means if we were to find it first, we could dictate what happens next.
Tactically, he's greatly disadvantaged.<eos> Between tactics and passion, I'll take the latter.<eos> If our information's correct and he seeks revenge over the death of Charles Vane, he will fight with passion today.<eos> Revenge is a powerful motivator, undoubtedly.<eos> Fortunately, my men would like a little of it for themselves as well.
Maybe-- all right.<eos> So, you're free to talk about anything.<eos> A lot of couples experience a death of passion, um...<eos> Passion is definitely not our problem.<eos> If it is, maybe it's because there's too much of it.
Uh, yeah, it took me a while to figure it out.<eos> At first I thought it was like the Norwegians, right?<eos> But then I noticed how he moves his cards when he's sorting.<eos> The first card he moves indicates the suit.<eos> If he moves it all the way to the left, it's spades.
- Happy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you took his head.<eos> As a souvenir?<eos> He didn't need it.
Is Flint?<eos> This war may feel over, but as long as we're all free, it's far from it.<eos> And if somehow we prevail in Nassau, what happens to former friends who've since aligned themselves so warmly with the governor?<eos> I've come to offer you a chance to earn back our friendship.<eos> Or, more specifically, to buy it back.
You want me to dance?<eos> I want the cover.<eos> You don't want the cover.<eos> Hell, yeah, I do.<eos> Damn cover's all any politician ever wants to talk about, but my editor's not gonna give it to the mayor of the nation's 27th largest city no matter how much buzz he's getting.
They were voiceless.<eos> They were hurting.<eos> Well, thank God they had film, and thank God I could do my bit to make our democracy a little more equal.<eos> Creating false stories doesn't make democracy more equal.<eos> It harms it deeply.
Praise Him.<eos> Praise God!<eos> It is a sign!<eos> You know of Ethandun?<eos> Not only do we know of this battle, Lord, we have risen because of it.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom and I picked it up, and before I knew it, 20 minutes had flown by.<eos> It's exciting.<eos> Y'all have a nice day.<eos> I didn't leave it in the bathroom.
Please give it back.<eos> Like I did with Lily?<eos> - Give me the lighter, Nora.<eos> - Come on, Nora.<eos> - She said she doesn't need it.
I'm trying to help.<eos> When all you've done since we hooked back up is the opposite.<eos> I never wanted the terrorists to get the list.<eos> There was an easy way to do that, Ben.<eos> Not steal it from me in the first place.
And that's the end of this conversation.<eos> So many lies to deny a simple truth.<eos> What?<eos> The crown does not divide.<eos> It cannot be shared.
Good morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love our coffee.<eos> It's one of the few things Kenya does really well.<eos> In England, I missed it.
Eh, see, what you feel, the haunted look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere.<eos> Then where does it come from?<eos> In the center of your being, there's a tiny beating heart.<eos> What, you mean like my soul?<eos> Part of it, yes, the slimmest part, but it holds specific power.
And this liver tells a story on its own.<eos> Vesicular degeneration makes it pretty clear he became a heavy drug user.<eos> Well, he had all his teeth, so it wasn't meth.<eos> Well, heroin's the most likely candidate.<eos> It has too short a half-life to show up on a tox screen.
Maybe a pipe, or a baseball bat?<eos> Until the skull's reconstructed, there's no telling if this beating was cause of death.<eos> The cell phone's motherboard was partially burned by the fire.<eos> So, what are you doing with the heat gun, burning up the rest?<eos> No. The hot air isn't gonna hurt it.
I just... Had to get out of there.<eos> Well, first of all, Nicole isn't having a setback because of the book.<eos> She's having a setback 'cause she was held captive in a jungle for two years.<eos> Yeah, well, the book didn't help.<eos> And I'm the idiot who convinced him to write it.
We here at Fillmore-Graves do not plan on going gently into that good night.<eos> What do you plan on doing?<eos> Well, for a start, we're well-armed and well-trained.<eos> We're also the proud owners of the formula for Super Max.<eos> No one else gets it.
"Noted Economist Attackedin Home."<eos> I didn't even know economists made the news.<eos> That's the first and last time, hopefully.<eos> I've been trying to piece this thing together.<eos> You remember those government guys, those think tank guys, trying to pick my brain about game theory, how they could use it for foreign policy?
Take it to trial.<eos> Expensive.<eos> And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<eos> Not my first choice or yours, I imagine.<eos> The firm could choose to buy me out for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.
Do you sleep in a coffin?<eos> No, it's a canoe.<eos> And, Mom, the blood wasn't fake.<eos> It was real.<eos> It's cow's blood, and it's gone now, and...
You mean, you blackmailed him.<eos> - Well... - For this data cache to have exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it has to be huge.<eos> I think the term is "beyond massive."<eos> What?<eos> One of the last things my dad said to me when he gave me the rags was that they hold a power most people could never even imagine and that I needed to respect and guard that power, not abuse it.
Obviously, this is a horrifying development.<eos> Uh, we believe the Green Arrow was retaliating against this office for speaking out against his recent crimes.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> This office is in complete agreement with D.A. Chase.<eos> This situation has become untenable... And I am determined to bring it to a just and successful end.
Yeah, I mean... you know, theoretically.<eos> And you were giving me crap about my portal?<eos> I didn't say I couldn't do it.<eos> Yeah, on second thought, my stele might actually come in handy.<eos> We should head back to the lake and see if we can find it.
Stop tormenting me, Mother!<eos> You and your sister made the same mistake.<eos> Inferior creatures mix their blood to strain out impurities.<eos> But Marburg blood is already purer than pure.<eos> Precisely because we never dilute it.
Harvey, you are acting captain.<eos> I want you to open an investigation into the murder of Frank Gordon, and I think Jim should be questioned.<eos> You're accusing Jim of killing his own uncle?<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> - I don't know, but I know that he is involved somehow, maybe not in his death, but maybe in covering it up, making it look like a suicide.
I'm sorry to throw you into the deep end of the pool like this, but I need to know what we're up against.<eos> You mean beyond a secret society that controls all of Gotham.<eos> Well, if they could isolate the virus they could transform it into any number of compounds that could be released on a large scale into the city.<eos> All they'd need is a sample of her blood.<eos> Well, they ain't getting it from the source.
Make one move to escape and I call the guards.<eos> Ah, I assumed as much, which is why I bribed the guards to poison your coffee.<eos> You're lying!<eos> Yes, I am, but I did steal a dart from the guards a couple days ago.<eos> Was planning on using it on them, but...
Good.<eos> Can you form them into a ball?<eos> Place it on the bench when you're done.<eos> Tonight when you go to dinner, that ball will be sitting right there on that bench.<eos> You won't be carrying it with you anymore.
We don't dispute he broke into his brother's house, an act he regrets... deeply.<eos> But there is another side to this story.<eos> One not about calculation... or ill intent, but about about two brothers, whose relationship, after years of strain, finally broke.<eos> We believe that, after you have the complete picture, you'll understand James McGill is an asset to our legal community.<eos> And he should remain a full member of it in good standing.
We don't need to dwell on the burglary or the assault that you suffered.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> What I would like to hear about is this tape.<eos> What compelled you to make it?
Don't ask me.<eos> They were here all weekend setting it all up.<eos> What the hell are you doing with my printer?<eos> It was garbage before I was born, man.<eos> Yeah, well, I know how to use it.
In that case, Mom, I'm sorry, but no.<eos> However you're rationalizing what you're doing with Archie's dad, I don't want any part of it.<eos> It's so perfect when you play it.<eos> We wrote a good song, Archie.<eos> I can't wait to sing it with you in public.
Did you find something?<eos> Not yet, but they're definitely hiding things.<eos> Remember our deal, Polly, if you don't find anything by Homecoming, it's over you're coming home.<eos> I just have to get into their bedroom.<eos> They protect it obsessively.
Thank you.<eos> I'm aware she's on her own, of course, and I saw her on Sunday, but she never mentioned anything about a court case.<eos> It's the shame, probably.<eos> The more ashamed people are, the less inclined they are to ask for help. Yes.<eos> And the more they need it.
"Bigger than Ben Hur!"<eos> I'd better start stocking Roman helmets, then.<eos> I've never come across a case quite like it.<eos> Mrs Wallace has made up her mind, and seems to believe that God approves of her actions.<eos> If I may venture an observation, when people seek the approval of the Almighty, it is generally because they fear they will not get it.
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Suppose I'll find out this evening.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.
If you want your internship back,<eos> You're gonna have to apologize to ashley. For what?<eos> Being honest?<eos> If you want the job back, that's what you have to do.<eos> You don't want it back, fine.
- Nice to see you again.<eos> Okay, so why gospel music?<eos> I mean, for us it's a sacred thing.<eos> Well, it's sacred for me too now, now that I've been here.<eos> And as an artist, I'd like the opportunity to explore it.
I have to get home.<eos> Building a fort?<eos> No.<eos> I just lost my phone.<eos> I can't find it anywhere.
Sorry Dad.<eos> Don't find yourself at Wozniak house tonight.<eos> You better not miss.<eos> Say something nice at his funeral..<eos> The assassination attempt, it was staged.
And I helped you with BB.<eos> Yeah, that worked great.<eos> We'll go to Hennessey and tell him about the kid.<eos> Whoa. Why are you taking the gauntlet?<eos> Hennessey's gonna hold onto it.
I didn't take anything from your house.<eos> You get us something from that suit.<eos> Holy shit, it worked.<eos> Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet?<eos> Hennessey's gonna hold on to it.
I was with dawes when he found Fred in a bar on ceres. Drunk.<eos> Lost.<eos> An earther outcast, still reeking with the blood of the belters he slaughtered on Anderson station.<eos> Fred was looking for death.<eos> He would've welcomed it. But dawes spoke to him and showed him a different path.
Look.<eos> Look at the eye.<eos> Heather.<eos> Heather.<eos> Interesting, you had a gun but you didn't use it.
- The skull guy.<eos> - Right.<eos> So it's logical that she's the connection.<eos> Maybe the blood on the mirror prevented something worse from happening.<eos> Probably a good idea not to clean it off, then.
What he can't abide to think on, it's like it don't exist.<eos> - Ross, am I a bad daughter?<eos> - He was a bad father.<eos> And yet 'tis a bond, Ross... .. father and child.<eos> Despite all, it cannot be denied.
When do you take your seat?<eos> Er... next week.<eos> I shall take a house in London.<eos> Then we'll no longer be neighbours.<eos> Oh, during summer recess. If I cannot avoid it.
But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?<eos> The man who newly finds it in his grasp, like one who has never before tasted liquor?<eos> Or the man who by heredity, like you and I, has learnt to take it in his stride, who may taste the heady brew without becoming drunk on it?
- Right, he just happened to stumble across molestation photos online.<eos> Yeah, while booking a trip to Thailand.<eos> Did you pay the person who posted this garbage so that you could own it yourself?<eos> And then maybe trade the images with other perverts?<eos> Regardless of how you organized your collection, someone stole it, and you were paying huge sums of money to have it returned.
Aren't pay phones a thing of the past?<eos> All due respect, my son is misremembering the night.<eos> And Danny handing you his cell and you walking around the outside of the Harbor Grill pretending to try to make a phone call... is your son misremembering all that, too?<eos> Danny... told you he gave me his cell?<eos> But you didn't use it to make a call.
It's yours.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How 'bout "nailed it"?<eos> I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it, but I knew my parents would never let me get it.<eos> I also knew they'd never keep it if I gave it to them, so...
Yeah.<eos> It's gonna be perfect.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Where's your jacket?<eos> Don't need it.
There is something lodged in the rectum.<eos> What is that, a gun?<eos> He says he has no idea how the gun got up there.Nt.<eos> All right, what are our options?<eos> It's not gonna be easy getting it out.
I'm losing my shit.<eos> Does that count?<eos> Kyle's new friend...<eos> Okay, let's talk.<eos> I had her deal on my desk for three days waiting for my approval, but I haven't even touched it.
You think we're gonna get in trouble being out here since technically it's count time?<eos> Maybe we get counted as sitting it out.<eos> That would be cool.<eos> Plus, the music's good.<eos> Maybe we could just listen to it.
The spear allows us to rewrite reality.<eos> Now, if you were to help me, your father no longer has to ship off to battle.<eos> He would no longer have to die in that ambush.<eos> Your mother would no longer be a widow, and you...<eos> The only way you're getting that spear is by prying it from my cold, dead hands.
Don't take this away from me.<eos> Just forget about history for once, all right?<eos> We're in the Age of Legend.<eos> Well, remember as Santayana once said.<eos> "Those who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat it."
There was this one guy I dated. He had a foot thing.<eos> Like high heels and all of that?<eos> No. Foot jobs. Like hand jobs, but with your feet.<eos> - Whoa. - How does that even work?<eos> Imagine picking up a hot dog... - Whoa. - With your toes, and then massaging it with your arches.
I thought we were staying out of this.<eos> I definitely think we should investigate.<eos> Me three.<eos> Some people.<eos> They can't appreciate a good thing until it's gone.
Lost count of how many of my people I've seen killed.<eos> They don't expect you to be chained to your desk on your first day, you know?<eos> Give me a hand here?<eos> Of course.<eos> Look, the success of the initiative's gonna depend on making it as attractive as possible to the Hairies, which means, among other things, counteracting any propaganda there may be from Hairy sympathizers.
I think you got it covered.<eos> I'm just gonna take a shower and rush back.<eos> I love you, all right?<eos> Just go make beautiful music.<eos> The city really needs it today.
I sleep fine.<eos> So should you.<eos> You got blood on your shirt.<eos> I have others.<eos> Gonna come a day when it doesn't wash off.
And yet you think he had the presence of mind, the ability, to not only kill Roger Caplan but to manipulate the car's GPS and send it out of town?<eos> I don't think anything, sir.<eos> I just rendered the data.<eos> But one thing I've learned from Everclear is, you know, memory is tough.<eos> Sometimes it just won't stay buried.
I trust them. And you trust me.<eos> Luna, Nyko, time to move.<eos> They think my blood will save them, Nyko.<eos> Save us all.<eos> What do you think would happen if I said they couldn't have it?
Well, you've certainly said it enough times.<eos> That's how I make it happen.<eos> Elena Gabriel.<eos> Lead candidate for that first mission.<eos> Well, it'll take a couple of days for me to do a full work-up on it.
Up front, carbon dioxide scrubbers, just like the ones on Apollo 13.<eos> They will purify the air, even in case of radiation.<eos> And you can measure that radiation on these systems up here.<eos> Water.<eos> You may not be able to find it.
- Yeah, and crash to our death.<eos> - Not necessarily.<eos> - Well, that's comforting.<eos> - Lucy, a little help.<eos> The density of the loading dock gives it three times the gravitational force of the sun, which will get you out of range in 10.2 seconds.
We'll head back, blow the bulkhead door, and get your colleagues out of there.<eos> In the meantime, you find a way to end the lockdown so we can get the shuttle to the central hub.<eos> We'll get everyone off the station that way.<eos> The Emperor initiated the lockdown.<eos> It can only be terminated on his command.

Where's Turrence?<eos> So you think you'll be able to sell this to the workers?<eos> Yeah. I'm sure I can convince them that this is their best option.<eos> Have to say, you surprise me.<eos> Your reputation may precede you, but it's a long way from reality.
Broke into our place, threatened Nick.<eos> I'd like you to keep a leash on your son. And I'd like you to help us with the other people.<eos> The ranch ain't my autocratic plaything.<eos> Its residents don't bend to my whims and wills and fancies.<eos> It's a place for free people who only ask for help when they need it.
Wait, The Widow is Flea?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You trained The Widow?<eos> Uh, yeah. Listen, with that book in her possession, no one's safe.<eos> Well, she doesn't know how to read it.
This, too, is Hmong.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> It's my mother's.<eos> You respect your history.<eos> This is part of it.
Well, what if we design a probe that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously?<eos> One probe head could target the cell membrane with the laser...<eos> While a second probe head deploys the drug, bathing the lymph node cells.<eos> And if we use the near-infrared part of the light spectrum...<eos> We could perforate the cell membrane without damaging it.
I'll tell you guys everything, just let me jump in the shower and then we can celebrate.<eos> Actually, this can't wait. Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back. It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.
From your father.<eos> We worked together in poland, in the same building.<eos> So he arranged me an invitation. We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.<eos> I don't like vodka...<eos> It burns my throat. Haha!
I told him to keep quiet,<eos> That it's important morale is maintained on a day like this.<eos> I'll need your gun. What? !<eos> Keep your holster closed.<eos> And no one will know it's missing.
Good morning, doctors!<eos> Chief.<eos> And welcome to you, Dr. Minnick.<eos> Oh, thank you, really, but I don't do caffeine.<eos> I don't need it.
Gwen, how old did you say she was when she disappeared?<eos> 20.<eos> That fits, I'm afraid.<eos> Late teens, early 20s is when it starts manifesting.<eos> It's possible it got so bad that she just left everything behind.
I'm going over your head.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He's never been that interested in the foundation.<eos> I know.<eos> He does not appreciate our role or the scope of it.
Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> Well, Frank, I'm really sorry about that hose thing.<eos> Oh, no hard feelings.<eos> Shirt needed freshening anyway.<eos> I haven't washed it since we stopped to take pictures at Smokey-Top, Utah's longest, continuously burning tire fire.
Well, then, look at me. What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?<eos> He said he would recommend to the judge a sentence of ten years instead of life without parole.<eos> No further questions.<eos> I had no idea of the plea deal.<eos> No, I did not authorize it.
Of course He does.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I'm a faggot.<eos> I mean, God's love is everywhere.<eos> It's about accepting it.
Brothers!<eos> I overheard your conversation regarding the War on Drugs.<eos> I'm extremely disappointed.<eos> I mean, you would be.<eos> You started it. I understand you hate it, I do. I really, really do.
Don't listen to him, Bae.<eos> He's just jealous.<eos> Maybe, Papa, but he's right about magic.<eos> The war's over.<eos> You don't need it anymore.
But Commissioner Fletcher was his superior officer at the time and on duty that night.<eos> We think Fletcher shot that kid and made Grimes take the fall.<eos> The missing tape would prove it.<eos> That's quite a valuable tape.<eos> Ms. Bloom may have been using it all these years to blackmail Commissioner Fletcher... special treatment.
Good.<eos> Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to enjoy my coffee.<eos> What?<eos> What? You ruined my blouse, you wrinkly bitch!<eos> Your blouse was ruined by your inability to fill it out.
Never recognizing when they're in the presence... of true power.<eos> Can I get an amen?<eos> Power can be lost, go missing for centuries, then turn up in the unlikeliest of places.<eos> But in the end... power can never remain hidden.<eos> Not to those deserving enough to wield it.
We had to restore time.<eos> Although I suppose it doesn't really much matter now that reality itself is threatened.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Last time I checked, there was not an on/off button on the spear.<eos> What if... what if they don't know how to use it?
Sometimes... we get it wrong.<eos> Officer Atwater, on behalf of the State's Attorney's Office and all the people of Cook County, I'm sorry.<eos> I think he'd be proud.<eos> Of both of us.<eos> Pursuing justice is a messy business, and yes, it took us awhile to dig it out of the muck, but in the end, the truth emerged victorious.
I can barely even remember what being human is like.<eos> Liv. The syringes...<eos> They're gone.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.
I can't imagine a life without all that.<eos> So, Tinker Bell was wrong, then.<eos> That isn't your happy ending.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> But it did give me hope when I needed it most, and that was just as important.
They've stood for something larger than themselves, and that takes courage.<eos> And you've shown a lot of courage, too.<eos> I haven't done anything.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Despite all the garbage that you have had to deal with, you asked for the truth, and you faced it.
Harvey!<eos> Don't move!<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> Harvey, don't play games with me...<eos> I got a big-ass gun, Harvey, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Well, I was in the area.<eos> Yeah, right. You're my mentor, okay?<eos> So stop acting like you're not.<eos> Well... you know I love this book.<eos> Thanks for pushing me to write it.
Hennessey's radio is over here.<eos> This is Los Angeles.<eos> I'm looking for Den Mother.<eos> Anybody reading?<eos> I have the gauntlet, but I can't hold onto it for much longer.
"Take this, all of you, And drink from it..." Any moisture left there...<eos> Causes infection.<eos> "For this is the Chalice of my blood..." Athlete's foot, especially.<eos> If you've ever had athlete's Foot, you'll know... "The blood of the new And eternal covenant..."<eos> It's a lot easier to catch it Than it is to get rid of it.
Er, do you want to come in?<eos> What is it?<eos> Why did you give me communion, father?<eos> Why did you come up for it?<eos> Because I've never needed It so much in my life.
- I'm listening. - Uh...<eos> Ring went down the drain, got caught in the garbage disposal.<eos> I went to get it, but I got it, so...<eos> Well, what if you had lost it?<eos> I would have torn my trailer apart looking for it.
Where'd it come from?<eos> I wrote it back in the day.<eos> You wrote it?<eos> It's hot.<eos> How come you never recorded it?
These people are terrified.<eos> Maybe we can help a little.<eos> Why not, just at the end, just be kind?<eos> See this face?<eos> Take a good, long look at it.
It will help grow the entire region economically, and it will significantly reduce drugs and crime in the U.S.<eos> And it is a great contribution to the world at large.<eos> How could your president not want to be a part of that?<eos> It is only a pipe dream if the peace agreement doesn't hold.<eos> Back home, there are rumors that it is on shaky ground, that the Colombian congress is wavering.
Do you remember the subject of your master's thesis?<eos> Well, it was 30 years ago.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> It's a good thing I have a copy.<eos> It's called "In Defense of Pinto."
No, I only had enough money to lease the bar.<eos> I need more to fix it up.<eos> Yo, what do you want me to do with the truck?<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Just get rid of it.
So you don't worry about her?<eos> Of course, I worry about her.<eos> I fought in the war in '96, I know what those things are capable of.<eos> But I know what my daughter is capable of.<eos> And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it.
You know? I mean, McGee is basically future Sebastian.<eos> Well, where's future Sebastian now?<eos> He's in Patton's office trying to track the final burner phone.<eos> No luck so far, though.<eos> It hasn't even been turned on.
The other night, Rainer asked me if I would be into candling.<eos> - Oh. You know what that is, right?<eos> - Yes! - Yes!<eos> It's when you do the... and then... and then you... and then you do the... the boop, boop.<eos> Candling is where you light a hollow candle and insert it... into one of the ear canals... to remove ear wax.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I'm just upset.<eos> No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings.<eos> And I'm proud of you-- for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.<eos> And if you don't like that machine, get rid of it.
You never know who's listening.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Sit down, I've a lot to catch you up on.<eos> James Weckler had a safe deposit box.<eos> I convinced Tatum to let me come along when she opened it.
'We've all been bruised a bit and we've had our hearts broken.<eos> But we are a nation of fighters, so that's what we do.<eos> We get up, we move on, we fight.'<eos> ♪ I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know ♪ 'We face the things that are bigger than us with dignity and with courage.<eos> And we ask for help when we need it.' ♪
Are you ignoring me?<eos> It's just, uh, why is he like this?<eos> What did I do wrong? No. Listen, Danny and people like Danny<eos> Have an affliction, ok? It's like a sickness.<eos> They either choose to fight it or they embrace it, And it's no one's fault.
- It can't travel.<eos> The victim's incapacitated before he can transmit it.<eos> - So how did Smoll get infected?<eos> - Lipstick.<eos> We found traces of it around the victim's mouth.
Some Latin Player he was beefing with.<eos> But you know how that go.<eos> No one saw nothing.<eos> Hey, what happened to the gun?<eos> I never found it.
Maybe three seconds.<eos> So in a crowded room, after you'd been drinking and popping pills with music pumping and lights pulsating, you were really able to see and identify a ring on the finger of a stranger?<eos> I saw it.<eos> And his face.<eos> I'll never forget it.
The Black Fairy has Gideon's heart?<eos> And what will it do?<eos> Destroy my magic.<eos> Maybe postponing the wedding is the best thing, until we know that the Black Fairy can't interrupt.<eos> Tiger Lily said it had been used to banish the Black Fairy once.
Thank you.<eos> Did Alvez say what he wanted us for?<eos> No.<eos> The same DNA was on the outside of the water bottle at Joey Fletcher's crime scene, but none in the water itself.<eos> So he's not drinking it.
Yes, it is.<eos> Yes, it is!<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Now I know why I got this mission.<eos> Nobody else wanted it.
Pride, what is it?<eos> Sebastian, if somebody swung one of these old rifles hard enough, could trace amounts of black gunpowder...<eos> Get dislodged, and end up embedded in the skull? Absolutely.<eos> Any idea where the missing rifle is, General?<eos> I never even noticed it was gone.
They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship.<eos> And with this ring, it now belongs to you.<eos> Killian, I spent so much of my life on my own.<eos> And then, Henry found me and brought me to Storybrooke, and helped me find the rest of my family.<eos> But just because you learn that you come from true love doesn't mean that you believe that you'll ever find it.
Hence my Robin Hood reference.<eos> - Bryant's doing pretty well for a civil servant;<eos> his co-workers think he may have, uh, cooked the books to line his pockets.<eos> So Langston kidnapped Bryant 'cause he's a corrupt official?<eos> Forced Bryant to withdraw the dirty money, and use it for its original, intended purpose.
We need to pull it out.<eos> - Dawson, no.<eos> We don't have the...<eos> - The bullet's right there.<eos> If we don't pull it out he's gonna die.
Well, I'm afraid it is.<eos> Your Story Book.<eos> Or what's left of it.<eos> No way.<eos> My mom would never burn it.
Well, between my revolvers and his pistol<eos> - we can slow it down, though.<eos> - Did you see the tentacle last time?<eos> I mean, no offence to your pistol,<eos> - but it won't leave a scratch!
You check behind the counter.<eos> God, what are we dealing with here?<eos> I got another one!<eos> And a can of oven cleaner.<eos> If he sprayed the oven and didn't wipe it up, couldn't that cause cyanide poisoning?
Fromthatdayforward,Peter and Lois never again... Ooh, nope, sorry, there's still another scene left.<eos> Well, Peter, turns out your initial instinct was right.<eos> You never should've let any of your children contact you.<eos> You said it.<eos> From now on, I'm making sure my sperm stays right where it belongs: in the bathroom sink.
Do you see the way she's looking at him?<eos> Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.<eos> I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.<eos> Ah, did you see that?<eos> She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away.
This is a problem and it needs to be addressed."<eos> [Asher] The whole issue of suicide is an uncomfortable thing to talk about, but it happens, so we have to talk about it.<eos> And it's dangerous not to talk about it because there's always room for hope.<eos> We wanted to do it in a way where it was honest, and we wanted to make something that can hopefully help people, because suicide should never, ever be an option.<eos> [Minnette] To not seek out help, or to end it, is just tragic, because who knows what you could have gone on to do?
More unanticipated than his murder?<eos> Before Jake died, he took our Mars communication satellite off-line.<eos> - That sounds bad.<eos> - Worse than you can imagine.<eos> If we can't get that satellite back on-line, we can't control it, meaning we can't steer it away from space junk, and if it collides with something, it will come crashing down to Earth.
What the hell is this?<eos> The murder weapon.<eos> Francesca, do you recognise it?<eos> Nup.<eos> Never seen it before.
It's a gun.<eos> Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?<eos> - If you didn't do it?<eos> - Yeah, I wish.<eos> Just tell the cops you never seen it before.
It feels dirty just to hold it.<eos> Is that your way of telling me you want me to look at it?<eos> No, I looked at it for both of us.<eos> Knowing how the book was made, the experience is as nauseating as you would imagine.<eos> And yet, one good thing has come from studying it.
There's no time.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sooner than expected, damn her.<eos> She's looking for the third seal.<eos> I don't have it, nor do I know where it is.
Back that up, Lee.<eos> What do you mean, the water at work sucks?<eos> Sucks how?<eos> You know, like really nasty egg water.<eos> We try to avoid it, really, but at the end of a shift, you take whatever's wet. Right.
It was sold out when I looked in the bookstore.<eos> Really?<eos> That's fantastic, Michi!<eos> I doubt that it was sold out.<eos> They probably never even carried it.
Congratulations on receiving the Japan Outstanding Literature Prize.<eos> Why did you choose me?<eos> Because I thought it would be interesting.<eos> I think it was about a year ago... that I just happened to read one of your novels.<eos> I didn't think it was particularly interesting or boring. But whoever wrote it has an incredible aversion to death. In fact, he might even fear it.
They're trying to break us down so that we start killing each other, Bud.<eos> You just need to relax, all right?<eos> I hope by now we've demonstrated that we aren't blindly bluffing.<eos> This game's a real one.<eos> Each of you are deep inside it.
This is it.<eos> We can't pass "eleven."<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Our drink number.<eos> In every male and female friendship, there's a number of drinks, and if you pass it, you have to have sex, mathematically.
You know, Bob, I think I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.<eos> But there's a little problem I need you to fix first.<eos> Alcaino says Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen, which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.<eos> And he doesn't give a rat's ass that our government did it.<eos> He wants his money and it's not gonna be over until he gets it.
Historical pageant, is it?<eos> Well, it's attempting to be more modern.<eos> I wrote a play once.<eos> It was not a happy experience. I can tell you that.<eos> I found it an anemic form... lacking the multi-colored cloak of prose.
Not unless we go by boat too!<eos> So there's a loop here in Blackpool, its only six months old.<eos> January 11th, 2016.<eos> With Miss. Avocet gone...<eos> - It can't be reset.
We need you to find out where he hid it.<eos> I thought I was here to be cured.<eos> Violence is a disease.<eos> Like cancer.<eos> And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.
Artistically it has merit.<eos> But more importantly, because what happened to Ryan Morris was horrendous.<eos> - It was horrendous, exactly, which is why we shouldn't be reminding the children about it.<eos> - Children aren't born with that kind of hatred, Henry.<eos> They learn it.
More like five times.<eos> More booze has been drunk in the last 10 years than ever before.<eos> Because people don't wanna be told they can't do it.<eos> The same could be said of fornication.<eos> People want it but don't want to be told they can't have it.
- No, it's not joke, is a job offer.<eos> Do you want the job?<eos> - Look, I just don't understand why you couldn't deliver this.<eos> - I already told you.<eos> If you don't want the job, you don't have to take it.
That's a lie, Timothy!<eos> That is lying by omission.<eos> That's textbook...<eos> You know what? My whole job is lying.<eos> Okay? That's why I fucking hate it! - I'm sorry, Jeff.
Don't let me see it.<eos> Show your associate. Commit the card to memory. When you're ready, put the card back in the deck.<eos> Don't try nothing.<eos> Keep your gun on me. That's very good, Earl.<eos> Now, there's no way I can know what your card is because I didn't see it.
But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.<eos> I know that.<eos> Always did.<eos> And you hired out to that gold convoy for the same reason.<eos> The Iron Way... some of us never stop living by it.
All right.<eos> See, you done made a mistake.<eos> - I didn't even do nothing!<eos> - I'll tell you what your mistake was.<eos> You swung at the ball and you didn't hit it.
Your skill made quick work of that cyst.<eos> So I want to thank you again.<eos> I've been feeling increasingly energized since the operation and I've already been able to transfer that energy to others successfully.<eos> The only catch is now I don't have anything to blame my problems on.<eos> That little growth explained everything, and now it's gone.
Look, sugar tits, I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but there's rules around here.<eos> Don't call me sugar tits.<eos> Rule number one, I'll call you whatever the fuck I wanna call you.<eos> Rule two, do not cross me.<eos> I carry artillery in my boot just like the King and I ain't afraid to use it.
Hey.<eos> Hey, you got any, uh, George Orwell books here?<eos> There's a queue, sir, if you wouldn't mind.<eos> That's right.<eos> And I'm at the front of it, sugar puss.
- Where's Nina?<eos> - At the back.<eos> With her friends.<eos> Where did you learn that song, Papa?<eos> I learned it from my parents.
We've got to go there and see what's attracting the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it's coming... we can figure out how to send it somewhere else.<eos> That plan is so dumb, I wish it had a face so I could smack it.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> Instead of running away from a deadly asteroid... you want us to run directly towards it?
It's the love.<eos> Nobody prepares you for that.<eos> It's like, uh..<eos> This wave that crashes into you and pulls you out to sea, you can't..<eos> You can't fight it.
Like at Ottawa university, when professor Janice flamengo attempted to give a lecture that questioned the feminist narrative.<eos> We'll take a moment until we enforce some decorum in the room.<eos> So you think this is a victory?<eos> Yeah, why are you so frightened of hearing an opinion different from your own?<eos> Then there was the first international conference on men's issues in Michigan, where even "Ms. magazine" urged its readers to protest the conference in hopes of shutting it down.
I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic.<eos> Your work exceeds all expectations.<eos> And you'll tell the Emperor as much?<eos> I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.<eos> That was only an inkling of it's destructive potential—
I'm coming with you.<eos> No, your father's message, we can't risk it.<eos> You're the messenger.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> We all got the message. Everyone here knows it.
Shut that thing off!<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Because I have good news.<eos> What? Amy Brandt, the Casting Director...<eos> - She was at your play, and she loved it.
I need a drink.<eos> - How much do I owe you, buddy?<eos> -12 bucks, pal.<eos> I always hated that palm tree.<eos> Never trusted it.
250,000 years ago one race united the entire galaxy, for the first time, in peace.<eos> But there is always the separatist one who will not join the whole.<eos> The Arioui a race of beings unlike any the Iconians had ever known, ...sought to lay waste to the galaxy and the Great Alliance, ...to rebuild it anew.<eos> They were cunning.<eos> One-by-one, they turned the galaxy against it's protectors.
And sooner or later, they'll be exposed.<eos> Any fool who followed Hallendale deserves whatever end they got in his company.<eos> You were right.<eos> This war is getting more dangerous.<eos> The strong among us must stand together and face it.
What is going on? I'm not taking your money. 50 bucks?<eos> - Well, if you insist.<eos> - Thank you so very much.<eos> It's very, very nice of you.<eos> Get rid of it.
Within you.<eos> - I might have to think about that one. - Ooh, ooh!<eos> Be here all night.<eos> All right.<eos> Ooh, ooh! You know, I do have a gun in my cubby and I will use it.
But only if you eat breakfast.<eos> - Dorsa?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Have you seen my workout tape?<eos> - No. It was here but I can't find it now.
Just like you didn't move my workout video, I suppose?<eos> I said I didn't touch your workout video!<eos> How did it end up in the bin then?<eos> The doll is around here somewhere.<eos> It hasn't left the house and nobody has taken it.
Yara was here.<eos> Being ironborn. Leading ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.<eos> And how will she do that?<eos> I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.<eos> Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it.
There used to be stories about an Elf who lived in the Vale.<eos> He'd gladly tell you his wild tale of how he single-handedly won the War of the Races with nothing but a magic sword and three humble Elfstones to aid him.<eos> Well, my father taught me not to believe anything I didn't see with my own eyes.<eos> You think just because those pointy-eared bastards tell us that magic's dead, that's the truth?<eos> What makes you think I haven't seen it, hmm?
You are responsible.<eos> Of course I know. But Antia asked me not to tell.<eos> Are you saying that my daughter doesn't want to see me?<eos> Look, Julieta.<eos> Antia has chosen her own path and you are not part of it.
My mother sings this to me... every night when I'm young.<eos> It's a real pretty song.<eos> I'm gonna figure it out. Maybe build me one of them Africa guitars.<eos> This song is mine.<eos> Nobody in this place can have it.
He needs to verify the value.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you these past few months.<eos> You would never steal from your family, would you?<eos> The collection was mostly my mother's anyway.<eos> It is more mine than theirs. And they would never have sold it.
He can take the train.<eos> Try and find out why he's been so bloody sour lately.<eos> Shouldn't go looking through other people's private things.<eos> He's my son.<eos> The bullet was mine. I never got a chance to fire it.
He's everything everyone says.<eos> GORDON: I don't know how bad it's gonna get.<eos> BARNES: There is no line.<eos> There's just the law.<eos> THOMPKINS: Jim, you see an abyss and you run toward it.
Look.<eos> Helzinger?<eos> Can't stand criticism because of an overbearing mother.<eos> Wants love and approval.<eos> Gets mad when he doesn't get it, so I give it.
Ah, hola, mi capitan.<eos> Why am I speaking Italian, you might ask?<eos> That was Spanish.<eos> Yeah, there are too many languages.<eos> An old case of mine is starting to heat up, and I'd like your old help to help me solve it, señor?
They were fresh.<eos> Not so fresh anymore.<eos> Eight hours ago, I talked to you on the phone.<eos> I told you to handle the Zeppelin situation.<eos> Now not only do you not handle it, but you tell their fucking manager about the deal with the fucking Germans?
All but you.<eos> You do not feel you are where you belong.<eos> The men above would fight to protect us.<eos> I should be among them.<eos> If we are to lead them into this war, we ought to show that we are willing to lead them through it.
But now it's time she had a king.<eos> When we're ready, when he's ready, he'll step into the role we've created for him... and lead an impossible army into an unwinnable war... and win it.<eos> "Captain Throckmorton's black spot will not be the last.<eos> Ignore it, and join him.<eos> Heed it, and reclaim your place amongst us.
- Who's Schulman?<eos> - Forensic accountant. Did he call you?<eos> He had some questions I tried to answer.<eos> Didn't add up. Somebody's playing shell games.<eos> No, no, if Richie drained the goddamn company, why didn't he unload it when he had the chance? 'Cause he's a coke fiend back on coke.
It doesn't let go even when you die.<eos> Love...<eos> Love is a strange beast.<eos> You can whip it, starve it, push it deep down in your insides.<eos> But you can't pull it out of you.
Killed in Virginia while investigating a story about a potential scandal involving our government selling weapons to Syrian rebels.<eos> - I never heard of that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because it never came out.<eos> The story got discredited after Brooks died, and it never gained traction.
Wait here, sir.<eos> Monsieur Drubetskoy.<eos> - Sire, the Emperor...<eos> - You are very young.<eos> I do not want war and I never wanted it.
That's enough.<eos> You're not the first man to threaten me.<eos> Arnold came to feel the way you do.<eos> He couldn't stop me either.<eos> And as exquisite as this array of emotions is... even more sublime is the ability to turn it off.
That's why I'm here.<eos> It's nothing to do with you.<eos> But I did send you the book.<eos> You said the other day that you didn't have a copy.<eos> I said I hadn't read it.
Musically speaking.<eos> Well, you did say Mother Hildegarde kens music.<eos> I was hoping...<eos> Wondering... if there was something odd about the music.<eos> The way it's written.
Oh, yeah. Looks perfect.<eos> Oh, wow. I like this one. Oh.<eos> That's art. That's art. I like that piece.<eos> She's going for it.<eos> She loves it. She loves it.
You have taken away the one thing that made Nassau what it was.<eos> You have given her prosperity.<eos> Strife is good.<eos> Strife makes a man strong.<eos> For if a man is capable of confronting death daily, functioning in the face of it, there's no telling what else that man can do, anda manwhoselimits cannot be known isa veryhardman to defeat in battle.
Peter Ashe, Miranda, her husband, and I, we worked to obtain a universal pardon and introduce it to Nassau to eliminate piracy and restore colonial rule there.<eos> I moved away from those things.<eos> Inch by inch, I forgot it all.<eos> And now, in this cage, in the belly of this thing that has swallowed us whole... I wonder... if the civilization of Nassau isn't exactly what I tried to achieve all those years ago.<eos> If resisting it doesn't set me in opposition to everything I once understood to be good and right.
You're tired.<eos> Perhaps no one else knows why.<eos> I believe that not even you know why.<eos> But I know why.<eos> The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Yeah, well, they didn't use to be.<eos> Somewhere in all of this, we got off track.<eos> I... got off track.<eos> When I first began all this, I had one reason driving me:<eos> dealing out justice to those who can't find it on their own.
You're about to be rich.<eos> What?<eos> Said he saw the murder.<eos> We had a deal, Moses.<eos> And right now, you're eating my end of it.
No one on site, but I have the device.<eos> What about the money?<eos> No, no money.<eos> If that cash does not land at that hangar, we lose Linklater, and we lose Donnie Pomp.<eos> Well, it's not here.
Something's wrong.<eos> Look, do you have to film everything?<eos> According to the future me, yeah.<eos> We never even talked about what we were gonna do with the machine.<eos> All we cared about was can we build it.
Without a job, I'd-I'd never get a loan and start a mortgage, whatever that is.<eos> Already I was terrified<eos> I wasn't saving enough for my retirement.<eos> And what else was I supposed to do?<eos> If I haven't written my novel by now, I'm never going to write it, you know?
Do you want a hat?<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This is the time for my kind to go into hibernation.<eos> I'm hoping I won't turn into a human again during it, and maybe when I wake up again, I will have slept off this whole transformation thing.
Have you sent him any money?<eos> He wouldn't accept it, if we did.<eos> That whole thing at Tulane? Drove a wedge between us, as a family.<eos> He didn't feel supported, so he left.<eos> I gave him my credit card, though, for emergencies. But he's never used it.
-More than liked it.<eos> I need another copy so I can play it again and again and again.<eos> No, you need another copy so you scratch it all over.<eos> That, too.<eos> But I do wanna play it over and over and over.
Host that went missing is the woodcutter.<eos> Looks like the rest of them got stuck here waiting for supper.<eos> You guys can't program more than one of these idiots to make a fire?<eos> We could, but thanks to a new policy from your boss, only one of them is authorized to handle the axe.<eos> The rest of them can't even touch it.
He wants what you want.<eos> There are international consortia lining up to redevelop the Zone.<eos> Matthews has been working behind the scenes to make this happen.<eos> Cleaning out the Zone is the first step.<eos> Yeah, cleaning it out of people.
And Dad's favorite dinner-- pancakes and milkshakes.<eos> That's my favorite, too!<eos> You got it!<eos> Come on, Dad. You're gonna love the new couch.<eos> I'll sit on it, but don't ask me to love it.
Tommy, I wrote a new song, trying to see if it appeals to the youth demographic.
- Hit you. - Get in.<eos> - What is it you expect me to do?<eos> - You're gonna fix me.<eos> Tell me... who were you stealing this pin from?<eos> Why did you want it so badly?
Ow! What are you doing?<eos> I'm rescuing us.<eos> What, through the ladies room?<eos> This is your dumb plan?<eos> The bar needed a ladies room built to be up to code, but no one was ever going to use it, so they didn't bother to finish it.
Thank you for answering my question.<eos> Funny, it sounded like a demand.<eos> Not that question.<eos> But whether your Machine knows the password to deploy the virus.<eos> From the very beginning, when you crippled your Machine, you denied it the same power that you enjoy.
Your sociopath of a son punched a kid in the throat.<eos> The victim didn't report it because he feared reprisal.<eos> That boy has a lacerated trachea and is unable to sing at Nationals.<eos> So, I don't give a crap where the violence comes from and why.<eos> I don't want it in my school.
No, he, uh, started at the wall, started bearing left.<eos> Davis caught it. Miracle of god.<eos> Yeah, then he brushed out.<eos> Kid got to see his first shrine, though.<eos> You didn't touch it, did you?
Oh, you're still in the kitchen. Yup.<eos> I met Allen. Did you?<eos> I gave him marijuana.<eos> Oh, great, that's great.<eos> Can you believe that he's never tried it?
- You think this is a gift?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To be at the whim of a force that's trying to destroy me?<eos> Only because you resist it.<eos> If you accept it, then you control it.
How much money do you have?<eos> If I was unemployed for, like, six months, could you afford our rent? Oh.<eos> Uh, I was actually going to ask you for a little more time this month.<eos> My grandma hurt her hip and she has dementia, and I've been sending her money, but she keeps losing the money.<eos> And she's been yelling at the nurses and accusing them of stealing it.
No, we have to beat her to the punch. What does that mean?<eos> If we're going to end this once and for all, we need to open the rift, knock the Zero Matter out of Whitney, and send it back to wherever it came from.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> We have no real understanding about how the rift works.<eos> Discovering it in the first place was a fluke. You kids are so cute.
Okay?<eos> ♪ This old guitar ♪<eos> ♪ Hell, I've even gone and named it ♪<eos> ♪ And I've cursed and blessed and blamed it ♪<eos> ♪ And still, my fingers have not tamed it ♪
Why's that?<eos> History.<eos> How old is this place?<eos> Foundations date back to the time of the barons.<eos> For centuries, all this land and everyone in it... belonged to one family.
About what?<eos> Raven, come on.<eos> You're not fooling anyone.<eos> I'm not trying to.<eos> If this machine was broken and you knew there was a way to fix it, would you not do it because it might be hard?
I'm not your type, man. I don't even...<eos> Where are we?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Clary, is there a war going on that I don't know about?<eos> There is now. I think my mother's at the center of it.
Lucky for you... guess what I am.<eos> A member.<eos> - I'm not really that into magic.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> You know... just a whole castle devoted to it.
Mannix, we need a guy with your talents in management, problem-solving.<eos> And you need to think about the future.<eos> Lockheed is booming.<eos> Everyone's riding in airplanes, and we're moving into jet airplanes.<eos> It's a new age, Mannix, and we're part of it.
Matter of fact, I think they're ready for him now. James, James, you need me.<eos> You... you can't run this place without me.<eos> I can, and I will. Get him the fuck out of my sight.<eos> Loyalty is everything to me.<eos> I deserve it, and I demand it.
Not now.<eos> We've got some land nearby that was her dad's.<eos> It's got pigs, sheep...<eos> I make what I can from it, but it's just a patch of land.<eos> But it's well looked after.
Settle your trouble.<eos> Get a non-disclosure form signed.<eos> I know.<eos> Thanks for coming in person.<eos> Dimonda said he vetted the story and it's ready to run, with or without comment.
Then, what?<eos> I train your replacement in case you walk out again?<eos> Oh, Alain...<eos> It was nothing to do with you.<eos> When they offered me that job in Paris, it was very hard to turn it down.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside D.C.<eos> Let me ask you something, Nathan.<eos> What's your opinion on infiltration?<eos> Well, how do you mean?<eos> How do we prevent it?
We?<eos> I can help you sell this lie... because like it or not, Ontari... a fake Commander needs a fake Flamekeeper.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I'm gonna need that case, Jasper.<eos> You can't have it.
I asked what she looked like and all the manager said is that it was a Caucasian brunette.<eos> Nothing strange about her.<eos> All right.<eos> Bring the box back here.<eos> Don't let it out of your sight.
How long have you got?<eos> 6 months.<eos> Dad, I'm sorry for all the losses. You were right.<eos> This sport has no future in India. There is a future...<eos> but you don't see it.
I think he was moved from a predominantly clay soil shallow grave.<eos> There are still samples of the soil on and inside his body.<eos> Most of the vital organs have had large chunks removed- the rats probably, but... the left kidney is completely missing.<eos> Completely?<eos> I noticed some clean incisions where it used to be.
I need to prepare the funeral.<eos> Yes, of course! Thank you.<eos> Bombay blood is a variant of the O blood group.<eos> It needs a special test to be detected.<eos> Which is why it didn't show up in the post-mortem.
We worked together... many years ago.<eos> You were the Senior Investigating Officer on my first case at MIA's.<eos> Right.<eos> It was the murder of... Maria Alexandri.<eos> It was never solved.
Thank you.<eos> Planck-Einstein.<eos> The problem... is when the capsule moves from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.<eos> There's no mathematical formula for that.<eos> Because we can calculate launch and landing... but without this conversion the capsule stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.
He appeals to your lust, your appetites.<eos> You're more than that.<eos> You're spirit and soul.<eos> You want her soul.<eos> I don't need it.
Surgery.<eos> You want us to remove...<eos> - And replace it with ...<eos> - Dr. Radcliffe needs assurance that your technology meets his standards.<eos> The only way to do this is to test it on a live human specimen.
Maybe someone should resurrect her.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> My dreams aren't like yours, Lydia.<eos> I'm not just a harbinger of death.<eos> I'm the cause of it.
How's she doing?<eos> She's in surgery again.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> Looking for Damian Darhk.<eos> There's a card that we haven't turned over yet, and we haven't turned it over, because when we do, he will know that you are working with us.
And lately, I can't seem to win for losing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When we got John's brother out of HIVE, I ran in to Damian Darhk.<eos> And he--he tried to use his creepy magic mojo on me, but...<eos> It was almost completely gone.
But no, you slunk away in the middle of night with your tail tucked between your legs... for him.<eos> It's called loyalty.<eos> Wouldn't expect you to understand the concept.<eos> Well, that died along with the seven billion.<eos> How are you supposed to save the future if you can't survive it?
In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope.<eos> Do you know why I stand guard, why I remain hidden in this place, while the others live in the light?<eos> Once, and only once, did all the gods work as one.<eos> We took all the evil in this world, and we hid it away in this box, Pandora.<eos> And the job of guarding it fell to me.
She's psychically linked to that thing.<eos> Got to find a way to shield it or...<eos> Let her go!<eos> No longer will I tolerate anyone's meddling!<eos> My power is my own, and no one will take it from me ever again.
Somehow it allowed them to enter the Catacombs.<eos> So, we need Betsy Ross's flag.<eos> Right, uh... last time I saw the flag, it was with<eos> Paul Revere. Now, Revere would have ensured that anything so vital was well-protected.<eos> He would not have allowed it out of his possession.
That would be me.<eos> # Sleepy Hollow 3x15 # Incommunicado Original Air Date on March 18, 2016<eos> So, service grate, windows, air ducts are all sealed off by this force field.<eos> Barrier of mystic energy.<eos> Nothing can penetrate it.
Ain't nothing gonna change.<eos> Children pick up their behavior from their parents.<eos> He don't look at you the same way no more.<eos> Blood stains everything.<eos> Can't get it out for nothing.
We're just discussing the Daniel Waldron shooting.<eos> Is there an undercover assignment?<eos> Look, can I just say, this feels like a long shot.<eos> Kate was kept out of the interview on purpose to give us this option.<eos> - We should use it.
All right? Nobody made you drop out.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> All right? I got you this job, man.<eos> Now you don't want it?
Where's my bracelet?<eos> Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call?<eos> I need that bracelet back.<eos> See, you're fine stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it.<eos> I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over,
That sounds unnecessarily mysterious.<eos> There were Shives all over the consulate last night.<eos> Reps from all the major U.S. syndicates.<eos> Armed to the teeth.<eos> So I hid the bracelet so if they got to me, they wouldn't be able to get to it.
Yeah. Wanna drive?<eos> Serious?<eos> Not gonna wreck it, Are you?<eos> Hell no, man.<eos> Beat the hell out of that bitch, But i ain't gonna wreck it.
That's a hypothesis, and a hypothesis isn't the same as reality.<eos> But even this hypothesis isn't so scandalous.<eos> I say: better to have a few that are reliable than to have a great many that are distractible and indifferent.<eos> The public squares have been jam-packed, but the hearts have been emptied of God.<eos> You can't measure love with numbers, you can only measure it in terms of intensity.
- All right? - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Good, I'll see you tonight.<eos> I feel like I've been through hell and back, but here I am, dragging a hunk of metal down the street like nothing's changed.<eos> I worked with this guy once who... He... he lost his leg in a drilling accident and, um, he suffered from, uh... From phantom, uh, limb syndrome.<eos> His... his mind was so used to, uh, you know, to the leg being there that it... It tricked him into thinking it was there even though it wasn't.
You do not eat?<eos> It is you who feed us.<eos> They do not dare take us anywhere by the main road.<eos> To hide like this must be a terrible burden.<eos> I was overwhelmed by the love I felt from these people. Even though their faces couldn't show it.
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Just stay a bit longer?<eos> Do you remember the Bible verse on John's headstone?<eos> "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
Hey, listen, I'm kind of tired. You know, I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm a little beat.<eos> So I'll see you tomorrow, okay?<eos> How's the hand doing?<eos> This is the only thing that makes it feel better.
Oh, ma'am, I...<eos> I don't know what exactly...<eos> Oh, don't play humble now, girl.<eos> You know your power and you know what you want.<eos> Don't be afraid of it.
I admire the impulse, but remember what George Orwell said.<eos> What was that?<eos> Precisely my point.<eos> This situation is bad enough.<eos> We don't need to make it worse.
They lived very simply, and they didn't run in our social circles.<eos> But they loved their art.<eos> They sunk every dollar they earned into it, and they had great taste.<eos> Their collection isn't in any of your catalogues.<eos> Very few people know it even exists... but I do because I helped them track a lot of it down.
We were soldiers.<eos> Two soldiers with the same goal... victory!<eos> I knew then I had to save this boy's country.<eos> We've got until September 10, 2100 hours to secure the chart.<eos> It's not in the armory nor the archives, not even the naval war room.
But thanks.<eos> Careful there.<eos> You got a lot of cream there.<eos> It can cause a lot of mucus.<eos> Oh, no. We're not drinkin' it.
She will continue onto the G7 Summit to assist Secretary Durant, as planned.<eos> She asked me to read the following statement.<eos> "It was a difficult decision for me not to return..." But I know my husband.<eos> If he were conscious... "...he'd tell me to press on..." ...that the best way to be at his side is to serve my country.<eos> "And I can serve it better in Germany than in a waiting room.
Kids, huh?<eos> It's there. It's-it's all there.<eos> It's in the bag. Yeah. I believe you.<eos> You don't need to do this, Malcolm.<eos> I know, but I was gonna shoot you at Palmetto, and now I feel like I've been given a second chance here, so I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it.
Just put a lid on it.<eos> Don't be too... you-ish.<eos> -Jewish?<eos> -You.<eos> No railing against country clubs, don't reference your manifesto, and for God's sakes don't talk about the BP oil spill and what it can do to a crab salad.
Big surprise.<eos> And our D.A. was in an unholy hurry, so instead of felony murder, she offered Emile 12 years in exchange for giving Daniel up as the shooter.<eos> To corroborate his testimony, she asked our new star witness to deliver the gun.<eos> Emile told us where it was.<eos> And you never found it.
Not a lot of help right now.<eos> So let's try to question Emile one more time.<eos> I don't have any leverage.<eos> Do I?<eos> We may not need it.
Which means he knew D.D.A. Gray's security routines.<eos> [Knock on door] But... If Hickman killed her, why perjure himself to get Price and risk turning the spotlight his way?<eos> [Door opens] I'm sorry, Captain.<eos> I wouldn't interrupt, but results came back on the heroin that killed Emile Fisher.<eos> It's 92% pure, and it's a positive match to the dope we found in Tamika Weaver's vehicle.
Like Jon Barnes?<eos> Uh... If we're getting into accusations of drug trafficking, we would want dual immunity from all federal charges.<eos> You have your story.<eos> What about the gun?<eos> Did Dennis ever go looking for it?
No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Keep me informed.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Even if I connect this phone to another dope case, I can't prove a specific person was using it.
Wu.<eos> Your body was unique already when you were born.<eos> Like you were born to practice Kung Fu of the Iron Kick.<eos> I will leave you the way of 108 kicks.<eos> Use it well.
- Oh, God, no.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I'm trying to tell you, you are not alone here.<eos> funny little irony they don't tell you, magic doesn't come from talent.<eos> It comes from pain.
- I lost it.<eos> - Guess I was wrong.<eos> - No, you're not, I--<eos> I need to read it.<eos> I just, I can't find it.
Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, you are not going limp on me here.<eos> This is game time, ladies.<eos> You got the ball, Kady.<eos> Don't drop it.
Yes.<eos> What is it, my dear?<eos> Do you think you can do the wrong things for the right reason?<eos> I used to have a scar on this ankle.<eos> This body doesn't have it.
If I can get close enough, I can memorize the settings, the markings on the machine,<eos> - how it operates.<eos> - So it's true.<eos> The Germans have an unbreakable code machine.<eos> And you're going to walk out with a chance to break it.
Where was it found?<eos> Down by the river.<eos> His mate took the trousers.<eos> Moncin could be telling us the truth, Chief.<eos> If he gave it away a week ago, he wasn't wearing it two nights ago.
What about this guy?<eos> No.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Look, our community is very small, very trustful.<eos> That man is not a part of it.
That looks like we coerced him into saying something.<eos> That ties us to his murder.<eos> Did you think about that?<eos> Give me the camera.<eos> We need to get rid of it right now.
You actually think they sent Burns the virus?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And we are gonna nail them, man.<eos> But we got to have more proof.<eos> The delivery notice doesn't say what was inside the package, but the CDC should have a copy of it.
That's his name and the time he made the call from his phone.<eos> Why should I risk everything I have for this?<eos> It won't bring them back.<eos> - Won't save any lives. - No, it won't.<eos> But our friends died searching for the truth, and you're just a few keystrokes away from finding it.
Thank you.<eos> Rich man or beggar, it does not discriminate.<eos> Death doesn't care about fleeing your demons,<eos> or making amends for them.<eos> It doesn't care about any of that.
I think you'll find that's a she.<eos> We'll be all right, won't we?<eos> I know what it is to live with grief.<eos> Through all the losses I've endured, I have had one comfort.<eos> I cling to it, sir, and so can you.
Um... I finished your book, and you could totally do that.<eos> I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.<eos> It was, uh...<eos> It was a page turner... A hot page turner.<eos> I'm happy you enjoyed it, but I'm starting to wonder if publishing it was a mistake.
Ms. Shannon?<eos> Rosie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Why are you burning this book?<eos> 'Cause I don't need it anymore.
There.<eos> It was just there, even then.<eos> On my very first night in the house.<eos> A death.<eos> But I cannot see it.
An obligation to be true to the subject.<eos> To Polly.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, I don't want to give it away.<eos> But, Mr. Waxcap, I... I'll never read it.
In my day, young ladies avoided the sun.<eos> Well, in my day, which is now, we don't.<eos> Book?<eos> Good girl.<eos> And don't just use it as a pillow.
- You take him.<eos> - Really?<eos> And your er... family will like him?<eos> Family... is like er good health.<eos> You miss it only when it is gone.
A little flavor might help.<eos> Annie.<eos> We'll get through this.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That this was just about that case or that she killed herself because of it.
There's a special school, called Brakebills.<eos> You heard of it? Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> I sort of checked myself in here to get away from magic, so...<eos> Look, you think magic is some terrible vice, so bad that you need rehab to get clean, it's not.
Oh, she will now.<eos> Wait, you're not really gonna have her come in for an interview, are you?<eos> Uh, hell yeah.<eos> This is the kind of moment you dream about your entire life.<eos> I'm gonna let her think she's got the job, and then I'm gonna yank it away.
If you think this is justice.<eos> It's our best option.<eos> If we could do something else, we would.<eos> Deal's still on the table.<eos> Don't need it.
I looked it over.<eos> I'll meet you outside.<eos> Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi and the girls if you're not interested.<eos> - Grandmother's jewelry? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> She'd turn over in her grave if I didn't at least offer it to you.
What happens if they disappear again and you never get the answers that you need?<eos> I know you, Shelby, and you will never stop wondering.<eos> When I lost my father, there was so much that was left unsaid.<eos> You have that chance.<eos> Use it.
The shots came near you at the time, though?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> There were shots all around.<eos> - A couple of students crept out the back door and made their way to him.<eos> A girl had taken off her slip and was using it to try to stanch the bleeding, but he was bleeding a lot.
Hopefully they'll kill themselves in the process.<eos> You know, the world would be a better place without these freaks.<eos> Correspondence with other major metropolitan centers seems to suggest that Los Angeles, the de facto home of Retro Girl, might be in for a rougher time tonight, and there's no guarantee that the trouble will end come morning.<eos> I see napkins, pens, fucking gum wrapper no gum.<eos> Yeah, you find gum in there, I'm not sure I'd chew it.
He's out on bail, but he's about to go to trial.<eos> Yeah, only if you still have the evidence against him.<eos> Do you?<eos> You gave Erik Lee the gun?<eos> Couldn't you have, I don't know, blurred it out of his pocket afterward or something?
An embarrassment to anybody who ever knew you, who ever cared about you.<eos> You've got the wrong guy.<eos> Tell me the target.<eos> Screw you!<eos> How can you even admit the truth when you won't even face it yourself?
What is the Book of the White?<eos> It's an ancient book of warlock magic containing spells more powerful than... most warlocks could ever imagine.<eos> I possessed the book when your mother came to me, and I used its contents to create the potion.<eos> Regrettably, I no longer have the book.<eos> I asked Jocelyn to hide it that Valentine might never find it.
Ugh, fine.<eos> I took the stupid thing.<eos> I was bored.<eos> It was there.<eos> Now it's gone.
I was bored.<eos> It was there.<eos> Now it's gone.<eos> Gone?<eos> What do you mean, it's gone?
It makes no odds where you were.<eos> You're a rich man, you can pay others to be... (FLOORBOARD CREAKS)<eos> Just a warped board, Inspector.<eos> When can I have that ledger back?<eos> When I've examined every last page of it.
Look, your cover's burnt, and your boss, Adrian Vescovi, says you need to come in.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> You had speeding tickets.<eos> You're an insomniac, and driving fast late at night helps you relax.<eos> I took a bet that once you had a badge, you'd just use it to get out of tickets.
- Get the hell out of here!<eos> Look, I-I know that you have a "no return" policy, but you have to take this dress back, okay?<eos> I look like a rich person in The Hunger Games.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I was gonna stop you from buying it, but I didn't, so we're done here.
I know.<eos> But you still have the gun, right?<eos> So, it's all gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Now, we get rid of it.
- Smoking gun?<eos> That's right.<eos> Which is me.<eos> Yeah. Sorry.<eos> All right, Dr. Williams, I need you to prop up the liver on sponges and hold it steady, I'll give me better access.
C.T.s and X-rays show that it's not located near any major vessels.<eos> Uh, so we're giving you a round of antibiotics for infection.<eos> Other than that, you'll be good to go.<eos> What... what about the bullet?<eos> Well, because of where it's settled, there's no medical reason to remove it.
Maybe they didn't leave a mark.<eos> Then what's the point of making a map?<eos> To drive whoever has the map crazy.<eos> No, they did this so they could go back and find whatever they took from the sack of Constantinople.<eos> I mean, you don't just make a map and imprint it on the side of seven keys for fun.
There's nine worlds. Ask me anything you like.<eos> So, why do I need a guardian angel?<eos> There are so many people that need a guardian angel more than I do.<eos> Well, and they all have them. You see, guardian angels are like herpes.<eos> Everyone has a version of it that they don't know about.
What we need is a bird's-eye view of the crime scene.<eos> Why?<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> Something I haven't seen in a very long time.<eos> I swear, if you don't stop with this cryptic shit, I'm gonna take that arm and beat you with the bloody end of it.
And in each instance it was either the son of a slain officer or someone close to his family, and the family made the request to you to unretire the shield number.<eos> So it's not policy but certainly tradition.<eos> Officer Carpenter was obviously not family, and her late father was not NYPD.<eos> Her request has no precedent.<eos> You are under no obligation to entertain it.
- Whoever it was might have coaxed Julia.<eos> Perhaps with lollies or toys?<eos> Well, that might explain the doll.<eos> This isn't hers?<eos> We'd never seen it before.
Bombay!<eos> To me it will always be Bombay!<eos> Not cool, man.<eos> Give me your vest.<eos> No, please, you can't take it.
- Excuse me?<eos> Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.<eos> We need to rehabilitate it.<eos> That means pro Bono, and you know it.<eos> One free case is not going to move the needle, no matter how worthy it is.
And no one is going to risk their career on a place that may not even exist in a month.<eos> They might, if you convince them to.<eos> - Louis, I can't do that.<eos> - Sheila, please.<eos> I came here once before, hoping for a second chance and you wouldn't give it to me.
- They took--<eos> Why couldn't you just wait for the verdict?<eos> Because I have to live with myself for the rest of my life.<eos> I made a decision, and I...<eos> I can't go back in time and change it.
What?<eos> I went to see the foreman.<eos> The verdict was gonna be not guilty.<eos> ♪ ♪ Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.<eos> I don't have it yet.
Where are you getting your intel?<eos> - A confidential source.<eos> - I see. So the DEA's supposed to hand over all our surveillance, but you get to play it close to the vest?<eos> Look, we could be allies or enemies.<eos> We're asking for help, not demanding it.
I'm feeling a bit tired.<eos> Have you seen Hotaru?<eos> No.<eos> She went out in her dress.<eos> I hope she doesn't get it dirty.
Go through some files? See if we missed anything?<eos> Asthma attack?<eos> A violent outburst?<eos> Something?<eos> There was no condition and it wasn't motivated.
It was folly.<eos> Their ambition exceeded their ability.<eos> They knew it was impossible.<eos> The cathedral is too grand, too glorious.<eos> But if they knew it could not be completed, why build it?
And what's she doing on his computer?<eos> I'm Detective Babineaux. This is Assistant ME Moore.<eos> Jordan never took back his key and I was just... Worried he forgot to do something else.<eos> Update his system software?<eos> I think he may have made another sex tape of us and never destroyed it.
- No.<eos> She was too fragile.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> Alright? I'm not going to back down.<eos> I want revenge too, but we're not going to do it like this.
I want out and I don't even have a credit card.<eos> Here.<eos> Use mine.<eos> Oh, wait, you maxed it out already.<eos> Ha ha ha. It's OK, I didn't need it anymore.
I know you don't like to put your name out there, so I did a little pushing.<eos> You don't want in?<eos> No, it's fine. Just check before you include me in something, okay?<eos> That book gets published over my dead body.<eos> You haven't even read it, Garrett. I read the coverage.
That ain't fair.<eos> You know what?<eos> This was just a courtesy.<eos> Everything in that book was accurate.<eos> I don't need your permission to publish it.
No, nothing like that.<eos> Well, then all this book says to me, then, is that you're like every other good cop I ever met.<eos> Yeah, but I'm not just any cop now.<eos> Look, Dad, you want an opinion, you should actually let us read the book.<eos> Oh, you two aren't reading it.
Dr. Eckland found me the blueprints.<eos> See they put the Time Machine and the Core at opposite ends so if one explodes, it won't destroy the other.<eos> And check this out.<eos> When the army build this place in the 1950s, they put this part over the underground river.<eos> We use it to cool the Core conduits.
I'll be right back!<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Your mother's death happened to you, Barry.<eos> It made who you are, but have you accepted it, really accepted losing her?<eos> Maybe that's why you couldn't come here... 'cause that would make it real.
I want to believe you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's not going to happen right away.<eos> I'm gonna make you a promise.<eos> I'm gonna hold on to it for you.
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you, Gilfoyle.<eos> There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.<eos> I can see by the sour, pinched expressions on all your faces that Richard has filled you in regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to relinquish my stake in your fair company.<eos> Erlich, uh, you should know that I have written a press release.<eos> - Oh? - I'm not going to release it yet, but if I hear wind of these rumors spreading out of control, I'm going to send it to every tech publication and blog on the face of the earth. Do you understand?
Yeah, I told her to give it to her Satanist friends out there.<eos> Looks like she did.<eos> She knows 400 Satanists in Boston?<eos> The Catholic church really did a number on that town.<eos> Hey, Erlich, remember when Gilfoyle said that my video chat app was a piece of shit and that nobody would ever use it?
This is about me. Being the Veep's Chief of Staff is not gonna be my legacy.<eos> That woman is my shot at the Oval.<eos> I cannot convince Susan Ross to do something she has no intention of doing.<eos> I think you can. I think you have certain gifts...<eos> Okay, I gave her that bracelet only after you said you didn't want it, so you can't use it against me.
But someday you'll understand that providing our family with a better life...<eos> Something I've never been able to do.<eos> ...is the most important thing in the world.<eos> We've been given a third ball.<eos> Let's not throw it away.
What happened?<eos> The temperature dropped faster than we could've anticipated.<eos> The poles are frozen and the connecting struts snapped.<eos> We can't put this antenna together.<eos> Can't you guys just hold it up?
They all hated you.<eos> I will not be wasting my time doing it again.<eos> I will pursue other avenues to hone my social skills.<eos> In social situations, there is a fine line between honesty and insult.<eos> Well, I-I don't see it.
I will pursue other avenues to hone my social skills.<eos> In social situations, there is a fine line between honesty and insult.<eos> Well, I-I don't see it.<eos> You're 100% wrong. Yes.<eos> Clearly you do not see it.
Is there another?<eos> We've watched you.<eos> We waited. Now we're here.<eos> You are in possession of an enormous power.<eos> We need it back.
Are we going steady now?<eos> Even better!<eos> Where is he?<eos> You are in possession... of an enormous power.<eos> We need it back!
Fingers crossed 'cause parking-lot pizza is so much better.<eos> It might still be in the box.<eos> This is insane!<eos> We are not having this conversation.<eos> What if it's not in the box, but still face-up?
Let us get our heads together and we'll get back to you.<eos> If you let the rocket launch, he's gonna detonate the bomb.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> You said yourself, there's no way to disarm it.
If you let the rocket launch, he's gonna detonate the bomb.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> You're not going to die.<eos> You said yourself, there's no way to disarm it.<eos> You're right, I can't disarm it.
You feel played.<eos> Don't you, sir?<eos> Look, we should be halfway to Havana by now.<eos> Why? She obviously doesn't want our help.<eos> Maybe or maybe not, but she needs it.
She was here, but she's gone.<eos> And, Jack...<eos> We've got blood.<eos> Not human blood.<eos> That's a relief, but there's a lot of it.
No, I'm serious, man.<eos> Change is coming.<eos> All the stuff we're doing to this damn planet.<eos> We're in the middle of some... evolutionary transition.<eos> And there's gonna be a revolution as a result of it.
Imagine that your decision here, in this case, could be subject to a suit.<eos> - It would be chaos.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Mrs. Florrick may like or dislike the way His Honor Schakowsky does his job.<eos> But she does not have the right to veto it.
Have a nice day, everyone.<eos> We're adjourned.<eos> Every attorney who comes to bond court has a learning curve, but Mrs. Florrick's curve wasn't about being a good advocate.<eos> - What do you mean? - Well, she knew her way around a courtroom.<eos> Judge Schakowsky liked to call her Marie Antoinette, but she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty or ask for help when she needed it.
She think I'm gonna get myself killed.<eos> You all right? Yeah.<eos> Ahh, thanks.<eos> Dude, we got ribs and, uh, two tubs of sauce 'cause you're not touching mine. Yes.<eos> Made them for dinner last night, but didn't get to eat it, what with the multiple kidnappings and all.
This one isn't.<eos> So the deceased was stood in a puddle - when he went to make his speech.<eos> - And the bride wasn't.<eos> But sir, have a look at this.<eos> The wire has been stripped bare, allowing it to make contact with the assembly and electrifying it.
I appreciate that.<eos> What's this?<eos> Uh, that's the sequel.<eos> You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?<eos> Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it; it's all yours.
And then you'll have the power to steal this brain and enact my time-travel spell... for you!<eos> And only you!<eos> Because that's what I would do.<eos> No.<eos> You want revenge and until you get it, you will never be satisfied.
Bled to death because I couldn't get the paramedics here in time.<eos> And now, two more of my guys are in the hospital in critical condition.<eos> I hope you can figure this out.<eos> You know, on jobs like this, something happens every day on these sites.<eos> I need to know that my guys can get help when they need it.
And we've just come back to 1969 when the critical events of the origin began.<eos> That machine over there is the first piece of the internet equipment ever installed.<eos> It's a mini computer, which we now call a packet switch.<eos> This is a... military hardened machine.<eos> You can't break it.
- Apparently not. - All right.<eos> Then who did attack her?<eos> How would I know?<eos> You seem to have taken Ferguson under your wing, as ill-advised as that may be.<eos> She needed protection and you obviously couldn't or wouldn't provide it.
She sent a message for you.<eos> "Pushpa..."<eos> "I hate tears!"<eos> "Beneath the feet is cold.." "..the earth which beckons us to sprint."<eos> "A lively fragrance in the chest of time, it leaves everything behind."
It is what was always intended.<eos> He's our brother and you tried to kill him.<eos> Musa kept the truth from you, but you remain his loyal soldier.<eos> Your experience with the humans is irreplaceable.<eos> You understand love, how to use it against them?
We can stop it.<eos> We're gonna stay here.<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> The scar is not from Bashir.<eos> I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.
She-she nursed me back to health.<eos> We f... we fell in love.<eos> And, eventually, we got married.<eos> That's a nice story, son.<eos> Having trouble buying it.
Coo.<eos> Coo."<eos> I'll pay you 100 bucks if you start cooing back.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I know this book is subtle, but I really think it will captivate people.
Well, I'm gonna go get settled.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I've very grateful to Random House, and especially my brilliant editor Pippa Daniels, for taking a chance on my book.<eos> I've been working on it for three years, so I'm really looking forward to getting it out there.

Of course he did.<eos> Hey, did you finish Colin's book?<eos> I was up half the night but only got through the first 700 pages.<eos> I mean, I know it could use some editing, but am I just being blinded by lust?<eos> Because I think it's pretty amazing.
He didn't do it, I can prove it.<eos> I can prove it, I can prove it.<eos> Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?<eos> You suffer from vasovagal syncope, don't you?<eos> And although you fantasize about blood, you simply can't stand the sight of it, can you?
That fucking bastard.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> It's a stunning and horrifically tragic end to a once-great Power who devoted his life to the preservation of law and order.<eos> Senator Bailey Brown, formerly the Cobalt Knight, was found murdered in his Los Angeles office early this morning.<eos> PTB and I will continue to follow this story wherever it leads, bringing you every twist and turn, lifting any rock we find to expose those responsible.
A thing?<eos> The Crown.<eos> That's what they've come to see. Not you.<eos> The minute you become yourself, you shatter the illusion, break the spell.<eos> What people want is someone to inhabit it. Not be frightened of it.
The minute you become yourself, you shatter the illusion, break the spell.<eos> What people want is someone to inhabit it. Not be frightened of it.<eos> Make it flesh and blood. Bring it to life.<eos> Your uncle, Edward VIII, threatened to do just that, impose his individuality on the institution.<eos> And he almost destroyed it in the process!
They weren't manufactured by accident.<eos> They were finely designed to veer off course when hit squarely.<eos> All right.<eos> So Lyon gives Benedict this special ball.<eos> He knows that every time he uses it he'll end up in the woods.
The fact is, we're grasping at straws here.<eos> I'm no military man, but I'm pretty good with facts, and the fact is, Hizb Al-Shahid set off a radiological weapon in the United States.<eos> They still have enough lethal nuclear material for three more bombs, which Jibral Disah won't hesitate to use against us.<eos> And as to his-his location, we know precisely... and again, I don't know the military parlance here... jack diddly squat.<eos> So even if this mechanic is a straw, I propose we grasp it with both damn hands before a bomb goes off in Times Square.
The Coronas are staying in Florence.<eos> The horses were still unbridled<eos> - in the stables when I came here.<eos> - Once the cordon is raised you will not be able to leave the city, Marco.<eos> The plague will be sick of me, not I of it.
The ship's well defended, but we can get aboard using the stolen bomber while the squadron is away.<eos> One team secures the hangar, the other storms the bridge.<eos> Then we jump out before they figure out what hit them.<eos> No. This monstrosity has rained destruction and death on the citizens of Ryloth.<eos> It is not enough that it simply disappears.
Did you figure it out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Think so.<eos> Python must have noticed this book in your office.<eos> He's using it to play mind games.
But how do the big dogs sleep at night?<eos> I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You're just standing too close to the Oval.<eos> You can feel the power, and you want it.
What do you say we go there together... Get this bride of yours squared away, huh?<eos> You have a gun.<eos> It's for my job.<eos> Yeah, but you have one.<eos> Yeah, and I try not to use it.
Thank you for bringing me Butch.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet him.<eos> I have a dress... a fancy one.<eos> M-maybe fancy's the wrong word.<eos> I haven't worn it in, like, eight years.
Regina! Oh, no. No, no.<eos> What happened?<eos> My wand.<eos> But how?<eos> Don't you keep it protected by magic?
The children are here.<eos> Chambers must have them.<eos> Nobody else is onboard?<eos> I'm piloting a new learning technique.<eos> Until I'm sure it's viable, the guest list for the station is very exclusive.
I'm so bored of this.<eos> Surely you cannot believe a senior member of the British Royal family would contemplate regicide?<eos> A harmless flirtation is what you called it.<eos> You have your freedom.<eos> Don't give it up for a man.
- Where is he?<eos> - I came to you. Now it's your turn to meet me halfway.<eos> Uh, the technology is...<eos> It's... complicated.<eos> I... I need to give it some context.
- Oh, I'll take that bet.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Just make sure there's blood.<eos> Lots of it.
I mean, honestly, I'm not sure, but who could be?<eos> We have to try.<eos> Why can you only admit how you feel when one of us is facing certain death?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess my armor's been on for such a long time that I... sometimes I forget I don't need it with you.
Don't make that mistake again.<eos> I just... I don't know how to say goodbye.<eos> Well, then don't.<eos> Just promise me one thing.<eos> If I helped take off that armor, don't... put it back on just because you're gonna lose me.
Dr. Hodgins, do you have the results from your swab of the lingual surfaces of the central incisors?<eos> Yes, I do, but I owe you an apology.<eos> I had no idea that that report card was Christine's.<eos> Does this mean you have completed your analysis of the ink?<eos> What? No. I-I didn't even start it.
- What attack would that be?<eos> Would you rather get ahead of it or find out after it happens?<eos> Business as usual, Steven, even with Thomas Shaw out there to expose it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When I draw a line, I don't redraw it.
Okay.<eos> I doubt she knows anything about the Stitchers program.<eos> I doubt she knows anything about quantum computation.<eos> I mastered the adiabatic model in fifth grade.<eos> If there's a pattern here, I don't see it.
Looks like you finished dinner.<eos> Do they really make love right after?<eos> Because I get a little bloaty after dinner.<eos> To true love.<eos> And all the different ways it grabs you.
- Good night. - Good night.<eos> Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.
Elizabeth, do you love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Love is a risk for anyone.<eos> But for you, knowing what love did to your mother, how could you not fear it?
Taking the air?<eos> God, you've always been an odd one, Peter Hare.<eos> I remember him in the schoolroom.<eos> Sharp as a knife, he was.<eos> I remember you saying that you hated this village and every soul in it.
You waited until now because you think the committee won't have time to stop you.<eos> I'm Chief of Surgery, Alex.<eos> There's not a chance in hell I'll approve this.<eos> I'm not asking for your approval.<eos> And as Chief Innovations Officer, I no longer need it.
They're from burst superficial blood vessels.<eos> Caused by someone suckling on his skin.<eos> So you're saying Reed had a hickey?<eos> Well, there are a variety of medical terms for it, but, uh, yes, a hickey.<eos> Based on color, I'd say it was inflicted within a few hours of his death.
What about the sawmill?<eos> Who told you about the sawmill?<eos> There was sawdust in the laces of those boots.<eos> A man called Riley has a sawmill in the Don Valley.<eos> He comes to us for extra labour when he needs it.
They will all die anyway in your master's infernal plan.<eos> We are not yet certain what will happen.<eos> I still hope...<eos> Again, hope.<eos> You are so filled with it.
So now you're angry with me? Because Art lied?<eos> I'm... I'm not angry with you, Virginia.<eos> Look, I'm sure you feel guilty enough without my piling on.<eos> Why would I feel guilty?<eos> You should have left that party as soon as you knew what it was.
- Now, that sounds like a gamble to me.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - You're not coming?<eos> - Consider this your first solo mission.<eos> Don't blow it.
- Like hell I will!<eos> - Wynonna, get the gun!<eos> - Wh-what? ! What gun?<eos> Where gun?<eos> Bossman said I'd never take it from you.
Get on the bike.<eos> Where to?<eos> We'll find Happy.<eos> But Guddu my truck is parked here. - What's going to happen to your truck?<eos> Come back for it later.
- What, what, what?<eos> - I put the ticket in the jean jacket and now the jacket's not here!<eos> The jacket's not here!<eos> The look on your faces right now is so great because what happened was I was going on my date with Conrad and I borrowed Sofia's jean jacket instead, and that's why I'm wearing it... a-right... a-now.<eos> I'm not wearing it, am I?
No, we don't.<eos> Hey, I know you don't want to but I really think we need to figure out what's going on with your magic.<eos> If you could learn to control it...<eos> But that's just it,<eos> I'll never be able to control it!
People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> - What? - Your wedding ring.<eos> They never gave it to me.
200 won't even do it, even if we each had the capital.<eos> Even then, I wouldn't attempt it.<eos> This mine has cost three lives.<eos> It was an ill-conceived venture from the start.<eos> It will never open again.
It's a failsafe.<eos> Unless she can override it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I can see the information, but I can't manipulate it.
Give me what I need.<eos> No murder charges, no consecutive sentences.<eos> We take the max on manslaughter and possession with intent to distribute, all served concurrently... nothing else.<eos> That depends on what her hypothetical statement sounds like.<eos> I-I never gave meth to anybody that didn't want it.
But just now the signal came up showing that an app had been deleted.<eos> I ran it through the recon program, reconstructed it.<eos> Turned out to be a dating app.<eos> Well, not so much dating as a "meet and let's have sex right away" app.<eos> Soon as you open it up, up comes photos of people in your area who're up for it.
He went to film a crime scene with Lieutenant Provenza.<eos> Something I can help you with?<eos> Well... Well, you probably have a lot going on right now, but I took the video from the ATM where Buzz's father and uncle were murdered, and I ran it through like six old VCRs from our communications department, and it's just...<eos> Ohhh. That's too bad.<eos> Yeah, but one of my professors says that it's just because the tape is dirty and that you guys have a process that you use to clean it all up.
And it looked just like that.<eos> But the Grail turned into Excalibur. That can't be it.<eos> No, the Grail was always silver, but... this looks kind of like it... it... its twin.<eos> And if the Grail really was the beginning of all magic...<eos> This might be the end of it.
we've ever encountered, so, if that's all you got, you should go... but I'm a father now, and if these bombs make it here and, God forbid, they, "rain fire on our cities and bring death to millions," I at least want to know that<eos> I did everything we could to stop it, even when it was hard and seemed hopeless.<eos> That's very moving, Jay.<eos> But I repeat:<eos> If Hizb Al-Shahid terrorists have a bomb, they'll want to use it, and that is an idea we can actually work with.
I think that until you can verify your whereabouts, you should probably come with us. Let's go.<eos> Who doesn't know their wallet was stolen?<eos> And then has it miraculously returned?<eos> The zombie girl's story sucks.<eos> It does, but we can't disprove it till we put her at the scene.
Okay. Rizzoli.<eos> What do you mean it's gone?<eos> I have no idea what happened.<eos> After you checked out the cutting board for trial prep last week, I put it right back where it belonged.<eos> And nobody's checked it out since?
Did I mention that I'm doing rounds at the clinic now?<eos> I'm gonna see three patients today.<eos> Okay. Good for you.<eos> What's the news?<eos> I don't want to spoil it.
Want to give it a try?<eos> I'm sorry, Mom, but that's not gonna make me feel better now.<eos> Why not?<eos> When we lived here, there wasn't any magic.<eos> We didn't even know it existed.
Rick, how's the Big Easy, brother?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> - I'm ready to get the fuck out of here.<eos> - They lowballing you already?<eos> No, the offer's solid, actually, but for a city full of soul, I ain't feeling it.
I must fire my rifle... true.<eos> We got him.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> My weapon?<eos> Back where it belongs.
A cricket?<eos> Eh... sorry.<eos> I didn't mean that like I was, like, anti... cricket.<eos> I just... I'm not really in the mood for therapy right now.<eos> And I've found, usually, that's when people need it the most.
Mirrors?<eos> That one seems to be an old wives' tale.<eos> We can see our reflections.<eos> And I'm obsessed with blood.<eos> I can't get enough of it.
Here.<eos> Drink it, all of it this time.<eos> And you, too, shall be free of my hold forever.<eos> But I've given you your freedom.<eos> I do not want it.
Mrs Turner. Roza. You look so smart.<eos> Once a secretary, always a secretary.<eos> 'Roza Mphaphane was appointed clinic administrator, which gave her 'dignity and purpose, and the hospital the chance to thrive.<eos> 'Clean water and renewed and increased funding from 'the mission made Hope Clinic viable again.<eos> 'It could at last look to the future with the woman who served it 'for so many years restored to her place as its beating heart.'
I mean, I feel horrible.<eos> I-I... I thought Susan just went back to Kansas.<eos> Bishop.<eos> You said Jennings had a life insurance policy?<eos> Get a copy of it.
Because she's crazy?<eos> She walks her cats.<eos> She said she saw two teenage girls hanging around outside my garage on the night my bikes were stolen.<eos> Or you left the garage door open again, like you always do.<eos> No. Mae-Yi has a very sweet, very gentle way of reminding me to keep it locked.
But there was this violinist playing on Kenyon so we sat in this stoop for a minute to listen...<eos> And I thought why ruin the moment.<eos> And when we finally got to your door I started to tell you about my job but you were distracted looking for your keys.<eos> I couldn't stop staring at that little cleft in your chin... thinking about how I wanted to trace it with my finger...<eos> 'So I never told you about the job' and I called them the next day and I told them that I didn't want it.
We have to.<eos> It's -- it's karma.<eos> You know, karma's been kicking us in the teeth lately.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So let's kick it back.
Tom, he could put you in front of a firing squad.<eos> There hasn't been a military execution in the U.S. since '61.<eos> Stop being cute.<eos> We're pawns in a bigger game.<eos> I don't know what it is yet, but I know this...
Nice to see you.<eos> The fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.<eos> Okay, let's make this quick.<eos> I need to work on my presentation.<eos> It's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled,
- Can they do this?<eos> - Of course.<eos> She pushed too far.<eos> Or they couldn't handle having a strong woman in power.<eos> Power only works if you know how to not abuse it.
Conviction Integrity Units don't usually investigate cases from the sitting D.A.'s tenure, let alone ones that D.A. personally prosecuted.<eos> Time for us to break out of the mold.<eos> It's our second case.<eos> And Wallace kind of gave you this job.<eos> Correction... he blackmailed me into it.
And what's the nitrogen oxide problem?<eos> The bomb used at the mosque was structurally identical to the one Landon described how to build in his blog, but the analysis of the debris post-explosion indicated a slightly different mixture of explosive chemicals.<eos> Doesn't that suggest Landon didn't build the bomb?<eos> Well, it's a possibility, but chemical reactions are unpredictable.<eos> The only way to know for sure what the exact residue of Landon's device would be is to test it in the real world.
Sharks piss through their skin.<eos> Tastes like bleach.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Maybe I missed your ugly face.<eos> Got used to seeing it the past couple years.
They're currently searching Flushing for IEDs, accompanied by a squadron of bomb-sniffing dogs. Beagles, apparently.<eos> They haven't found anything?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> That is disgusting.<eos> A 2011 study concluded that chewing gum for five minutes and then discharging it produced a 15 minute window of improved cognitive function.
But for it to work, the first thing you need to do, Captain, is allow that nuclear missile to launch.<eos> I'm sorry, Walter.<eos> I-I thought I just heard you say that we should let the missile launch.<eos> Yes!<eos> Now, the nuke travels so fast that within seconds, it'll be so far away from the sub that the sub's computer system will no longer control it.
No justice, no peace!<eos> We're in front of the courthouse as crowds await the verdict on Steven Benedict, the 45-year-old white male on trial for shooting an African-American man six months ago.<eos> This man is no "highway hero"!<eos> He is a "roadside racist"!<eos> We want justice, and we want it now!
And not because the guy that he shot was black, all right?<eos> You know that.<eos> I'm saying I... I understand that vulnerability.<eos> You know, when I had a stalker, I went out and I bought a gun.<eos> Yeah, but you never used it, Jordan.
Special agent Eliot Ness.<eos> This is my associate,<eos> - Bob De Niro.<eos> - Well, I've assembled the team your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.<eos> Well, hope they're ready for some action, 'cause they're gonna get it.
They wrestled it free.<eos> Does your story have a point?<eos> Yes.<eos> That without unity one cannot accomplish anything in life.<eos> As I got older, I realized it also meant something else, that scum never amount to anything without help, that the Solntsevskaya Bratva can pull at the turnip all they want, but they will never, ever, ever set it free.
Thanks, Sebastian.<eos> Brody and I will coordinate with Coast Guard, try and track down the boat.<eos> You two get with Greene's CO and learn things.<eos> 11 grids down, only three to go.<eos> What if we can't find it, Pride?
I'm losing a great deal of sleep over what I'm doing behind Frances' back.<eos> During wartime, public duty takes precedence over private loyalty. You wanted to take this on, remember?<eos> I'd no idea it would involve bringing known criminals into my friend's business.<eos> We have no interest in seeing the factory wrecked, Mrs Scotlock.<eos> Only using it to get at the Lyons.
What can I do?<eos> Mazie was supposed to be on a ship last night.<eos> I was able to convince the captain to give me until midnight tonight.<eos> But if she's not on the boat by then, they're gonna leave without her.<eos> Problem is I had to ditch the transport truck because I knew that HPD would be out looking for it.
'Cause it's a pattern I've seen before.<eos> It's a gag she used to name her operatives for her own amusement.<eos> She used for her amusement?<eos> We've dealt with this organization before, Watson.<eos> It was run by Moriarty.
But it's not too late to save it.<eos> You mean to barter for your life.<eos> No, no.<eos> My life is nothing.<eos> Giving a future to those who want to see it is everything.
You got a problem with my doctor?<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> The bullet... it's buried back near the C5 nerve root.<eos> You said you could get it out.<eos> And I can, but removing it is unlikely to improve the sensory and motor deficits to your arm, and, well... the surgery could actually make them worse.
Where's your wedding ring?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Um... I had it on when I got here.<eos> You didn't put it in your locker?<eos> No, I never take it off.
That's where you screwed up, talking.<eos> You either go get her and make this right for good, or you leave her the hell alone.<eos> You want to intimidate someone, Antonio, take it back to the 21st.<eos> If you're just giving advice, then I can tell you.<eos> I don't want it.
He moved to L.A., so we broke up.<eos> Hey, did you find something strong enough to lift your cube with?<eos> No, we're trying something else.<eos> What if you don't have to?<eos> I figured why go around the pipe if you could go through it?
Believe?<eos> In myself.<eos> You like school?<eos> I like learning things.<eos> Not real big on the other parts of it.
- Sold it.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> - With the trailer?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Don't need it anymore.
The report we read didn't mention anything about a propellant.<eos> Probably because it burned up in the explosion. Most do.<eos> But I now believe it was a chemical commonly used in pesticides called nitroguanidine.<eos> One of the characteristics of nitroguanidine is a tendency to corrode metal, as well as a very distinctive smell like latex paint.<eos> The condition of this belt buckle suggests that krasnov is responsible not only for planting the device, but for building it as well.
Yes, sir.<eos> And Mr. Reid... now that Mr. Shine's last actions have delivered him into your custody, does he speak?<eos> He does not.<eos> And never mind what Mr. Shine did to him, it's... it's as if the marrow has been sucked from his bones.<eos> Well, betrayal, he has suffered... a perception of it, at least. That is, perhaps, understandable.
Just... Just half the city.<eos> L.S. is a 46-year-old male raised by an abusive mother.<eos> He states that as a child he seemed to learn everything backward.<eos> He read not only individual words backward, but entire pages.<eos> When he was forced to read a book from the beginning, he has little sense of the story until he is able to read it again from the end.
There'll be no one left to finish the job,<eos> Jeremy will be free.<eos> You have a lot of faith in your former Alpha.<eos> I have a lot of faith in my Pack.<eos> What remains of it.
Torus executives...<eos> Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?<eos> Know thy enemy, my brother.<eos> Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus executives...<eos> Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?<eos> Know thy enemy, my brother.<eos> Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.<eos> Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?<eos> Know thy enemy, my brother.<eos> Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
- How often does it find a substandard piece'?<eos> It's rare, but it does happen.<eos> Occasionally, the weave isn't sufficiently dense or there's a slight stretching that weakens the panel.<eos> - And this finds those faults every time? - That's its job.<eos> Assuming it's properly calibrated.
You can't submit this to a publisher.<eos> But you just said it was in great shape.<eos> For a graduate thesis, not for a publisher.<eos> You only get one shot with someone like that.<eos> I just really don't think you should use it when the work isn't ready.
Listen, I have a little favor to ask you.<eos> Um, do you remember when you asked me to order in bulk for the restaurant?<eos> Well, I did, and there was a little mix up, and now I have a pig.<eos> Let me tell it.<eos> See, I can't take it to my apartment 'cause I can't let Sofia know what I did, so I gotta leave it here overnight.
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.<eos> Get him on the phone now.<eos> I already tried him.<eos> What happened, you forget your cane?<eos> I don't need it anymore.
Sorry, Agent, you surprised me.<eos> No worries.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> How you liking the new gig?<eos> I hate it.
I like your spirit.<eos> And your patellas aren't so bad either.<eos> So what are we gonna do about you trespassing and accosting my children?<eos> What are we gonna do about you destroying public education?<eos> We're not destroying it.
Really?<eos> 'Cause you can ask for anything.<eos> After tomorrow, you're not gonna be able to use the bride card anymore.<eos> You've got power.<eos> Wield it.
Yeah?<eos> Special Agent Grant MacLaren with the FBI.<eos> I came by earlier, left a card under your door.<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't, uh...<eos> I didn't see it.
We can't.<eos> We have to hit the monkey symbol from the other side.<eos> Oh! Oh, the one you broke.<eos> There must be another way out.<eos> If there is, I'm not seeing it.
I've just had an earful from my mum.<eos> And in case you didn't notice, the entire British press corps wants to paint me as a spineless fool for standing by my man.<eos> I understand that kind of devotion, and it's-it's hard to let go of.<eos> I've believed in the monarchy for as long as I can remember.<eos> It's been my life's honor to serve it.
My dear Elizabeth, this news has made me the happiest of men.<eos> 'So, what brings you to London?<eos> '<eos> A need to see justice done. My mine has begun to prosper.<eos> It was your loan which enabled me to keep it open till we struck tin.
Not ordinary! But, yes, imperfect.<eos> Human!<eos> Real!<eos> What that night with Elizabeth taught me... And God knows, there should have been other ways for me to come to my senses, but my arrogance... my... idiocy... has been spectacular.<eos> All I can say is... after that night... because of it... I came to see that if you take an idealised love... and bring it down to the level of an imperfect one... it isn't the imperfect one which suffers.
You're running out of time.<eos> Who's it gonna be?<eos> Joel?<eos> Where's your camera?<eos> It's usually attached to your hand.
Intel has confirmed that Mullah Abdul, commander of all Taliban forces in Helmand Province, is holed up in the village of Musa Qala.<eos> Here's his latest video, uploaded about a week ago.<eos> He beheaded several doctors from the U.N., two of which were American.<eos> 0600 tomorrow morning, first and second squads will surround the village.<eos> Once it's locked down, I'll go in with Captain Rahim to talk to the village elders, see if they'll hand over Abdul without a fight.
Every person plays their part.<eos> Joey's here ain't behind a gun.<eos> Hey, you forgot to secure your weapon.<eos> When are you leaving?<eos> We got shit to do, and you're not a part of it.
We need to talk about your bullet.<eos> Sergeant Major...<eos> I reckon the person with the rifle is gonna dictate this conversation.<eos> Where'd you find this?<eos> It was used to assassinate the Ukrainian president.
Winds at 9, 10 miles an hour.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding me. You're like 5 feet high.<eos> I mean, holy shit.<eos> I saw a guy fire your bullet. It didn't sail like that.<eos> Yeah, just 'cause he had my bullet doesn't mean he knew how to use it.
Yes, I did, Ed.<eos> And at the time you administered the treatment, were you aware that aladictin was in the trial stage, and not approved for use?<eos> Let me make this simple for all of us.<eos> I gave him the treatment,<eos> I knew it wasn't FDA approved... and...he died.
Right. Say, this, is the fabric of space-time.<eos> Now, if you get a powerful enough gravitational field, you could actually bend it back on itself, creating a kind of loop that would allow you to cross over to an earlier point.<eos> An... an earlier point in time, you mean?<eos> What he means is, Mr. Mason invented a time machine.<eos> And chose not to tell the government about it until it was stolen by terrorists.
Well, I'm... I'm not ready for that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just you are an intern, and you shouldn't be spending your time in a courtroom.<eos> You should be scrubbing in on surgeries. This job is hard enough.<eos> Just don't need to make it any harder.
You live here?<eos> Sorry if it's chilly.<eos> The heating's a little spotty.<eos> I bought the building in foreclosure.<eos> I moved in so I could oversee the remodel, but... but I never got it started.
The incident at the Perriman Grand?<eos> I was hired to investigate it... By the victim.<eos> Patrick Spring, the rich guy?<eos> Wait, he's the one who died at the hotel?<eos> That's right and he hired me, well above my normal rate, to investigate his own death a full six weeks before it even happened.
It's gonna be a good day, Sal.<eos> Your pep talk was deeply inspiring.<eos> Hi, Kareema.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Honestly, I don't know what's sadder: the utter meaninglessness of this job, or your attempts to imbue it with meaning.
Well... I got nowhere I need to be, I can tell you that much.<eos> I was 16.<eos> It was winter break.<eos> Um... my best friend, Ashley, was having a party, but... there was a snowstorm on the way.<eos> My parents were worried I'd get caught in it.
Um, well, I'm a big fan of yours, too.<eos> Although, I have to admit I've never actually used your app.<eos> - But your daughters have? - Yes.<eos> They have, and they love it.<eos> - They use it all the time.
I-I have a meeting.<eos> A meeting?<eos> I have a hearing today.<eos> Jeffrey's father wants custody.<eos> Oh. Why don't you just let him have it?
Shouldn't you be out screwing up somewhere?<eos> - That's funny.<eos> - Then what do you want with us?<eos> You possess the only communications grid in the country.<eos> Your government needs it.
He's coming here!<eos> He's gonna kill us all!<eos> I can't let him do that.<eos> Prepare for war.<eos> We are going to a planet, and we are going to kill EVERYONE on it.
I will.<eos> Please, Charlie, you can make them stop.<eos> I wasn't even hero enough to save one soul.<eos> This weapon... ..never to be used.<eos> This weapon of such destruction it is never to be used.
The dress you had made to celebrate the 25th year of father's rule.<eos> I have a hard time believing you've forgotten.<eos> You loved that dress.<eos> The last time I saw you wearing it was the night I was sent away from the palace the night father died.<eos> It's gone.
Take him away to await our verdict.<eos> His closing argument could've gone better.<eos> We need to go after him.<eos> He didn't want our help.<eos> That doesn't mean he doesn't need it now.
Every piece of hardware we've got is running into this junction box.<eos> It's too much.<eos> We don't have a choice Robert.<eos> We have one shot to deploy that dome.<eos> It doesn't go back in the box.
I spoke to Paul and he seemed, distant.<eos> He's just focused.<eos> I checked his ration allotment and he's hardly eating.<eos> He forgets sometimes.<eos> Look, he lives for his work and he can't do it.
It was me!<eos> It was me!<eos> I wrote the note!<eos> You did?<eos> Why didn't you sign it?
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I just thought maybe you could help me.<eos> My daughter told me to get this app called Snaptalk, but I can't find it anywhere.
What?<eos> It's Snapchat, not Snaptalk.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> That would explain it.<eos> And why can't I find it?
We will save $1.8 billion in fiscal year 1982.<eos> Luxury stores like Neiman Marcus predicts record sales.<eos> The number of Americans dipping under the poverty level has reached the highest rate in two decades.<eos> Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years, before we got here.<eos> It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.
So once you've been convicted of a crime, you are in essence a slave of the state.<eos> The stroke of a pen is not self-enforcing.<eos> And so, while the 13th Amendment is hailed as this great milestone for freedom, and abolitionists celebrate, and this is the end of a lifelong quest, the reality is much more problematic.<eos> Well, once that clause is inserted in there, it becomes a tool.<eos> It's there. It's embedded in the structure.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
I saw.<eos> You saw what you wanted to see.<eos> The truth is, you and I, we're not so different.<eos> We share the same home.<eos> We both want nothing more than to return to it.
Without them, we'd still be crawling in mud.<eos> And for your information, conselor... a year after this incident with this boy... Diane thanked me for my intervention.<eos> She realized she'd made a mistake and she thanked me.<eos> You see, Diane understood. She's been a contible for a gift she'd been given.<eos> And she didn't shy from it.
Listen to me.<eos> There's a girl in England.<eos> Nine years old.<eos> Laura Buxton, she's got a red balloon.<eos> She ties a note to it.
No.<eos> They're independent systems.<eos> Can we run a diagnostic from here?<eos> SHO: The transmitter has failed.<eos> But we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online. Then I have to walk.
'The other day, you didn't hear my voice, right?<eos> '<eos> 'No problem.<eos> You can hear it now.'<eos> 'And get used to it' 'because we'll be visiting often now.'
How did you get hurt?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Listen, you missed school again?<eos> There's a football match between our colony and Navjeevan Society.<eos> I'm going to practise for it.
- So maybe I wasn't...<eos> - No, you were right.<eos> And I, I needed to hear that.<eos> My flight wasn't cancelled.<eos> I just didn't get on it.
Can we get in a bit closer, see if there's any way to land?<eos> Not if you want this boat to stay in one piece.<eos> But if that jetty is the only place on Ternstone - where you can launch or land a boat...<eos> - Definitely is.<eos> .. then either she or the killer must've used it.
Give up and die? I can't wait another four years.<eos> It was supposed to be one week.<eos> - Poseidon has left us here to die.<eos> - We still got one card left to play.<eos> I didn't want to play it, but it's already in motion.
Listen, I got to go, man, before they find out I'm gone, but if you're alive... man, I hope you are... call me back on this number.<eos> Is everything okay, Officer?<eos> Shit. I forgot I was still holding it.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I, use it so much, it feels like it's a part of me.
Great, let's go.<eos> Whoa, slow down! Okay?<eos> You don't get to go out in the field until you complete your training.<eos> But I have more medals than anyone in my class.<eos> I did so well in the simulator, they had to write a new code for it.
No no no, listen, I want you to call me on it, so that the number comes up on my phone.<eos> Then I want you to delete the call record and... and put it back, okay?<eos> - Put it back?<eos> - Yeah. Listen.<eos> Listen, Callie, I want you to wipe your fingerprints off of it first, okay?
Kovar is inviting key members of the government-- politicians and military mostly-- to the opening of his casino.<eos> Then kill them with sarin gas, even the innocents?<eos> It's not good for business.<eos> Yes, but being in charge of whole country is good for business.<eos> We need to get into that casino, and we need to stop the attack before it happens.
No.<eos> I don't think that will work.<eos> You said the hatch was titanium, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hydrochloric acid will turn it into Swiss cheese.
The mind can do far more than recall memories.<eos> If one knows how, you can experience them, relive them as if they were happening for the first time.<eos> You're saying we were inside my mind?<eos> One is always inside their own mind.<eos> Pretending we are separate from it, that is the falsehood.
And that is the crux of the matter.<eos> The code is not a suggestion.<eos> It's an absolute.<eos> The code is what separates us from the monsters.<eos> It is the order by which we all live.
Do you think I should come round?<eos> You can't. She told me not to tell you.<eos> Why would someone do this, Dad?<eos> I'll keep her phone in an unsealed exhibit bag.<eos> If anyone wants access to it, they'll have to go through me.
So we take the Cuyahoga up and catch the train.<eos> What's the route to the river?<eos> You ain't traveled it.<eos> That stretch of woods is tough.<eos> Only use it when we ain't got another choice.
Howard saved me.<eos> I wish to God he never got on that airplane.<eos> He didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> - The plane... he never got on it.
He's right.<eos> We should be standing on it.<eos> Maybe we are.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Now all we have to do is get it.
Can I go now?<eos> What'd you do when the black SUV pulled away?<eos> I got outta there.<eos> And you didn't go and check out the RV?<eos> I didn't go anywhere near it.
May I see your license, insurance, and vehicle registration, please?<eos> You didn't roll through any stop signs.<eos> Uh, my license is in my wallet.<eos> And my registration and insurance is in the glove box.<eos> Is it okay if I reach for it?
Was that Huck's turn? Vanessa says Jake's been out every night since election night.<eos> If we can figure out where he was going, maybe we can start to try to put the pieces together.<eos> The day Jenny was killed, I picked up the signal of a satellite phone near her cabin.<eos> She's around here somewhere.<eos> She actually bought a satellite phone, and she's using it.
You and your friend Pillboi were trying to rob a restaurant.<eos> Pillboi!<eos> And then the cops showed up.<eos> So the plan was to pretend to install a safe with your friend hiding inside it.<eos> He pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it.
You already knew... about my entire player history.<eos> That wasn't a guess.<eos> Look...<eos> I need to win this thing.<eos> I put somebody on it early this morning.
To truly grasp the idea of time, we must take a step back and ask: what is light?<eos> So, journey with me to the Sun.<eos> Light travels from the Sun to the Earth through space, yes?<eos> When I was your age, I wanted to know... how can something... travel through nothing... space?<eos> Let us isolate a light beam and travel alongside it, but let us go faster.
Where's Liam?<eos> Join me on stage, little brother.<eos> Put 'em up, Sparrow.<eos> Be careful, I've got the longer reach.<eos> Thank you again for coming, and please enjoy the palace. And everything it has to offer.
Mmm... 'kay. If memory serves, we were talking about reinstating the GED program.<eos> The issue being the presence of an existing education initiative.<eos> They called it education so they don't have to pay the inmates.<eos> When I brought it to MCC, it was an education program.<eos> They turned it into a chain gang.
I just fucking found you.<eos> Hey, Anna.<eos> Uh, have you had the chance to look over the handbook?<eos> You have any questions?<eos> Uh, you know, no, I haven't opened it yet. Wow.
I have befouled the Wellspring.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.<eos> And it's a stinker.<eos> I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.
Range Rovers and Aston Martins.<eos> They buy those things cos they didn't know that you could do this.<eos> - I like my car.<eos> - It's shit.<eos> They're flocking to it, aren't they?
I've never encountered anything this buried.<eos> You're telling me that every Truman Protocol file has been redacted?<eos> No...<eos> I'm telling you that there are no files.<eos> That whatever the Truman protocol was, somebody has worked very hard to have it completely erased.
Fortune Cookie, down!<eos> Beirut, y'all. Beirut.<eos> As my Aunt Jeanette used to say:<eos> "This nursing home is a waiting room of hell."<eos> And these two old bats are straight out of it.
It never hurts to remind them.<eos> I want you to wear this for luck.<eos> Ooh, your sister is on to something.<eos> Ever since the Christmas address, that watch has been more famous than you are.<eos> You should reach for it when you speak.
You just have to try, you just have to cut people open.<eos> Resecting the tumor load out of your heart will help your symptoms and buy you time.<eos> Yeah, this tumor, it's just, uh... it's part of me.<eos> It's like my hair or my boobs or my weird-looking toes.<eos> I made room for it.
Well, we can't talk to the hostage takers, but she can.<eos> I see.<eos> And you're happy with this plan?<eos> Well, Bill Winks has a matter of hours until he bleeds to death, and there's a bunch of innocent people locked inside with a known hostage-executing psychopath.<eos> I mean, given that it's a plan that we have right now, I'd say, yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
Every supernatural encounter we've had leads back to Dreyfuss.<eos> The Lincoln Memorial.<eos> Dreyfuss Enterprises had a contract to restore the statue before Lincoln's head went missing.<eos> The Dyer House.<eos> Dreyfuss had applied for permits to drain the swamplands around it.
Who is shooting those at us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Whoa.<eos> We must be right on top of the Talisman piece.<eos> I'm guessing something doesn't want us to get it.
Maybe we don't need to defeat the Sphinx to get what we need.<eos> All right, you... now, you said these lead to a tunnel system?<eos> Like, similar to the one back home in D.C.?<eos> Yes, Master Wells.<eos> And if this piece of the Talisman resides in a crypt beneath the street, perhaps we can access it from below.
Man, Crane can really pack that Szechuan chicken away.<eos> Guess Chinese takeout was far and few between in the 18th century.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Molly left her backpack here.<eos> I moved it, and this fell out.
You tried to usurp me as the Horseman of War.<eos> Now that I have what is rightfully mine,<eos> I will be free of you.<eos> I brought you into this world, Henry.<eos> I will free you from it.
- I fixed an essay writing contest so Hank would win.<eos> I should've told you earlier.<eos> I had to meet him.<eos> - Well, our guidance system failed to power back up.<eos> - Can we enter the atmosphere without it?
Hoboken, New Jersey?<eos> Nothing ever starts in Hoboken, New Jersey.<eos> Well, on August 19th, some time before dawn, this happened.<eos> Industrial park burned to the ground.<eos> No one could explain what caused the fire, or why it left one single building standing untouched with a perfect circle of burn around it.
Okay. Have you seen Soledad?<eos> Is it true she-she wants to leave me and stay in the U.S.?<eos> She doesn't know what she wants right now.<eos> I know that you are disappointed that she's having second thoughts about the wedding, but I am certain... that she has not changed her mind about the peace treaty.<eos> Peace can hold if you both are still committed to signing it.
I went to the same place.<eos> How bad?<eos> There's four injured, and this guy, Evan Wheeler.<eos> She's lucky she got out of the car.<eos> She's lucky she never got in it.
You won't do a damn thing.<eos> I'm not your enemy!<eos> I'm from the same place you are!<eos> I have a ship!<eos> I can take you to it!
I think my time here may be coming to an end.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think mine might be nearly done, too.<eos> I spent years... hoping to make a man pay for the pain he caused, never once considering that he might have felt pain himself and learned from it.
Ambulance is coming.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> You got to trust me.<eos> Eric, yeah, I got a cell phone.<eos> I need you to get everything you can off it.
But before you start, am I mistaken, or is Mr. Grayson your superior?<eos> Yes, I'm sorry, but...<eos> Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir, are somehow involved with the death of Zoe Barnes.<eos> And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone that was given to Ms. Barnes.<eos> It called only one number, and that number was yours.
And like I told the blonde here, this isn't Kiki, this is Wagon.<eos> - What?<eos> - Damn, Wagon. Can you believe this place?<eos> Look at the size of that ottoman!<eos> You still have the box it came in?
We're in Harley's truck, Liv squeezes in our headlights, frothing at the mouth.<eos> He wants our brains, man!<eos> I yell, "Go! Go!<eos> Go!"<eos> Harley guns it in reverse.
That's not even a math symbol.<eos> That's just Charlie Brown's hair.<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> This club was so great.<eos> How could they turn it into a bookstore?
- what's the Doc-ism?<eos> Fool's errand?<eos> - No, just the opposite.<eos> This demon was brought forth from a vessel.<eos> Should it return, it could be contained, kept alive.
Carl, I'm in the only safe place left here now.<eos> Got Sabatino!<eos> He's still alive.<eos> I got his cell phone.<eos> I need you to get everything you can off it.
Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?<eos> Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind, I'd still like to pause for effect.<eos> Now...<eos> You've recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?<eos> Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you're forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.
There's no reason to believe they know anything about our business or the shipment Manuel sent us.<eos> You want to take that risk?<eos> We have no choice.<eos> That shipment is our last chance to rebuild the business.<eos> Without it, we're as good as dead.
The only way to do that is to help legitimize families like this.<eos> Give them a second chance.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> He's changed. And so have I.<eos> I don't want anything to do with that world, or anyone in it.
Well, it's because you've made it time and again.<eos> It's who you are.<eos> You're the woman who shot your father to save your mother.<eos> You're the woman who chased a terrorist to stop a nuclear bomb.<eos> You're the woman who raced into a crisis instead of away from it.
Uh, east on 33.<eos> I sent a team out already.<eos> All right, we're heading that way.<eos> And Patterson, try to turn that phone on remotely.<eos> It's Tasha's only lifeline.
How's this place for a picnic?<eos> Okay, let's see what we have here.<eos> Hey, this isn't what I packed.<eos> This basket is filled with toys and treats.<eos> Melissa, did you empty this basket and fill it with toys and treats for Jasper?
We struck out I.D.'ing the guy at the mosque.<eos> No hit on facial rec, and his prints aren't in any system.<eos> What about the military?<eos> Not according to our database.<eos> The way this guy evaded us, it's clear to me he's had training, but since he's not in the system, that means he's been scrubbed from it; he's a ghost.
It would be almost impossible to find a juror in the entire state who had never heard of him.<eos> Indeed, yes. Even I have heard of him.<eos> Meaning recent coverage is unlikely to have altered anyone's opinion of him.<eos> If cases are to be thrown out on the basis that social media creates unfair trials, well, then nothing would ever be tried in court again.<eos> My instructions to the jury will be to take into account only evidence presented in court, not hearsay outside of it.
The doctor is pretty and smart.<eos> Please, I beg of you.<eos> What's with the politeness?<eos> Look, mister.<eos> Lucid dreaming is your dream, which means you can easily get out of it.
Golden Glove National Tournament gets you no ranking points. It gets you no international competition. Gets you nothing.<eos> But there's... It holds weight. It holds weight in the world with people.<eos> They like Golden Glove champions.<eos> This tournament, it's a big deal.<eos> I'm gonna be takin' it very seriously.
Key of Solomon.<eos> You finished all of these?<eos> Yup.<eos> Come with me.<eos> This section is for masters only... But at my discretion, others may use it.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.<eos> Goddammit.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> I know I owe you a call.<eos> Who the fuck buys a house, and cuts the entire crime scene out of it?
Because for all your talk... and all your millions of beautiful words... you haven't the slightest idea of what it means to be alive... to look into another person's eyes and ache for him.<eos> I hope someday you will.<eos> And then maybe all your words will be worth five of Scott's.<eos> Max thinks he created me. You know that?<eos> He thinks he found this ugly lump of Carolina clay... and molded it into me.
The good Lord wants us to spend Sunday mornings at Cracker Barrel.<eos> I'm with the Lord.<eos> How come Lauren doesn't have to jog?<eos> 'Cause Lauren doesn't have to lose weight.<eos> First step in solving a problem is recognizing it, buddy.
It would take someone with serious reach to locate that kind of untraceable device.<eos> You're gonna help me get some hard evidence on him.<eos> Pope ain't gonna stop shooting at your ass, so we the only choice you got.<eos> You set up his computer, right?<eos> So, can you get us into it?
- Superstitions are a holdover from primitive humans finding simple reasons for things they don't understand.<eos> - Verifiably a complete waste of mental capacity in this day and age.<eos> I'm just saying, in a deterministic event, such as hitting a baseball, there actually is a strict relation between cause and effect.<eos> Now, superstition, it's bringing a... A probabilistic framework and projecting meaning onto a completely random sequence.<eos> See, we can deduce from that, that the lucky helmet was probably not the factor in Coma's ability to get a hit because he was just able to do so without it.
They deny the Virgin Birth.<eos> They attack the Holy Family.<eos> Think then of the peril should your children be exposed to their heresy.<eos> These are grave and bitter evils.<eos> Anyone who does not confess that the world and all things in it are created for the glory of God,
I don't watch you 24 hours a day.<eos> So then, go sleep in the car, please.<eos> Do us all a favor.<eos> The car is a fucking petri dish.<eos> I'm not gonna ride in it.
But we isn't got nothing of any firearms on this truck, other than a busted old shotgun.<eos> Oh, what's it for?<eos> Propping open the air vent.<eos> What if you get in a jam?<eos> Bust out my old trusty crowbar and back it up with one of these guns.
Right now, this is what they need.<eos> ...found guilty of these and countless other crimes for which the sentence... is death.<eos> Any news from London?<eos> The trial is set to begin sometime next week.<eos> The spectacle around it is said to be so great, the king himself receives daily updates.
We got each other, that's all that matters.<eos> How, if you ain't got the backbone to work?<eos> How did you buy the pram?<eos> Don't matter. You pawned it, didn't ya? Your docker's hook.<eos> How are you going to get work without it?
He offers you the world and gives you Chrisp Street.<eos> I mean to say, he tried, but you can't run a shop on good intentions, can you?<eos> Don't he know this shop's the only thing you've got?<eos> It's not all I have, Mrs Cadman. But it is mine.<eos> And I would like you to leave it.
Adam!<eos> Smiths!<eos> It was hard to believe that these were the same brave Highland warriors who had beaten the British army at Prestonpans and Falkirk, who had marched triumphantly into England.<eos> Five months of retreat with not enough food and brutal weather had left them broken and demoralized.<eos> Our worst nightmare was coming true, and I felt completely helpless in the face of it.
Are you pregnant?<eos> Of course not.<eos> And we're not that old.<eos> Would you not like it?<eos> - Not really. I got it for my purposes.
The mind can do far more than recall memories.<eos> If one knows how, you can experience them, relive them as if they were happening for the first time.<eos> You're saying we were inside my mind?<eos> One is always inside their own mind.<eos> Pretending we are separate from it, that is the falsehood.
Believe me.<eos> Okay, what have you got?<eos> Okay, so check it, boss.<eos> I got a search warrant for Rhonda's personal computer. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I remotely accessed it, and it's got mostly personal stuff on it except for one large protected file, heavily encrypted.
You expressed your concern to me that to truly partner with your captain, you would need to join him down a dark path.<eos> And that you fear it... it might lead you to a place you would not be able to return from.<eos> You're concerned about me.<eos> The alliance between your crew and my people is critical.<eos> Without it, we are all nowhere.
We can't find a single connection to Bode.<eos> I did request an expedited subpoena for her cell phone records,<eos> - but that's still gonna take a few days.<eos> - You still got the phone?<eos> - Well, yeah, I mean, what's left of it.
Turns out we were only half right.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Well, we need to talk to this guy.<eos> Well, I doubt he's coming back to his room.<eos> I did retrieve some personal items from it, though, that might help us track him down.
So, I'm supposed to just take your word for it now?<eos> Take whatever word you want, son.<eos> Mine, your wife's.<eos> Rickey Suggs was a seam-busting shitbag.<eos> The world's a better place without him in it.
You say you had to move, son, you had to move.<eos> Just so happens I have the client right here.<eos> I'll pass on the good news.<eos> How's it feel?<eos> Like the world's a better place without him in it.
Give what back?<eos> What's the trouble here?<eos> This reprobate stole my leg!<eos> What would I want with a piece of rotten wood?<eos> Use it for a club? Make a fire? Stick it in your fecking' eye?
I'm gonna call Elliot.<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> How are you gonna know that Sara's not following you?<eos> I programed a drone to fly over my car.<eos> And I attached a camera to it so we'll see if anybody's behind us.
It's artificial.<eos> You used to squeeze your own juice, I remember that.<eos> I'm back.<eos> Isn't that orange juice great?<eos> They put fake pulp in it, you know, so it's exactly like the real thing.
Hey, boys!<eos> Be careful!<eos> My dad fell off that bridge!<eos> Yeah, he fell off!<eos> He jumped off of it, but...
Aah!<eos> Aah!<eos> Such a beautiful poem.<eos> I remember it well.<eos> Though, as you can see, I can make the dagger do its work without it.
I came out here to try to listen to what you wanna say, but if all you're gonna do is scream--<eos> Let's go! Let's go!<eos> There has been an attempted assassination of the president.<eos> President Frank Underwood has been shot.<eos> It occurred about ten minutes ago during a campaign event at Hammond University in Washington, D.C.
It's beautiful.<eos> There's blood, but the trail disappears.<eos> The tracks are covered.<eos> We crossed a dry riverbed just west of here.<eos> They might follow it.
Would you like to join her?<eos> You two... brother and sister... stand at the threshold of a new age.<eos> So take my advice... love each other or die.<eos> Forgive me, sister.<eos> I, as much as anyone, put you in this grave, and now I must drag you from it.
Oliver queen with your political legerdemain.<eos> Until we take him out of the game completely, you mean.<eos> Oh, you're not reconsidering the plan?<eos> Malcolm merlyn reached out, gave me an early birthday present.<eos> It would be a shame not to make use of it.
No, Andy.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> - There's a piece missing.<eos> - What?<eos> We separated a piece of it and put it in another location.
Yeah. Well, that, and this is always what it looks like on Homeland right before there's a drone strike.<eos> Oh, my, you both look so elegant.<eos> Thanks, I did a little shopping today.<eos> Not me. Mine is actually an Aladdin costume from last Halloween.<eos> I never travel without it.
I say we take the next.<eos> We got to finish this thing.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> My compass, it's broken.<eos> I cannot locate the ley lines without it.
She's bipolar, manic-depressive.<eos> Was she abusive to Joey?<eos> No, but her shrink said that her condition could lead to violence, so the judge gave me sole custody.<eos> Do you think Joey's with her?<eos> No, I-I went over there, which was a mistake because now she's losing her mind... what's left of it.
I'm gonna punch that son of a bitch right back into a coma.<eos> Oh, come on. No.<eos> No. Anything back on the 999 key?<eos> I'm sorry, Chloe.<eos> They couldn't get any prints off of it.
-(scoffs) -(giggles)<eos> Hank is strong.<eos> J'onn j'onzz is even stronger.<eos> Did you get any intel on max?<eos> I did, but I had to eat slugs to get it.
-Peppermint?<eos> -Guess again.<eos> -Come on, what's the secret?<eos> I don't clean the shaker when I make a drink.<eos> Puts a nice stank on it.
-I'll go make sure he's OK.<eos> - For right now, you just stay here.<eos> - Oh! Can I say that I'm concerned about the "stay here" part?<eos> I hate to ask, but if you're going, could you please get my wallet?<eos> I ran out without it.
But the ones we tried to bring back on our own, they were reborn dead.<eos> Albert has the precursor.<eos> I could bring him back.<eos> I hadn't perfected the process yet, so I aborted him, but you're attempting regeneration without the precursor.<eos> You can't restore life without it.
We don't have electricity.<eos> - Why not? - Why?<eos> Well, because we try to live a simple life.<eos> And we do have a stationary phone.<eos> You can use it all you want, so no need to worry.
Oh, you'll be back later?<eos> Well, I... I need to be with my wife.<eos> She's just a few blocks away.<eos> Listen, the only way to find a treatment or a vaccine is to use the virus.<eos> And since it's too dangerous to transport the virus out of the quarantine zone, I'm the only doctor who has access to it, and I can't do any more testing without more rats.
Five.<eos> Twenty-five.<eos> Thousand.<eos> Okay. Just fix the shower.<eos> It needs to be in the center of the ceiling and water needs to come out of it.
The Titans need my help.<eos> I'm going to hell.<eos> Oh, I don't feel so good.<eos> The crystal can only be touched by me.<eos> He may have escaped it, but he can't destroy it.
Thank you, Governor.<eos> Everyone has a flaw, and this is Conway's.<eos> I spoke with the president, and I said that I'm willing to assist in any way if it would be helpful.<eos> He aches for the spotlight.<eos> He feels almost invisible without it.
I wish I had better news, but things are bad here for Miranda.<eos> Everything she's touched is radioactive, including you two going undercover as twins.<eos> And you're not in trouble, but this experiment of hers may soon be coming to an end.<eos> But this project is important.<eos> How can the FBI just give it up?
Yeah, I got it, all right.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Actually, it's from a case Tess and I worked on.<eos> The last one I did as a detective. And?<eos> And without it, the DA can't prosecute the perp that we busted with it.
"And the moon gave everything a magical glow as if they were dancing on the Milky Way."<eos> - Mommy.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You have a voice.<eos> So use it.
You can't take NZT anymore.<eos> That's okay.<eos> But my days here are numbered.<eos> I don't know exactly how long the booster shot's gonna last.<eos> Well, Naz isn't gonna risk you taking a pill without it.
Your words are most inspirational.<eos> Regrettably they will not bring back our murdered president.<eos> We have nothing further to discuss.<eos> General, Mr. President.<eos> While we have no wish for further conflict, we are prepared for it if necessary.
He looks fucking dead.<eos> And then you bring him to my stand?<eos> You've no idea where the car... Came from?<eos> - No.<eos> Kids got it before I put it on the lot.
Then we better come up with something, and we better come up with it fast.<eos> I'm not in the habit of removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.<eos> And I'm not in the habit of having an accomplice be the attorney on a case.<eos> I'm entitled to representation.<eos> And you had it last night.
Damn it, woman.<eos> Why does it always have to be like this with you?<eos> I came here for peace.<eos> Peace is boring.<eos> Not if I have to put a hole in your head to get it.
They're gonna let me off?<eos> It'll have more effect in the sentencing phase.<eos> They're gonna convict me.<eos> You committed involuntary manslaughter.<eos> But there are clear, mitigating circumstances that could reduce your sentence, maybe remove it.
Alexandra Parrish, my name is Matthew Keyes.<eos> It is my belief, as it is many others who work for me, that the FBI treated you terribly.<eos> They didn't trust you, they certainly didn't help you, and then they hung you out to dry.<eos> But I know that you love this country.<eos> And although you can't do very much for it right now, I know you wish you could.
Instead of focusing the temporal stream, it dispersed it.<eos> Without the lens array to focus the accelerator beam, the machine is going to continue to bleed splinter radiation throughout the facility.<eos> The machine is locked into random sequences.<eos> The mainframe's Core is frozen.<eos> I can't access it from here.
_<eos> Come on, let's shop.<eos> - Mmm. - I'll tell you right here, right now, the way to make a perfect martini.<eos> Gin over rocks in a shaker.<eos> Come up real close to it and whisper vermouth.
You're a lie, Charlie.<eos> This pain?<eos> The pain of your loss...<eos> I long for it.<eos> Revisit it.
How's it going in here?<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> This is Lillian Forrester. Mr. President.<eos> It is such an honor. Let's hope you feel that way after these three days.<eos> Sir, we were just going over some ground rules for Lillian's article, should we decide it's a go.
We'll see you next time, okay?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> You take care, have a great weekend, what's left of it.
That's awful.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.<eos> Uh, why... why would you sue us?<eos> I never gave permission for the school to use it to put on that play.
There's more.<eos> - Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.
Ain't she a beaut?<eos> Is that for you and Gabi tonight?<eos> Oh, this tent?<eos> Oh, ah... it's not just for me and Gabi.<eos> Anyone can use it, really.
Now, if we're gonna help you, we need to know what you remember from last night.<eos> I already told you, I don't remember much.<eos> We should also be concerned about what the guy on the recording knows.<eos> Like... like how I dropped my keys.<eos> Well, you two were both outside, so maybe they hacked into satellite imagery, or had access to it, or know someone who has access to it.
Why didn't you just turn Bardot over to I.A.?<eos> Malone: I couldn't!<eos> Not after what he found!<eos> Your office computer.<eos> He found something when he hacked into it.
What if I could talk to someone about this?<eos> Maybe he's right.<eos> Maybe it could help.<eos> Finally unburden me from...<eos> You tell him anything, and I will personally find the tallest building in the city and swan dive off of it.
Why?<eos> What have they done?<eos> (Has someone been having sex... in my computer?<eos> ) No employees?<eos> - No-one else has access to it.
So, Victoria...<eos> Normally, it is the man who must declare his love, but, in your case, you will have to overcome your maidenly modesty and propose to Albert.<eos> I'm sorry, Uncle, but Albert and I are not suited.<eos> He has no manners.<eos> Yesterday, he was playing my keyboard as if he owned it.
I had to get him back.<eos> - This, it's...<eos> - I know.<eos> But the chip, that's what this is all about.<eos> Rose took Mateo to get it.
Silverton lives!<eos> Oh, you guys are doing that book thing, right?<eos> - Well, I don't know if this helps at all, but I was just talking to the engineer.<eos> It turns out he can't leave the controls because of what's called a dead man's switch.<eos> If he takes his foot off of it, the whole train stops.
It's Mardi Gras.<eos> My police escort needs a police escort to help me get Corporal Alex to the morgue.<eos> But, while I wait, you see this swelling and rigidity around the eyes?<eos> Could be a reaction to the drug he was given.<eos> We find out what kind of drug, and we figure out who had access to it.
I tell you, I did nothing.<eos> I am victim here. Really?<eos> You're the victim?<eos> All right. Then do you want to explain this little, uh, blackmail video that you made?<eos> See the stills that we pulled off it?
You know what, I'm gonna call the DA tomorrow and ask her legal advice.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just loved that idea.<eos> And I was gonna go back to it.
That's what you get for being better at school.<eos> When you're done with the dishes, mop the floor, Paige.<eos> Ha ha. Probably Stan.<eos> Uh, tell him there's no leftovers.<eos> Henry, if that plate is not clear by morning, you're eating off of it for breakfast!
I wrote half of them.<eos> You and Captain Grant were having an affair.<eos> Not technically.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means we never acted on it.
She drowned herself at her parents' house 3 weeks ago.<eos> Roughly around the time the first victim would have gone missing.<eos> She drowned herself in the worst way I can imagine.<eos> Her parents had a pool with a retractable tarp.<eos> She held down the remote and she covered herself under it.
I'm shutting the project down.<eos> No.<eos> We launched already.<eos> That was a huge mistake.<eos> No, building Afterlife and not using it, that would be the mistake.
Julio's actions had context, And it all started with that disgusting thumb.<eos> Because it upset him?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Morales was able to rehydrate enough of that thumb To get partials off it.
- Thanks.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Oh, thank you, Maura.<eos> - When ... When's the exam?<eos> Uh, next month. It's a 7 1/2 hour test, and Max and I have been cramming for it.
Probably with the same gun.<eos> So Michael and Edward were both targets.<eos> Well, Edward was just a little luckier than Michael.<eos> Well, get the buckshot down to the crime lab.<eos> Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it
Whatever it takes to get this done.<eos> You sure you can do this?<eos> I have to.<eos> That language is from my past.<eos> It has no place here.
- I know, I'm really charming.<eos> - Okay, tell us.<eos> There's something very weird here.<eos> The transformer's been magnetized.<eos> All this stuff is stuck to it.
I have no clue.<eos> He had no I.D. on him, his prints aren't in the system. and facial rec's drawing a blank.<eos> Everything associated with Antiqam Industries has been bogus.<eos> Okay, so what about his cell phone?<eos> You think you can crack it?
Get the handcuff keys.<eos> Alpha-stabilizer's damaged.<eos> Suit's not gonna work.<eos> They took my amulet.<eos> And without it, I'm guessing you're just...
Saving history can be extremely wearing on the body.<eos> I'm thinking this amulet dates back to Late Antiquity and is Judeo-Christian in origin.<eos> Great.<eos> Is... is that great?<eos> Well, I can't find a reference of it anywhere.
Let's go for a run.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> The suit's tracker must be malfunctioning.<eos> It says he's appearing and reappearing all over the city at once, and that's impossible.
Watch the lines.<eos> Wait.<eos> Did you say he needs a bypass? Yes, ma'am.<eos> We got your husband's rhythm back, but he's still not out of the woods.<eos> We need to find the blockage that caused his heart attack and most likely, we will graft new vessels on around it.
And completely miserable.<eos> I-If I still feared your father, yeah.<eos> Your name is on the poster. We announced you.<eos> Check out this house that's for sale.<eos> I drive by it every day on my way to the office.
Can Olivia and I go now?<eos> Soon.<eos> We still need your help in our investigation, um, answering some background questions.<eos> Okay.<eos> [Walt] When we found you in your car last night, um, you remembered getting into it but nothing after that?
There's something wrong with my eyes.<eos> I'm seeing double.<eos> The Flash hit me too hard!<eos> I'm gonna sue you, saucer-head!<eos> One day, I'll own that helmet, and I'll use it as an ashtray or a candy dish.
Quite impressed, really.<eos> Yeah, I just saw it. I'm already working on a trace.<eos> "Judgment Day"?<eos> Oh. People should really be careful how they use that phrase.<eos> It isn't actually due for another couple of years.
Too much.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When I lost my dad, I got messed up.<eos> I numbed the pain.<eos> It feels like an escape. But trust me, the pain will always find you, and the longer you put it off, the harder it beats you up.
Mass is a friend.<eos> Without it, you will remember everything that you did.<eos> I ain't having this Mass shit. No more.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... Maybe you should see what life would be like without it.
He is not the only one beaten down by this system, Nachiket.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> We are waiting for the train.<eos> It will arrive in five minutes.<eos> Be sure to board it.
Just go. Just do your thing, get out of here.<eos> - Come on, son...<eos> - I said don't call me "son."<eos> I-I look at that little girl, I would do anything for her.<eos> You understand? Y-You show me a train, I'll jump in front of it for her, no question.
Trap bit him. Maybe a little bit of situational awareness might save you some pain next time, you damn hippie.<eos> Okay. Incoming.<eos> Trauma 2. My name is Derrick, and it's nothing like the pain those animals feel, you fascist!<eos> Hey, Mac! Last time I saw you, you were laying down fire in Afghanistan.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were running from it.
MacGYVER: How do you bypass a handprint scanner?<eos> There's the easy way, and then there's my way.<eos> Easy is leveraging the host to cooperate.<eos> That could get messy.<eos> My way, fooling the scanner into thinking I'm the last person who used it.
- What happened?<eos> ! - You tell us.<eos> It is a prison.<eos> The whole meteor field.<eos> Every rock has the consciousness of a prisoner bound to it.
Someone must've stolen it.<eos> And you didn't notice, didn't report it?<eos> I keep it parked in a crappy lot.<eos> On the West side.<eos> I barely use it in the city.
Takin' pictures, little lady?<eos> The fire will purify my body and vanquish the fear in my heart.<eos> I've been imbued... with the power of the blood moon!<eos> The land shall be consecrated with blood, and purifed with flames!<eos> This house and everything in it will be consumed by fire!
If you're here, come in and eat.<eos> This meat stew...<eos> It's made at one factory and delivered over the province.<eos> It's quite the delicacy.<eos> Would you believe that I visit funerals to taste it?
Additionally, according to the news, a warehouse fire broke out near the Oak Island Rail Yard shortly after my departure from the scene.<eos> The good news is, solving these murders may help unravel several other criminal enterprises.<eos> In addition to yielding a source of poisoned heroin, it would expose what is left of Rey Torres' smuggling network and reveal his killers, who I'm sure are quite heinous in their own right.<eos> So heinous that you would have this Halcon guy kill them?<eos> Yeah. Well, we'll blow up that bridge when we come to it.
And I was just about to say you sure have a funny way of showing it.<eos> I sense your disrespectful tone is meant to goad me into asking,<eos> "What do you mean by that?"<eos> Our server.<eos> Well, it was hacked.
Father, you can't.<eos> I know the casualties will be high, but that may be necessary.<eos> You can't really believe that.<eos> Did you listen to nothing that I've said?<eos> Of course I did, but you can't build a better world if there's nothing left of it.
You know this bridge?<eos> A famous bridge?<eos> -That's a squirrel bridge?<eos> -Yeah, it's a squirrel bridge.<eos> Anyway, how many squirrels do you think have used it?
Exactly.<eos> Samanthia bombed that dumb thing, never got a medal, and now she's lost her appetite for soosh!<eos> That's what he's mad at?<eos> My version of the demathlon is way less rigorous than the South Korean teacher I copied it from.<eos> Either bring the phone over here where we can hear it, or stop talking to it.
I would ask that you hurry.<eos> Landlord says he hasn't seen Mr. Beale in a couple days.<eos> You recall that the back door of Arrondissement 21 was a grotesque shade of burgundy?<eos> Tip of this crowbar is covered in flecks of burgundy paint.<eos> Perhaps it's the tool used to break into the restaurant so that Mr. Beale could envenomate the foie gras.
It's still yours.<eos> Even if you're not driving it.<eos> And that person is a thief.<eos> Okay, true.<eos> But if I saw your pickup and the garden hose lying next to it and I got inspired to build my own fire truck, and then drove around town putting out fires, now what do you call me?
You're lucky to be alive.<eos> I don't feel lucky.<eos> He got the gun.<eos> Yeah, but he didn't get the suit.<eos> And he can't leave without it.
- If?<eos> you agree to sell the rights to your Nap Sacks.<eos> Evidently, Web videos of your protest went virulent.<eos> Cory Casey noticed your sack.<eos> He wants to get his hands on it.
Now, Edwyn handled a life-or-death circumstance without breaking a sweat.<eos> That's also what makes him a scratch golfer.<eos> So... we know he can do that.<eos> He's more than just ego.<eos> He has a mind, and it's brilliant.
How do you do things here?<eos> I was told to be here early this morning.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Didn't I tell you to get rid of that report quickly?<eos> Why is it still causing problems?
That man right there, that's Marcel Corre.<eos> He's a passionate photographer who vows to secretly document a life-or-death escape attempt.<eos> How he actually filmed inside the POW camp without the guards ever seeing the camera is incredibly brave and somewhat genius.<eos> He grabs a large dictionary.<eos> He cuts out all the pages to fashion it into a camera case and then he cuts a hole in the back of the dictionary for the lens to come through.
- For the Alliance!<eos> WARCRAFT<eos> You will travel far, my little Go'el.<eos> My world maybe lost, but this is your world now.<eos> Take what you need from it.
We can't, nudge.<eos> As much as we try, we can't.<eos> We can't risk the exposure.<eos> Max only cares about herself.<eos> She has her own plan, and I'm tired of sticking to it.
So, Hank, how tall are you?<eos> About the same as my mother.<eos> Six feet, six-one, thereabout.<eos> Is that with or without the hat?<eos> Because I don't think I've ever seen you without it.
- And why don't we learn this in school?<eos> - Good question.<eos> Because there was one thing that Beneš didn't think through:<eos> The successful-ness of the myth that he helped to create this way.<eos> The myth about the impossibility of self-defence is so popular in this society that we used it whenever we collectively cocked something up.
I know people don't want to hear that.<eos> I mean, they can't believe that a parent would actually hurt a child.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> The court system, I mean, it just makes things so much worse for the children.<eos> We're taught to believe that the system will actually help the child, that it'll do the right thing, but it doesn't always.
It'll keep till morning.<eos> The condemned men had one last drink before they died.<eos> A drink.<eos> A bloody good drink.<eos> Nothing else for it.
Patrick, I'm getting hot under the collar.<eos> We can begin on the second floor on Monday morning.<eos> - What about the attic?<eos> - Attic is just filled with junk.<eos> We'll get to it sometime.
- What's that for?<eos> - Not to shake as brutal.<eos> Guys, I think that this whole do-it-yourself exorcism guide is a joke.<eos> We have to try.<eos> You'll never pull it off.
How is this a good idea?<eos> Move or sink, kid.<eos> You were actually prepared for that?<eos> - My hat.<eos> - Leave it. No, no, no. I can't go without it.
The big difference, when he grows up...<eos> In fact, if we wanted to wait until the year 2001, is that he will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, but at least a console through which he can talk to his friendly local computer<eos> and get all the information he needs for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theater reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in a complex modern society.<eos> This will be in a compact form in his own house.<eos> He'll have a television screen, like these here, and a keyboard, and he'll talk to the computer, and get information from it.
I didn't think you'd...<eos> Come on, Max. Of course, I would remember.<eos> I have really good memory. It's not just the Adderall.<eos> Hey, do you want anything?<eos> I'm gonna go get a popcorn and then we can dump MM'S into it.
I warned you.<eos> You know who I used to be.<eos> You like to win.<eos> You're gonna be very disappointed.<eos> There's a car outside, I suggest you get in it.
No wonder they've been chasing you.<eos> Not "they," "he."<eos> Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.<eos> That is why rock was so important.<eos> Without it, he was alonely... and would someday be extinctly... which made Gorg cranky and irrational... and physically violent.
Hey, Richie, don't worry about it.<eos> I got something for you, top secret.<eos> Imagine this.<eos> A small, little rectangle.<eos> You hold it up to your ear, you speak into it... somebody in a distant land with the exact same thing can hear it.
- Mm. Let's all take our seats.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Smells delicious, Dad.<eos> - Let's join paws for a sec here.<eos> We are grateful today to Mother Nature and Mother Nurture for the abundant food on this table and the not entirely unattractive family around it.
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them.<eos> And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...<eos> The most versatile substance on the planet, and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Give me a few weeks to grow him stronger.<eos> When we come here I will set him free.<eos> I promise.<eos> As the old saying goes<eos> "it's easier to climb on the tiger's back than to get off it".
We'll get her back.<eos> I need a car.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Your boy Dayton's about to let that girl die.<eos> The house has a basement or cellar or something to it... it's obviously well hidden and he wouldn't listen to me.
Wait right here.<eos> Hong-y"!<eos> Sul-rang's sword...<eos> I haven't seen it in years.<eos> Take your filthy hands off it!
All right, man.<eos> You're gonna miss all the action.<eos> I'm telling you, Osama Bin Laden had this dog. Right?<eos> Best friend in the entire fucking world.<eos> And our military was able to go in, kidnap the dog, bring it back to the US, teach the motherfucker how to speak English, and that's how they found out where Osama Bin Laden was hiding.
I've been fired<eos> Security threw me out.<eos> So I sit at home all day I wake up at nights, anxious, in a sweat<eos> I had my appendix operated<eos> It's been leaking ever since
Hang in there.<eos> I'm listening to you, Carlos.<eos> I'm going to place a new deposit with our most trusted clients.<eos> The money will go into an account that I'll manage from here.<eos> I can transfer the money into it.
Okay.<eos> I'm getting the check.<eos> And I'm getting my coat.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> I've never actually used it.
All I know how to do is to get by.<eos> Someday, if I discover my purpose,<eos> I'll feel I'm beginning to live.<eos> When life has meaning, you can bear almost anything.<eos> Without it, nothing is bearable.
That's quite an honor.<eos> I don't understand, why me?<eos> Because I've no wife or kids?<eos> This independence movement against Japan<eos> I've been riled up about it for 3-4 years.
Spit it out!<eos> Spit it out!<eos> I said spit it out!<eos> Camel, return my diary!<eos> Give it back, you won't be able to digest it!
Give the men a little more space to breathe.<eos> You want the vanguard to quarter in the captain's cabin?<eos> I'm not a tyrant, Mr. Dufresne.<eos> The ship belongs to all of us.<eos> This seems a way to ensure that we all benefit from it equally.
I shouldn't be entertaining you in my vest.<eos> We've all got our vests on in Nonnatus.<eos> Some of us are wearing two.<eos> The boiler broken?<eos> Yes, because no-one's come to see to it for days.
With pleasure.<eos> Excuse me. Does that pay phone work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not very private, though, is it?<eos> Not many people use it.
Just as I was getting some responsibility, right...<eos> - Hey, Jonah.<eos> - Hey. Teddy sends a message.<eos> - No, don't you dare touch my balls -(LAUGHING)<eos> A joke's not a joke unless everyone can laugh at it.
- We lost the forestay.<eos> Lost it? Fuck you mean, we lost it?<eos> Sabotage.<eos> We must have missed someone.<eos> Can we sail without it?
Didn't occur to you maybe that's in poor taste?<eos> The shirt?<eos> Yeah, no, it did.<eos> It was terrible... but that first park was legit.<eos> I have a lot of respect for it.
- No, of course. I mean, of course I would help you design it.<eos> Not, "Of course I think it's lame."<eos> - Okay-<eos> You know, I was thinking about getting it just, urn just here.<eos> - Yes... good spot for it.
That's a good point.<eos> Maybe he turned his back.<eos> Someone appears out of the blue, and drops something in his drink?<eos> Well, aren't those take-out juices covered with a straw?<eos> Or someone could have gone to Pascal's and gotten a juice, and put the poison in it and switched it with the judge's.
"Morningstar?"<eos> "Oh, dear. "We live at the Morningstar.<eos> "That's so posh and hibbley-fibbley-gibbley."<eos> The world needs apartment buildings.<eos> The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.
The snake won't mind Just do it<eos> Go ahead, bro... lick My dear wife!<eos> Goddamn green frog! Tell me Where are the Vethala hills?<eos> Why is he pointing this side?<eos> (scream) The wonder drug is in this Where is he running off to without taking it?
I can't believe he shot me.<eos> There's blood and everything!<eos> The names.<eos> I left my laptop.<eos> Deleted everything from it.
I mean, it's Daedalus!<eos> Fate?<eos> No.<eos> Impossible.<eos> But if the ring is in the forest of Troezen, you must take me to it right away.
- What's the big deal if she is a lesbian?<eos> Okay, the big deal is it wasn't her decision to tell the world.<eos> I wasn't the only one on that group thread.<eos> And I did delete that video.<eos> After I sent it to P.J. Girl-On-Girl is his demographic.
You cost dozens of good, honest people their jobs.<eos> You sent my SVP of Sales, my friend John Bosworth, to prison, and for what?<eos> A doorstop of a computer with a fancy screen and no legacy.<eos> Some folks say this sale's a success.<eos> I think my father would've called it cutting the nuts off of a bull and turning it into a steer.
Take 'em!<eos> There's a reason that Michelle came back.<eos> There's a reason.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Son. - She...<eos> She brought your car back, so you can get in it and drive away!
I don't know where. - What?<eos> Well, why would she do that?<eos> - Don't know. She gave me something.<eos> Audrey, it's her ring.<eos> She wouldn't go anywhere without it, right?
No next time.<eos> No, your da's not going anywhere.<eos> Good shot!<eos> It's like something out of a dream, Sal.<eos> The way the light bounces off it, it's changing all the time.
You know, I could be there for them, but I'm not.<eos> You know, because I'm here.<eos> Because I'm told that staying here, you know, that's something I could do for those kids you know, in a big way, you know, in a real way someday.<eos> So I'm here.<eos> But if I go back to the house? Well, then, I'm in it, you know, and I can't get back out of it.
You're no match for her with a sword!<eos> I've wounded her before.<eos> Had I known who you were then, I never would have let you go.<eos> Where is the ring of the Magi?<eos> I'll take you to it if you spare our lives.
- Not recently.<eos> I thought perhaps it might be in your chambers.<eos> Don't you know where you last had it?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I've grown so used to having it there, I...
We're going to have a family ourselves.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> They'll be able to play together.<eos> That's why we did the garden.<eos> Billy can use it whenever he wants.
Now, who was next?<eos> Uh, let's see here.<eos> Well, how about this young woman right here?<eos> Now, I'll give you my microphone, but only if you promise to give it back.<eos> He seemed to want to hang onto it for a while. - There you are.
Okay, can we go over this one more time?<eos> Yeah, you put the glasses on, fall asleep, and start dreaming.<eos> Not that hard.<eos> Yeah, except I'm pretty sure I die in this dream.<eos> If I go back into it, am I gonna die in real life?
"I know your dad will be sorry for hitting you.<eos> You can talk to me any time."<eos> What evidence do you have to prove that Mr Miller was using his phone at the time the calls and messages were sent?<eos> They were sent from his private number.<eos> Someone else could have picked up the phone and used it.
- What?<eos> - She meant rooster.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> This cock has been in my family for over 100 years.<eos> I need to find a special place to stick it.
You're hilarious.<eos> Found the bullet press in the garage, along with red automotive paint and spray gear.<eos> The getaway car was red.<eos> And there was a burner cell that was in the trash.<eos> It was smashed, but maybe digital forensics might find data.
We were working with the Mexican police, trying to do something about the cartels.<eos> Tough work.<eos> It was war.<eos> The Zeta cartel would send their men out dressed like soldiers.<eos> They would wait for a bus to come through, stop it, force all the passengers off, and shoot them.
I'm not here to tap dance.<eos> I'm not saying you are, but...<eos> 'Cause then the commissioner would have two of you instead of one of you and one of me.<eos> There's a learning curve, Sid.<eos> And I'm on it.
Good God!<eos> What is that on the lawn?<eos> That. Worried about that.<eos> There's a giant schmeckle out there.<eos> Hey, so that I can tell Carlos, are you guys gonna want the saddle or you wanna ride it bareback?
She needs her rest.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah, well, why don't we all just take a bloody holiday, eh?<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Oh, I forgot... Angels, they can't read sarcasm.<eos> I can read it, I just don't have patience for it.
Not about the biopsy... the surgery.<eos> Removing the tumor? I might not want to do that.<eos> I understand how scary this must seem to you, believe me.<eos> But it's a very small mass.<eos> It's accessible.
Do you really think the cops are gonna connect your call to a pharmacist with a drug heist in the parking lot - of a freaking diner?<eos> - We had a plan.<eos> Doctors have plans, and nurses do what works.<eos> And that just worked.<eos> Do you want to track down the van, break back into it, and return these meds, or can we just deliver them and be done with it?
Of course it could work.<eos> They plan to target your reactor, trigger a blast that will level this entire facility.<eos> It's a Mark Four fusion reactor.<eos> Standard equipment for a mining community... about fifty years ago.<eos> Nowadays, we can hardly find spare parts to keep it running.
Oh. No. Sweetie, no.<eos> No, no. She's living in mine.<eos> But I really feel for her.<eos> Look, anyway, the point is, there's always gonna be a shadow.<eos> So it's up to you to step out of it.
All right. What it is... she comes to me, your girl. Different name.<eos> She's got these uncut diamonds.<eos> Blue-ribbon merchandise, worth a lot of money, but difficult to shift, unless you've got the right connections, which I've got... she doesn't.<eos> We agree a 70/30 split.<eos> She doesn't like it, but she needs the money sharpish.
Our defender of Long Island?<eos> Being held at an outpost near New Haven.<eos> He's been found guilty of wartime atrocities. - Atrocities?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> They said that he murdered their commander, wrote a note in his blood, and pinned his tongue to it.
We know you let Carl into Boyd's room, so you know where Markham's got Ava Crowder.<eos> You are gonna tell us where he is and you ain't gonna tip him off.<eos> If you do, we will come back here and we will bring a jackhammer.<eos> If he's at the Bennett shed, it means Loretta's either partnered up with him, or...<eos> Let's cross that bridge when we come to it.
Your team has specialized expert hackers.<eos> None of them would allow him to do this.<eos> Scorpion does nothing but help people.<eos> Miss Dineen, we don't grab children randomly off the street.<eos> Either he knew where the secret map was and how to access it, or had something to do with the design of this game.
I said: I'll make you work, but you can't.<eos> Went to see a movie yesterday.<eos> The one with that Jandino.<eos> Boy-oh-boy.<eos> Well... I'm afraid that's not going to be it either.
Even you, Gretchen.<eos> 'Cause I know there's still hope, no matter how brainwashed you are.<eos> I'm proud to be brainwashed.<eos> I've got a clean brain.<eos> You could eat off it.
If she's as important as you say, they'll put her on the first lifeboat.<eos> Uh, yeah, I suppose that's true, but it's so risky.<eos> Not with my man on that ship.<eos> Special operator first class.<eos> That ship goes down, he'll find a way off it.
I don't want him to see any of this.<eos> Please take him in the house.<eos> Did I do it? Did I do it?<eos> I was in the office closing up, and this car comes careening in.<eos> Annika gets out of it.
You trust him more than you trust me.<eos> Instead of believing in me you're putting faith in a man you hardly know who's a little too cozy with the enemy if you ask me.<eos> I hate to say it, but the man has a point.<eos> Without that key it doesn't matter if we're ahead of schedule or behind.<eos> If Tonkin can't get it, what benefit is it to the mission?
Nobody cares about your schnauzer.<eos> Flearoy?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> I'm trying to track down the artist who painted the original painting.<eos> If we figure out where the painting came from, we might be able to find out who had access to it.
I bet he wanted Daniel to turn himself in.<eos> Well, that didn't work out as planned.<eos> Panic button.<eos> You can hear that all the way down the hall.<eos> Well, it only works if you can get to it.
Well, for most parents, I think there's a significant degree of denial that has to be overcome, as well as the guilt about having your child be such a person.<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> "Fire is alive.<eos> I love to watch it breathe, jump around, dance.<eos> It consumes everything that falls into it, that I put into it.
I can't find Gia and Sarah anywhere.<eos> Hold on. Slow down.<eos> Okay, I need to tell you something.<eos> I just found Gia's cell phone upstairs.<eos> She never goes anywhere without it.
She's releasing it tomorrow.<eos> Well, then, we'd better get hacking.<eos> If your computer system's been compromised, it's likely to be a cyber attack.<eos> We'll send over a task force.<eos> The computer in question is air-gapped, which means it's untouched by the Internet and therefore unhackable.
I'll get into it.<eos> Still waiting to hear back from Canoglu about our offer for the laptop.<eos> Give them whatever they want.<eos> Oh, trust me.<eos> I'm not leaving here without it.
It has the same routine day in and day out... to grow, to spread out, to take up space.<eos> That's it.<eos> At this point, our baby tumor is so enmeshed, so invasive, it's touching virtually every single brain structure.<eos> It's pushed existing tissue aside, shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself.<eos> How do you remove it without destroying the brain around it? How do you kill the baby without killing the mother?
Her husband bought the gun that was used to kill Henry Wilseck and Freddy Duncan.<eos> That's not in question.<eos> Now, neither is the fact that it was used to fire a bullet through her window the other night.<eos> Now, the gun hasn't turned up. Doesn't mean it won't.<eos> Even without it, I like our chances.
- He has her?<eos> He has Nancy?<eos> Please, too little, too late.<eos> Max, we're in $10,000 worth of debt and you spent money on new kitty litter?<eos> Relax, I'm going to pee in it, too.
Until then,<eos> Young Bruce has become fond of you.<eos> His trust will be crucial when the time comes. I need you to ensure that no one else is whispering in his ear until I make my offer.<eos> See this finger?<eos> I've got little Bruce wrapped tight around it.
He killed my mother, Jim.<eos> You have the Wayne boy?<eos> Not yet. There are some practical matters that have to be resolved first.<eos> See this finger?<eos> I've got little Bruce wrapped tight around it.
[clapping] - Wow, that presentation was terrific.<eos> So fun to watch.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - See, the problem is the product.<eos> I just don't see any need for it at all.
But this was a high-pressure situation, and you rose to the occasion.<eos> You may have saved lives tonight.<eos> The squad is my family, and I'll always protect my family.<eos> Except for Zeke. That deadbeat giant can fend for himself.<eos> There's a Lieutenant's exam coming up, and I think you should take it.
I thought we'd lost you, thought you'd forgotten these were only memories.<eos> Sometimes I do forget.<eos> You have to come back with me.<eos> Your body is dying.<eos> Your mind's gone, and without it...
Because you don't think you could be held accountable if you don't know what's happening, right?<eos> I'm sure the details will appear in your report.<eos> Oh, you're goddamn right about that!<eos> You wanna hear about my day, boss?<eos> It started out when we abducted Sammy O'Malley at gunpoint from his residence. Paul...
It has the same routine day in and day out... to grow, to spread out, to take up space.<eos> That's it.<eos> At this point, our baby tumor is so enmeshed, so invasive, it's touching virtually every single brain structure.<eos> It's pushed existing tissue aside, shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself.<eos> How do you remove it without destroying the brain around it? How do you kill the baby without killing the mother?
With hidden conditions, it seems.<eos> Oh, so suddenly you owe me nothing?<eos> What about the temple?<eos> The building which, until this Jesus appeared, was the center of your universe?<eos> Do you feel nothing for it?
And on national TV.<eos> Shit, shocked the hell out of me.<eos> Talking about his dad like that took some balls.<eos> Textbook Ricky.<eos> Digs himself a hole and then he charms his way out of it.
Really?<eos> I wanted to go to Disney World, but my dad said maybe next time.<eos> But we went swimming one day, and there was a window under water.<eos> In the pool.<eos> I wanted to go to it, but my dad said I couldn't because it was a bar.
Mm-hmm. That's good.<eos> Um, this isn't mine.<eos> I just found it in my coat. Oh.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure how it got there.<eos> Uh, well, maybe someone thought your coat was their coat and put it in.
Exactly. But we know that it isn't 315, don't we, because we demonstrated this in Australia last week.<eos> Well, from 60, yes. But we made the point.<eos> So what we were wondering is, how fast do you actually have to be going before you need 315 feet to stop?<eos> So we actually decided, this morning in fact, to do an experiment.<eos> We've got footage of it here.
Doctor, you know where Greg lives.<eos> Come on, Sheriff, you seem like a smart man.<eos> I mean, really, do I strike you as the sort of person who is gonna throw her medical license away and bust into a patient's house guns blazing?<eos> I mean... Well, I've seen things on this job surprise me more.<eos> You put someone in a bad enough corner, they'll do just about anything to get out of it.
It must be charging.<eos> It's plugged in, so...<eos> I shall go and get a cup of coffee.<eos> While we wait for the batteries to charge, let me show you this incredible app that you can get with your i8, OK?<eos> If I push that, I can set the air conditioning so the car is cool when I get back into it.
It's the same as when you took him to the Dodgers game and you brought him back with that Dodgers cap.<eos> You think?<eos> Or is it different in every conceivable respect?<eos> Ay, and don't forget that Phil is gonna be meeting you at Mitch and Cam's to help you bring Lily's Princess castle here.<eos> She's outgrown it, but Joe loves that thing.
He's gonna get in!<eos> The gas! Floor it!<eos> All right, there's a hose in there that leads to the heater core which is next to the engine.<eos> Keep the pedal down and get the temperature up.<eos> But if this thing blows up, we're five feet from it.
I ran the op and Agent Nasri was undercover. CALLEN:<eos> Let's stay on track here. Why don't you tell us about this watch?<eos> That's Naveed's.<eos> It was broken during his arrest-- he got physical-- Shah must've claimed it upon completion of the trial.<eos> Eric said the forensic team pulled Shah's print off it.
I'm gonna go train now.<eos> I tell my guys to identify their fear.<eos> Seek it out.<eos> Run straight through it.<eos> Take its power, make it your own.
I have to live honestly.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So you were born with that hair color?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was. That's... why I keep trying to get back to it.
God, what is wrong with you?<eos> I'm... I'm gonna fix it.<eos> I'm gonna fix it.<eos> Oh, the shop's been slippin' the last few years.<eos> I still think we can pull it out, but Dad wants to sell it, let it get turned into a Midas.
I have seen your husband.<eos> That's hardly a credible threat.<eos> The people of Andover are not my concern or yours.<eos> The citizens of Salem are under quarantine, one you yourself supported.<eos> That edict was for others. I did not intend it to apply to me.
You have a secret. I do.<eos> One you haven't shared.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I'm... I'm afraid.<eos> You face your fear, stand up to it and you take its power away.
We've been able to determine that the New Orleans civilian fleet is moored right about here, near the southern tip of the Mississippi delta, just off Garden Bay.<eos> Far enough out to be safe from the virus, close enough to land for supplies.<eos> I designed the disaster response plan to include tankers and barges fully outfitted with solar and bio-diesel power, stocked with enough food to last a minimum six months.<eos> Any idea how many vessels they have, sir?<eos> I never saw it completed, but the plan was to have enough for 5,000 to 10,000 people.
- Your father, huh?<eos> - He said every man was free.<eos> How do I know you're not a spy?<eos> - A spy?<eos> - The resistance... what's left of it... is shot through with them.
Find what's missing, Gunny.<eos> Drill bits weren't for woodworking.<eos> You own a safe? Yeah.<eos> Bolted to the closet floor-- why?<eos> She was trying to crack it.
He caught you unawares and-and you panicked.<eos> But if you drop that lighter, you will be attempting murder on the 200 or so other people who live in this building.<eos> HOLMES: This... this contraption was at the heart of the drawings on Nadim Al-Haj's walls.<eos> Ionlyhadamoment to absorb them before they were engulfed in flames, but it was clear that he never intended to sever the cable that he excavated.<eos> Rather, I think his plan was to splice this device onto it.
That was kind of hot.<eos> Let's go, champ.<eos> Zachary, how goes the hunt?<eos> Nearly a quarter of the nation's power supply has been compromised.<eos> Soon the Machine will lose access to it entirely.
I'm sorry, but I... I needed to see what he was doing.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Can you prove any of this?<eos> I think the proof lives on Dani's computer, but I can't access it from outside the building.
- Honey, can you just run down?<eos> They're under the sink in the kitchen.<eos> I remember the day Neil left me.<eos> I went outside on my lawn and I sat there until the sprinklers turned on.<eos> The whole fucking world looked like all the green went out of it.
Olga, and she took Dante's security bracelet.<eos> That means she can get anywhere on the island now.<eos> Did you bring your company plane? - Yes, do you need it?<eos> - No.<eos> I need you to get on it and get off this island.
The thing about traffic cams is they only take a picture when you do something wrong.<eos> We went to the apartment.<eos> No sign of foul play.<eos> Uh, we did bring her laptop.<eos> I tried opening it there, but this thing is a virtual Fort Knox of firewalls and security codes.
Thanks to me, Hadad will be more famous than Bin Laden.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This thing goes off, everybody in the world will know that you were behind it.<eos> You really think our government will blame this on an American?<eos> I've given them a scapegoat and they'll take it.
That's America.<eos> The Jack Thompsons of this world won't have it.<eos> I don't care what he thinks.<eos> I'm not going to bend to this.<eos> Sex is a perfectly acceptable thing to have in a piece of adult entertainment and we are not pushing boundaries without it.
So we sell half of what we hoped - at least we get to make our game.<eos> I'm not having the content of my game dictated to me by a bunch of moronic shopkeepers!<eos> Don Simpson wouldn't settle for it, would he?<eos> What would he do?<eos> He'd hire an aircraft carrier, fill it with prostitutes, take 15 different types of class-A drugs and then, I think, he'd accept the power of the marketplace.
- through the window?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He went and he got into his car.<eos> Car or truck?<eos> When you saw Evan Lee leave, did he... sit down into his car or... step up into it?
It is.<eos> It is normal.<eos> It's not normal to you 'cause you've never done it.<eos> Y... instead of feeling it, feeling the grief and the pain, you've shoved it all down and you do drugs instead.<eos> Instead of moving through the pain, you run from it.
Couple days later, the shipping container shows up at the port.<eos> He goes to the port, puts a cargo box from the container into his trunk.<eos> He doesn't know what's in it.<eos> He just knows there's 50K payable upon delivery, so he waits for the phone to ring.<eos> And today, when we were in lockup, it rang.
But if I were you, I'd buy one that helps you find your marbles, because you have clearly lost yours if you think you're gonna be selling our house.<eos> It is my house.<eos> You put it in my name.<eos> And why do you even care?<eos> I care because if you sell it, it means you can never ask me to come back to it.
All Caleb is is an athletic and energetic stand-in until the right one comes along.<eos> Even more depressing.<eos> What?<eos> Haven't you ever wanted the company of someone for... fun?<eos> I made my choice, and I'm proud of it.
Well, they used it for something.<eos> - [sirens wailing in distance] - You have to admit that, if the terrorist has this kind of wire and those materials, another bomb isn't just some idea... it's an inevitability.<eos> If you pieced this all together in 10 minutes, so will the FBI.<eos> Yeah, the problem is the FBI doesn't have this wire.<eos> And without it, they won't know what they're looking for.
Wait, Darlene. We don't do that.<eos> That's to protect fsociety. Okay, but we need to protect each other right now.<eos> Lose Darlene's number.<eos> It's a rule for a reason.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not gonna use it.
Oh, no, I think I am... unwell.<eos> 'Still, at least I wasn't suffering alone.'<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you see, ah...<eos> The oil's been, it's sloshing from side to side as I corner hard.
I like you.<eos> - I like you, too, Noah.<eos> But I trust this administration about as far as I can throw them, and I can't throw at all. I got a bad back.<eos> Noah, the interview's gonna happen.<eos> And when it does, you'll get your tape.
I'd like to request fluoroscopy.<eos> Because?<eos> Because I'm flying blind here. The only way I'll know when the wire's in the right spot is to watch the EKG.<eos> Hi. I need to maintain a sterile field so you need to be my second set of hands.<eos> Hold up that V2 lead so I can attach this alligator clip to it.
What the [bleep] is so valuable about you?<eos> I am no more valuable than life itself.<eos> However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.<eos> That was oxygen.<eos> I added 71 protons to it.
- Your what?<eos> - It's Italian for "sable."<eos> - And I don't speak Italian.<eos> - A sable for a blanket...<eos> I can't sleep without it.
John was the first, and he was the best.<eos> Come on, he can't stop us all!<eos> Even as a child, I could see how special he was.<eos> Sense his unformed potential.<eos> I simply needed to carve away everything else to get to it.
You helped me.<eos> We will always help each other.<eos> I think Amara is the Darkness.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Whatever's in that house, I can taste the power radiating from it.
Little distracted in there.<eos> You got a fully stocked bar, satellite TV.<eos> We ordered some Sushi on your credit card, so I hope you don't mind.<eos> We got to get the phone.<eos> It'll tell us who's been giving them orders.
Found it.<eos> This is it except it's... does that look like the Phoenix Stone to you?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that looks like the Phoenix stone to me.<eos> "The stone gives the sword its power against immortal foes.<eos> Without it, the blade is merely a blade."
Well, if you're here to tell me not to play dirty, you're wasting your breath because Donna already did it.<eos> I'm not here to do that, because you already played dirty.<eos> I'm here to get you to vote against suspending Harvey.<eos> How the hell have I already played dirty?<eos> You knew my partnership would mean something to Harvey, and instead of holding it outside of your feud, you used it to trick him back into the firm.
You know, if someone wanted to take President Eckhart out, your boss has the power to do it.<eos> "Little thieves get hanged, but the great ones rule the kingdom."<eos> Sums up David's clientele.<eos> He had that watch for years.<eos> Never went anywhere without it.
Raven, who's Henry?<eos> I... I'm sorry.<eos> Did you go through my phone?<eos> No.<eos> Did you hack it?
But it was an unmitigated disaster.<eos> NARRATOR: Casey Stoner had won 23 races for the Italian team.<eos> None of the other Ducati riders could come close.<eos> In 2009, when I first got on the bike,<eos> I couldn't believe how Casey could go so fast with it.
I couldn't wait for even one night because the pain was so high. So we went to the hospital close to Assen.<eos> I informed Jorge that if you operate tonight, you can do push-ups tomorrow and we can try to ride on the warm-up.<eos> And to see how it feels, step by step.<eos> He was, "It's impossible, Wilco."<eos> I said, "I've had my collarbone broken with a plate on it."
Did they actually touch?<eos> I was leaning and I only felt "clack" on my rear tire.<eos> I thought he'd touched my exhaust pipe. After that, I don't remember much.<eos> On the rear of the Honda there is a wheel speed sensor, which is part of the traction-control system.<eos> Without it, the bike is unrideable.
I got Patton tracking the IP now.<eos> Those threats make sense based on what I just found.<eos> I examined Lieutenant Garrett's organs, and in addition to scarred lung tissue, I discovered damaged neurons and white matter in the brain, which is typically a side effect of chemotherapy.<eos> Garrett's mother died of cancer.<eos> But there was no sign of it in Lindsay.
It does.<eos> I believe we've already established that I don't trust you.<eos> I believe we've also established that you need me.<eos> Look.<eos> If this Asher kid somehow has access to it, what makes you think he's gonna take you there?
When am I getting out of here?<eos> I got class in the morning.<eos> Your defibrillator implant sustained damage.<eos> It may not be functioning normally.<eos> I can survive without it.
Any news would be good.<eos> There's a way to defeat Gwi.<eos> Without the key?<eos> Tell me quickly.<eos> Explode the dungeon, and make it his grave.
Yes.<eos> So a hero, again.<eos> He told me something else, as well.<eos> Well, the inspector certainly was talkative today.<eos> You rode in a balloon and jumped out of it in some kind of suit?
And he paid with a $100 bill.<eos> Is there any chance it's still here?<eos> Yeah, last night's take is in the safe.<eos> We're gonna need that bill.<eos> We may be able to pull some prints off of it.
- Brother?<eos> - Bond!<eos> The vehicle is up on the first floor!<eos> The car is not registered Nor insured.<eos> Don't let the cops get to it.
- No, no, no, no.<eos> You--Gloria, I was told to make myself at home.<eos> - I have seen thee and her, and I do adore thee.<eos> - You're on very thin ice.<eos> And I suggest you get off of it before it breaks and we both fall through.
Come on.<eos> Gotta keep working.<eos> Coming?<eos> You know, Michelangelo used to say of sculpting that the statue was already there.<eos> He just had to remove the pieces around it.
We don't even have a suspect in custody.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> This is the victim's.<eos> Yup. Caliber's a match, ballistics confirm it.<eos> Do we know who had access to it?
Bus number 12-3-09.<eos> Its first run of the day.<eos> Send us its route.<eos> See if you spot him getting off.<eos> Where is that bus now and what's the quickest path to intercept it?
This blue has finally found what it's been searching for, for so long.<eos> A meal big enough to make opening its massive mouth worthwhile.<eos> The krill swarm is hundreds of metres across and packed tight.<eos> The whale lines up on its prey, targeting the densest part of the shoal.<eos> It takes so much effort to swim with a fully extended throat that the whale virtually comes to a standstill.
The only way to save the dam and the people in town is to make the river that feeds the dam flow in reverse.<eos> Doesn't sound crazy at all.<eos> Okay, explain to me how you make a river flow backwards.<eos> Two miles upriver, the Kesselman Reservoir is stable at 48%.<eos> Now, if we can force 52% of our reservoir's water back up into it...
Jesus, you don't go into a place and search it 18 times and keep looking for something unless...<eos> The only reason you go in a second time is because you believe you missed it the first time.<eos> Once a place is cleared, it's normally released back to the person.<eos> The key was worthless, as far as I was concerned, as evidence, because of the number of searches.<eos> Now this is a key that was used by her for several years, and they took the key and meticulously scrubbed it for DNA and that was, at first glance, a good thing.
They become their own creation.<eos> Did that just happen?<eos> A decade of my life in this office in search of the truth.<eos> And all the time, I was being led by my nose through a dark alley to a dead end, exactly as they planned.<eos> The poster has become so iconic, it's really the heart of the show.
Martin Karlsson passed away.<eos> I'm the real estate agent handling the...<eos> Listen to me, whatever you do... don'ttouchthatcostume.<eos> You understand?<eos> Stay away from it!
It'll do.<eos> We bought it for a song.<eos> And the place is the perfect cover.<eos> And the view is swell.<eos> All right, let's get to it.
- Todd, help me. You got him. You fucking got him.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> All right, we're clear, we're clear.<eos> - Did you fucking kill that thing?<eos> - Yeah, I shot it, man. - I shot it.
The man who brought this bomb on the plane may try something.<eos> Can I trust you to stop him?<eos> You're damn straight you can.<eos> Hey, Reilly, sorry about the nose.<eos> It was never my best feature.
I don't give a fuck.<eos> All right!<eos> You'll be in room number 13.<eos> You can drive on down there.<eos> Park by it if you'd like.
Read the responses only.<eos> There are six stages to exorcism.<eos> Presence, Pretense, Breakpoint, Voice, Clash and Expulsion.<eos> During each stage, you will do exactly as I say and nothing else.<eos> Don't talk to it.
Where is he now?<eos> He's turning down West 12!<eos> You'll see the accident any second now.<eos> You need to turn around.<eos> Why around it?
That poor girl is risking her life to fight for our respect, for India's respect..<eos> And we will just leave her and go?<eos> You have lost the plot. If we go back then everyone gets arrested!<eos> Stick to the plan!<eos> Take your bloody plan, make a trumpet out of it and shove it up your muscular bum!
Yes, yes, I saw her flying towards the dust depot.<eos> The blue pixie dust.<eos> Ooh, this is bad.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Without it, the tree can't make pixie dust.
Time had stood still for the Garm, but by your coming here, it has begun to flow once more.<eos> The time of the Garms' extinction has begun.<eos> Your body will still prove useful to me.<eos> The braincase of a Kumtak will be able to freely access the central Garm network.<eos> I shall make free use of it.
Yes, well, it's a lot easier for you to get over it.<eos> I've got to get... up and over it, if you know what I mean.<eos> I hate my dick.<eos> Why aren't you doing my pilot?<eos> You'd be so right for it.
I don't.<eos> That just means we get to skip limbo and go straight to hell.<eos> Okay. How about this?<eos> What if we just buy the show from you?<eos> We'll hire someone else to run it.
- Yeah, I'm fine!<eos> - I'm coming down!<eos> Yes!<eos> I looked for the tomb of Ahkmenrah for 20 years, and what do you do?<eos> You fall right into it!
I think of it like a dream, analyze it like a dream.<eos> My subconscious wants to tell me that... Cassidy knew his kidnapper.<eos> Nelson.<eos> No one else knew what Cassidy was working on.<eos> That's what I thought, but... the plans for that chip were on Cassidy's computer, and Nelson's not the only one that had access to it.
OK, bye. Bye-bye.<eos> Hello, I wondered if Sir Donald was in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've got three bulimics.<eos> Do you think we should put them next to the buffet or a long way from it?
I'm not stupid.<eos> You're a very stupid little boy.<eos> Mummy and Daddy are very cross because it doesn't matter about the gun.<eos> Why not?<eos> You saw the whole room when you entered it.
Recorder?<eos> What are you, Lois Lane?<eos> - Just use your phone.<eos> - No, you don't understand.<eos> I can't do an interview without it.
Always great when I can see you.<eos> - Oh, aren't you sweet.<eos> - (CHUCKLES)<eos> I have a piece of registered mail.<eos> I need your signature for it.
See the shape of the land here.<eos> Creek dead ends back there.<eos> Flows out of the hillside, right?<eos> What, under there?<eos> If there's flow under these rocks and we can get to it, We'd be up river from everyone else.
That's a shitty rate, Rick.<eos> No bank's gonna loan you that money.<eos> If you don't pay, I'm on the hook.<eos> I don't want that property.<eos> It has no future.
Are you saying you can't beat those beasts?<eos> Their forces are much larger than ours.<eos> We can't face the beasts and the Black Dragon at the same time.<eos> After all these years of hibernation, the dragon will be a fearsome foe.<eos> And if we get to it before it wakes?
And?<eos> And they have the votes to unseat me.<eos> Sounds to me you have a real problem there.<eos> If Hunter becomes chief, you can kiss any piece of that casino good-bye.<eos> Hunter won't let you near it.
That's Euan Ross.<eos> He's landed.<eos> You know, when we found Catherine's body, she didn't have her house keys or her phone.<eos> We don't usually lock the doors, but her phone?<eos> She never went anywhere without it.
This may be helping you to find out.<eos> She has one phone she only uses for very rare things, very rare.<eos> We found her having it because she used it to call Nathaniel Bloom for a coffee meeting many months ago.<eos> Since then, she has been...being called by one phone in the UK, two nights ago.<eos> And she is calling with it to another phone in... Holland.
And if you refuse to decode the cipher?<eos> Then it's a gallows dance for us both.<eos> Then why are we still here?<eos> You have the logbook.<eos> Without it, the secret of longitude is lost forever, so let's just burn it and be gone.
This neurotic relationship can last for millions of years.<eos> The atmosphere of the larger star was being siphoned onto a glowing hot accretion disk that revolves around and spirals into a black hole.<eos> The overwhelming gravity was accelerating the blue star's gas into a death spiral, crossing the spacetime boundary, never to be seen again.<eos> The fateful boundary that separates a black hole from the rest of the universe is called an event horizon.<eos> From our point of view, the substance in the disk slows down as it approaches the event horizon, never quite reaching it.
"He broke through the walls of heaven."<eos> John often reminisced about those summer nights with his father.<eos> Maybe that's why he sought a way to preserve the past.<eos> John Herschel was one of the founders of a new form of time travel, a means to capture light and memories.<eos> He actually coined a word for it, photography.
DANA: I'm starting to get worried about the traffic.<eos> It's gonna be fine, Mom.<eos> And I'm sorry about my phone.<eos> Are you sure you have time to stop by the hotel?<eos> I'd hate to be without it today' but I don't want you to be late for the photos.
- Can I come in?<eos> That depends.<eos> What's the plan for that stake in your coat?<eos> You have a very good eye.<eos> Well, you don't survive as long as we have without it.
It's been a few decades since I've met anyone like her.<eos> Ok, I'll do it.<eos> You will!<eos> But I know how dangerous your world is.<eos> - Keep her safe from it.
And don't you think there's something fundamentally wrong with that?<eos> Don't you worry you'll end up one of his victims or, worse, just like him?<eos> Poor Marcellus.<eos> You remains always in the shadow of your father.<eos> Climb out from beneath it, will you, so you can die like a man?
I'm taking care of it.<eos> Today or I will resolve it myself.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We should prepare Mr. Olynyk for surgery.<eos> He'll likely rupture within a day without it.
And if you refuse to decode the cipher?<eos> Then it's a gallows dance for us both.<eos> Then why are we still here?<eos> You have the logbook.<eos> Without it, the secret of longitude is lost forever, so let's just burn it and be gone.
Leave me a message, and I'll call you back.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I found the car.<eos> It's parked outside Grand Central Station.<eos> I have traffic cam video of a woman leaving it.
Did you hear?<eos> It's over! It's really, finally over!<eos> Somehow, in my mind, V-E Day, the end of the bloodiest and most terrible war in human history, grows fainter with each passing day.<eos> But I can stiff recall every detail of the day, when I saw the life I wanted sitting in a window.<eos> I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd bought that vase and made a home for it.
Yeah, defending a cellphone company.<eos> Competitor says my client stole their phone design, so my client's looking at $100 million in legal bills, give or take.<eos> I'd be happy to take some.<eos> Listen, the, um -- the thing is, several times now, in meetings, uh, my phone gets hot even though I haven't used it, you know, like it's been on the whole time,<eos> like -- like somebody hacked it and used it to listen in on me.
Special kid.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you'll allow me just one more question.<eos> Was this Elijah's coat?<eos> According to his mother, Elijah was allergic to wool, and that coat is 100% wool, so it didn't belong to the victim.
I should take a look.<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Bad idea.<eos> This worm is like a python.<eos> It wraps itself around a system, squeezes the life out of it.
You tell me.<eos> - I did it.<eos> - What?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You left your phone on the table, and I didn't look at it.
You, Roman, are anything but normal.<eos> That's why you went to Hawaii, right?<eos> To get away from it?<eos> But the thirst came right along with you.<eos> There's no running from it.
Are you giving me a mandate?<eos> No. Heh heh heh.<eos> I'm giving you an ally.<eos> I want peace just as much as you do.<eos> My lifestyle, which I enjoy very much, depends on it.
It's like this Buddhist guy says.<eos> "You see this goblet?<eos> For me, it is already broken.<eos> I enjoy it.<eos> I drink out of it.
Maybe we don't need a key!<eos> I can pick locks.<eos> I went through this delinquent phase when I was 15...<eos> What don't you understand about the concept of a magic key, Freya?<eos> The spell won't work without it!
- their new base camp.<eos> - We know what quadrant it's in, we just don't know its exact location.<eos> The good news is they have no idea that we're onto them.<eos> I should be able to follow the Trags to the Marketplace without them suspecting.<eos> They should lead us straight to it.
Wait, Carl has a dog?<eos> Yeah, just some stray he brought home.<eos> Um, hey, listen, are you guys using the laptop?<eos> I kind of need it for class.<eos> Well, Debbie uses it for school, and Carl uses it for porn.
So, my papa's- my dad's side different story.<eos> He was a crazy kid my dad growing up in the 60's and all.<eos> Drifting through life.<eos> Then as the story goes he was walking on a beach one day, and he came across this piece of driftwood and he saw something in it.<eos> So he took it home and he studied it and he studied it, and he ended up carving a statue of Jesus out of it.
I can't do it.<eos> It's false.<eos> Look, Gwyneth, this isn't the first time you've had to make the leap. But I can't do it this time.<eos> That's what this is about.<eos> On the record, I want to say that I think this hair thing is the real deal and I think it is going to grow hair, not just because I want it to.
That's the chair.<eos> No, no, no. You could read the sign, right?<eos> All right. Listen up, you shitheads.<eos> You stole my goddamn wheelchair.<eos> And you... you need to get your candy ass out of it right now.
What do we know?<eos> On the face of it, it looks like an accident.<eos> What's that supposed to mean-- "on the face of it"?<eos> Well, look at the vehicle.<eos> There's nothing left of it.
And wear a tutu?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> No.<eos> See, before the kids go on stage, we have this secret ritual.<eos> They can't dance without it.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> What's bothering him?<eos> He's a drug addict.<eos> Um, I-I see that you're, looking into my trunk of unsolved cases.<eos> Yes. You told me to look into it in my spare time.
A snot-nosed brat kicking his rapping grandpa in the testicles.<eos> The rapping grandpa kills me, though.<eos> I am in marketing, Winston.<eos> The backbone of capitalism.<eos> - Without it, you'd be dead in two days.
You care to elaborate, you know, on this whole analog thing?<eos> No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.<eos> Right.<eos> The hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.<eos> And then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.
Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.<eos> I wasn't using the car this week.<eos> Well, would there be anybody else who would have access to it?
For some reason, we get no reception at all in the spleen.<eos> You have got to come out.<eos> My shrinking device was only designed for three-hour intervals.<eos> If it reverses, you'll explode right through Artie's chest.<eos> But we found the artifact and I think we can get to it before it strikes 12:00.
What did I say?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Every time.<eos> It's like you have a sensor - for whenever my butt lifts off the bed.<eos> - Back in it.
And, uh, two...<eos> That's not as hot as you think it is.<eos> Look, I'm just saying I know what works on me because I'm hard working and I'm dedicated, but it would really be interesting to see if it worked on somebody who was almost completely sedentary.<eos> But... but who... who... who makes that look very sexy.<eos> You know, this system of yours, do you have a name for it?
Every day, I'd go up to the post, chew it, sniff it, take a leak on it.<eos> I loved that damn post.<eos> But one day, I was licking it, and it gave me a splinter in my tongue.<eos> Ah, I just felt so betrayed.<eos> So I just started walking past it, just pretending it wasn't even there.
You could get a laundry basket and I'd ask: 'Why do you need that? ' and you'd say, 'For my laundry!<eos> ', and I'd say, 'Okay, I get it.'<eos> That night we could snuggle and you'd pull the cunains.<eos> That would be great, I think.<eos> Next morning, you'd stan sipping from my grandma's cup, you know I really like that cup, but I'd be touched... by how you sip tea from it.
Has it really been that long since your last kill or was violence your natural inclination?<eos> Go back to Setauket, Captain.<eos> I pray that woman can settle your savage side.<eos> General, have we come to a consensus?<eos> Your Excellency, we believe traditional reconnaissance is the way forward as it depends on as little variable as possible and would be carried out by men who could be trusted to follow orders.
I donated the egg.<eos> In the whole wide world, you'll never meet a man more accepting and open to nature in all its wonders than your father.<eos> He's a gem.<eos> The best thing about your dad and that horrible perm of his is that no matter how talentless, misshapen, ugly, miserable or sexually ambiguous you are, he will still love you unconditionally.<eos> Your dad made sure that everyone in this school understood what it was like to see the world from this chair, and he helped me see all that I could be even though I was in it.
Give me my bike back.<eos> Or I'll report you're working against the Juvenile Protection law.<eos> I know your phone number now.<eos> Give it back!<eos> I will not go until you return it.
What are you doing, man?<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry about the mess.<eos> We can blame it on my insomnia and late-night TV marathons.<eos> Have you ever seen the documentary on The Who where Keith Moon hits the drum and it looks like glitter comes jumping off of it?
That was hardly subtle.<eos> - That's Verrat. - Yeah.<eos> - Where's your car?<eos> - Downstairs, parking garage.<eos> Get it, meet us out front, and follow me.
- Great idea, fishlegs.<eos> Gobber locked the dragon root up,<eos> So we could get rid of it.<eos> - Just one problem.<eos> All our dragons go nuts when they go anywhere near it.
Out of chaos rise angels like Naomi, Bartholomew...<eos> Metatron.<eos> Well, perhaps I've been down here with them for too long.<eos> There's seemingly nothing but chaos.<eos> But not all bad comes from it.
Um, I mean... That's the question that we should be asking ourselves.<eos> If I may?<eos> MODERATOR: Please be brief, Congressman.<eos> With absolute...<eos> With regard to holes, and notwithstanding the humor that was poked at me earlier, and I'm certainly a fan of humor. Um, can't get by without it, but I think the point about holes is well taken and sort of circles back to my point about plug holes earlier.
You should put me back in O.R. rotation.<eos> Start clipping aneurysms again.<eos> Well, it would be good to have you back.<eos> It used to be all I wanted to do.<eos> I'm grateful that they approached me for the project and that you pushed me towards it.
Come on, Hammond, come with me.<eos> Really?<eos> Now, this is your actual GT3.<eos> Yes, it is, actually, yes.<eos> We know this because there's a fireman standing next to it with an extinguisher in case it suddenly combusts.
Where that, sir?<eos> Here, near here. Uh, uh, music hall.<eos> - Which?<eos> - I don't know which. Um...<eos> Vera brought me to it.
Guard it with your life because, in many ways, it now is your life.<eos> You were born with great power, Zelena. And now... now this pendant will harness, protect, and grow that power...<eos> Will it make me stronger?<eos> Than you could possibly imagine.<eos> However, the price is, without it, you are powerless.
Wanted to get it to someone who would understand.<eos> - So where else could it be?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't even know what we're looking for.<eos> Well, he didn't drive all the way here without it, so it has to be here somewhere.
Well, we're leaving him.<eos> He has bought a van that has no traction at all, no ability to work off road and now no hydraulics so none of his tools work.<eos> You've got to be ruthless in these circumstances.<eos> With his crane, he was useful.<eos> Without it, he's just another mouth to feed.
He did a good job, too.<eos> But the thing is, if you really study every inch of a crime scene, sometimes you notice things you weren't even looking for.<eos> Like where the grout is a little whiter because it's new.<eos> Kevin Elspeth was careful not to get his prints on the magnet.<eos> We know, because he buried disposable gloves-- like these-- right in there with it.
Okay, okay, we need to focus.<eos> How about we drive through the fence, across the neighbor's yard and out onto Sycamore Street?<eos> That's great except for the pool in the neighbor's yard.<eos> They have a pool?<eos> Why don't we use it?
Hey! That was my pool cue.<eos> I brought it from home.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> It screws together.<eos> And I even have this special little case for it.
Hello?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, yes, th-thank you very much.<eos> That was the network.<eos> They, uh... they loved the script and they want to make it into a pilot.
No, she wasn't like anybody else in the world, even after... everything, she still believed in me.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Was she worried about you having access to your inheritance?<eos> She said to put it in a trust.<eos> I can't access it till I'm sober a year.
It was there, and now it's right here.<eos> Then we're going to have to rethink things, aren't we?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ballistics found no gunpowder residue in the barrel of Gabby's gun.<eos> So, it hadn't been fired recently.
Everything is really delicious, Sam.<eos> And the second fork really adds a sense of occasion.<eos> Oh, thank you, Marcus.<eos> So how's the tree house coming?<eos> I'd love to come up and see it sometime.
I root for you.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Don't have to say anything.<eos> But you should know that I'll be recommending they appoint a successor, and not vacate the position.<eos> I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.
No comprende.<eos> We do him first, then you.<eos> All right?<eos> The dope... It's not yours.<eos> Why die for it?
Right, almost forgot.<eos> That wasn't your bag.<eos> On my way over, I spotted your exact same backpack in a shop window.<eos> Well, you know how much I love that shade of gray.<eos> So, naturally, I snatched it-- four-claw discount-- and moved all my stuff into it.
Sane.<eos> She and her boyfriend seemed happy together.<eos> I... I was worried, if you saw that, it would make you upset.<eos> I was scrambling to think of a way to get you out of there, when I realized I had the perfect combination of a deviant's delights-- the gerbil, the lube, the alcohol... the ski mask.<eos> When you went to the bathroom, I stole your backpack and put my things in it.
Uh, I-I saw that your laundry was done, and I was gonna fold it for you to make us even for what you thought that I did that I didn't do.<eos> Even?<eos> I held your popcorn for eight hours waiting for you to come back.<eos> I walked all the parking areas twice, checked every medical tent.<eos> By the time I got back to my car, it had been broken into and the battery was gone.
Now.<eos> I'm transferring to Thin Man.<eos> I'm joining Akley's group.<eos> You know, when we get home, you can transfer to the Axis for all I care.<eos> But I brought you onto this project, and for the next 30 miles, I can kick your ass off of it.
It's a copy of a statement written by Leticia Gomez.<eos> Says that you farmed out all your dirty work to the Brotherhood of Doubt because you thought they couldn't be traced back to you or your network.<eos> She gave you up.<eos> Fu'ad Hansur's compound last night.<eos> CIA followed your funding trail straight to it.
How do we find the stone?<eos> What we need is a compass.<eos> The stone that Excalibur was pulled from is almost pure magic.<eos> It should attract any other magic item in the city.<eos> Let's just take another magic artifact, rig it into the compass.
"Oh boy, the one you are looking for, isn't here."<eos> "He isn't here."<eos> "Why do you roam?"<eos> "Why do you roam?"<eos> "The one who comes in the world has to leave it one day."
MAN: Nick, get away from the railing!<eos> Are they okay?<eos> CARRIE: He was there.<eos> That backpack. I saw the same backpack at the pier the day the yacht exploded.<eos> He put his cell phone into it.
- Why not?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Maybe because it's called "crazy golf."<eos> Table tennis is called Ping-Pong, and that's an Olympic sport.<eos> Perhaps if the crazy golf people got together and came up with a more serious-sounding name, like elaborate obstacle golf, you see then... then the Olympic body might make it a proper sport.
Guess my shining isn't infallible.<eos> Your shining?<eos> My extreme acuity, my sixth sense, it can sometimes be a burden.<eos> But, anyway, you seem like a nice guy.<eos> I just- - I think I was so dazzled by the costume, that I didn't even think about what you looked like without it.
Well, uh, it looks like everybody's feeling better, so let's all clear out and give the Captain some privacy for his exam.<eos> I've seen his ass, like, a million times already.<eos> - Oh, it's a beauty, isn't it?<eos> - Oh, it's perfectly formed.<eos> I almost took a shot at it myself.
They can't crack it.<eos> They think it's a one-time pad.<eos> What's that?<eos> I-it's a-a code made with a key.<eos> The person who encodes the message has the key, so does the person who decodes it.
Do it.<eos> Auggie, we're moving on an exfil.<eos> How?<eos> I can't get a Black Hawk down there for love or money.<eos> McQuaid Security has another plan, so I'm letting them run with it.
I know that it's scary, but Angela has to leave the nest and spread her wings.<eos> That's good advice... if we were talking about a cockatoo, which we are not.<eos> My mother has dated two men her entire life, both of whom I knew very well.<eos> She doesn't know what men are like.<eos> What if she leaves her drink unattended, and somebody puts something in it?
Without the hydraulics of the air-con, it's just dead weight.<eos> Slow you down.<eos> Cook you in the process.<eos> Agreed, we'll just keep the oxygen.<eos> We can go without it for a while, but we'll deficit pretty quickly in this atmosphere.
Nick holman.<eos> He's always had his eye on taking over this farm.<eos> He seems pretty comfortable taking George's property.<eos> Maybe he took George's colt, as well...<eos> And shot him with it.
- Your driveway.<eos> - My driveway.<eos> How long was it there?<eos> Three days.<eos> Anyone else have access to it?
How long has it been since your husband did that?<eos> What time is it?<eos> If I'm late again, the girl's gonna quit.<eos> You don't have to wear so much makeup, you know?<eos> You're beaucoup plus belle without it.
I really thought that going part-time would give me balance, but I seem to be scrambling even more.<eos> I really want to be a good mom to sashi.<eos> She deserves everything.<eos> But I love my work too.<eos> Three years ago, this business was my dream, and I sacrificed so much for it.
Very sexy watching a man go after what he wants on his own terms.<eos> You know, that's a pretty big garage.<eos> Is it full?<eos> I was hoping I could keep this car here.<eos> Maybe come around from time to time, use it.
What do you mean?<eos> The porcelain foo dogs were completely neglected by the Zhangs.<eos> The Wentworths used the Navajo serape as a cat bed.<eos> The P.S. Heggen mid-century wastebasket?<eos> The Usamovs were putting actual trash into it.
Thank you.<eos> In the 12th century, sugar arrived in Europe.<eos> And, due to its rarity, it quickly became a status symbol for royalty.<eos> Queen Elizabeth I had a real love of sugar.<eos> So much so that her teeth rotted and went black from it.
Now, a lot of people will say,<eos> "Well, I eat sugar all the time and, you know,<eos> "I'm perfectly fine."<eos> Well, what they don't understand is that they eat sugar all the time and they're fuzzy and their mind is cloudy all the time.<eos> Sugar has now become so deeply ingrained into the fabric of our society that some people can't imagine life without it.
Honey, I should have taken you out to lunch, and we should have talked.<eos> But I didn't do that.<eos> And I'm sorry about the Mort and the Maura and the he and the she.<eos> I'm just a person, and you're just a person, and here we are.<eos> And, baby, you need to... you need to get in this whirlpool... or you need to get out of it.
That'll be all, Dr. Tsing.<eos> Tell me about the radiation leak.<eos> The air filtration system malfunctioned, but the containment system worked.<eos> Malfunctioned?<eos> I'll look into it.
Good.<eos> That's good... because I really want to hear him explain what he did.<eos> Any more evidence connecting this attack to our prime suspect?<eos> He didn't come home last night.<eos> We have two undercover vehicles parked outside his house and one a block behind it.
There's no class on Fridays, doesn't meet before 11:00, half the time, we meet under a tree... 'cause I guess Buddha was into that.<eos> And Buddhism is about rebirth, so I'll learn how my coolness will live on forever.<eos> In your face, death!<eos> Axl, what kind of a job do you think you're gonna get as a Buddhist-studies major?<eos> Enh. Cross that bridge when I get to it.
- Turn them around. - We can't.<eos> Saul, they're waiting for you at the rendezvous.<eos> Don't let them down.<eos> Saul, you're in a courtyard.<eos> You need to exit it now.
Because it's there.<eos> We're not satisfied. Now we're mapping out a plan to go to Mars. Why?<eos> Why Mars?<eos> Ain't the moon far enough?<eos> Mars, because it's there and there's the possibility and a chance of us reaching it.
If it gets me cleaning the bones sooner, I'm all yours.<eos> All right, then, walk this way, Mr. Bray, into the wonderful world of forceps and swabbing.<eos> Looks like the organ gods are smiling down on us.<eos> I've got a stomach.<eos> Think you can recover anything from it?
We're talking dozens of veteran troops, gun emplacements,<eos> - and the latest Russian hardware.<eos> - What's the estimate on casualties?<eos> PARKER: With the element of surprise, zero to five.<eos> But without it, I think there's a strong chance we lose more guys than we save.
Well, they should all be fired, 'cause we got in here pretty easily, especially me.<eos> Steve, there's our dream house.<eos> Where?<eos> You see the one that's bathed in that ray of sunlight?<eos> It's the one right next to it.
Till he put his hand on my knee.<eos> 'And then I was just grossing.'<eos> It was intended as a comfort!<eos> For whom?<eos> 'All I could see was his nose, 'with all the little hairs coming out of it.'
But you're still on R and R.<eos> You're that concerned about me?<eos> That's why I'm letting you crash here.<eos> I'll turn the traps on on my way out.<eos> The house will keep you safe as long as you don't leave it.
You know, I'm getting a little sick of your attitude.<eos> You almost got me killed.<eos> No, you almost got yourself killed.<eos> I didn't get you into this mess, you did!<eos> I'm the one that's trying to get you out of it!
It's been spackled.<eos> Matched the color with toothpaste.<eos> I'm so turned on.<eos> This wire runs to the gate lock.<eos> And this is a wireless transmitter that's been spliced into it.
You murdered girls who had the misfortune of sleeping with you.<eos> You slaughtered hundreds, heroes of Calais, for your own amusement.<eos> You were mad.<eos> You lusted for power, for England, for Scotland, for my wife!<eos> You justify your sin but you don't admit it.
Watch your hand!<eos> What a psycho!<eos> Make yourself useful for once.<eos> "Thanorm Garage Service." Why is it taking forever to fix this bike?<eos> You trying to make a Porsche out of it?
When you become a member of the Preservation Hall band, you come up through the ranks.<eos> Our clarinet player, Charlie Gabriel, he's 82.<eos> So what we were thinking for an intro was to do a variation of that riff, - but swing it a little more. - Okay, do the riff.<eos> He's a fourth-generation musician.<eos> And then you play around it.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> It's hollow.<eos> So we got... fake body, real blood.<eos> Yeah, looks like it.<eos> And if Nelson Kern's cell phone ended up in here, I'm betting that's his blood smeared all over it.
No.<eos> Why was I not consulted?<eos> You're displeased?<eos> Surely, you can't object to the match?<eos> I object to the way it has come about.
It's on, bro!<eos> [Chuckles] Bro, don't call me "bro," bro.<eos> I'm not your bro. I mean, non-bro.<eos> Here in my hand... the starter's pistol.<eos> But before I fire it, - I'd just like to say... Boo!
Mom, if you love me, let me hate.<eos> Nice.<eos> - Nice place.<eos> - Candace has a pool.<eos> Oh, don't you pee in it.
This view is amazing. Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You know, I used to walk by houses like this and think the people on the decks were just looking down their noses at everyone, feeling all superior.<eos> Now I know it's true.<eos> Roger sold our beach house 'cause he said we never used it.
I told you you'd be back.<eos> I told you... you belong here.<eos> Jerk!<eos> I thought there was another world out there.<eos> I thought I could be a part of it.
He's at the back door.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Do you see a trash can?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why? - Get in it.
Them postcards you've been sending me?<eos> You're a damn liar.<eos> I have been in school.<eos> Who do you think you're talking to?<eos> I brought you into this world, I can take you out of it.
Well, I've just been glancing... into some of the rooms.<eos> What do you say we... go to Coney Island? We could take my car.<eos> It's too late tonight.<eos> We could take a plunge in the pool.<eos> I haven't made use of it all summer.
Did you like the show last night?<eos> That was just one fuel cell.<eos> Imagine what 10 of them will do, with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.<eos> We have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.<eos> But we can't access it.
Move out.<eos> Shuttle is ready.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Here's the deal. We'll wait outside the factory until we see his shuttle leave.<eos> One of you puts an explosive round in it, goes to the crash site, gets the data.
This is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.<eos> Now, unfortunately, it's damaged.<eos> It's a little bit weak.<eos> But it's still alive.<eos> Now, I think I can tap into it using the same technology that allows the two Jaeger pilots to share a neural bridge.
And whoever it was, she really hurt you.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> "Take this and eat it for it is my body given for you."<eos> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, and giving thanks once again, he passed it to his disciples and said:<eos> "Take this and drink it for it is my blood, the new testament to be spilt for you and for all men in forgiveness of all sin.
Oh, ship.<eos> Put a vibrator in her stocking, for God's sakes?<eos> No, I was saving it for her birthday.<eos> - I'm coming, honey. - Wait.<eos> Just because you have lube, doesn't mean you have to use it.
And I still say yes to this day I did some of my most unusual paintings and I'm very proud of them.<eos> He was very supportive. Very supportive.<eos> Alejandro motivated me to such an extent I used to go in at weekends just to finish paintings.<eos> I've got this memory of coming up with the pirate spaceship over a weekend.<eos> It's been mortally wounded and all this spice is spilling out of it.
My young mother.<eos> The building where Mama lived blocked one of the exits to the Volga.<eos> For months, our troops would capture the building and then leave again.<eos> Mama was tired of living in an inferno, tired of being shocked by human grief, human cruelty and even by her own patience.<eos> Mama just kept living in her old home and didn't want to leave it.
You wanna know why?<eos> Because we have two daughters and a third on the way.<eos> We live in a very, very small apartment, about half the size of that house I bet you stole.<eos> Hey, I worked hard for that house.<eos> I'm proud of it.
Look at me.<eos> Stay with me, stay with me, come on.<eos> I...<eos> I have hell in my head.<eos> And I cannot run away from it.
You had the phone with the account numbers , and the accounts were full .<eos> I did not know .<eos> - The phone was encrypted.<eos> - Drop that shit.<eos> - Are you saying you did not get access to it?
I give you my favorite gun.<eos> That shines from newness.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I wonder if you can shoot with it.
You making fun of me?<eos> Are you trying to say my family's poor?<eos> Oh, geez, Frank.<eos> I don't know if a knife is necessary.<eos> I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
Get used to it, bro!<eos> What are you going to do when we're roommates?<eos> Roommates?<eos> Yeah dude.<eos> We'll rent an apartment and set it up... like that TV show F.R.l.E.N.D.S.
They would have noticed me already.<eos> Oh, no, my friend.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> Because you still walk in the shadow of Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> Don't you think it's time you stepped out from it, and let the gods see you for who you really are?
He's Russian - remember?<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Oh, it's Lady Cremone.<eos> She's an interesting lady, but she's a recluse.<eos> She has an apartment at the Imperial, but she never ever uses it.
At which moment it all came to pass.<eos> The ship struck.<eos> The hull split.<eos> The deck lurching into the air.<eos> The gaggle of girls, slipping across it.
Wait.<eos> Is it not written-.<eos> "My house"-<eos> "My house shall be called the house of prayer"?<eos> But you... you have made it a den of thieves.
Then along comes this nature outfit who want to repurpose the plant as a bottling plant for some fancy organic iced tea.<eos> The problem they run into was that Louisianans only drink Lipton.<eos> 18 months later, nature boys go belly-up, can't pay their taxes.<eos> We take the plant.<eos> You can use it.
That car is a present. I bought it for you.<eos> Mr Luscombe, you didn't.<eos> - But I can't drive.<eos> - l'll teach you.<eos> And Louis can use it too.
You trusted me... but I betrayed you.<eos> I can't be trusted.<eos> Chandu, I've trusted you since the day I met you.<eos> I still do and always will.<eos> If you can't give up this addiction for yourself... I'm sure you will give it up for us.
I feel our cock won't win, not today!<eos> Let's wait for the big festival!<eos> - Festival? Do we've to spend all our time on it till then? She's too much!<eos> Settle it once for all today!<eos> If you say no and bring back to home, I'll make a dish of it.
Lives are taken because somebody lost at the track that day or because dinner was late on the table.<eos> Sometimes there's no reason at all.<eos> Just boredom and booze on a Saturday night.<eos> For me, there's only one reason that ever made sense.<eos> It doesn't make your hands any cleaner, but maybe it'll let you sleep at night.
Are you drunk? Yep.<eos> I'm planning to stay that way.<eos> So, the secret is plain old lard.<eos> That's what makes the crust so crispy and delicious.<eos> These days, lard is a dirty word, but I won't make a pie without it.
You're pretty.<eos> Well, you got him here.<eos> "A new study concludes that most Americans now believe that global warming is a real thing... " Did you hear that?<eos> "And that people are causing it."<eos> Okay, I said you could use my laptop, not read out loud from it.
There's a lacrosse stick in my bed.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Syracuse, Hopkins... all the schools were all after Reed, offering him full rides.<eos> He was lightning on the field.<eos> Now he's dead, and my wife... she's got his lacrosse stick in our bed, holding onto it every night as she cries.
♪ Do you want fries with that?<eos> Oh, well, maybe if you put some of that sass in your performance, your teacher wouldn't have begged me to come here and be your new vocal coach.<eos> Mercedes is one of the strongest vocalists in McKinley Glee Club history.<eos> So get on point, Kitty, your little theory about Mercedes' shattered dreams, like most of the garbage that comes out of your mouth, is wrong.<eos> All right, Mercedes is back because she has a new album coming out, all about home, and she's come back to film a video for it.
I hope you are not here about this brown water business too.<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> If only we could put a stop to this archaic way of thinking, "chemicals equal pollution."<eos> No, believe me, you're preaching to the converted.<eos> But you know, it's when I turn my water on in my kitchen, and it comes out brown, I don't want brown water.
That's just a fact, but Blackout...<eos> Blackout is ready to go.<eos> Why are we talking about Blackout?<eos> He's immune.<eos> Ian's immune, but what about other people who don't need to use it for the rest of their lives, who could benefit from it in the short term?
One special.<eos> Hey. You got a pay-phone in here?<eos> Yeah. Around back.<eos> By the washrooms.<eos> See anybody using it last night?
Oh, the missus couldn't wait to get me out of the house.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> - Oh, wait.<eos> Messenger came with your script yesterday.<eos> I didn't let it out of my sight.
Your hat?<eos> That's how she did it.<eos> How she managed to fly out of this place.<eos> They don't know it, but I don't need the hat.<eos> I can fly without it.
Of course he's going to get into trouble.<eos> I just wish I knew what.<eos> Look, we have to get serious about this.<eos> We have to get Ian's spinal fluid.<eos> We're at a standstill without it.
We're on our way.<eos> They found the caddy at Santa Lucia high school. - Help her!<eos> What's happening? - Get Dr. Meeks in here, now.<eos> Hey. The car's there.<eos> Nobody's come to it since we got here.
Emails, corporate PR, accounting details...<eos> Absolutely nothing for anyone to be killed over, though.<eos> But she was right.<eos> The security was top-notch.<eos> I mean, I had to use a high-level brute-force cracking algorithm just to get into it.
Well, she seemed very nice.<eos> How about these miracle drugs, huh?<eos> M-My headache is gone.<eos> I can't tell about the accent.<eos> I'm still getting used to it, so...
Did you use your tongue for something wicked?<eos> Or maybe you just suck at going down.<eos> Oh, come on, Jeeves.<eos> Show us your stub!<eos> Maybe we can put it to use!
Ah, hotcake flying', lion.<eos> Shh... - Later on, Jakes.<eos> Hey, Johnny, do me a favor, man.<eos> Open this mail, try not to get any of that nasty stink juice on it.<eos> You're standing right next to it.
Terry, how's your hand?<eos> Punched his girlfriend in the face.<eos> I mean, you know. That shit can hurt the puncher as much as the punchee, so...<eos> Maddy and I had a little fling over the summer.<eos> I guess she's still a bit sore from it.
Trial basis.<eos> But the good news was she was going to get me a car to help with my sister.<eos> All my friends talked about how lucky I was to have it.<eos> I hated that car.<eos> Every time I got in it, I-- it just reminded me.
I did not think to lay eyes upon you again.<eos> Nor I you.<eos> The gods mock us both.<eos> You are still of this world.<eos> Yet shall slip from it if you do not eat.
You know, he said he couldn't be.<eos> He was traveling for basketball and all, but when his career ended, you know, he had more time.<eos> Is this about the time that Quinlan started looking like a prospect?<eos> Look, I just wanted us to be a family.<eos> Well, we know that Quinlan's new contract with Miami was negotiated solely by his lawyer, and Daryl was left completely out of it.
Can't I return her car?<eos> The car's been sold, bro.<eos> It's parked in Chandigarh, refurbished like new.<eos> So what?<eos> If a stolen car can get to Chandigarh" "then it can come back too.
See?<eos> They obviously consider you to be one of them!<eos> You know what?<eos> This bird deserves a much better space...<eos> For old time's sake, how about I weave a fine bamboo cage for keepin' it?
- Because I'm a good-- - detective, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The sergeant's test?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I'm gonna start studying for it. - Okay.
She's, uh... strong.<eos> How are you?<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.
There's your roast beef and cheese.<eos> Bobby.<eos> This used to be the road, where we're walking.<eos> My dad's listening post station was right through there.<eos> Nothing left of it now.
Hurry. Come on. We have to get out of here now.<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Tip! Tip...<eos> I need my medicine. - Hurry up!<eos> - We can't leave without it.
I don't believe this.<eos> Flint would have fought to the death before allowing it.<eos> He resisted... at first.<eos> But then I told him what else I had heard about this place.<eos> I was told prominent families amongst London society made use of it.
Flint would have fought to the death before allowing it.<eos> He resisted... at first.<eos> But then I told him what else I had heard about this place.<eos> I was told prominent families amongst London society made use of it.<eos> I was told the governor in Carolina made use of it.
I know this.<eos> But I cannot believe that that is all there is.<eos> I cannot believe we are so poorly made as that.<eos> Incapable of surviving in the state to which we are born.<eos> Grown so used to the yoke that there can be no progress without it.
Dad.<eos> I didn't say it back.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> He's got a pack.<eos> Theo's not in it.
Hey, I came as soon as I heard.<eos> Is Dr. Brennan okay?<eos> Well, we just got to wait. You know, right?<eos> The lab is... It's-it's a mess.<eos> But it's usable, and she's there now.
I'm even in love with one.<eos> Bonnie Bennett, are you trying to kill me?<eos> I've never been this happy, Grams.<eos> I'm so close to the life I've always wanted.<eos> Please help me find Damon, so I can get back to it.
In this case, four teams were used... innocuous name, unidentified objects, extraordinary security.<eos> Whitehall.<eos> It says the transfer was made February 11th at the Stewart Air National Guard Base.<eos> If it was that important, there would have been aerial surveillance. From the Artax Network.<eos> But if you can access it, why did you wait to do it until now?
Why are we talking about glass?<eos> We just lost two of our allies.<eos> Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.<eos> And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?<eos> Apparently, it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.<eos> I never expected that you would.<eos> And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to that throne.<eos> I haven't either.<eos> I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.
I lost this dagger.<eos> To whom?<eos> Tyrion Lannister.<eos> Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.<eos> I will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.
Right now, tonight... Is a public emergency, and we need to think outside the box.<eos> The last thing I need is the FCC breathing down my neck.<eos> So we'll just sit on our hands and let these kids kill each other over a few blocks of turf.<eos> Come on, you know there's middle ground between doing nothing and this.<eos> Why not try to stop the worst offenders from perpetrating this violence before it happens?
You want to join?<eos> No, it's all right. Thanks.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I'm only a third of the way through this.<eos> A partner just gave me an assignment and I can pull another associate onto it.
This isn't mine.<eos> I knew the perspective was off.<eos> It's Cam's fault.<eos> He made me copy it from a photo.<eos> You know what? I accidentally destroyed the original, and I couldn't live without it.
- Um... - Erin, we gotta go.<eos> - But it's all we have.<eos> - Thanks. - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Body inside the house. Or, you know, what's left of it.
- I thought you'd be at the office.<eos> - Don't lean against it.<eos> I was.<eos> I read your ending.<eos> You bagged it.
Go, go, go, go!<eos> Harpoon<eos> Noooo!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Next time they shine your light in the sky, don't go to it.
Earth's most powerful propulsion device is right in front of us.<eos> Who? Spitty McGee here?<eos> The volcano!<eos> That's our magnet launcher.<eos> All we need to do is seal the steam vents around it.
His mates, Chloe and Danny, got it into their heads that this old lady, Mary Aminov, had something to do with it..<eos> And they hounded her.<eos> Kept knocking on her door, night after night until in the end.. She couldn't take it any more.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> By the time we found the body, the foxes had got to it.
- We gotta go!<eos> - We gotta go!<eos> - Wait!<eos> There was a piano.<eos> She went to it and waved La Marseillaise in front of all those Germans!
Of course we're gonna arrest him.<eos> But you know any good lawyer could get that confession thrown out, but now that we know where the murder weapon is, all we have to do is go get it, get the prints off it, we got an airtight case. Right.<eos> And then the good news for us is?<eos> The good news for us is that, you know, given all the things they can do now... - The technology.<eos> - At the lab, even if he washed that murder weapon down with bleach, we could get his prints off it. - Exactly.
My fourth wife, Constance... a sweet girl, bright, but she had her notions.<eos> Cricket in the house means good luck, a moth in the house, bad.<eos> And the bed...<eos> Jesus, the bed.<eos> No hats on it, no brooms near it, nor any clothes in it that were worn outdoors.
Mm, she met someone else... younger, more age appropriate.<eos> I'll spare you the gory details.<eos> She put in for a transfer.<eos> It was a big relief for both of us<eos> - when it finally came through. - I'll bet.
- My lawyer.<eos> - Oh good! So tell me, what've you been up to?<eos> How's the apartment?<eos> It's great.<eos> I'm just getting settled, starting to feel like it's mine.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> My daughter gave it to me 'cause I'm kind of a foodie.<eos> I love truffle butter.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I'm kinda famous for it.
I hear her voice in the house, still.<eos> She had a very soft voice... like a little bell.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> So... this is life again.<eos> I've barely seen it for the past year... especially in such abundance.
Perhaps this city has it right, Hank.<eos> Shed the past, move on.<eos> - You sound hopeful. - Ah.<eos> A new sensation for me.<eos> I shall attempt to get used to it.
Someone in the DA's office wants you dead, Mr. Castle... and we'd like to know why.<eos> You let us take your case, we can soften your sentence, and give you a shot.<eos> Maybe even find out who's responsible for what happened to you.<eos> We're talking about your life, Mr. Castle.<eos> We can help you keep what's left of it.
He has not even kjentmannsprøven.<eos> He's not going off the road to kill.<eos> Are you a little NAP, you take the wheel allows he.<eos> Look at your life, Roy.<eos> Are you proud of it?
There's at least three more here.<eos> Huh. I think that's it.<eos> The shooting happened right in the middle of the road.<eos> Somebody just walked up to the car?<eos> Maybe another S.U.V. drove up beside it and fired.
Check it out.<eos> Ooh, look at you Zillowing.<eos> That's right.<eos> Oh, it's gorgeous.<eos> It may be a little big for me at the moment, but I could see myself settling there and growing into it.
The people who took me and helped me heal and move past everything that happened. They're responsible for who I've become today.<eos> But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.<eos> Come on, Barry.<eos> Not everyone gets that kind of support.<eos> Without it, I don't know where I would have ended up or what I could've become.
All right, we have you over her left shoulder.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> All right, all agents stand by.<eos> Dr. Reid will give the green light.<eos> Don't move until we have it.
- Your apartment.<eos> - Do you rent or own?<eos> - I rent.<eos> Good.<eos> I might need to borrow it for a few hours later.
I got to pee. Is that okay?<eos> Keep an eye out.<eos> - No. - Yes.<eos> It is my business too!<eos> I built this empire, and you're willing to throw it away and wash your hands of it.
She made me who I am.<eos> Okay, we don't have a way out, but we didn't have one before anyway.<eos> My magic's working now.<eos> So let's do this heart split.<eos> That way, when we find an exit, we can get through it.
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.<eos> Just let me have this one, okay?<eos> - Have it, have it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So if you run around the city fast enough to create a refracting field, the device can send out a pulse that'll bounce off of it, split apart, and collide with itself over and over.
Actually, I do.<eos> Or at least this little bit of it anyway.<eos> Charlie Fraith.<eos> Gustav, put the gun down.<eos> Then as you well know from our copious correspondence, there is an ancient right-of-way across your field and we intend to use it.
- I'd rather die.<eos> You can't mean that?<eos> I lived in the wrong body, Bea, for 32 years of my life, okay.<eos> I woke up, every single morning, wanting to tear it off like it was an ill-fitting suit.<eos> Just step outside it... and just be me.
Well, I'm sorry I don't have more to offer, but as far as I know, I'm his only weakness.<eos> Okay, I know it seems a little creepy, but we should be safe down here.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> What the hell is that thing, and why is it chasing us?<eos> I don't know, but if it comes close, I can get a shot at it.
If we solve the Lobos murder, you solve it.<eos> I won't take any credit.<eos> - All right, what's up?<eos> - All right.<eos> The cell that was found on Lobos when he was killed... What was the phone number attached to it?
God, it must've cost a fortune, this.<eos> It says she ordered that yesterday.<eos> Now, what does that tell us?<eos> Not a lot.<eos> What woman would order herself brand-new saddle and then top herself before she'd had the chance to use it?
Everything he did, he did for you.<eos> It goes like this.<eos> "I carry your heart with me.<eos> I carry it in my heart.<eos> I am never without it."
It's all beyond your control.<eos> Full of good intentions, leaving a trail of havoc in your wake!<eos> Or perhaps you can't help this, either.<eos> I oppose this marriage, Elizabeth.<eos> I'd be glad of your assurance you will not go through with it.
Can't I just wave it around and frighten off - the mosquitoes that way?<eos> - Oh. It seems we have company.<eos> Hello, Rosa, come and join us.<eos> The most pressing problem is the need to repair that truck.<eos> Without it, we can't get out to the villages to start the vaccinations.
This is Rafalski. 10-23 up on Gander Road.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We received an automated alarm from this residence, the call went straight to 9-1-1.<eos> Just wondering if you could tell me what you're doing here.<eos> We must have tripped it by accident.
I'll be your life coach.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Okay, fine, I tried.<eos> It's your life.<eos> Whatever's left of it.
It just needed a new switch.<eos> And he built a firepit in the backyard.<eos> - I dug a hole and put some bricks around it.<eos> - What?<eos> Course, the Secret Service won't let us use it. Aw...
- Jackie, I'm... I... I...<eos> I... - You're not welcome here.<eos> You know the rules of the court order.<eos> Yeah, I'm here because there's something wrong with our daughter.<eos> There will be constant injuries to you while I link the anchor to your body and the heart beats in and out of it.
All right, how about a unicorn?<eos> Right?<eos> I bet you don't have one of those.<eos> No, that is true, yeah.<eos> Might be fun to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh, maybe break off the horn, grind it up, snort it.
This is as far as I care to take you.<eos> The living cling to life above all, but the trophy misprized is to die in peace.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Some animals are afraid of the light.<eos> Their instinct is to stay hidden from it because darkness means safety and protection from predators.
How many of these seizures have you had already?<eos> Oh, you don't understand.<eos> When things are tough at home and money's short, I eat first.<eos> Then Theo, then my dad.<eos> And I get the best mattress, even if I can't really enjoy it.
Yeah, but they got Cabe.<eos> And Walt and Tim and Fart and Backside.<eos> - Hands up! - Drop the laptop.<eos> Turn around slowly.<eos> It's too late! This metal box is on U.S. soil, and it's overflowing with evidence incriminating you.
She'd been renting a house in Ewa beach, but before that she'd moved around a lot.<eos> She even lived under a few aliases.<eos> Okay, that means whatever secrets she was able to learn that night have gone to the grave with her.<eos> But we know now that the FBI was spying on the Cabinet.<eos> Which means they may have had advance knowledge of the assassination, which means they let it happen.
No speculation.<eos> For years he worked in the Military History Institute until the Communists locked him up.<eos> And his basic idea is:<eos> Munich was not a national tragedy, just the opposite, it was the greatest diplomatic victory this country had since 1918.<eos> The only tragedy was the myth that emerged from it.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Were you- can I wipe this thing?<eos> - What, I got food on my face?<eos> - Beauty mark.<eos> No, you're prettier without it.
Yeah, totally.<eos> Hey, do you ever bring chicks up here?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I think I want to sleep in a bed made of your voice.<eos> I'll get right down to it.
He's with Ethan Burke.<eos> Well, maybe he wasn't with Ethan Burke.<eos> Yeah, but Ethan checked in by e-mail at 1:21 PM from Lowman, Idaho, where they stopped for gas.<eos> Jimmy, anything could have happened between Lowman and the ball of fire - by the side of the road 20 miles later, okay? - Just take it easy.<eos> Including the possibility that Ethan Burke's body was so badly burned that there was nothing left of it.
No, I understand, but my wife tried that, and I don't think I wanna do it.<eos> Didn't turn out so good.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> With treatment, you'll still have a very good chance of recovery.<eos> Without it...
Save a couple dances, darling.<eos> Not exactly, sir, but the girl has been handled and the video has been erased.<eos> On that front, at least, you are safe. That video is embarrassing. The drive is treason.<eos> You'd best find it.<eos> Yes, we'll toss the room before we leave. I'm confident we'll find it.
Look, I don't know what protocol is for something like this, - but letting you keep it sure ain't it. - All right.<eos> - Give me a hand.<eos> - Fine, fine!<eos> - Watch it! - Or what?<eos> What else can happen to it?
It's a way of poisoning the atmosphere so that the jury doesn't focus on the allegations, but focuses on this atmospheric that the government has created that in some sense is a diversion appealing to the emotional aspect of it<eos> so that if the proof is weak, the benefit of the doubt doesn't go to the defendant, where it belongs, under the presumption of innocence, but it goes to the government because there are these awful things lurking out there<eos> which aren't part of what we're supposed to find. The government doesn't have to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt, but they've injected them in the case in a way that is toxic to an impartial evaluation of what the evidence is on the charged crimes.<eos> So people come in with a preconceived notion and that's halfway there to guilt.<eos> Previously, the Murder-For-Hire was in there as a charge and then it was dropped.
Neither of us knows where our lives are going to go.<eos> It smells like chewing tobacco, soda and smoke.<eos> And the conversation is the best one I ever had.<eos> David thought books existed to stop you from feeling lonely.<eos> If I could, I'd say to David that living those days with him... reminded me of what life is like, instead of being a relief from it.
- Zarontin.<eos> It's for my seizures.<eos> It's an anti-epileptic.<eos> "Anti" mean against and...<eos> It's much better than Depakote because it doesn't make me constipated.
I don't know if they change that much.<eos> Bottoms up.<eos> Cheers.<eos> ♪ And the freaks in the middle ♪ That's not what I was expecting.<eos> Nick's been renting the same apartment on Virtual Slumber and using it to cheat on Beth.
Tell me what chance this has of success.<eos> Be honest.<eos> Ultimately there is tremendous support for every part of the package.<eos> This entire battle is being waged over the pardon provision.<eos> Without it, I could get this passed in a matter of hours.
But he's coming back later tonight.<eos> Tonight.<eos> They cut me loose.<eos> But something this important needs doing, leave a fucking whore to do it.<eos> I can go get it.
You can just use the FLOTUS window.<eos> Looks right down onto the Oval Office.<eos> - You can?<eos> - Sure.<eos> A lot of anxious First Ladies use it.
A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.<eos> I'd have been fine if that little game of Russian Roulette ended it.<eos> But since I planned and executed the elimination of Judge Spangler, my life had taken a new turn.<eos> I understood why people loved life and saw it as something joyous to experience.
Blood.<eos> I, uh, don't know what it is.<eos> I have a class to teach.<eos> Look, it isn't Christian, Egyptian or African.<eos> I can't seem to find any reference to it.
It was a heartfelt apology.<eos> What about that was an apology?<eos> I said I'm sorry in it a bunch.<eos> I'm sorry, I worked really hard on my story.<eos> It's about a robot horse, and I would really like to get back to it.
Okay, well, do you know where Ray is?<eos> Ray's a politician now.<eos> He's shaking hands and kissing babies.<eos> That's his life.<eos> We're no longer part of it.
I was just leaving.<eos> Over my dead-hand.<eos> That's why you really sent the oracles after me.<eos> You were after my box.<eos> And I'm not leaving without it.
- Yeah.<eos> You're staying with me.<eos> I got my place all fixed up.<eos> Put an extra bed in the parlor for you.<eos> Had a lady down the hall make a curtain to go around it.
Are you alone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, Christ.<eos> Come on, the emergency exit is our only option.<eos> The problem is getting to it.
_<eos> Please don't leave me here.<eos> It can't be over.<eos> Our ancestors used a missile to destroy the world.<eos> We're gonna use one to get back to it.
- But if his prints are on the inside, game over.<eos> - Oh. There's an envelope in the front seat, sir!<eos> Hey, can we just wait until the bomb guy gives the all clear?<eos> "The police are welcome to this car.<eos> Hope you have as much fun with it as I did."
- You don't want to go there.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Thank you... Sir.<eos> Where's your gleichheit?<eos> If I see you without it again, then you won't need a mask.
Maybe we can get a dispensation.<eos> This... this doesn't have to mean the end of your career.<eos> Could you not do that?<eos> - Sir?<eos> - I love the army, Captain, but I gave up everything for it.
Honey, you're young.<eos> College will always be there.<eos> The dreams you have now may not.<eos> Life is unpredictable.<eos> It'd be a crime not to take advantage of it when you can.
I've been trying for days.<eos> I can't live like this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You can shoulder this burden, let it consume you from within.<eos> Or you can wield it as you have.
I have A.L.S.<eos> Yeah, but that's...<eos> Incurable.<eos> There's only one outcome...<eos> And it's coming.
You think you know it all.<eos> And, God, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted out of life.<eos> Didn't have a clue.<eos> But now... it's weird now.<eos> I just... it's like my life got a whole bunch more complicated, but what I want out of it got a hell of a lot simpler.
'Cause if that's what you thinking, you missing the point.<eos> I had to lose it all before I saw the light.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> I succumbed to temptation.<eos> Now, any man can walk towards temptation. But it takes a real man to walk away from it.
Okay.<eos> Chloe.<eos> Chloe?<eos> Did you know that by week 16, your baby's only the size of an avocado but it can hear?<eos> It says you're supposed to, like, talk and sing to it.
Now you're here on... damage control.<eos> Actually, I'd like to skip the damage control, and talk about Samila Mahdavi.<eos> The dead Iranian woman?<eos> She had a laptop in her possession when she died.<eos> I'd like to have access to it.
There'll be 6 mounted armed guards and 2 bodyguards with her.<eos> A 2nd convoy will join at Marly.<eos> I'll kill her in the forest, then.<eos> You're sure you can do so?<eos> I know a perfect spot, used it often.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> And-- and the realtor said there was a-- there was a home office, and I've always wanted one.<eos> Listen, this is a great house.<eos> You should buy it. But whatever you do, turn this room into a den.<eos> When you have a home office, you use it.
And unless you're gonna suspend me or assign me to desk duty and put me on probation, I don't really want to talk about it.<eos> Hey. Sit down.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> My friend, you are trapped in ice.<eos> When a traumatic event happens to us at a certain age, we tend to always relate to it like we're still that same age.
He's after me, boss.<eos> Go.<eos> Oh, baby. You disappoint me.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> I suggest you use it.
I'm sorry, I just don't understand why you called us down here.<eos> Look, I know Detective Chisolm.<eos> And he's a nice man, but he's lazy.<eos> He thinks this case is solved, but it's not.<eos> And I know you two are crackerjack investigative reporters, and if I give you an acorn, you're not gonna rest until it is a giant tree.
~ Is that actually yours?<eos> ~ It's still mine, yeah.<eos> ~ Oh, wow. Do you know what, though?<eos> I spent more money...<eos> That car cost me 895 quid and I spent, I think, 950 quid on the sound system for it.
Ingenious.<eos> One final defense mechanism.<eos> Hide a single tree amidst a thousand.<eos> Ingenious, yes, but no defense from us.<eos> Now take us to it, my little sprite.
Mmm, Phil.<eos> Oh, there you go, you big camper.<eos> Oh, now put the food in the bear box.<eos> The food's in the box, baby.<eos> Put it high up in the tree so the bears can't get to it.
You ran this town into the ground.<eos> No, Roger, I didn't.<eos> I risked everything to set you free from those cocoons.<eos> Because I love this town.<eos> And I'd do anything for it.
Stop.<eos> I know where the egg is.<eos> I stole it.<eos> It's here on Bird Island.<eos> Take me to it.
Where were we?<eos> What?<eos> - I don't want to have to hide in closets.<eos> - I know.<eos> We both agreed that our work is too important to walk away from it.
Shot my brother Lev right here in the corner.<eos> Blew his brains out right in front of me.<eos> You call me a monster.<eos> Well, this is where they made me.<eos> If you hate this place so much, why did you make it your headquarters?
Okay. By hearing what's going on in there, we'll be able to know if Kirsten is in trouble.<eos> The agency really outdid itself.<eos> We've got a backscatter X-ray infotech, an infrared vibration receiver, oh, and this baby here it's called a blowfish.<eos> It acts like a cell phone tower.<eos> Pinpoint the location of any phone that tries to ping it.
Well, did you... have a good teacher?<eos> I mean, most people, they need to take a lot of lessons before they can play the piano well.<eos> How did you start?<eos> Me and my mom were at the mall, and I saw a piano in the store.<eos> And I ran up to it, and I played a song.
Dog told us that there's a Transair flight that lands at midnight, midnight every night, in Los Angeles-- you understand what that means.<eos> It's gonna take off any second.<eos> I did the math.<eos> So you understand that we're gonna be late.<eos> The only way this vehicle is gonna go any faster is if you throw yourself out of it.
Does that not make me appear weak?<eos> A young Queen cannot afford such powerful enemies.<eos> There seems little point to being Queen if I must please my enemies before myself.<eos> The throne gives the illusion of power... .. but you need support.<eos> You cannot rule without it.
The ex-fiancé. That's him.<eos> There's two beds in the guest bedroom.<eos> And the sofa opens up into a bed as well.<eos> The most important question is... Where is the wine?<eos> I hear you french are very famous for it.
But I like...<eos> I like my life.<eos> It has taken me a long time to get here, to build a life where I'm actually comfortable, much less happy.<eos> I'm not about to toss it.<eos> As a matter of fact, now that I think about it, I'd like to get back to it right now.
And then...<eos> I got set up with this girl who I really liked and she Googled me.<eos> And that was it.<eos> It was over before it started.<eos> Do you know what it's like to realize that for the rest of your life, when someone searches your name, the word "rape" comes up next to it?
Why would he kill her?<eos> Relationships get screwed up.<eos> You'd know all about that. Right? - That's enough, Lee.<eos> - Oh, I might have guessed you'd take her side.<eos> Ryan's pillow still warm when you hopped in, was it -- mate? - No!
- It's completely different.<eos> - Is it? I worked for that man 60 hours a week for 10 years, And now that I want to start my own company,<eos> If that's not ruining a person's life, then I don't know what is.<eos> Oh, and as far as Travis Tanner goes, Sexual harassment wasn't his idea. It was mine.<eos> And when he tried to talk me out of it, I told him he could either get on board Or watch me get another lawyer.
She knew she was not entirely out of the woods.<eos> ♪<eos> [Inhales deeply]<eos> You're up early. I didn't hear you get out of bed.<eos> Uh, yeah, that's 'cause I never got in it.
Well, I'm no contractor, but I think it still shows promise.<eos> And you know, I read somewhere actually that walls are overrated.<eos> I think that was Outside magazine.<eos> Well, it's your call... But this place obviously means something to you and it just...<eos> Doesn't seem right to give up on it.
Was there a cooler panel on Khempa_BAR_'s body?<eos> Er... why yes Sir, there was...<eos> Who must have kept it?<eos> Who would have kept it?<eos> So why didn't you take it for fingerprints?
Yeah, I looked. I looked down there.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Why didn't you wait the six weeks?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> I mean, if someone hands you a box and says there's something super crazy inside, but you're not allowed to look in it, of course you're going to look in it!
If people aren't breaking the law, what do they care if we're listening?<eos> We would be breaking the law if we used any of this Intel.<eos> If it ever got out, we could go to prison. Whoa!<eos> Whoa. And who's talking about prison?<eos> We just received a directive from the White House Chief of Staff, and I for one intend to act on it.
Second sip always goes down easier.<eos> You've reached Dash Parker.<eos> - Please leave a message.<eos> Where the hell are you, Dash?<eos> There's something up with the murder from last night; there's no record of it.
"Crime tech report shows no identifiable ridge detail on the vehicle inside and out,"<eos> that doesn't belong to Cecilia.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We know Matthew drove this car the night he was killed, so shouldn't his prints be in this report as well?<eos> Not unless someone else, who was in the van, wiped it down before Cecilia drove it today.
Open!<eos> Is he nuts?<eos> We gotta support government's work.<eos> You're the only hold out, take the money and sign.<eos> Look at next town over, people are flocking to it.
You can't, lord.<eos> Just taste my blood and control the power.<eos> That's it!<eos> Guardian vampire Hae-soo was centuries old.<eos> Maybe he could control it;
You can go as the front, I'll go as the back. Hm ?<eos> Don't be ridiculous !<eos> Why, you think people might catch on, eventually ?<eos> Lizzie, life is so short.<eos> Why don't we just suck the marrow out of it, while we still can.
Got them from when he was 17, boosting cars, some things worse.<eos> Wouldn't be too flattering if it got out, especially since he's an officer.<eos> Would damn sure get him off our back at 51.<eos> Listen, whatever you choose, I'll back you up. You know that.<eos> But in my experience, when you step down in the gutter, part of you never leaves it.
My little girl's got her name in print! Did I miss something?<eos> Only that your granddaughter's now a published writer.<eos> I just think it's stupid they're talking about ghosts as though they actually exist.<eos> I thought you were into all that gory stuff.<eos> A corpse is fascinating enough without Casper popping out of it.
You'd do that over again?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't do it over again because... because of all this.<eos> But the, uh...<eos> I think in the final analysis, the issue of the May 13th statement probably will never come up in Brendan's case again.<eos> The state most likely is not gonna use it.
Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sellin' it off to Marty Corcoran.<eos> If I may, sir, that place is a gold mine.<eos> Neither me or you or Match or none of us has been out there in years... for it to be worth the taxes I cough up.<eos> Marty's priced it at a mean dollar.
Oh, don't be silly.<eos> She's an amazing woman.<eos> She's remarkable.<eos> She just lives life.<eos> She just grabs it by the horns.
A guest reported seeing the two of you having a conversation.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - I made a comment to her about how different she looked... that night from how she appears in this picture.<eos> Is that why you kept it?<eos> You were seen having a conversation in front of it. Before she went missing.
But most importantly, for the disregard it seems I've shown you.<eos> The most important element of a healthy ship is trust.<eos> Trust between men.<eos> Trust between captain and crew.<eos> Without it, a ship is doomed.
My boss is upstairs at the reception.<eos> He wants to meet you.<eos> He read your story or at least, half of it.<eos> He loved it.<eos> He... he said it was a little episodic which only means he read it in several sittings.
What do the others do?<eos> Gene, you're always talking about food.<eos> What do you think?<eos> The liver, anyhow.<eos> The heart if you can get to it.
- It would be helpful if...<eos> - Go right ahead.<eos> No amount of force will grant you access to that motor.<eos> Allow me.<eos> "I swear by my life and my love of it... that I will never live for the sake of another man... nor ask another man to live for mine."
Oh.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> The Taggart Bridge collapsed.<eos> Listen, Frisco, I'm ready.<eos> "I swear by my life and my love of it... that I will never live for the sake of another man... nor ask another man to live for mine."
Ava, we've provided alternative accommodation for you and your dad.<eos> Oh, yes, I've seen it.<eos> A poxy caravan on the other side of the village.<eos> It won't happen.<eos> I'll pull that place down before I let you take it from us.
-Fifteen million?<eos> -That's in American dollars, sir.<eos> -Of course it is.<eos> Well, plus running costs.<eos> You own it, we rent it out for you in the weeks you're not using it.
I was coming to talk to you.<eos> What you did to my father was cruel.<eos> Sweetheart, I understand...<eos> Your job was to prep him for his speech before parliament.<eos> Not prove that he's incapable of giving it.
You're his bookie.<eos> Listen, you could either talk to me now or you can wait until I've had a Rico task force assigned specifically to make your life hell.<eos> What did you say your name was again?<eos> It's Moretti.<eos> But you'll get used to it.
I'm not going to apologise again.<eos> We used to share everything Rose.<eos> That is what marriage is supposed to be about.<eos> Oh, Harry, that's you all over.<eos> You want marriage when it suits you and drop it when it doesn't.
Science has made it possible for us to construct this family tree for all the species of life on Earth.<eos> Close genetic relatives occupy the same branch of the tree, while more distant cousins are farther away.<eos> Each twig is a living species.<eos> And the trunk of the tree represents the common ancestors of all life on Earth.<eos> The stuff of life is so malleable that once it got started, the environment molded it into a staggering variety of forms-- 10,000 times more than we can possibly show here.
But the oceans this Navy sought to control were vast, unknowable, and full of terrible danger.<eos> And for all the crown's might, its ships were often lost to starvation, to storm and tempest, and to pirates.<eos> So it was that in 1712, the Crown offered a prince's fortune to whomever could create a device that would allow its Navy to navigate this great emptiness with a precision never before known.<eos> With this device, the empire would increase its dominion over the world.<eos> But without it, the ships of the Crown would continue to be easy prey, not only from the gods and monsters of legend but from a monster far more brutal and far more real.
I worked in a factory once.<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> I assembled brakes.<eos> A car is a car!<eos> Solange asked me to look at it.

One, by one, they've taken over towns by putting passengers inside of townsfolk.<eos> We think they're doing the same thing in Mystic Falls.<eos> We're in.<eos> This body's incredible.<eos> Don't get used to it.
The geezers vote.<eos> Do you think my hair looks too shiny?<eos> Hey, so, City Post is reporting Rowley's PAC just got a major donation from, what's-his-face, the golf-course guy.<eos> They put it at a million and a half.<eos> Oh, fuck. I bet Rowley danced like a little monkey-whore for it, too, that dick stain.
_<eos> _<eos> Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.<eos> Your life's not ruined. Yeah, it is.<eos> What's left of it, anyway.
Or saw.<eos> He'd have had to come right past you in that storeroom.<eos> I didn't like to say before, in case he thought me daft.<eos> But there's this tiny crack.<eos> I put my eye to it.
- Took you long enough.<eos> - We got here as fast as we could.<eos> - Traffic was horrible.<eos> - Do I look like I care?<eos> Get rid of the body before it starts to stink... and the rats start eating it.
- We were trying to reach you.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - How dangerous are they?<eos> - Extremely dangerous.<eos> This device turns any moisture around it to ice very rapidly, at a great range.
Where's the antidote?<eos> You must think I'm stupid.<eos> If I tell you where it is, you'll just kill me and keep it for yourselves.<eos> He's not wrong.<eos> Well, then you're gonna take us to it.
Oh, no, I can't.<eos> Sure you can.<eos> We'll help you pack.<eos> No soul can leave this place without being granted forgiveness.<eos> To leave without it... It would break down the walls between the worlds.
You'll finally be free from this place.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Sure, you can.<eos> We'll help pack. No soul can leave this place without being granted forgiveness.<eos> To leave without it would break down walls between the worlds.
I'm not putting pot, like, up inside of me, 'cause I'm an adult, and I'm responsible.<eos> Let's go get some candy.<eos> (both) Ooh...<eos> Kids used to say it would take them, like, a week to get to the center of one of these bad boys.<eos> But I know the trick to gettin' right to it.
This is fresh-squeezed typhus.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Where's the antidote?<eos> You'll just kill me and keep it for yourselves.<eos> You're gonna take us to it.
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.<eos> And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?<eos> A laptop.<eos> The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.<eos> Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Ooh, that would stink.<eos> The backscatter X-ray is low resolution, so there's very little detail.<eos> That's fine.<eos> You got him?<eos> The radiation just reflects off the target, it doesn't pass through.
Well, tell us, then.<eos> Concealment, perhaps.<eos> Concealment?<eos> It's a fanciful theory, but it fits the facts.<eos> By destroying the body so completely, you conceal what is missing from it.
No, I haven't forgotten.<eos> It's OK. My mother killed herself when I was seven.<eos> Left me alone and unwanted.<eos> There's suffering all around us.<eos> Why not take some pleasure from it?
Why?<eos> There's a cure... but he wouldn't drink it.<eos> - I'm confused. - Yeah, so am I.<eos> Because it was right there.<eos> Salvation was right there and he wouldn't take it.
Omar.<eos> Papa.<eos> Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.<eos> Your life's not ruined. Yeah, it is.<eos> What's left of it anyway.
I got a big fucking cloud over me.<eos> I'm talking a world of trouble.<eos> With Martha?<eos> Worse.<eos> If there was a way out, I'd take it.
I cloned Antti's drive.<eos> I can see anything that goes through it in almost real time.<eos> There are more messages going out to Stefan right now.<eos> How can it not be illegal?<eos> If suicide is not illegal, causing someone to do it is not either.
We need to speak with Peter Cordero's boss.<eos> Jamie Berman, I believe?<eos> Can I tell him what it's regarding?<eos> Killing.<eos> Are you capable of it?
Yo, I talked to the manager at Suisse Federal.<eos> He confirmed that a bank account with those numbers exists, but he refused to give out any information on it.<eos> Did he at least acknowledge it was Peter Cordero's account?<eos> He couldn't, because he didn't know himself.<eos> It's a numbered account, set up for privacy. So the only way that anyone can access it is with a password.
It's so advanced it's almost alien.<eos> I've been able to isolate a few strings of nine-digit numbers, but... no clue what they mean.<eos> What happened after the system locked you out?<eos> I couldn't shake this feeling that I wasn't testing the system.<eos> I was showing the government how to break into it.
Do we tell him the "new guy at 51" job is jinxed?<eos> Maybe he'll be the one to break the streak.<eos> Test is in five days, huh? Must have blocked it out.<eos> One second I feel 100% ready, and the next I'm panicking.<eos> Well, here's a possible solution. You could just not take it. - Sorry.
God forbid they find the bodies and we get caught over something stupid.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's done.<eos> God forgive us.<eos> God created this life and made us live it.
Why would they do this?<eos> Why would they risk their lives because an old man died naturally?<eos> Peter, put the past behind you and you can have a future.<eos> Mrs Greg has given you a new life.<eos> Embrace it.
So much worse than I expected.<eos> - What?<eos> - Listen...<eos> We got to move the party, and we got to make it hype!<eos> Stop saying "hype." I'm not moving the party, and I'm not compromising the integrity of the party by making it a mind-suck on wheels just to lure guests.
It's okay. He's a doctor.<eos> Baby, mama's here. Mama's here.<eos> You can fix her, right? You can fix her.<eos> They're on approach now, so, you know, within 30?<eos> Okay, well, I just... what I need to do is confirm with you that the back entrance is gonna be available to us. It is.
What is this place?<eos> It used to be a sanctuary for butterflies.<eos> Monarchs.<eos> My sister took me here once.<eos> They still use it on their way to mexico.
It's a figure of speech, Ryan.<eos> It means he has AIDS.<eos> About your happiness?<eos> I'm on it, dude.<eos> Should lead you to it by tomorrow, Monday at the latest.
No, no.<eos> I... I had a little game going for a while, but...<eos> You know, it just got to be too much.<eos> Um, why don't I go see if he's ready?<eos> Oh, let's put the eggs on the middle shelf, and then meat goes on the bottom so if it drips, it doesn't ruin everything.
Let's start with the people we trust.<eos> I will walkie Tom and Andrea.<eos> Have them meet us at the Sweetbriar in an hour.<eos> There's finally a way out.<eos> And I don't know if we should take it.
You're not leaving this town.<eos> You don't tell me what to do.<eos> Not you. Not the dome.<eos> This is my town, little boy.<eos> Enjoy what's left of it.
But you don't have a life-threatening condition.<eos> Why would you take the risk of surgery?<eos> Sheldon, it's a routine procedure.<eos> I've heard you complain about his snoring.<eos> Yes, for the first five or six years, but I've gotten used to it.
- I am?<eos> It should be melting away.<eos> I'm the only one with this power.<eos> I should be able to undo it.<eos> I know this town might seem strange at first, but you do get used to it.
You're a coward.<eos> And you are a hypocrite!<eos> You preach about socialism and then you go home to George Allingham.<eos> You know nothing of my marriage!<eos> I know that you've martyred yourself to it!
- Better, better.<eos> He's back in sinus rhythm.<eos> - Good work, Hank.<eos> Will this affect his participation in the clinical trial, you think?<eos> - Boris, I'm afraid he's not eligible for it.
Well, it looks like we're taking that break after all, huh?<eos> Be advised, the fence is live.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the fence is hot.<eos> Trust me, you do not want to go near it.
I looked inside of it and found one present, one yellow dress.<eos> Good girl.<eos> One more time.<eos> I was playing the piano.<eos> I looked inside of it and found one present, one yellow dress.
All you got to do is pick a school.<eos> Thank you for giving me a second chance.<eos> Awfully humid out here for a piano.<eos> Only temporary.<eos> The movers are making room for it inside.
It's so great that you're doing this for charity.<eos> Uh, but what's the cause we're raising money for again?<eos> The environment.<eos> No one even realizes how important the environment is.<eos> I mean, where would we be without it?
I'm so sorry, but I thought I heard his voice on your radio,<eos> - and I really just...<eos> - You know what you need to do is you need to remove yourself from the area...<eos> Herrmann, what's your status?<eos> Looks like that dang rotor rolled all the way through the neighborhood like a wagon wheel, but I think we're closing in on it.
Chaplain.<eos> Hey, good to see you.<eos> Mm. Hey, can I tell you the hardest thing about my job?<eos> What's that?<eos> People come to my office when they're in the deepest valley, but they stop coming once they've climbed out of it.
Trust me, Walden, he'll warm up to you just like I did.<eos> Remember when you moved here?<eos> I wasn't sure I wanted you to stay.<eos> I bought the house.<eos> And I made it a home.
Right, killing the roses.<eos> What's up?<eos> I just wanted to tell you I didn't know anything about him asking me to take the coaching job.<eos> You saying you don't want to do this now?<eos> No, I want to do it, but I didn't want you to think that I put WB up to it or something.
For when I think of their lives,<eos> Amadeu, Stefania, the others, their lives full of such vitality, intensity...<eos> So much so it broke them apart in the end.<eos> But they lived.<eos> Where is my life... apart from these last days... and now you're going back to it.
God's gift to me.<eos> His reward.<eos> A reward shared with the bank.<eos> This passage is very narrow.<eos> What's in it?
No one knows it's there. We're gonna go get it.<eos> Wait.<eos> You mean break in?<eos> Look, Marshall wants his gold. And he's gonna hunt me down until he gets it.<eos> If we show up without it, he'll kill me.
Where is your home? -Say what?<eos> Where is your home?<eos> My house?<eos> The site seemed else ... but the picture was black and white.<eos> Soon you'll get used to it.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Come on, papi.<eos> Yes!<eos> We've got our jam on now.<eos> Jump to it.
We have discussed going to Barthelona, but we are never going to go to Barthelona.<eos> Not with an attitude like that, we're not.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Wait, do you even hear yourself? Yes.<eos> I'm glad that you got to say some of that, because we're in a relationship, and I'm just glad that we're both committed to it.
I'll take care of the rest.<eos> Do you expect to live after what you have done to us?<eos> Who would know about it?<eos> Who knows about this place?<eos> The person who used to use it.
You want to feel such sweet and easy peace.<eos> The angel maker wants that same peace.<eos> He hopes to feel his way cautiously inside it and find it's endless, all around him.<eos> He's gonna be disappointed.<eos> You accept the impossibility of such a feeling, whereas the angel maker is still chasing it.

- Am I allowed to touch the chair?<eos> - Don't be smart.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Kale, brown rice and tofu.<eos> Your body is a temple, Carl, and you only want to put things in it that are natural.
Your Grace.<eos> He writes me "Lady Elizabeth Grey".<eos> He does not say "wife", he writes "my love"!<eos> There's nothing here that speaks of a marriage, Mother.<eos> Not a word to prove it ever happened.
- Aunt Maddie?<eos> - Wait, she has a vision.<eos> Lucy!<eos> Lucy...<eos> Egg of sapphire, And crows hatch from it, Time is running out,
Plus, I love history.<eos> I own a museum.<eos> None of the artifacts you bought from Sutton made it in your museum.<eos> It's my museum, Dr. Sweets.<eos> I decide what does and does not get into it.
You're on drugs.<eos> I don't want this around my kids.<eos> I'll be fine once we have some work.<eos> When is the next job with Schiller?<eos> Uh... do you think we can get a cut of it?
Well, there are no shadows, not anymore.<eos> Do you really think with Twitter and Facebook that a witch does anything at all she won't be videotaped and turned into some... viral freak show like a dog who says "I love you"?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is my life.<eos> You can't come in here and piss all over it.
You have access to a chopper, right?<eos> We set up roadblocks at both ends of the road, but he never reached them.<eos> So we closed in and found his car here.<eos> - Any other vehicles go through? - No.<eos> Anyone approach it?
Posters demanding his return were hung around the capital.<eos> ABDULRAH MAN BARMAN ABDULELAH'S LAWYER<eos> I met Abdulelah's lawyer at a teahouse because his office was under attack.<eos> They fired over 120 shells into my office.<eos> And now we can't reach it because the Republican Guard are deployed in the area.
And make swift return for more.<eos> I shall try not to kill to many Romans short of your presence.<eos> You've had your fill of women and drink?<eos> I'm a man of the sea.<eos> And do not belong from it.
- Nothing.<eos> So, you're buying a condo.<eos> I am!<eos> My friend Jenny, she was looking at it first.<eos> She wanted to turn the bonus room into a gym, but it's gonna make a much better recording studio.
Did you know that there was a secret passage?<eos> Because I am totally hosting a murder-mystery dinner.<eos> That's what finally got you to commit, a secret passage?<eos> Mm, and, uh...<eos> Someone to walk through it with?
- If you can go out with her?<eos> Yeah, that'd be cool, right?<eos> Not right.<eos> Not cool.<eos> Ben, the minute I get my new desk, I'm gonna sit Jenna down in front of it and fire her.
Whether I am my father's son.<eos> Whether I am legitimate!<eos> George is saying that I am a bastard and that would make him the true York heir.<eos> Damn him!<eos> We will go and scotch this snakes' nest before it comes out of the ground.
How you feeling?<eos> How's your "widdle eaw"?<eos> Doesn't feel so good, Dad.<eos> It's really aching.<eos> And there's blood crusting off of it.
I've warned you about dark magic before.<eos> It's not dark magic.<eos> It's expression, and I need it.<eos> They found a cure, Mom.<eos> There's a cure for vampirism, and I can do the spell to access it.

- Yes.<eos> - Make you uncomfortable?<eos> You know what's really uncomfortable?<eos> 20 years inside. Wyatt, why don't you just tell me what you want so I can give it to you, and you can get the hell out of here and open up an army surplus store, or a pawn shop, or whatever your stupid white trash dream is?<eos> I want to dismantle your life piece by piece until there's nothing left of it.
This is me.<eos> This is you. Hmm...<eos> Well, thank you for...<eos> For running away from my life with me.<eos> Are you in that much of a hurry to get back to it?
Bay, I did this for you.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I'm sorry, mom, but you did this for you.<eos> You asked me to save your drama club!<eos> I didn't ask you to join it!
We all know your opinion on this, Jeremy.<eos> But right now I'm the one speaking.<eos> Brothers and sisters, words only have power if we give them power.<eos> We must take back the word "retard."<eos> Make it ours.
We're bleeding out here.<eos> [ Metal clangs ] Come on, man. It's me.<eos> Now it's wet me.<eos> You forgot the knock.<eos> What's the point of a secret knock if you don't use it?
Go.<eos> What the...?<eos> Looks like they cleared out.<eos> Think we found our lab.<eos> Yeah, what's left of it.
You know she's never gonna change, so why not learn to be the bigger person?<eos> I am being the bigger person.<eos> Otherwise, she'd be in the emergency room getting my sensible shoe removed from her hateful old rump.<eos> Wow, you know, right there, you sound exactly like my dad?<eos> When we do have a baby, I'm not letting that nasty woman anywhere near it.
- So I can refute it to people.<eos> - It's my refuting copy.<eos> - Get rid of it.<eos> Refuse it.<eos> Okay, look, if the VP did have a window, it'd be a high one and she'd push you out of it.
Spent all my time at the pierogi factory.<eos> Dab the potato, fold the dough.<eos> That was my Star Wars.<eos> Well, Dumbo had a magic feather.<eos> He thought he needed it to fly but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time.
Everything disappeared like in a cruel movie<eos> As for the pits near the hospital where I buried so many dead and my mother, my sisters... They became a manmade lake made by an international organization<eos> Bones were taken<eos> Pumpkin and corn were planted<eos> But the lake is so salty and so oddly green that nobody dares to use or drink it
I borrowed Scott's car.<eos> I had a meeting with the coach at Marston Prep.<eos> What, were you just gonna... you gonna ditch us in the middle of the season?<eos> It was just a meeting.<eos> Nothing came of it.
- It's me.<eos> Well, I assume you're not calling to catch up.<eos> Fi, I need your help.<eos> Michael, I have spent the last year trying to put my life back together.<eos> What was left of it.
- Truck stop security cameras?<eos> Limited to gas pumps, cash registers and bathrooms.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - What about the car?<eos> - They never went back to it.
Okay, so that's that.<eos> How about we go get a drink? Hold on.<eos> Tell me what you liked about it.<eos> Uh, what I liked about it.<eos> Okay, well, the beginning just... it started the whole thing off.
That's how it works.<eos> Temporarily brings your spirit here.<eos> To go back, you have to reconnect to your body.<eos> My body's not even here.<eos> It's because each time you die you wake up farther and farther away from it, and you wander the other side until you find it.
Well well, look at that.<eos> Chief, you think Karen might have...<eos> I mean if she had been connected to this, why not just tell us when she first confessed?<eos> Well, someone had to know about that account.<eos> Someone else must have had access to it.
I can hear music coming from the inside, but can't tell if he's home.<eos> I could go knock on the door.<eos> If he is there, I could see if this Cory guy looks funny.<eos> No, the ground we're on is too shaky.<eos> Captain, if Cory was driving the car when Briana Mathis was pushed out of it, he gives you everything you need to make a deal.
No, he'll be too exposed at a hospital.<eos> Wouldn't matter anyway.<eos> He was poisoned with a custom-made toxin we can't reverse-engineer.<eos> You want to save him, find the antidote.<eos> Without it, I give him 24 hours tops.
Then I looked again, and I saw a messenger coming down from heaven, and he cried out aloud, "Cut down the tree!<eos> "Trim off its branches.<eos> "Strip its leaves.<eos> "Scatter its fruit.<eos> "Let the beasts flee from under it
Ciera want you to succeed. Because you want your children always have, and win.<eos> ButI haveonetribe count me.<eos> knewhecouldnot beatme, and we could go home.<eos> Galang, another victory.<eos> No challenge not have gone without it.
Your dad threw you down a well?<eos> In Minecraft.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> I was able to hoist myself out.<eos> It was like I was frozen in the lake he had no idea how to swim out of it.
But what is money anyway?<eos> You know, it's just paper that some king on the mountains said was worth something.<eos> You know?<eos> Gold, I understand.<eos> It's shiny and you can make jewelry out of it.
♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x09 ♪ Platonish Original Air Date on November 11, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Look, guys, just, seriously, don't worry about me, okay?<eos> Just let me deal with this on my own.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible, Robin.<eos> Once I've accepted a challenge, it cannot be unaccepted.
Flora, go with Denise.<eos> Miss Flora, have you ever seen The Paradise at night time?<eos> I did, once, have a dream of Moray.<eos> But, I promise you... that dream is dead.<eos> I am free of it.
Now we got a groove.<eos> Yeah. There we --<eos> It won't budge!<eos> The hell is this wood made of?<eos> They ought to make saws out of it!
Shoot them.<eos> Shoot them all.<eos> We both know that I have to kill you now.<eos> You'll just have to imagine the fire.<eos> About the whole no-guns thing I'm not sure I feel as strongly about it as you do.
In any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected.<eos> We had to get up at 6 in the morning and plunge into a lake.<eos> It was a small lake not far from the castle.<eos> It was fed by an icy mountain stream.<eos> We had to enter it running, in a double file.
We all come from the sea, but we are not all of the sea.<eos> Those of us who are, we children of the tides, must return to it again and again.
To Jay!<eos> To Jay!<eos> To Jay!<eos> We all come from the sea, but we're not all of the sea.<eos> Those of us who are, we children of the tides, must return to it again and again until the day we don't come back, leaving behind only that which was touched along the way.
The camp is a place where every activity and human impulse is senseless.<eos> Where, in other words, senselessness is daily produced anew.<eos> So, to summarize:<eos> If it is true that in the final stage of totalitarianism, an absolute evil emerges,<eos> absolute as it no longer relates to human motives, then it is equally true that without it, without totalitarianism, we would never have known the truly radical nature of evil.
Do you mean sangria?<eos> I'm- - We don't have that.<eos> - Do you have wine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Put fruit cocktail in it.
My son.<eos> Mehmet.<eos> I am your grandfather, Osman I founded our principality.<eos> My successors, your forefathers, your father turned this principality into a strong state.<eos> And you will turn it into a mighty empire.
Ooh.<eos> Man!<eos> Where are we?<eos> We're in some liquor truck and we're on our way to the abandoned mall on highway 59.<eos> Did you say we're going to the mall or coming back from it?
I go home this way a lot, by this tree.<eos> - It's beautiful, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, really beautiful.<eos> Believe it or not I talk to this tree, and it talks back!<eos> I sit beside it for hours and write.
Our intel was wrong.<eos> I didn't anticipate the Fairy Warrior or the Succubus being there.<eos> He must pour quite the pint to employ such loyalty.<eos> Pity about the eye...<eos> But, if you have no use for it...
The mail pod's crashed.<eos> - It exploded.<eos> - It turned into a giant death worm.<eos> It's turned into a jacket.<eos> - A giant death worm's come out of it.
Here, take...<eos> Well, you said you liked the rain.<eos> This body is super bendy.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> And you should probably start referring to it as "my body."
Lassie, Jules,<eos> - we're here to help.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> Here's what I need you to do.<eos> Get back into your car, make like a bat out of hell for the ocean, and then drive straight into it.
A warning from history.<eos> You've just arrested Ben Wilkie but beware.<eos> An innocent man hanged himself because of the Ratcliffe murders.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The police arrested John Williams because he knew Timothy Marr and was at the Williamsons' house on the night of the second murder, had no money before the murder and had some silver after it.
We can't back off now, Kate.<eos> Think about what Janice said about the.. The big meeting.<eos> That could be the key to breaking this whole conspiracy.<eos> We have no idea when that meeting is supposed to happen.<eos> For all we know, it already did.
(MOANS SOFTLY) In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain.<eos> I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog.<eos> If I had my mouth, (MOANS) (SOFTLY) I would bite.<eos> Can you make no use of your discontent?<eos> I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead.<eos> I ran to my sister, Siobhan, for help.<eos> Siobhan killed herself, and I assumed her identity.<eos> It was so easy.<eos> I saw a way out, and I took it.
Ever seen this before?<eos> Yes, it's my jewelry box.<eos> That's what we found the heart in.<eos> Don't you see what's happening here?<eos> Someone stole that box and put the heart in it.
And what I'm feeling...<eos> It's love, Mary Margaret.<eos> David, why are you here?<eos> Because Kathryn put a down payment on an apartment in Boston.<eos> She's not gonna use it, but I am.
Thou art... Dust and food...<eos> For worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
Let me introduce...<eos> - What is this?<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> You used my personal life without telling me?<eos> Turned it into some cheesy headline to move your merchandise?
O God of battles!<eos> Steel my soldiers' hearts. Possess them not with fear.<eos> Take from them now the sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.<eos> Not today, O Lord, O, not today, think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown!<eos> I Richard's body have interred anew, and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood.
I've canceled the tour.<eos> - We're going home.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, what about Cardoza?<eos> I'll be careful, but I have to face my life and not run away from it.
It was a good plan, one that only a conspiracy freak like you could come up with.<eos> Frame Stella by framing yourself so that you could challenge Derek's new will.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Your big mistake, though, was throwing in with Sean, who, through his cryotherapy, knew that Derek had a wine cellar, a hot wife, and a taser to protect it all, but who lowered Derek's wine cellar too low too fast<eos> when he froze Derek's body and oxidized about a quarter-million dollars' worth of wine. [ Laughing ] Plus, if that wasn't stupid enough, he remembered to replace the taser back in Stella's secret spot but forgot to wipe his own prints off it first.
Hey!<eos> You're dragging something under the truck!<eos> Hey, under your truck!<eos> Two kids skating home from a party that went into the early morning found the body.<eos> Or what's left of it.
- Now, does the name Theo Tonin ring a bell?<eos> - No. No? Let me tell you about Theo Tonin.<eos> The man carries an ear in his pocket.<eos> He carries a human ear in his pocket.<eos> And when he wants to talk to somebody, he wants to get their attention, he reaches into his pocket, takes out the ear, and he speaks directly into it.
It's believed the egg might have been accidentally moved by a cleaner or even a practical joker, but however it happened, Lord Tenguiz declared he was delighted to have his egg back.<eos> As you can see, the egg is now...<eos> Mmm. I'm no legal expert, but I'd imagine it's quite difficult to charge someone for stealing something that hasn't been stolen.<eos> Wouldn't you say?<eos> 'The egg is now back in its rightful place, and what a piece of art it is.
"Why do I have any right "getting stressed out about anything when I know that that light is waiting for me?"<eos> And here's the thing, it's not just when you die.<eos> It's here.<eos> I think it's here. I think it's all around us.<eos> And it's just waiting for us to tap into it.
I'm serious.<eos> Just come back tomorrow.<eos> Hey, hey! I got a bail bondsman on my ass!<eos> I need that new driver's license now!<eos> I ain't leaving without it!
Can I use this perjured testimony, now in the record, to question this opposing witness?<eos> You must represent the interests of your client.<eos> You were not aware of the perjury when it happened.<eos> To not use that perjured testimony would be to poorly represent your client.<eos> So, yes, you can use it.
Maybe if I back-fish the instruction set.<eos> Maybe you should have backed it up before you started playing with it.<eos> Shane embedded a self-destruct worm in the phone's base code.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> The phone's programmed to wipe out its memory if anyone attempts to access it.
Young is better and the government should not say children should have older people, they should just say to my daughter, go to the pub and pick up your dad.<eos> Cadillac has made a concept car, and here it is, it's called the CL.<eos> It looks astonishing.<eos> It's got a twin-turbo V6, and they say it is going back to their roots.<eos> What, so it will rock for 5 hours after you get out of it?
I don't know, you don't live that long.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I mean, life isn't that long.<eos> 80-some years.<eos> Buy some shit, use it, it breaks.
Thou art... Dust and food...<eos> For worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
A friend of mine lives in Knightsbridge, in the middle of London, wanted to go and see Chelsea play at Stamford Bridge, put Stamford Bridge into the sat nav and only realised something was wrong while going past Peterborough on the A1, on the way to the TOWN of Stamford Bridge, rather than the big football ground.<eos> How daft d'you to be to do that?<eos> It's only a mile down the road.<eos> How thick do you have to be to believe what the digital pretend woman on the dashboard says over what you can actually see out of the window?<eos> I mean, the sea, for example, it's big, it's blue, the top of it wobbles around and isn't suitable for motor vehicles.
I have to take you into custody now.<eos> I want you to lay face down.<eos> Easy. - Cameron...<eos> - You turned her in!<eos> Please understand, if I had any other option, I would have excercised it.
Get Buzz to check security cameras surrounding the building.<eos> See if any of them caught our shooter coming or going.<eos> Mr. Reyes, you said this apartment's on the market?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Who has keys to it?
Well, I don't like talking to you that way, okay?<eos> I just wanna be sweet to you. That's the thing that's...<eos> But I also wanna know why you didn't text me back.<eos> What, to the picture?<eos> Ljerked off to it.
I just wanna be sweet to you. That's the thing that's...<eos> But I also wanna know why you didn't text me back.<eos> What, to the picture?<eos> Ljerked off to it.<eos> You jerked off to it?
To be perfectly honest, we wanted an excuse to get away from Courtney.<eos> She's so superficial and shallow, and all about how men respond to her appearance.<eos> Yeah, don't you just hate women like that?<eos> So how come you like is tree so much?<eos> I've been walking past it for 60 years.
Now that we're alone, I'll speak frankly.<eos> I come from a long line of people who can make other people disappear, as if by magic.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> And here I am, trying to live a better life and do the right thing and you bring all this negative shit into it.
You better come quick, sir.<eos> Can't keep his nose out, can he, eh?<eos> Hey, DS Arnott - kindly desist.<eos> I want this car impounded as evidence.<eos> I want it cordoned off and I want HIM kept away from it.
You may not.<eos> But honestly, why put yourself through all that for people you just met a few years ago?<eos> Look, man, I'm just trying to give you a second chance.<eos> You know what?<eos> Clean slate just isn't all that appealing if I have to sell out my friends to get it.

We work so hard so we like to dance and flirt and live!<eos> Come on!<eos> Another night I will.<eos> If you don't join in, be one of the girls, you won't last long here.<eos> It's a good life if you go with it!
Tandang has their second puzzle finished.<eos> They're now working on their third and final puzzle.<eos> One more.<eos> Like tetris.<eos> Matsing was out of this challenge and they're now back in it.
Ammonium nitrate, probably-- maybe a smidgen of C-4.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Two champagne flutes, two different shades of lipstick.<eos> He had company. Computer's got a firewall.<eos> We're gonna need Eric to crack it.
I know you wanted my help. He just... Makes me so angry.<eos> No one deserves to be treated that way.<eos> I wanted it back then.<eos> The cure.<eos> I was willing to leave behind my family for it.
Oh, Shania, sweetie, this baby isn't related to you.<eos> The doctor planted another lady's egg in me that was fertilized with David's sperm.<eos> Mom, this baby's growing inside you.<eos> It's absorbing all your love and niceness and yogurt.<eos> Plus, I talk to it all the time in Spanish.
Some other kid you bought?<eos> What, that's it?<eos> Where's he going? !<eos> Guy actually has a conscience.<eos> Gibbs is gonna take a hammer to it.
And that was something that the stunt driver, he somehow couldn't quite handle.<eos> And I guess the real turning point was what was a very simple shot, two or 300 yards up the road was a right-hand corner and then driving up the hill into the next chase scenes.<eos> And mysteriously, the stunt driver had disappeared.<eos> So the camera crew who were parked up on top of a hill said, "Well, bring the car up anyhow."<eos> So I jumped in the car, absolutely flailed it up the road, slid it round this corner, up the hill, onto this dirt area where they were parked, all sideways, and when the dust settled,
It's terribly shameful.<eos> The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election-<eos> Quite right. Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?<eos> Gentlemen, if we don't cut spending we will be bankrupt.<eos> Yes, the medicine is harsh... but the patient requires it in order to live.
Who? The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.<eos> They say he rides an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Enlightenment.<eos> We are nothing without it.
On the other side is a black circle.<eos> The circle of Death.<eos> It's formed by the crowd gathering around the execution like flies.<eos> And here below is the tree of Death.<eos> A horse's skull next to it.
And of course, you cannot.<eos> You travel in space and survive?<eos> The cylinders are made for such a purpose.<eos> Further, My brain is immune from disease here, and even age.<eos> And my body is perfectly preserved if I ever wanted it again.
It's God's gift to mankind.<eos> - You gotta love the pig.<eos> - Hurl.<eos> What about the baby?<eos> You're gonna raise it vegetarian or not?
- for this spaghetti.<eos> - for this spaghetti.<eos> It's so yummy<eos> - and it is so good - Mm-hm.<eos> That God didn't put mushrooms and meatballs in it.
She's my best friend 's kid.<eos> That really hit me.<eos> I spent about a year working on developing the concept.<eos> Sooner or later the National Institute of Health gave me a $50,000-grant to develop a prototype for reproduction.<eos> Anyone ever use it?
Let's not make this a thing.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> What is this?<eos> Where's my soft-boiled egg?<eos> I scrambled it.
I'm the one with something interesting to say.<eos> Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art.<eos> In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.<eos> I sense that you're trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany.<eos> Would you mind very much jumping to it?
-Yeah, that's it. -Okay, okay, this is it.<eos> We're right here.<eos> Looks like the tunnel's entrance is in a shaft.<eos> -Right behind the crew-break area.<eos> -How do we get to it?
So it cannot be that.<eos> But I am too tired to be examined.<eos> Your tiredness may in itself be a symptom of illness.<eos> You examine me every week.<eos> What harm can it do to leave it undone just this once?
Yeah. This thing, a specimen from the '69 outbreak?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> The military's worst kept secret.<eos> I've been training this bastard for ten years.<eos> You know, the government wants to shut it down.
Nothing.<eos> I got a bad feeling that this is a mistake.<eos> I mean, while we're sitting here, that thing is putting as much distance between us as possible.<eos> No, the creature knows we're hunting it, so it needs to protect its lair.<eos> To do that, it has to make sure we never reach it.
Yeah, I get on that.<eos> I hope you're planning on sharing that.<eos> - How far did you get this time?<eos> - Airport.<eos> Sat there for two days, ate bad airport food and prayed on it.
I had it preserved.<eos> The last of my clutch.<eos> If Lisa proves disloyal, she can be replaced.<eos> This egg is my only alternate to interbreeding.<eos> The very survival of our species may depend on it.
Cities.<eos> The advent of the city is a defining feature of modern civilization.<eos> Its role is to enable efficient access to the necessities of life along with increased social support and community interaction.<eos> So how would we go about designing an ideal city?<eos> What shape should we make it?
Hacker?<eos> It's probably someone from the bank, confirming.<eos> But I'd have to look into the account details to be sure.<eos> You'd need the password.<eos> I'll arrange a time for us to go to the bank so you can access it yourself.
Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> It's about to.<eos> Second 911 call had the same signature as the first.<eos> Murder was reported before it happened.
Losers go to tribal council, where somebody will be the first person voted out and the first person sent to Redemption Island.<eos> This is what you want right here.<eos> This little statue guarantees your safety in this game.<eos> When you're in possession of immunity, you can't be voted out.<eos> Without it, you are vulnerable.
The few plants that have managed to grow over the short arctic summer are dying back.<eos> This is exactly what is happening on Arnoy island, northern Norway.<eos> 3,000 reindeer have been grazing here all summer.<eos> But now they have to move, because their winter food source, lichen, can only be found 450 kilometres away.<eos> And to get to it, they'll have to cross this, the Arnoy strait.
And we will not fall out over this.<eos> But you don't agree.<eos> I would just say one thing;<eos> Marriage is a long business.<eos> There's no getting out of it for our kind of people.
Not at all.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I know I've been a disappointment to you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But I've relied on your support for too long to do without it entirely.
We got a lead on Johnny D.<eos> Meet us at Femme Nu.<eos> All right, I'm on my way.<eos> Okay, you've become acquainted with my office already.<eos> Feel free to use it for as long as you need.
I'm honored, then.<eos> Back when I was a kid, there was this old lady.<eos> She lived in the creepiest fucking house in the neighborhood.<eos> All the local kids, we used to avoid the place like the plague.<eos> We used to run past it as fast as we could.
I really envy you.<eos> I am really happy for you.<eos> But you forgot one thing.<eos> Your body is still at Lan York Tze.<eos> Without it, you can go no where.
Walked out on his family, maybe, even wrote a postcard like this.<eos> So the unsub picked a site of significance to them both, a spot known to local fisherman that he turned into his prison.<eos> But that's gone now, so where will he head next?<eos> Well, he can't go back to that spot, but he won't leave Jacksonville either.<eos> That prison was his responsibility, and without it, he'll cling to what he knows.
There comes a time in your life when everything falls into place.<eos> That dream, you've been working towards for years.<eos> You've torn your knees for it on the dance floor.<eos> You gave up everything else for it.
'But I know that the time will come when words will fail me.<eos> 'When I can no longer write my books,<eos> 'I'm not sure that I will want to go on living.'<eos> ..I will stop the fight when I deem that one man has definitely had enough.<eos> I want to enjoy life for as long as I can squeeze the juice out of it, and then... I'd like to die.
- Nothing in the kitchen.<eos> - Are you feeling okay?<eos> I actually feel pretty terrific, like super duper focused.<eos> Why are you staring at my ear?<eos> I don't know, but I can't take my eyes off it.
I've given up classifying people.<eos> Moreover... the hero and villain don't matter... because I'm the vamp in every story.<eos> I want to go home... will you take me there?<eos> You see that window?<eos> I escaped from it on the eve of my wedding.
once we submitted it to the state lab for DNA, it had Michael Perry's DNA on it.<eos> Which means the body had fallen-<eos> Had fallen on the cigarette after it was already discarded on the ground.<eos> The other body was Jeremy Richardson.<eos> From where we actually found his body, it was so dense with trees, we couldn't even get into it.
Which means the body had fallen-<eos> Had fallen on the cigarette after it was already discarded on the ground.<eos> The other body was Jeremy Richardson.<eos> From where we actually found his body, it was so dense with trees, we couldn't even get into it.<eos> I don't know how he got into it.
A tree?<eos> Our fate rests on a tree?<eos> Let's get back to the fighting thing.<eos> The tree is enchanted.<eos> If fashioned into a vessel, it can ward off any curse.
Eliot, that is our first solid lead.<eos> Look, if Lacey signed that photo, she's touched it.<eos> That's my thinking, too.<eos> Parker, grab the photo.<eos> We might be able to tell something from it.
Why are you telling me?<eos> Because I want you to hear it from me in person that if Kane does step down, I don't want the earth tremors it will cause to give you any doubts about my intentions.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, this doesn't affect our plan one way or another, right?<eos> - Why would it? - I don't care about the others.<eos> I want you to tell me now that you care just as much about putting me in office as you do about dumping Kane out of it.
And I'm sorry.<eos> I should have trusted you.<eos> Which is why I've, uh, come to a decision. What's that?<eos> From now on, your love life is just that-- your love life.<eos> I'm going to stay out of it.
How can we wrap this up? It can't go on.<eos> - Somebody's gonna get killed.<eos> - Let me talk to Joey first. To what end?<eos> I want to find out what his guilt trip is.<eos> Try to cure him of it. Might be more complicated than you think.
When's the last time you saw Kaplan?<eos> When I rented him the apartment.<eos> - You haven't seen him since?<eos> - Don't think so.<eos> You don't find it strange that someone rents an apartment from you then doesn't use it?
Cec said he had something for he'd kill for.<eos> Thought it was insurance.<eos> Cec always was dumb.<eos> What kind of insurance?<eos> You'll be safer without it.
- Oh, don't flatter yourself! - Alright, alright!<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy!<eos> Now, what were you saying?<eos> What do you know about the gold?<eos> I know there's a way to get it.
Like a videocamera.<eos> And then when it's needed I find it later.<eos> I then I can easily march into the bedroom and when it comes to that, I close my eyes and turn on the autopilot.<eos> And here I see the pictures I want.<eos> And the body does what it's gotta do.
You really serious about taking that job at the Stowaway?<eos> Right now, all I'm serious about is taking you to the bedroom.<eos> Then what are you waiting for?<eos> Guilt is a powerful affliction.<eos> You can try to turn your back on it, but that's when it sneaks up behind you and eats you alive.
He is not gonna let up.<eos> He is just waiting till I crack.<eos> Honey, you're panicking over nothing.<eos> The body's gone.<eos> Chuck doesn't have a case without it.
We'll get started.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> For immunity and reward, survivors ready?<eos> Go!<eos> Any way you can get that meat off using your mouth, and then wring it back and spit it in the basket.
Because I thought it was too soon.<eos> Siobhan...<eos> We talked about it.<eos> This baby changed things.<eos> And without it, I just don't know where we stand.
It's here.<eos> That means I've had it the entire time.<eos> But how did they get the footage?<eos> Maybe I could help if I had any clue what you're talking about.<eos> Someone leaked the video that I shot of Teddy's wedding to the press, which is impossible because no one else had access to it except for me.
Dinner time<eos> Taiwan...<eos> A film? No way. He is just an underwear model<eos> Maybe even wearing nothing Just like the two poor guys at that ridiculous wedding Mom you have a good sense of humor<eos> How can one live without it?
What did I just say About vomiting in public?<eos> Change seats<eos> And the emergency exit is...?<eos> -13D trust me, I know where it is.<eos> About to throw myself out of it.
Are you a thug?<eos> Fight now!<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You can't grab anything now.<eos> We attached rocks to it.
As soon as I went into it, I lost any sense of being different.<eos> Any sense of what I was doing, past, any sense of future.<eos> It was absolutely blissful and euphoric and I just felt like it wouldn't I. I was everything.<eos> I was the light, there is no sense of separation, no shadows, no differences no past, no future, it was all present and a white-yellow light.<eos> Then I felt myself falling out of this light, and as I felt out of it, I could feel the light was like a glow, like the sun with flames coming out.
Of all the planets to put a stargate on, I would think that...<eos> Looks like we weren't the first ones here.<eos> It's massive.<eos> 2,000 feet high, at least.<eos> We detected a faint EM field around it, but nothing else.
That makes it a good in itself, and certainly more important than your desire for revenge.<eos> Madam President, I don't want revenge;<eos> I want justice.<eos> And I want peace.<eos> If there were another way, I would take it, but there's not.
But the baby is okay, all right?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Did you?<eos> We saved it a spot.
I'm seeing a shrink because my wife's dying.<eos> There's your opposition research.<eos> You'll be happy to hear I came with transportation.<eos> Your chariot... and your box of ultimate mystery.<eos> Did you look in it?
He isn't the one that had to gain Daniel's trust.<eos> Probably saw me as a waste of resources.<eos> - I'm sure that wasn't the case.<eos> - He wanted a quick and easy collar and I couldn't give it to him.<eos> And when Daniel wanted me on his team, I didn't bottle it.
Look, this is all happening too fast.<eos> What if she's singing on the tape?<eos> What if she's terrible?<eos> Or worse-what if she's better than me?<eos> I can't believe we're so close to your dream coming true and you're running away from it.
He's so handsome.<eos> Brianna, where's his crib?<eos> It broke.<eos> I got it second-hand, and it just fell apart.<eos> He was trying to get out, and it just busted up.
I'm not sure.<eos> Seeing you again changed so much in my life.<eos> Me too.<eos> But I don't even know what my life is right now.<eos> I mean, I lost five years of it.
From the outside, I looked the same after the blackout.<eos> But inside, I was different.<eos> We've lived believing not knowing the future made life difficult.<eos> The truth is... that it's vastly more difficult knowing what lies before us.<eos> "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."
Oh, yes, he is.<eos> I tried the piano once.<eos> Oh, did you enjoy it?<eos> You know, I have one at home.<eos> Ahm... uhm... I never really get to play it though.
I'm sorry things went a bit tits up for a while.<eos> But I'm glad I said it.<eos> I think sometimes it's good just to be honest, then you can make changes and move on.<eos> - Now go and blow them away. - Ok!<eos> So Tess, I might have an old CV, but it says the last thing you did was a year ago, Casualty.
pacemaker, defibrillator... record players, sewing machines...<eos> Yes, it'll all be turned off.<eos> And what if we leave it on?<eos> Well, um, his body's failing.<eos> And eventually, his heart will stop beating, but the defibrillator will shock it back to life.
They really have to choose which girl to save?<eos> I know. It's awful.<eos> Right now they're willing to let both girls die When they could save one.<eos> I mean, how's that make sense-<eos> To have a cure and not use it?
Sir, dent seems a little big for a guy to fall from a tree, If you ask me.<eos> That's 'cause he didn't fall from a tree, walter. How do you mean?<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> See, the tops of these branches are sheared off, walter.<eos> Means he fell through the tree, not from it.
He gets away with murder.<eos> Why would he write about it?<eos> Why risk it?<eos> Writing is probably a symptom of his psychosis, like taking a trophy.<eos> He both memorializes the deed and distances himself from it by turning fact into fiction.
Knowing that with one touch, my own children had the power to destroy me again.<eos> Found something?<eos> Her necklace.<eos> Now all we need is sunlight.<eos> The spell won't work without it.
The elder race? Yes, yes.<eos> There are rumors around town.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> Every ten years, the evil comes down to us from the mountains!<eos> And we caught it, and made it the mascot of the shopping center.
We will survive, but for how long? The loss of Jai Alai makes Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.<eos> It's an untenably insecure position.<eos> Harry, why don't you call and pretend like you don't Know any of this.<eos> Give it an hour so he'll take the call.<eos> I wish we really had a second floor so I could jump off it.
The prerogative of the wrongly accused.<eos> Play up to it.<eos> And no mere judge and jury could exonerate you, could they?<eos> That was left for the tabloids to decide, and they found you guilty, guilty of being The Evil Bitch From Hell.<eos> Aa-aahh! If you give a dog a bad name, some day it'll live up to it.
And then I dosed him with amiodarone.<eos> Carelessness or willful negligence?<eos> I was careless.<eos> Thank you for clearing that up for us.<eos> People, carelessness is actually worse than willful negligence, because by definition it can happen at any time, and it does.
Astrid, I need you to get me something.<eos> I need the organ donor.<eos> - Amanda Walsh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I need her body. Or what's left of it.
I'm swinging by her place to return her things she left at the suite.<eos> Gotta get rid of them so I can be done.<eos> Closure.<eos> The unattainable goal.<eos> In my personal experience, the closest I've come to getting it is through massive amounts of hate-sex.
The sound machine in his bedroom was tuned in to the ocean. That, and the fact that room 6-4-4 has already ordered six cans of spaghettio's from the concierge.<eos> You can't arrest him yet.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> He escaped because he knows the location of the device, and if we follow him, he will lead us right to it.
in order to mine gold and bring it back to their home planet.<eos> But why gold?<eos> What are the unique properties of this precious metal that might make it important and worth traveling through the galaxy for?<eos> I think, for extraterrestrials, gold would be an important resource just like it is for us.<eos> If it's at all like our society, one of the major things it's going to be built on is electricity, and gold really is one of the top conductors, and its malleability and its ability to make it into wires, use it in
But why gold?<eos> What are the unique properties of this precious metal that might make it important and worth traveling through the galaxy for?<eos> I think, for extraterrestrials, gold would be an important resource just like it is for us.<eos> If it's at all like our society, one of the major things it's going to be built on is electricity, and gold really is one of the top conductors, and its malleability and its ability to make it into wires, use it in<eos> really small forms as nanoparticles is going to make it an incredible technological resource for any sort of life- forms that reach that level of dealing with electricity and technology as we do.
This would be obviously a very nice clean energy source.<eos> With its capacity to create energy and conduct heat, some scientists believe gold may also be an invaluable asset in the construction of spaceships.<eos> Gold actually reflects infrared light.<eos> Infrared is basically light that's not quite red, and so you don't see it, but we interact with it as heat.<eos> The radiation will interact with your molecules and make them vibrate faster and you'll feel that as heat, so it makes a great heat shield, partly because it's so malleable.
JENNIFER HELDMANN: Each step that we take makes us a little bit less special.<eos> We used to think that we were the center of the universe, as humans, and then we realized, "Oh, all right, well, that's not true." And...<eos> But we're at the center of the galaxy, and, like, well, all right, so we're like two thirds of the way out in a spiral arm.<eos> And then, well, at least our sun, you know, with this...<eos> No. The sun is actually in the middle, and the earth goes around it.
Tempers running high already.<eos> Last thing you needed was another cowboy.<eos> Maybe he should've asked your permission before he went down there.<eos> He doesn't need my permission.<eos> But without it, he doesn't get your protection.
No, your Grace, right now, Boulogne is now far more important to me than Paris...<eos> Than ten Parises!<eos> No, we shall back to England.<eos> We have gained here a singular victory...<eos> And I mean to hold onto it.
Get that dog off my couch!<eos> You can't keep it, Jimmy!<eos> A baby will dramastically change your life.<eos> What are you gonna feed it?<eos> Do you even have clothes for it?
Well, you, uh, ready - for the big practice tomorrow?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Chloe was just giving me some advice.<eos> I really appreciate your support.<eos> I couldn't survive without it.
There is no evidence! I'm not trying to hurt anyone here.<eos> I'm not lying to you.<eos> This is smallpox.<eos> House, you have to examine the body.<eos> I'm not going anywhere near it.
Worth playing for?<eos> Yes!<eos> We'll craw for teams and get started. All right, we randomly drew for teams, and amazingly, we ended up with men versus women.<eos> Because we have 11 people one of you was not selected.<eos> Chase, you will not run in this challenge, but it doesn't mean that you're out of it.
Nash!<eos> Nash!<eos> Yes, Sarge.<eos> Why are you in Buckley's bed?<eos> I knew he wouldn't be using it on account of being dead, Sarge.
Thank you, Laszlo.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Very happy.<eos> This chair is really comfortable.<eos> It's one of our best sellers, comes with a how-to video that's amazing.
Madame president, Those are questions for the future.<eos> We have a decision to make now.<eos> What do you call this place?<eos> We like to think of it as ctu.<eos> What's left of it, anyway.
Let us share for a moment every preconceived idea.<eos> What shape would it show us?<eos> What shape? You once said that the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.<eos> Yes I did, good.. good Put it into words.<eos> The sun must be at the center, since we revolve around it.
What shape would it show us?<eos> What shape? You once said that the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.<eos> Yes I did, good.. good Put it into words.<eos> The sun must be at the center, since we revolve around it.<eos> And at the same time, in another position since our distance from it varies.
For one day, I could hold my head up high.<eos> We need a conviction, preferably today.<eos> You would think that after 35 years this would get easier.<eos> I'll do my best. Thank you, Tatsu.<eos> Until this is over, check your car before driving it.
Motherhood is not knowing what's going to hit you next,<eos> Motherhood is a day in May, a hot air balloon God's gift to womankind,<eos> What about when your child's hand is still so small that he or she puts that hand in yours with absolute trust?<eos> Their incredibly soft cheeks when you kiss them,<eos> The way their foreheads sweat when they're sleeping, and the hair sticks to it,
You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> - I don't joke about my daughter.<eos> Now, Mr. Goldstein, you better pray... /none of your friends /get there before I do.<eos> People said you left this life behind.<eos> You hurt me, you fall right back into it.
He killed his mother with that sword, Lee.<eos> Jesus God.<eos> With that damn thing?<eos> Brad was obsessed with it.<eos> I told him it is too dangerous for rehearsals. But he insisted on using it.
Right...<eos> Alice.<eos> I brought my cake, for the Brazilian kids.<eos> Wow, that is... elaborate.<eos> I'm sure you'll figure out where to put it.
So someone murdered the kid for leaving the fold.<eos> Then uses a knife to gouge out the bullet.<eos> - Buries the body under the bridge.<eos> - Knowing that the cognoscenti... will see the bullet and assume he is the murderer.<eos> But Murderbreath finds the body, puts it on display. Mm-hmm. Stealing credit.
Travis Dobbs and the guy that owns this trailer<eos> So, what, you just filled a bottle with this mysterious untested liquid And gave it to Nicky to drink ?<eos> - No<eos> - My dad didn't do anything, I did<eos> The spring... it looked so clean and fresh, I wanted to taste it
That's right.<eos> Courts rely on it to facilitate the juror selection process.<eos> Yeah, that software uses a pseudo-random number generator called the Mersenne Twister to assemble lists of potential jurors from DMV records and voter registration.<eos> That software has access to their names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.<eos> And who has access to it?
Michael, please.<eos> Look, I've tried to help you.<eos> You knew her, didn't you?<eos> You had Jeanette's photo, didn't you?<eos> You carried it with you everywhere.
Look, I've tried to help you.<eos> You knew her, didn't you?<eos> You had Jeanette's photo, didn't you?<eos> You carried it with you everywhere.<eos> You talked to it.
What?<eos> Come here.<eos> What?<eos> The mirror was broken.<eos> A hand came out of it at me.
Isabella, where are you?<eos> Come and get me.<eos> - That explosion.<eos> - The tunnel should be clear by now.<eos> I'd say there's a way out if you want it.
Please stop doing that.<eos> Fonzie. Homer Simpson.<eos> And the winner is...<eos> Homer Simpson! Yes!<eos> I'm Senior Class President! I get a parking spot if the Assistant Principal isn't using it!
He had it right.<eos> Enjoy what you can and move on. Way of the world.<eos> So save yourself, okay?<eos> I'm no good for anybody, and I don't wanna be.<eos> place sure looks better than it did when I used to break in and get up to all kinds of hell in here.
- From you two, upfront.<eos> What makes you think we'd give you that kind of money?<eos> The fact that the gold's still out there.<eos> That's what you're after, isn't it?<eos> He hasn't had a chance to get his hands on it yet.
Balsa wood?<eos> That explains why it was so light.<eos> Now, it's known for its strength-to-weight ratio.<eos> Right, it's usually used in model airplanes and surfboards.<eos> Now, the only prints or DNA I got off it were from the vic.
You saw it yesterday.<eos> We all did.<eos> And look at that stack of washing.<eos> Let me explain once more, child.<eos> It is your responsibility, not only to clean up such a mess, but to prevent it from happening in the first place.
Richard Owen himself purchased the most astonishing fossil for his museum.<eos> It had been found in this limestone quarry in Bavaria.<eos> The stone here splits into flat, smooth leaves that have been used as roofing tiles since Roman times.<eos> Most are blank, but occasionally, when you split them apart, they reveal a shrimp or a fish.<eos> It's almost impossible to resist the temptation of pulling down almost every boulder you see and then opening it like a book.
You'd be saving thousands, clark.<eos> The only way any of us are ever gonna be safe again is if doomsday is destroyed... for good.<eos> Doomsday is my problem, and i will handle it.<eos> Just, please, take care of chloe.<eos> I'm down to my last card, emil, and i really don't want to play it, so please take another look at the samples.
He wanted you. He wanted me.<eos> We could've been a family.<eos> Sam, you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know he loves you.<eos> I know... I know to follow my heart instead of locking it away.
You have no idea how special Zoe was to us.<eos> Or is.<eos> I gotta hand it to Vergis, it's an elegant design.<eos> But will it work?<eos> Well, I won't know until I put it into a cybernetic body and try and download Zoe's avatar into it.
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.<eos> Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory any way you can.<eos> I don't know him that well, sir.<eos> This memory is everything.<eos> Without it, we are blind.
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory any way you can.<eos> I don't know him that well, sir.<eos> This memory is everything.<eos> Without it, we are blind.<eos> Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.
Perhaps it is none of my business, Your Majesty but I am told that Mr. Lambert is well known to my Lord Cromwell.<eos> It appears that they were educated together at Cambridge and some six months ago when Lambert was apprehended on suspicion of promoting religious heresy my Lord Cromwell had the charges dismissed.<eos> Thank you, my Lord Bishop.<eos> What news of the king's marriage to the duchess of Milan?<eos> Alas, princess, I think it is not to happen.
You know you're gonna end up dead someday.<eos> - Thanks, now I feel so much better.<eos> - You should.<eos> You're going to die, no matter what.<eos> Hence the phrase, "Life is short, so make the most of it."
What is it, 11-12?<eos> Why is six so convinced there is another place?<eos> Because for people like six, life is not enough.<eos> The simple life...<eos> They want to escape it.
Good enough.<eos> You know what's great?<eos> Your mango salsa?<eos> Wine.<eos> Nine months without it sucked.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!<eos> Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.<eos> The time invites you - go, your servant tends.<eos> Farewell, Ophelia. And remember well what I have said to you.<eos> Tis in my memory lock'd, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Little stutter step with my ticker. But I feel great now.<eos> So, they adjusted your medications and stabilized you. But that doesn't mean you should leave.<eos> Look, I know some patients check out against medical advice for financial reasons.<eos> Luckily, my wife bought us good insurance.<eos> Then use it. Stay.
It feels pretty real to gwen, too.<eos> She gets a creepy, threatening email, She ignores the warning to forward it, And wham, car accident, she's dead.<eos> Her mother's hanging by a thread. Yeah, i'm starting to wonder about the power of that email.<eos> How's an email have power?<eos> Well, if there's a ghost attached to it.
Nobody wants to drive around with a small girl's severed head on the dash.<eos> The worst thing about this was that when it came out, we all got suckered into it and thought,<eos> "Three in the front, three in the back, it makes sense," but it doesn't.<eos> If you think, I've got two daughters, so if I have one girl in the front between me and my wife, that leaves one girl on her own!<eos> You're just gonna have an argument every time you go near it!
Sophie, come on.<eos> I'm not an amateur.<eos> I'm not gonna let a keyboard monkey like that con me.<eos> Where is your car?<eos> And if we hadn't come along, When, exactly, do you think you'd be getting in it?
- I like to think it stings a little.<eos> Jules, if you don't torch this cocky bastard, then I will.<eos> - No, no, I want to do it.<eos> - What is this weird mirror?<eos> No! Stay away from it.
Excuse me.<eos> Didn't I ask for a private room?<eos> This room is practically the same.<eos> The bed on the right is broken.<eos> It hasn't been used for long time.
- Throw it.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you think this marriage will not happen?<eos> It will happen.<eos> Stay here and watch how it happens.
Jones wouldn't have had a ladder.<eos> So we use the stairs.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> It's gotta all be about the window.<eos> The stairs lead right to it.
Well, you may return any time to view the treaty.<eos> You're very kind.<eos> - We may return, too?<eos> - You are always welcome.<eos> My heart will remain, and I hope to join it soon.
Wonderland's my home.<eos> I can't just abandon it, despite what I said.<eos> I have to stay and fight. What?<eos> Seeing all this-- Look...<eos> This great kingdom and what-- what has become of it.
Yes, I do.<eos> -You do?<eos> -lt's just all an act.<eos> We need the ring to get you home.<eos> The Looking Glass won't work without it.
This one's gotta go back right away.<eos> She'll have to wait.<eos> A raiding party is returning with fresh Oysters.<eos> The Queen's getting impatient. She wants the ring.<eos> We'll need it back. The Looking Glass will only work for a short time without it.
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.<eos> Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory any way you can.<eos> I don't know him that well, sir.<eos> This memory is everything.<eos> Without it, we are blind.

We hadn't even started yet.<eos> Yes, sir, I'll take care of it personally.<eos> You bet, sir. Thanks for calling.<eos> Hey, Mike, don't crush that car yet.<eos> The governor wants the hood off of it.
- And it was illegal, right, being gay?<eos> - Profoundly illegal.<eos> Now we're out and proud and we've got everything.<eos> Gay magazines, gay bars, gay saunas, gay youth groups.<eos> I'm very glad that I have lived into an age where happiness is there for those who know how to enjoy it.
- I will be all I can be.<eos> - Or be what everybody else wants you to be.<eos> - Having some troubles, ma'am?<eos> - I have no control over my life.<eos> Well, maybe you need to step away from it.
- Hey, okay. Two seconds.<eos> - Talk to me for a second.<eos> - Yeah, I'll talk to you all night. - All right.<eos> Didn't I just save your ass?<eos> I just cleaned up your bed and you're shitting in it again, okay?
But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in,<eos> I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help.<eos> Maybe it's the way you were raised.<eos> But, honey... it's okay to lean on people now and again.<eos> You need this treatment, and nothing can stop you from getting it, except you.
To remind you of sins you thought were hidden.<eos> Sometimes these sins are forgiven but when they're not, they fester...<eos> Guilt is a strange thing.<eos> You can see it in people's eyes, in the way they move.<eos> They carry it like a weight.
Well, I'm just saying that... that these psychos are the only reason this place ever stays open.<eos> Well... then I will just have to make it successful enough to run on its own.<eos> Salud.<eos> You know, the place is an arm pit.<eos> It never made nobody a nickel. I say we burn it down.
While drilling off the Yucatan Peninsula... they discovered a hundred-mile-wide impact crater... buried underwater beneath 3,000 feet of limestone.<eos> Analysis of the rock confirmed... that the craterwas, in fact, formed by an asteroid.<eos> And like Meteor Crater in Arizona... shocked quartz or glass was also discovered... at the K-T impact crater site.<eos> One of the other important lines of evidence... for the impact at Chicxulub was the finding of shocked glass.<eos> Basically, when they looked at the impact site... and in regions around it... and all around the world, in fact... evidence was found of glass that was fused. It was basically created when the giant explosion fused it.
However, nobody knows when the next one might come.<eos> It's a completely random process... so we have no idea when the next one will occur.<eos> It could be tomorrow, it could be five minutes ago... could be another hundred years. We don't know.<eos> If it is very close... you would see a very bright event in the sky.<eos> It could be even brighter than Venus or the planets... or even the Moon... or maybe even the Sun if it's bright enough.
Mr. Crusoe.<eos> Would you kindly lead the way?<eos> I will.<eos> If somebody else will kindly carry the powder.<eos> My father's crew captured the gold on its way to Spain, and they cast it in the shape of a cannon to smuggle it home.
No. I had no choice.<eos> Where there's life, there is choice. Staying would have cost me my life.<eos> I might as well have joined the rebels, because in the end, I had to flee like one.<eos> Robin, don't argue please.<eos> If there was any other way out, we'd be taking it.
Anyway, she quit therapy.<eos> I forgot to tell you, she quit therapy on Monday.<eos> Well, good. Now you can fuck her without worrying...<eos> - Or losing your license.<eos> - Or maybe now, I can try to save our marriage or what's left of it, which,
Footballers don't believe in Confucius.<eos> Some footballers are bald headed...<eos> I remember the day your father planted these trees.<eos> His hands were blessed.<eos> Once we ate apricots, he spat out the pit, and within a week it grew into a huge tree.
- Yeah, John, there.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> - Yeah. After 9/11, what would you say your biggest mistakes would be and what lessons have you learned from them?<eos> Now, I wish you would have given me this written question beforehand, John so I could prepare for it.
Sure.<eos> Uncle Michael, I came here in good spirits, and I don't want to let anything change that.<eos> Happy Fourth of July, everyone, and God bless America!<eos> Grandpa, get back to the story!<eos> I've never left it.
Strangulation marks.<eos> Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes.<eos> So what kind of shark strangles his meal before he takes a bite?<eos> Severed femoral artery, major tissue damage, massive blood loss: all postmortem injuries.<eos> Seems kind of coincidental that a shark would attack a dead body, and then wash up onshore right beside it.
What do you feel?<eos> Electricity.<eos> Electricity.<eos> I know I saw the symptom.<eos> I know the memory is locked in my brain, now I know how to get it.
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?<eos> Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.<eos> That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.<eos> Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.<eos> Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
He was put to death By lethal injection A year ago yesterday. Yesterday.<eos> Morgan: so we're looking for a copycat.<eos> Honoring the anniversary of his hero's death.<eos> It says here they found semen At the crime scene.<eos> Perhaps locals will get A DNA match when they Run it through vicap?
There has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.<eos> I can help you!<eos> All right, that's enough!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you see a light, pal, go for it.
That's FiberCon cereal with raisins added.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> But I want the raisons added from the Raisin Bran box.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Pour a bowl of FiberCon, open up a box of Raisin Bran, grab 20 or 30 raisins out of it.
I thought I was doing good and that curing Gwen's father would help her.<eos> I thought... I was saving a life.<eos> It seemed... so simple.<eos> An easy solution is like a light in a storm, Merlin.<eos> Rush for it at your peril.
- So round of applause for Artemis.<eos> - Very nice.<eos> She also transcribed my work into a format you might consider a little bit more legible.<eos> Or literate.<eos> She added words to it.
Not all of them. Actually, the first one that I kind of owned, I bought from a friend.<eos> I was 13 years old, I didn't have a licence. I wasn't registered insured.<eos> But I stole quite a few cars in my day. Did you steal the same guy's car a few...?<eos> He was... How many times did you steal his car? Probably, like, 10 or 15.<eos> I'd drive around, he'd find it or the cops would find it, bring it back, I'd walk down the street, jump in the car, pinch the window, unlock it and jump back in and start it.

- Hey, Stryker.<eos> - Hi, Nora.<eos> This place is just gorgeous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm very, very proud of it.
He played me the demo.<eos> It was good.<eos> Yeah, it's really good.<eos> It was good the first time I heard it. It was good the hundredth.<eos> He's really proud of it.
How dare you!<eos> Are you eating?<eos> Have you been stealing food?<eos> - Answer me!<eos> - No, sir. He gave it to me.
pearlman, too.<eos> - how the fuck you... how much longer does this...<eos> how are you not in jail?<eos> - i don't know.<eos> the lie's so big, people can live with it, i guess.
We don't even know where to start.<eos> - Where's the rest of the stuff you found?<eos> - Still printing it up.<eos> When my device was in Tuxhorn's house, it must've been next to his PDA.<eos> Sucked up data from it. I got e-mails and photos.
Remember when Lutz cried during that diamond commercial?<eos> Lt'd be worse than that. But I can't keep dressing like you.<eos> "The New Yorker" Festival is next week.<eos> We're trapped in a political minefield.<eos> How are we gonna get out of it?
Yeah, guys take you out, treat you special, bring you to all the best places.<eos> Let's roll, ho's.<eos> You guys can have a kiss fight to see who gets to eat the fruit that touches my syrup at IHOP.<eos> I'm not going to end up a worn-out ho having breakfast for dinner with an abusive Persian.<eos> I've lived that life, and Stan saved me from it.
I recognize that, but can 't we do something to speed this along?<eos> Bring in heat?<eos> Melt the ice?<eos> Whoever did this to her is almost certainly still at large.<eos> Hey,all those thoughts occurred to me. The problem is, if we heat the body or even just the ice around it any potential evidence... hair follicles, fibers from clothing, skin cells under the nails-- it'll all be contaminated by the heat.
Well, I'm assuming he died from his burns.<eos> No.<eos> Actually, our boy ate fire.<eos> Is that his lung?<eos> What's left of it.
I'm not looking for smooth.<eos> I'm looking to make you as miserable as I possibly can.<eos> Try harder. Been working for you so long, I got a high tolerance.<eos> Whatever you've got going on, it ends now.<eos> I want you out of Farmington and away from everyone in it.
He had touched it before.<eos> Where did you get this pie ?<eos> We thought you were having them delivered.<eos> Comes every week.<eos> I don't know how we survived without it.
- You should've thought about that. - No-<eos> The info on that chip's gonna save lives.<eos> Give us an option.<eos> Because after the strip search, we induce vomiting.<eos> I don't have the chip. But I can take you to it.
- That's okay, I'll ask him.<eos> Is he home?<eos> - Goodbye, Alan.<eos> How about I stay in Jake's tree house?<eos> He never uses it.
I don't think you do.<eos> Let me tell you something, Charlie.<eos> You said you took me and my kid into your home, but you didn't.<eos> You took us into your house.<eos> We made it a home.
Nothing to report.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> What?<eos> "This girl has a decent body but sadly she has no idea how to use it."
I think I might talk better in the dark.<eos> When he was 16, our sister Deborah went to stay with friends near the garrison at Newcastle.<eos> She was away three months and Cranford had begun to miss her.<eos> One day, Father had come back from his walk, and he saw a crowd at the Rectory gates.<eos> As he approached, he saw a woman in the garden holding an infant in her arms and babbling to it as if it were newborn and out for its first airing!
After secretly releasing his own album, "Gay Power Volume 4 ", he is back, to perform...<eos> "Do you feel the way I do?"<eos> It may have been so far away, the day when we went our separate ways.<eos> There may have been many people.<eos> Hundreds, even thousands of them, who came into my life and made it go round.
You ought to take a break.<eos> Stretch the limbs a little bit.<eos> Go get something to eat.<eos> Maybe find a little companionship.<eos> You know, we... We study the origin of life, but we also have to live it.
- Earn.<eos> Earn a point of view.<eos> Then come back when you've got something to say.<eos> "Get a life,"my ass.<eos> I had a life, and there was no way I was going back to it.
She's dead.<eos> - Yes, she is. - You made your bed with her.<eos> - I did.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> I made your bed with her, and then you pissed in it!
You got great cards.<eos> Keep your clothes on and you can do what you want.<eos> You want out, you're out.<eos> You wanna bake bread, go with God.<eos> There's only one wrong answer and you've got your arms wrapped around it.
You keep you away.<eos> Who are you and what have you done by my little brother?<eos> My name is Herman Hartmann.<eos> I died in 1873 and ended up in your body by mistake.<eos> I do not know how I slip out of it again.
- Sir! Take Dave and two of the fellas, pick up some hoses...<eos> Billy, protect the roof. Don't wait before it gets too hot.<eos> What are you looking so miserable about?<eos> There's a whole ocean of oil under our feet!<eos> No one can get at it except for me.
Michael, it's OK.<eos> I had to leave, but I'm OK.<eos> But... why did you die?<eos> Life was just too difficult for me.<eos> I wasn't cut out for it.
Killed!<eos> But most important I've got hope now to open the doors to myself, to understand who I really am.<eos> Now that's a character.<eos> I don't want this piano to play.<eos> Let it be our table.
Anabelle: lsn't it amazing?<eos> here we are, lying on this big ol' ball of planet, spinning round and round in space. All these stars floating next to us.<eos> Nobody even thinks twice about it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> After all the terrible stuff that happened to me... it made me realize that for every terrible tragedy in this world, there's an equally miraculous thing that grows from it.
It appears Kimble is awake, and he's trying to stand up.<eos> Seriously, you're probably hurt pretty bad.<eos> I'd say definitely, Kevin.<eos> I'd wager 10 to 20 broken bones, minimum.<eos> But life is pain and we've got to scrape the joy out of it every chance we get.
Do something I want to do.<eos> That's a positive attitude.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> That's the problem.<eos> I like my job. It's the best in the world.
- I think it'd be a good idea...<eos> - of course.<eos> I need an hour before I can even think about it.<eos> I know we're corrupting your scene.<eos> I haven't even looked at the scene And you're talking about removing items from it... seriously.
You're mine.<eos> You're always mine.<eos> Now I'll have to start all over again.<eos> What would you like your next life to be?<eos> One thing I can promise you, it won't be pleasant, and she will certainly not be part of it.
Shit, I got to back track, you're coming with.<eos> Oh, yeah, right. You...<eos> Do you see that window up there? That...<eos> That's mine.<eos> Do you see the girl sticking her head out of it?
Because you're selfish, and you don't listen.<eos> I told you when you proposed to me I didn't want to move.<eos> Now you go behind my back like this?<eos> Yeah, well, screw me for thinking you might be open to changing your mind.<eos> I mean, what is it about this town that's got you so... addicted to it?
You got a colour film, Jim?<eos> Hand me a roll of colour, quick.<eos> Just grab me a colour.<eos> We took photographs as much as we could and, of course, we took the photograph of the famous Earth rise around the Moon and I have to credit Bill Anders for taking the picture.<eos> Uh, he claims it all the time, anyway!
We will be a family if it kills us.<eos> Pull this off and you're halfway home.<eos> - You remember what home is like?<eos> - Stay away from my family!<eos> She needs that medicine-- she can't go two days without it.
20, 40...<eos> And... I've... let... everyone down.<eos> I can no longer...<eos> A few things got blown in the canal, but we think we got everything.<eos> It could be a while before the body shows up and, you know, sometimes it never does.
We found a body,Robert.<eos> Out in the woods.<eos> Near Mill Creek.<eos> Broken neck.<eos> Animals got to it.
Look morally tainted enough to kidnap a kid<eos> Look what it says here :<eos> Raven - creatures of haven, follow migratory patterns,<eos> So that's mean they like to come back to the same place - over and over again.<eos> - Once a raven builds a nest, it almost always goes back to it.
About 30 minutes...<eos> Ok.<eos> Do I have the right to dream at least...?<eos> For the next 30 minutes?<eos> Her heart felt a sense of frozen droplets shining inside it...
I know.<eos> I should have gone to the police, but this man-- he had already taken so much from me.<eos> He destroyed my life. (reporters clamoring)<eos> No comment. I have no comment. Thank you.<eos> Bennett knows that he is sunk on the Pena murder, so he cops to it.
-All right, then.<eos> Since we're up, do you think we should have some pie?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> You think we should have some vanilla ice cream on it?
Right there.<eos> Cut!<eos> Oh, print that one.<eos> That's in the movie. Oh, loved it, kids.<eos> You find out there's an afterlife, and this is what you do with it?
Anything. Talk to me.<eos> Is there any newspaper reports about a rape at a bar called jones?<eos> Zilch.<eos> You sure?<eos> It would have been about 9 years ago.
You brought Sinclair along from a rookie...<eos> Granger, too.<eos> When Reeves gets her team, who do you think she's gonna come to for advice?<eos> Who had the balls to bring in a damn math professor to solve federal felonies and the brains to watch it work?<eos> What you have to do is stop worrying about life passing you by, and start enjoying what you put into it.
He opens it up then looks at me.<eos> This gaze of absolute disappointment.<eos> There's nothing in the box.<eos> So he hands it back to me.<eos> "Go fill it up," he says.
I'm tired of running!<eos> You're a coward, just like your brother.<eos> I see the fire.<eos> It's right through those trees.<eos> There's a man lying next to it.
What scares me...<eos> I know it's weird, because I'm a sailor... but... hooks. Hooks.<eos> Next?<eos> As you know by now... I'm the navigator and first mate.<eos> I love the sea... though I have to say I am in awe of it.
- Well, I don't want it anymore.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - I want you to have it. - No.<eos> Go away.<eos> - It's been great... but I'll be fine without it.
I good this life...<eos> next life, I princess.<eos> Have many shoes...<eos> You only get one life...<eos> So you got to try and make the most of it.
They said you're quitting.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Why were you so mean to me?<eos> That hussy just uses our piano.<eos> I donated 500 euros for it, you know that.
Guitar player: Is she hot?<eos> William: Yeah she's real hot.<eos> You know what it is you miss most when you're separated from someone - you lived with and loved?<eos> It's waking with that warmness beside you.<eos> Once you get used to that warmness - it's a hell of a lonely feeling to wake up without it.
Specially in some dollar -<eos> Can we do it from the top?<eos> Director: You know what it is you miss most we you're separated from someone - you lived with and loved?<eos> William: It's waking up with that warmness beside you.<eos> Once you get used to that warmness, it' a hell of a lonely feeling - to wake up without it.
Who the man was, why he'd built around the tree instead of cutting it down.<eos> But Mose couldn't find out where he'd got to.<eos> Why does she need to know where the man got to for Mrs. Bullock to tell the children about the tree?<eos> To finish the story.<eos> More than where the man got to once he was through, I'd think the story was of the tree and the schoolhouse built around it.
-What about the rest of the team?<eos> -You were right about Lemansky.<eos> And this Terry murder? It is the soft spot.<eos> But with me, it was still theoretical.<eos> I mean, I'm trying to get inside it and I will get inside it. But I need you to add that personal element to it.
You're a rebel.<eos> Zack, I need you to analyse the cuts on the bone.<eos> I was kinda hoping to keep my job.<eos> There's not enough skull here for me to do a reconstruction.<eos> If I gave you a picture you could tell me if it doesn't match?
Well, how is he?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Figured he's out of my life.<eos> Why get back into it?
- As there is no law.<eos> Remember we were talking about the Illinois state law here? Which is a law in Illinois...<eos> So we got out that law and we've read it several times and I said: ok, wait, wait, wait, you know, 'cause they kept saying...<eos> But this is a law in Illinois and I said: Look at the beginning of the...<eos> It says: anyone required to file a federal income tax return, is required to file an Illinois tax return.
- No! Just get out!<eos> Get out! - Susie!<eos> Susie! - Our marriage was garbage!<eos> - A disgusting pile of garbage!<eos> - Don't say that. I regret everything that came of it.
No.<eos> Do you know what time they got back to the hotel?<eos> Uh, a little after 10:00.<eos> The guy gave me a Benjamin.<eos> I kept an eye out on that baby, I didn't want any of these other maniacs putting their paws on it.
It's been a long time.<eos> - Hi. Hi, Paul!<eos> Time to get dinner started. Oh!<eos> You brought the wine.<eos> I'll get some stuff to go with it.
he's out with the Salvation Army.<eos> He's feeding the poor. Good for him.<eos> Faith gives people a meaning in life, doesn't it?<eos> Well, all I believe is life has no meaning.<eos> You just get used to it.
4x13 Final Grades<eos> No idea on this one.<eos> Two on this block and 3 off Lanvale.<eos> They cluster.<eos> And when they found a block they liked, they came back on it.
I wanted to die, that's why... that's why when you asked me to run away, I was ready.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> Start over.<eos> Erase that picture right now.<eos> - Jason, it can't be erased.
Dennis has an answer for everything.<eos> Well, answer me this:<eos> Where's the collar?<eos> Cats have collars.<eos> Maureen's body didn't have a collar on it.
What are you doing here?<eos> AUTOMATED VOICE: Please cease operations and leave the building utilizing the nearest exit... (GROANING)<eos> I can handle it, sir.<eos> Take Gabriel alive.<eos> Once an animal escapes, it'll never go domestic again.
That's why two billion dollars' worth of these babies are sold every year.<eos> Because they bring reassurance that when the time comes, you can step up.<eos> Some of you take them.<eos> A little blue steel is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> But if I threw this bottle into the audience right now, no one would grab it.
- Oh, don't worry, he's not a suspect.<eos> He's just a former known associate of some of the key people.<eos> Detective, if one of my parolees is connected to a crime,<eos> - procedure dictates... - No, no, no.<eos> I wouldn't say he's connected to it.
You have all these brilliant ideas that only find life on the page.<eos> I'm a writer, John. I fail to see how that makes me a coward.<eos> All you do is write!<eos> It's the only release your fear grants you.<eos> You write about life without actually living it.
- I'm not crazy about your name.<eos> - What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too old-fashioned.<eos> - I've never really liked it.
And he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Uh, took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant, and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?<eos> Under his seat, between his legs.<eos> Nobody touched it.
- and also undead.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> I'm sorry. What are you saying? She's a... zombie?<eos> I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.<eos> - I don't like it either.
- What the fuck?<eos> I'm sorry. What are you saying? She's a... zombie?<eos> I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.<eos> - I don't like it either.<eos> - Let's not use it.
Go.<eos> The Ice Juice IPO never tracks back to my family, to my father's investment in any way.<eos> Seal it off.<eos> I can't just hide discovery. Oh, I'm not asking you to hide discovery.<eos> I'm asking you not to discover it in the first place.
Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove out to Sweetwater River for an early morning boat ride.<eos> Are you scared, Jason?<eos> The next thing we know happened for sure is that Dilton Doiley, who was leading Riverdale's Boy Scout Troop on a bird watching expedition, came upon Cheryl by the river's edge.<eos> Jason...<eos> Riverdale Police dragged Sweetwater River for Jason's body, but never found it.
Not yet.<eos> Well, when are you gonna find out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Soon.<eos> We need to know so we can make a plan in case it doesn't come through.
You just push people away, because God forbid you might ever need anyone!<eos> What?<eos> The listing went down.<eos> They must have given it to someone else.<eos> How did we not get it?
Well, I can until I can't.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Double crap.<eos> This idea of a midnight release is a risk, guys, and it's just a risk I don't think we should be taking with your first single.<eos> But I love the idea of putting it out there and letting it speak for itself.
- Go on.<eos> - We get our stuff out of the trunk of the car and we head upstairs.<eos> I'm sure it's all on the tape.<eos> Tell me what happens inside after the tape.<eos> I didn't see it, so clue me.
I didn't like feeling pain, so I fixed that. Aida, whatever you're doing, you ... you got to stop.<eos> Why would you want to hurt me, Leopold?<eos> I was your shield.<eos> - You still make my favorite breakfast.<eos> That's because you don't eat breakfast if I'm not there to cook it.
I go after crooked cops.<eos> Looks like we both won here, no?<eos> Come on, do we really need to go through this procession again?<eos> I hope your lawyer passed the bar and can build a defense without that box of blackmail.<eos> I wouldn't open it, sweetie.
Voters respond to strength.<eos> And I would vote for that boy of yours.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He has your attitude towards pain.<eos> If you don't acknowledge it, it isn't there.
Julia.<eos> Bianchi... kept a recording.<eos> What'd you hear?<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> I didn't want to see it.
Let me go!<eos> Video clip has a male, 5'10, wearing the monogrammed slippers of the Cavendish Clan at the site of an armored truck heist two days ago.<eos> You're Albert Hill's mate, a wannabe gangster in a little silly bow tie.<eos> I want that gold, boy.<eos> And if you don't bring it to me... I will come for it.
What's your boy done with my diamonds?<eos> My boy wouldn't rip you off, Saul, he knows what's what.<eos> Let's just tell Saul Gold who heisted it.<eos> I want that gold, boy.<eos> And if you don't bring it to me, I will come for it.
Oh, and then all I need is that bed.<eos> I did more thinking on that island about that bed than I care to admit.<eos> It's amazing the power an object can hold over you if you let it.<eos> Luckily we kept that bed.<eos> Lucius thought it would be a waste of funds to replace it.
Phew, this polish smells.<eos> Want me to open a window?<eos> Oh.<eos> It stopped raining.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna leave it open too long, or you'll catch a chill.
Hi. Hey, how was the ride?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Phil fainted.<eos> - Claire. - Oh, come on, they were gonna find out.<eos> I'm not spending $15 on this picture and not show it to everyone.
I ended up finding a piggy bank in there.<eos> We used to keep city money in a piggy bank?<eos> No, but you had a benevolent fund.<eos> You know, I do remember hearing that the city did used to have one, once, but that account has been closed for, well, at least thirty or forty years.<eos> - Except it wasn't.
So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...<eos> I just wanted you to tell him what you told me, before I make a mess.<eos> What mess are you going to...<eos> That's where it's been this whole time?<eos> Put it somewhere I could keep an eye on it.
Jennings.<eos> Um, well, before we got here, our people worked it out.<eos> What happens in these cases is you need a new name to fit in, where you're going.<eos> So they look for the name of someone who died.<eos> They're... they're not using it anymore.
They can.<eos> And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> The fairies want a baby?<eos> They aren't gonna eat it, are they?
- Agh. - What did I say?<eos> The deceased can literally be flushed down the drain.<eos> It's really convenient.<eos> - Margot.<eos> - What, you think it's somehow more civilized to hack a body to pieces and haul it around in a sack?
- Hey. Can I get a refund for these leftover chocolates?<eos> - They don't work.<eos> - One second.<eos> Abigail. Stephanie wants to talk to you about a return.<eos> If the box is opened, I can't take it back.
Hey, we got into this to make some money, provide for our families.<eos> I'm not about to go to prison for it. Are you?<eos> Put a bullet in him, toss him over.<eos> The downwellings out here will take his body right to the ocean floor.<eos> Nobody will ever see it again.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Maybe call Spicy.<eos> You tell her to come babysit this, you know, hunk of a man.<eos> You single, sweet cheeks?<eos> What do we got, Lou?<eos> Well, Xander's body was found inside the container. Obviously, it was put there so it wouldn't be easily found.
You sent Nimah to jail?<eos> I didn't want her to go, but we felt that it's safer for me like this.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want nothing to do with it.<eos> I barely got this assignment, and I'm not about to lose it because you can't play by the rules.
And yes, that includes you three, or rather... four.<eos> Or is that what you want?<eos> Dolls?<eos> He's right.<eos> The spell's irreversible if the caster dies without lifting it.
Do you copy?<eos> Can you move?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Then you're gonna have to keep looking for that beacon.<eos> If you don't find it within the next two minutes, that glider will pass fail-safe.
A native Hawaiian.<eos> Must be fate.<eos> You might be right.<eos> Ms. Goodwin wanted you to have your nail.<eos> You know what? I don't need it.
He's gonna come out courageous.<eos> He's still gonna be what he is, and he's gonna be the champion.<eos> And he's gonna get his belt back.<eos> Peter Quillin had a reputation of being just one of the meanest men in the ring.<eos> Now he's on the cusp of real greatness but he hasn't really hit it yet.
Mmm. So, why didn't you go?<eos> You know what I see when I look at you?<eos> - Don't say "potential."<eos> You need to widen your horizons, Clark.<eos> You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.
- Wren?<eos> - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What can I do for your fellows on this lovely evening, huh?<eos> Give us the file.<eos> - I don't have it yet.
Looked everywhere<eos> You'll have a nice home<eos> Australia is a great place<eos> Does everybody have a napkin? - This is called a "serviette"<eos> - Serviette Lay it down on your lap like this so that food doesn't fall on your clot So it doesn't ruin them
It's got the additions of stannum alkylated chloride and ethyl silicate.<eos> I'll certainly look that up in chemistry textbook.<eos> We are dealing with face-painting silicone.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's used to make masks, thin and durable.
Terribly unprofessional.<eos> Who can confirm that?<eos> The camera technician.<eos> He's got the video.<eos> But I'm asking you not to show it to anybody.
What for?<eos> We could have changed the world for the better!<eos> You can't change the world for the better through blood and murder.<eos> "Human life is the highest value;<eos> no one has the right to take it away."
Uncle, may I ask you a question? Mohenjo Daro?<eos> Everyone is leaving tomorrow.<eos> This time let me go with them for the bazaar.<eos> You have asked the same question for the past three monsoons now.<eos> I am tired of listening to it, are you not tired of asking?
Ugh, no.<eos> I made a gay slur, then he threw it back in my face by acting like the kind of fruit that grows on trees.<eos> Everybody thinks so fast.<eos> Stan Smith, remove yourself from the tree immediately.<eos> Not until you promise you won't cut it down.
"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you."<eos> "When you pass through the flames, you will not burn."<eos> "You are precious in my eyes".<eos> This baby is still breathing!<eos> We couldn't have saved it.
Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who can say what evil truly is, until we experience it first-hand?
But why ask?<eos> There's no legal purpose for it.<eos> But Mr. Cochran and the defense have a purpose for entering this area, and that purpose is to inflame the passions of the jury and ask them to pick sides.<eos> The-the "N" word is a dirty, filthy word, Your Honor.<eos> It is so prejudicial and inflammatory that the use of it in any situation will evoke an emotional response from any African-American.
That said, you're wrong.<eos> He's right.<eos> The safest place for this isn't behind walls or guarded with guns.<eos> The safest place lives outside the realm of anyone's awareness.<eos> If the English can't find it, they can't take it.
She was choking here.<eos> Now you catch your breath too.<eos> Don't believe what your eyes see.<eos> Listen to your heart, Noor.<eos> But now it isn't yours anymore.
I didn't do anything, I promise.<eos> I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?<eos> A week?<eos> - You didn't show it to anyone?
The French have already supported us, Colum, by engaging the British Army in Flanders, reducing the troops remaining here at home.<eos> The prince is certain the French will want to press the advantage, send men and artillery to support the Jacobites.<eos> Oh, so--so the French have not yet committed to Prince Charles?<eos> Always an unreliable ally, the French.<eos> We will welcome the French support when it comes, but we dinna need it.
That's what I thought this was all about in the first place.<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> - Invasion?<eos> - A fleet.<eos> Eight ships, soldiers, 700, all led by a man claiming to have been appointed governor of this place and empowered to take it back by force if necessary.
And represents the positive image of the new South Bronx.<eos> I got the perfect kid for you.<eos> And one other thing.<eos> Now, I know this may not be our most pressing concern, but graffiti.<eos> The plebeians, the average Joes, they hate it.
We gotta do this now.<eos> Listen up.<eos> The signal's converging at the next cross street. - What's there?<eos> - A library.<eos> The attack was meant only to take food from those who had everything and redistribute it to those who had none.
- Have a safe trip back, Ms. Harvey.<eos> I'll show myself out.<eos> For quite some time, the president and I have been growing apart.<eos> Have Meechum step in here.<eos> We've attempted to save our marriage, but after great effort, I've come to the conclusion that it can't be saved.
And I think you and I talked about that, right?<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> I can do it, sir.<eos> Do you have any idea how exacting these calculations have to be?<eos> It's like shooting a sawed-off shotgun from a thousand feet and getting that one BB through a hole so tiny, you can't even see it.
But when he opens it, it's either "Hello, Mittens" or "Goodbye, Socks."<eos> Putting aside the potential animal abuse here, what does it have to do with physics?<eos> Yes, Hayden.<eos> It illustrates the concept of quantum superposition.<eos> Light is both a particle and wave until it's observed.
I think I found something. That logo that was on the flash drive that Waller gave you.<eos> Shadowspire.<eos> I thought I recognized that from someplace. I ran into alot of those guys back in the 'Stan.<eos> I need to talk to my brother again.<eos> Who would think the reward for confiscating an opium shipment would be additional duty guarding it?
With the survey map's details,<eos> I was able to decipher the inscriptions on this, which you also provided me.<eos> Are you beginning to see it now, the pattern, the trend of Providence?<eos> Legend tells of a hidden place within which lies a device of untold power.<eos> The quest to find it requires one who has been granted passage by the gods.
"What do I do?" "What do I do?"<eos> "Girl I need you..." "Girl I need you... It's happened for the first time."<eos> I wonder how it's happened." "Girl I need you...<eos> This is really close to my heart.<eos> Don't ever take it off. My dad gave me this.
The Strix are thinning out.<eos> It is back to Nola business as usual.<eos> I'm afraid our plans to vacate have been put on hold.<eos> Three of our upper-level circle are missing, including Fukuda, Bailey and Flynn.<eos> In the wake of Aya's death, you can understand our concern, though you don't seem to share it.
Cool.<eos> Well, he's not here, so...<eos> He's dead.<eos> The serum.<eos> No, Marcel didn't take it.
- No.<eos> Eventually, I'll give in.<eos> But there is another way.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
But Tamika was at the church for taco Monday not long before she died.<eos> And Reverend Copkiller was there, too.<eos> One other thing.<eos> The car that was used in the Reese murder.<eos> - It was never found.
Well, great.<eos> I'm sure they'll catch up.<eos> I had to repeat kindergarten, so I understand.<eos> This is a little different.<eos> This is like if seven yous got sent to kindergarten because they knew most of you wouldn't survive it.
- How's it down there?<eos> - Testing your lens now.<eos> How's this supposed to work?<eos> Well, theoretically, Connaver's device has been on Arkyn, so it should have absorbed that radiation signature.<eos> The beta radiation isn't visible to the eye, but those bang-ass lenses will translate it into something you can see.
And?<eos> Was it like with Joshua?<eos> Did you see it come out?<eos> I told you, it's not always like that.<eos> Then how can you be sure it's gone?
Yeah we remember.<eos> In the caves.<eos> But it'd gone!<eos> Whatever you do to me, they'll be back. They...<eos> Will not leave until they find it.
Right, you love-birds, we've got a wedding to prepare, let's not dawdle!<eos> Nancy, put your crayons away!<eos> Larry, please, I can't stand this.<eos> - This is family life.<eos> - And you've always been the first to question it, to argue for personal freedom over mindless allegiance.
- Best guess on cause?<eos> Someone snapped our vic's neck like a chicken last night around 10:00 PM, give or take.<eos> That phone.<eos> It was there when they found the body?<eos> As far as I know, no one touched it.
Life is one big living dream.<eos> [Gun cocks] Well, I must be in the midst of a 40-year nightmare.<eos> Take this.<eos> I'm issuing you a glock.<eos> You're gonna learn how to use it.
I doubt they'll find any security cam footage, though.<eos> No wires.<eos> Fakes. Just for show.<eos> Sorry, I never caught your name.<eos> My boss never uses it.
It's about my other daughters.<eos> I'll let Cosima explain.<eos> Sarah Manning, welcome to Brightborn.<eos> You're Evie Cho, right?<eos> I'm gonna pass on the tour; Cosima doesn't recommend it.
That's not how Erica got the flight info.<eos> Instead, she found a weak link: a low-level marshal fell victim to a classic spearfishing campaign.<eos> Leaked the flight number and the U.S. marshal transporting the witness.<eos> What about the witness's name?<eos> I don't see it anywhere here.
No, this is another matter entirely.<eos> X-rays showed two different broken bones-- the trapezoid and the hamate.<eos> And these bones were beginning to heal.<eos> I'd say this break happened in the last few days.<eos> Yeah, the bruising pattern suggests it was caused by a blow from a small, compact object.
Can you hold baby Maggie here, while I check out las tiaras para la quinceañera?<eos> Oh, a cute little rugrat like that?<eos> You betcha.<eos> Hey, look at ol' Gil holding a baby.<eos> I'm not even dropping it.
I don't think anyone starts out wanting to be a portraitist.<eos> Yeah. But in your search for your métier, you've tried a bit of everything.<eos> That's true.<eos> I came to painting quite late.<eos> And now that you've found it, you'll never leave it, yes?
What?<eos> The vehicle carrying the preventive vaccines was stolen.<eos> The vehicle... also carries Lieutenant Yoon's cure.<eos> Who on earth stole it?<eos> If we don't get it back in an hour, it will be too late.
A country which has brought us many things.<eos> Philosophy, democracy, my brother-in-law.<eos> So to all of you, I say welcome!<eos> As a rule, the food here is pretty ordinary. The wine is usually rather good.<eos> And I have made sure there is plenty of it.
He knows I hate that.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> He's never gonna change.<eos> He's always gonna be boring and selfish and drink that stupid milk. Milk is stupid.<eos> Nobody drinks it.
Now we need a warrant for Old Town.<eos> Can I cook you breakfast too?<eos> We need to get a friend back inside the Company's wall.<eos> Can't do that without a warrant.<eos> RAC's only got one active warrant in Old Town, and you don't want it.
I wanted to say something, voice my rage, tell my husband to get the hell out of there, but I didn't.<eos> I bit my tongue, because we are not our husbands' keepers.<eos> 14 hours later, a Taliban sniper put a bullet through my husband's neck, severed his carotid artery, killed him almost instantly.<eos> I didn't blame the shooter. I didn't even blame the government or the energy companies. I blamed myself.<eos> I had an opinion, and I didn't voice it.
It's not on the list of devices assigned to employees.<eos> All right, so the target has spoofed his Mac address to stay hidden. All right.<eos> Look, man, you may have to check every device in the building by hand.<eos> I know his device is here somewhere.<eos> I just can't see it.
Look, man, you may have to check every device in the building by hand.<eos> I know his device is here somewhere.<eos> I just can't see it.<eos> Hold up.<eos> All right, you can't see it, but could you hear it?
Okay, so can we view the photo without triggering the site to send it to every PicThread user?<eos> No.<eos> Well, then what are you so excited about?<eos> Well, because the photo is geo-tagged, just like the others.<eos> I can pull the metadata off the photo without viewing it...
It was a long story.<eos> What's in this vault?<eos> Something that can't be let out.<eos> Gonna need you to be a little more specific.<eos> First you have to swear that you'll never open it.
I'm your cousin.<eos> You want to shut this place down, go ahead.<eos> - I'm not shutting it down.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because that just feels harder than keeping it open right now.
We don't have to hang on to any of that fucking bullshit for them.<eos> They are gone.<eos> We are here.<eos> We have need.<eos> - Okay, so we sell the place and then it's gone.
I'm getting stronger.<eos> It's like all the power in this ship is pulsing through me.<eos> I feel almost invincible.<eos> We should shut down the link.<eos> Why the hell would we do that? We don't need it.
I'm gonna go to my sister's, birth it with her.<eos> And what then?<eos> I will raise it like my own or give it away, sell it on the black market.<eos> I thought you hadn't decided whether you were gonna have it or not.<eos> I can't not have it.
This is from Charlotte.<eos> From her birth.<eos> The doctor was impatient.<eos> After a while, he just cut me open and... took the baby out.<eos> I didn't even get to hold it.
All right, I'm opening the chest and exposing the mediastinum.<eos> I'm opening the pericardium.<eos> Dissecting the great vessels.<eos> All right, hook up the cardiopulmonary bypass.<eos> Okay, let's go. That donor heart's gonna be useless if we don't get blood flow to it soon.
He's 24.<eos> He had a car accident when he was three and sustained permanent damage to his Broca's center, which, of course, affected his speech, which is what causes him to speak backwards.<eos> But the damage to Sam's speech is a separate issue from what was discovered on his MRI yesterday. A cerebral aneurysm.<eos> It's most likely an incidental finding.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna ligate the aneurysm by placing a clip at the base since it's not amenable to endovascular coiling.
No, I-I cannot come right now.<eos> No, no, don't call the police.<eos> Uh, yes, I'll be right there.<eos> The Container Store!<eos> They're closing this shelter, shutting it down, not even bothering to replace it, so they can bring in a...
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?<eos> Well, that's just Batman.<eos> No, if a man dresses as a bat, that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that's Batman-Man.<eos> So does that answer your question?<eos> Oh, I haven't asked it yet.
Okay.<eos> I told you, I had nothing to do with the suit going missing.<eos> How stupid do you think I am?<eos> You are definitely stupid enough to get caught, uh, trying to sell plans to a rival company.<eos> Which is exactly why I would never steal it.
You know, back then, I...<eos> I didn't value my life all that much, but it's different now.<eos> I've outgrown this.<eos> I don't need it anymore.<eos> I don't want it.
Cut of what?<eos> The profits, seein' as how I'm the reason that they increased.<eos> On what planet do diner managers get a cut of the business profits?<eos> I turned that place around.<eos> Yeah, so we wouldn't close it down.
You really can't see the connection?<eos> Look, your people must have some sort of reliquary.<eos> A place where they protect the Faith's valuables.<eos> If the tree is more than religious symbology, nothing on here says where it is being kept.<eos> Half the references say they were stolen back by the Devil, and my people were on some holy mission to find it again.
She left me a box of stuff.<eos> Sounds promising.<eos> What kind of stuff we talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never opened it.
The sooner we find out what's going on, the sooner we can lay Dad to rest.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Where's the box?<eos> Wasn't it right there?<eos> You said you wouldn't move it.
- It's a Madame Lombard.<eos> - Mm. Beautiful.<eos> I planted it just before Carolyn was born.<eos> Oh, dear God. I would do anything to have this baby live.<eos> If only it knew the love that's waiting for it...
I'll be careful.<eos> How many secret hideouts do you have?<eos> It's a secret.<eos> You're such a shit.<eos> Baby, remember where this place is, but don't write it down.
Why does it have to be a competition?<eos> Did you understand the physics homework?<eos> What?<eos> Don't "oh" me. Fine.<eos> Though I didn't understand all of it either.
You're pretty much big a threat as anybody else around here.<eos> So you don't approve?<eos> Let me tell you something...<eos> There's not a person in here who would refuse that particular task.<eos> This is our place, and we're not giving it up.
I don't understand.<eos> The trial's over?<eos> I never even testified.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess A.D.A. Holder just decided that she didn't need your testimony.<eos> You mean she didn't want it.
You asked me why I was drinking that night.<eos> It was because I found out the thing that I worked so hard on to get that prick's approval was nothing but a lie.<eos> - Your trading program.<eos> - Yeah, my program.<eos> Turns out he wasn't using it at all.
We have a witness that can document giving inside information to William Sutter time and time again over the last ten years.<eos> And when we present that witness to you, you'll be leaping out of your chair to convict that man beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> Mr. Specter.<eos> What the hell witness is he talking about?<eos> Didn't it have to be in discovery?
Th-The beans are gnawed on and digested by little animals called civets, but the bean's core is too hard to digest fully, so eventually they poop it out.<eos> Farmers gather them.<eos> Because the bitter outside is already eaten away, they don't need to be roasted too long, preserving the natural sugar... and complexity.<eos> I always thought it was a good metaphor for what I do... getting foreign leaders to eat a plate of crap and like it.<eos> But I don't like eating it myself, especially from my own president.
We have over three million followers on Twitter; almost five million likes on Facebook for the finale;<eos> multiple covers of Entertainment Weekly; hundreds of fan sites online;<eos> cons across the country.<eos> The appetite for this show hasn't even reached its peak!<eos> We have millions of eyeballs waiting to see the next iteration and you have a chance to buy it now.
Doesn't look good, but it also doesn't feel right.<eos> Whoever it is, we'll flush them out when we turn Miami back on.<eos> They're definitely using EMP devices.<eos> The blackout zone encompasses the same amount of area in all four cities.<eos> Now, the effect is randomly dispersed, making it difficult to pinpoint the source, but I have everything I need right here to locate it, to disable it, and trace...
Kidnapper could have been after this software?<eos> Or a cut of the profits.<eos> Did you tell a lot of people in your family about this program?<eos> I told you, that's who it was for.<eos> How many people actually saw it?
Recovery team locate the murder weapon yet?<eos> Shallow waters, near the cockpit.<eos> Couldn't salvage any prints.<eos> And it's a ghost gun.<eos> No serial numbers, no way of tracing it.
Music is great.<eos> How the hell did you pull that off?<eos> You got to know Quincy.<eos> How's your arm?<eos> I don't even need it.
You said you got it back.<eos> Well, clearly, I lied.<eos> So how's your apartment?<eos> Not great.<eos> The electricity's out. So why don't you get it fixed?
'Cause the truth is, when I close my eyes and I think about our future... I see us with kids, Jack.<eos> I love our life.<eos> I love it right now.<eos> And I'm so scared of changing it.<eos> I don't want to change it.
What?<eos> No, I'm not gonna practice on you.<eos> Wait, I think that I've come up with a way to keep my engagement secret.<eos> It involves me?<eos> Look, we've established, firmly, that I cannot be around this ring without completely spoiling it, okay?
These granules-- some of them are sea salt.<eos> Others are tiny shards of fiberglass meant to create microscopic abrasions in the mouth.<eos> So the snake venom could be absorbed into the bloodstream.<eos> Pretty sure you'd know if you were eating fiberglass.<eos> Well, this has been ground down exceedingly fine, so adding it to a dish like this would yield little more than a chalky texture.
Thank you Detective Wells.<eos> We anguish over this situation.<eos> And Detective Hester is in our prayers.<eos> But our decision's gonna have to stand.<eos> The state made a bad law, the state made a bad law and it's up to them to fix it.
and make the Gorg think we are dead.<eos> Next!<eos> What if we logged into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancelled his e-vite--<eos> Or we could log into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancel his invitation, and...<eos> So the Gorg never receive it.
Next!<eos> What if we logged into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancelled his e-vite--<eos> Or we could log into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancel his invitation, and...<eos> So the Gorg never receive it.<eos> So the Gorg never receive it!
I don't know.<eos> It's sitting in my house.<eos> I've never seen any of this before.<eos> I mean, this box?<eos> I've never seen it before, Mike.
Reasonable isn't the word I'd use to describe what I'm seeing.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> No, you understand me.<eos> No, I've spent six years hiding in the darkness. It's time to come back into the light.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I don't have it. Mr. Washington and the others failed.
And shipments are being made available to public clinics immediately.<eos> Individuals diagnosed with s.O.S. Need not suffer another day.<eos> Contact your doctor immediately to receive the ashby eni cure and rejoin the ranks of equals...<eos> We're gonna remember this feeling.<eos> We're gonna live every day remembering and we're not gonna feel it.
Instruments, tools, everything.<eos> You have to destroy everything.<eos> The best way is to burn.<eos> You also need to clean the barn and destroy all the hay.<eos> It is forbidden to sell it.
Words I thought I'd never say again.<eos> "Lyman enters."<eos> Now the good news is I shuffled some stuff around, and I got you your old office back.<eos> Really?<eos> No one snatched it up.
Blonde hair, white purse.<eos> - You know the Heimlich?<eos> - JESSIE:<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She tries to eat that deposit receipt, you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?
Wow. Is she ok?<eos> I think so.<eos> - We're ok? - Yeah.<eos> Did you do the science homework?<eos> I didn't get it at all...
I don't think of it this way.<eos> I never even say this word.<eos> Death.<eos> Yes, okay, I said it once or, or, maybe three times just now.<eos> But watch, I will not say it again.
- More like no lighting.<eos> Oh, come on, Tommy!<eos> Mrs Sprot did always have a soft spot for you.<eos> Perhaps you reminded her of M. The likeness is striking.<eos> - I don't see it myself.
Folksy, direct and tough.<eos> He vowed to go after drugs at the source.<eos> But it was Nancy who stole the show.<eos> So to my young friends out there, life can be great.<eos> But not when you can't see it.
Never let down your guard.<eos> Just then, I could've killed you.<eos> The wine is in your hands.<eos> I'm content.<eos> If you don't like it, I'm fine with that.
Now, if I remember my training correctly, one of the lessons was titled...<eos> "Don't Dig Up the Big Box of Plutonium, Mark."<eos> I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft, but if they rupture around humans... no more humans.<eos> Which is why we buried it when we arrived.<eos> And planted that flag... so we would never be stupid enough to accidentally go near it again. But as long as I don't break it... I almost just said
- Pick it up. Pick it up, pick it up.<eos> It is backward, it...<eos> That is the reflection.<eos> The real one is in the mirror.<eos> I apologise, sir, I do not know how to bring it back.
No...<eos> But you do need to scratch an itch.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it before.<eos> A guy does someone wrong, now he needs that sweet release of a good punch.<eos> Throwing the punch or taking it.
Where have you kept my luggage...?<eos> In that room down there...<eos> No...keep it up stairs...in that room...<eos> "Where did that chair come from?"<eos> That's grand pa's commode don't touch it...haven't cleaned it with an ANTISEPTIC yet..."
The only thing is that I miss Jacob, though.<eos> It's hard having him not much around lately.<eos> Almost.<eos> [Bubbles] Ricky!<eos> Ricky, you can't take the car until you fucking get it registered and inspected.
"It"?<eos> The baby?<eos> I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Either way, I don't want it.
I don't cook Italian much, but what this woman does with butter...<eos> What'll I use it for, a doorstop?<eos> Hey, pity party... you need to let this shit go.<eos> You're right, the food tastes like crap, and I get 1,000 different visions of hell when I put it in my mouth, but your face is not one of them.<eos> We get it, you didn't cook it.
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to jump right to medication, at least not before talking through the problem.<eos> I did talk through the problem, and I decided to take action before things got worse.<eos> You also told her nobody likes sad people and that depression's all in her head.<eos> So?<eos> When someone's feeling vulnerable, they need their pain acknowledged, not be made to feel worse for having it.
Aye.<eos> Aye, we are.<eos> What about the price on yer head?<eos> I'm expecting a pardon, with the aid of the Duke of Sandringham.<eos> It hasn't come through yet, but we're hoping it will soon.
Or Ross's!<eos> I take no-one's side.<eos> Had it been left to him, you would be in Falmouth now, living with that scoundrel in shame and misery.<eos> I don't regard marriage as misery.<eos> That's because you have yet to experience it.
Said he had things to do out of town.<eos> - I saw him yesterday.<eos> The world's becoming more corporate-- this was their pitch to me.<eos> And in this new world, there's no room for family business.<eos> They're offering to buy the whole operation, then pay us to run it.
That can't be!<eos> Did he say when he intends to do this?<eos> Very soon.<eos> Don't you ever get sick of this place?<eos> Why don't you sell it?
Not anymore, it isn't.<eos> I needed that.<eos> Listen, hate to snort and run. But I'm going to Reno. Win me some kitty.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I'd say wish me luck, but I don't need it.
And he was killed in the car within ten minutes.<eos> Now, most killers don't want to drive around for longer than 20 minutes with a dead body in their car.<eos> And he'd avoid bridges and tunnels because traffic jams and accidents prevent an easy escape.<eos> That gives us a search area of approximately two miles in any direction.<eos> If the body was dumped three days ago and we haven't found it yet, it means it's off the beaten path.
I need you to take this.<eos> Dave said that Croatoan was looking - for the Aether core.<eos> - You think he knows you have it?<eos> Just in case, will you take it and hide it somewhere?<eos> Somewhere where no one else can find it, not even me.
Because I wish I had said something like that to you when we first met.<eos> I'm glad you didn't.<eos> This wine's even better than the last one.<eos> Did you pick it?<eos> I've never had it.
Hey! Hood!<eos> Where you going?<eos> You can't...<eos> You can't just leave!<eos> Well, I'm not giving it back this time.
11 vials went to the government, 1 vial went to me.<eos> Does the SSR know they have the vial?<eos> Why shouldn't they have it?<eos> The government's almost through their supply.<eos> If they know they have mine, they'll never give it back, even if you clear my name.
I used to work on old cars as a boy.<eos> Yo, Nutella, could use a hand. Here.<eos> Which cable controls the elevator's mechanical lock?<eos> The coiled one.<eos> But cutting it will alert Samaritan's operatives.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Aw, look at that. He knows where everything is.<eos> So how's the grad school application coming?<eos> Not so good.<eos> The school e-mailed me back and they won't accept it because I missed the deadline.
'Cause Phipps and the girl will testify to you being here.<eos> Stop.<eos> Tell me where you buried the body.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> So I can get rid of it and save both our lives.
What's this guy's connection to Yussef Khalid?<eos> The clay pot with the ashes, Jerusalem Heritage Center?<eos> He worked at Cafe Sergei.<eos> He had access.<eos> So we don't have a connection yet. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
May I have my license back now, please, and what on earth is taking so long?<eos> Well, your license is expired. Clerical error.<eos> - No, you forgot to renew it.<eos> No, my assistant forgot to remind me to renew it.<eos> Either way, I can't give it back to you.
I try never to go, but I think I was there six months ago on official business.<eos> - Did you get a parking ticket?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - You did.<eos> And you didn't pay it.
Let me ask you this-- do you think there's any--<eos> He's not in the picture.<eos> Never has been.<eos> She never even told me his name.<eos> So why'd she leave this condo and move to Nevada without selling it?
His parents reported him missing a month ago.<eos> If cryogenics is their hook, they should try a lot harder to hide it.<eos> Technically, it's cryonics and not cryogenics.<eos> Cryogenics is a scientifically proven process involving the successful freezing and thawing of materials without damage.<eos> Cryonics involves taking an already dead body and putting it in liquid nitrogen, and there's no scientific merit whatsoever.
You mean she was still alive when it was cut off?<eos> Yes, but I doubt she suffered long.<eos> With her arcuate artery severed, Eva must have likely bled to death within minutes.<eos> But I'd need to see the body to confirm that. Well, gonna be a bit of a problem with that.<eos> We haven't found it yet.
-No, not that type of team.<eos> -Like milo and otis.<eos> -You only have to take one pill, right?<eos> -Right.<eos> -So I go to the doctor, I get the medicine, But I do not take it.
I went back and looked at the metadata on the photo that Zoey texted her dad.<eos> It was taken at Rock Creek Park. Just not this morning. Four months ago.<eos> Zoey didn't take that photo with her phone, she took it with her digital camera.<eos> But most importantly, the photo never existed on Zoey's cell.<eos> If she didn't have it on her phone, how did she send it? Well, that's the thing.
The coast is clear.<eos> You can send Miss Shippen down.<eos> She asked to see you upstairs.<eos> How was your meeting?<eos> I hope you didn't end it sooner on my behalf.
He's obviously got a little Shepherd in him, so he is German.<eos> Hello, everybody.<eos> Don't be fooled by my floppy ears and adorable snout.<eos> Even though I appear friendly, I have already poisoned all of you.<eos> You probably want ze antidote. You don't get it until I get a new collar and some snausages.
Today's your lucky day.<eos> Your mistake is not sending you to prison.<eos> It's dying here with me.<eos> But I want you to think about something.<eos> Does victory really taste so sweet when you haven't earned it honestly?
Kimmy Schmidt, Carla Tuesday, WDUR.<eos> I think of you as the Paul McCartney of the Mole Women.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> - Isn't there a back door?<eos> Well, there used to be, but all the prisoners kept escaping through it, so we got rid of it.
What do they want?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> For the cure. Are they gonna offer us a deal?<eos> No, no. They thought the cure was on Solace.<eos> When... when we didn't find it, the commander's brother, he became certain that the cure was just a rumor.
If you'll excuse me.<eos> Go away.<eos> Look, I know you're hurt, and you have every reason to be, but...<eos> Harry made me write that ending.<eos> He wouldn't accept the book until I changed it.
I truly appreciate everything that you've done, and I promise you that I will rest.<eos> But I... I need a story, Eva.<eos> I haven't had a decent scoop in months.<eos> Slippery elm don't work on your schedule, Miss Ellison.<eos> If you don't respect it, it can turn real bad.
He should have recovered by now.<eos> Everybody is worried. And you want me to come and take a look at him.<eos> I'm surprised the baron would approve of a cog doctor tending to his son.<eos> I vouched for you.<eos> I have a simple life. I wanna keep it that way.
And they're taking me nowhere. Before you start throwing stones,<eos> You might want to look in the mirror. And I'm not speaking metaphorically.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Rumplestiltskin:<eos> It's a wasteland. But years ago, it was a lush forest till Maleficent burned it down.
- Getting his strength back.<eos> Working on his argument to go back in.<eos> Got a stranglehold on him, is what it's got.<eos> I say we blow the espheni hub-of -junk to kingdom come Before it hurts anyone else.<eos> Well, we're keeping ben and everyone else Away from it for now.
Now, this indicates to me that the three years you've spent trying to conceive must have consisted of heavy petting.<eos> Look, Bill... We're not really married.<eos> Really?<eos> It's just... All I want is a baby.<eos> She doesn't have anyone to have it with.
Previously on Masters Of Sex...<eos> Allow me to introduce my wife, Celeste.<eos> All I want is a baby.<eos> She doesn't have anyone to have it with.
Hey!<eos> Get your ass up, we're late!<eos> I think I should stay.<eos> Kirk, can't it wait till tomorrow?<eos> What good's life if you don't live it?
It's close to his artery.<eos> If it shifts, it could slice into it.<eos> - It has to come out.<eos> - There's no choice.<eos> But removing it could sever the artery as well.
I'd call us even, but... let's not quibble.<eos> I'm so happy you came to me for help, Jim.<eos> The answer is yes.<eos> Your wish is granted.<eos> You don't know what it is yet.
Sergeant. Monroe knows a thing or two about the Varme Tyv.<eos> Varme Tyv, is that what we're dealing with here?<eos> We think.<eos> From what I know about Varme Tyv, they need body heat.<eos> This is what happens when they don't get it.
Yes, about that, um...<eos> It was you who voted against Daniel's wing.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> Oh, it was not my heart. It was my child's.<eos> I heard it beating, and... Every fiber of my being felt compelled to protect it.
Do you not want to live with me?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> But I-I want our place to be perfect.<eos> Like you.<eos> Uh, and I don't care how long it takes to find it.
To see what we have.<eos> What you have is irrelevant to me.<eos> I'm innocent of any wrongdoing.<eos> If you're innocent, then why won't you give us this woman's name?<eos> Especially when not giving it makes you look guilty.
We had a deal, Fitz.<eos> Fight back! No luck on the surveillance tapes?<eos> Nothing faces the street except for the bank, and I just found out the police were there last night, and they took the tapes, the backups... everything.<eos> The DCPD has been sitting on footage of the shooting all day?<eos> If they haven't released it yet, that means...
It was meaningless.<eos> It was absolutely stupid.<eos> Do I regret it?<eos> Yeah, every minute of every day.<eos> When I found out I was sick, I looked around for my marriage and it wasn't there.
I worked for two months on that. Sorry.<eos> We gotta go with what's proven.<eos> We're remaking my old commercial.<eos> 30 years ago, my dad was in a local ad for Pritchett's Closets, and he has always been really proud of the slogan he came up with.<eos> I've never understood what it means.
- My lawyer.<eos> I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies.<eos> It's called Brad's law.<eos> We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison.<eos> Actually, I've decided not to eat it.
Oh, did you suddenly get super wolf powers?<eos> I wasn't aware of that development.<eos> Well, if you're not going, I could use the help.<eos> No, I'm coming just as soon as I talk to my dad.<eos> They're moving the body and he wants to make sure that this time no one steals it.
Why are we celebrating?<eos> It's your... It's your 45th wedding anniversary, Mum.<eos> No, I know that. But why are we celebrating?<eos> In conclusion, let me just say that... that a marriage, it's a bit like a house.<eos> You don't just build it and let it look after itself.
Mike.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You were saying about my story?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't read it.
- George!<eos> Hahaha!<eos> - Henry! Good to see you!<eos> You've helped yourself to my desk, I see.<eos> - You weren't using it.
Bonnie's mom or Caroline.<eos> Already tried to pawn it off.<eos> Then I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything for a do-over.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena.<eos> Well, I don't want it, Damon.
We can't have much time before the dome runs out of air.<eos> 24 hours.<eos> Norrie's been sneaking out to see Joe.<eos> Kid doesn't finish his device by tomorrow, it's game over.<eos> Well, however this thing ends, I'm gonna make sure Christine ain't here to see it.
How are you feeling?<eos> I need to listen to your heart, okay?<eos> This might be a little cold.<eos> Can you sit up for me?<eos> Okay, I need you take a big breath in and hold it, like you're swimming underwater.
You're wrong.<eos> Before, I couldn't even consider the thought without feeling pissed off or depressed, But my perspective has changed.<eos> You can still get the transplant.<eos> You can have your normal life back.<eos> I don't want it back.
And we only have one groom and a stable boy.<eos> But we still have an under butler and two footmen.<eos> In this day and age.<eos> I do believe that Mr Barrow has genuinely been looking for other employment.<eos> But not finding it.
What, you... you did this because I went to visit my wife?<eos> You're dismissed, Private.<eos> And lastly, the arid climate can be very hard on an infant, so your baby may need to feed more frequently.<eos> I was told there'd be formula.<eos> Yes, infant formula needs to be reconstituted with water and so I excluded it from the packages as a precaution.
We were so busy.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's like you say, it's an up and down business.<eos> We could get a new color scheme, or new signage...<eos> The only way this place is gonna make us any money, is if we sell it.
What's my story?<eos> I think I'd start when I was born.<eos> You know, I came shooting out like a fucking missile.<eos> And at first I was interested in soft food, But then I grew teeth, And I -<eos> I couldn't get enough of it.
I think it's bullshit that you're still actually fucking holding him.<eos> He got bail.<eos> Yeah, but you know he can't pay. [ scoffs ]<eos> Listen, detective, uh... You have my statement.<eos> Not gonna change it.
She knows exactly who the fuck I am.<eos> Does she understand it? That's another story.<eos> [ laughs ]<eos> And she still wants the kid. Mm-hmm.<eos> I mean, she could've got rid of it, right?
It will be difficult... .. but not impossible.<eos> Pasiphae will only be vanquished... .. if you find the source of her power and destroy it.<eos> What is the source of her power?<eos> There is a golden fleece, woven long ago by the Stygian witches.<eos> No mortal man has ever seen it.
Feeding like an animal.<eos> Stuffing your gullet and blowing it out your ass.<eos> How many shits a day do you take, Mac?<eos> Well, Jay, that depends on the day.<eos> It is astonishing how much time you waste on food, figuring what you want to eat, where you're going to get it, going to get it, finding a place to eat it, cramming it down, then laying around
It's not in impound.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - It's a piece of crap!<eos> It's in the shop.<eos> It doesn't even run.
Can you just take a minute to think this through?<eos> Does it look like a minute would make a difference?<eos> Does it seem as if I've made a rash decision here?<eos> Look, if I just knew your name, I could apologize to you.<eos> You never remembered it anyway!
It's possible we saw what we wanted to see.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> No, we don't. It does not need to be asked.
All because of James?<eos> It's not natural what he is. It goes against God.<eos> Quick!<eos> I need help! I can't have this baby.<eos> I don't want it.
That tape is all the proof they need.<eos> So we find a way around it.<eos> We can say it's been doctored.<eos> And no one will buy it.<eos> Then I never saw it.
Please.<eos> These are meaningless jests, protected by the constitution, P.S.<eos> He posted these jokes for entertainment purposes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Would the entertainment purposes include hacking into the Cochrans' car and driving it over a cliff?
I love these sconces so much.<eos> Hey!<eos> Boss the Ross.<eos> Oh, hey, have you seen my apartment?<eos> 'Cause I can't find it anywhere.
You will probably be very sore for a little while, though.<eos> Sore is better than dead.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> How are you doing, Garrick?<eos> Your serum's out of my system, and I will never take it again.
Got it.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, Laurel.<eos> Ok, maybe we need to work on your understanding of the phrase "distance yourself."<eos> Only if you insist on continuing to use it when it relates to my friends.
You did threaten me with arrest the last time I popped by.<eos> So...<eos> Did you reconsider my advice?<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm still not going to take it.
Then why is he caged and left to shit in the corner!<eos> You call that glory?<eos> Can she not hold her tongue for just one moment?<eos> No she can not and she will not!<eos> Keep your food, I don't want it!
Do it.<eos> Good morning, Madam Secretary.<eos> I wish I could agree.<eos> I have the number for Luke Miller's parents when you're ready for condolences, ma'am.<eos> I have a P.A. working every international search and social media platform, burying that video so deep even Criterion Collection won't find it. Good.
No, not-not yet.<eos> Okay.<eos> What did I just tell you about that look?<eos> Right. Sorry.<eos> It's... it's gone.
And he told me a story about how he was humiliated by a cop.<eos> Beaten... but never arrested.<eos> Derek was homeless and unable to find a job.<eos> He was so broken by the system that he just wanted to disappear.<eos> So that's what inspired you to find the video and post it online?
Come in!<eos> A midday visit from my son!<eos> To what do I owe this rare pleasure?<eos> Well, I have a little headache, and I was wondering if I could get out of gym class.<eos> Boy, I didn't write that note for you before. You know I'm not gonna write it for you now.
Scooter, hey!<eos> I was so relieved when I got your text.<eos> I thought maybe I had done something to freak you out or had sent an inappropriate picture of myself.<eos> Uh, yeah, you did.<eos> And thank God my mom didn't see it.
Who is he?<eos> How do you know what I was or was not thinking?<eos> I know everything, Peter.<eos> Almost always before you.<eos> Your analyst discovered that they deleted Halmi's name so you wouldn't find it.
I'm on it.<eos> Are you forgetting something?<eos> Nate.<eos> I asked you about an update on my recorder.<eos> Oh, it wasn't on your desk this morning.
Could be.<eos> Is this an admission?<eos> Only in the sense that I know where the light switch is.<eos> I thought you were above quid pro quos.<eos> Well, I would never look the other way on a criminal complaint, but now that it's gone?
- I'm not sure.<eos> It was white letters against a blue background.<eos> Maybe a uniform?<eos> Net searches for "Tav 8" bring up results about an antique military aircraft.<eos> It's been retired for decades.
That's your job.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> No.<eos> I'm caught up in all this because of you.<eos> My job is to uphold the law, not to break it.
It's a chasing game.<eos> A game, nothing more.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - I think what he also seeks is some certainty that you will try, if only for a day, to let your grief over Francis pass.<eos> To give him a chance to warm your heart, if not to win it.
Ashley, I understand you're not feeling well and haven't been for a while?<eos> - Some tummy issues?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So you and food not on the best of terms right now?<eos> I love food. I just can't eat it.
It is good, isn't it?<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> - She's never gonna use it, is she?<eos> - Matt... this speech was intended to rally the nations of the world into a potential war with Russia.<eos> If the secretary never reads it out loud, that would mean the best of all possible outcomes had been achieved.
Would you agree with me that it's pretty remarkably coincidental that that would depict Steven Avery's January 1985 mug photo, which was available to you that evening?<eos> One, the photo wasn't available to me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> It wasn't in the array?
Even sadder.<eos> Look, bud, I'm sorry how this whole thing shook out.<eos> You know, I'm looking at you up there with her, and there's a baby on the way.<eos> She's in there bawling about a heartbeat, and, buddy, I don't even hear it.<eos> I don't even think the doctor hears it. I think they're all in on this thing.
No, the game is over.<eos> You're going to call for help now.<eos> You're the only one who can operate the radio.<eos> - Not without the serum.<eos> - You'll never get it.
You're going to call for help now.<eos> You're the only one who can operate the radio.<eos> - Not without the serum.<eos> - You'll never get it.<eos> If we don't get it, We won't be returning anywhere.
I'll pay you back, sir.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> Me and Roland, we'll take care of your daddy.<eos> It's about time you had some family around here helping' you out.<eos> Reckon you wouldn't get this kind of pass in the big city, and you best not ever need it again.
Never have and I never will.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> Why is all the food sitting outside their rooms like this?<eos> - It's getting cold.<eos> - It's always cold because the appropriate staff won't bring it into the rooms, so it sits and rots until one of my staff can.
What'd he say?<eos> - Sounded like he said "cancel the order."<eos> -What? -Cancel what?<eos> -Cancel the order.<eos> Don't need it.
Plumbing's no good.<eos> We're on a septic, so only flush if you have to take a shit.<eos> Did he really just say that?<eos> Pretty sure, yeah.<eos> So you going to take it? Yeah.
That was my mistake.<eos> You can't live in the past.<eos> You've got to put it away and move forward.<eos> Life's a gift.<eos> Don't waste it like I did.
Alex, you know if you need any money, I'll...<eos> No, I mean, yes, I do, but I-I don't.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't you just dump it?
Love's the easy bit.<eos> It turns out, finding trust with someone, feeling safe, that's...<eos> And when I finally found it, I thought, "well, there you go.<eos> That's it." But...<eos> When the trust goes away, when you can't feel it anymore I don't know how you get it back.
Well, this food was excellent, and the company's even better. And this wine was undoubtedly $7.99.<eos> Well, it's a good week.<eos> I was wondering how long it would take you to notice.<eos> Well, I have a theory about fine wine, which is that... - Oh, do tell.<eos> - ...nobody really knows or even likes it or opera or... - Foreign movies. - ...foreign movies.
Why?<eos> Because looting is more manly.<eos> In looting, you have to beat the guy in open combat to take his stuff.<eos> America is based on a different idea.<eos> The idea of acquiring wealth not by taking it from someone else.
You ever go to her house? Me?<eos> I, um--I did, yeah.<eos> Yeah, when?<eos> Ooh, I don't remember exactly.<eos> Uh, we--you know, we were working on a story I wrote for class, and she liked it and wanted to try and help me get it published, so we met at her house to go over it.
So... they live without any ability to see or even know about light, right?<eos> The notion of light to them is... unimaginable.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But... we humans... we know... that light exists... all around them, right on top of them.<eos> They cannot sense it, but... with a little mutation, they do.
He wasn't shot here.<eos> Perhaps we should pay a call on the victim himself.<eos> See what he has to say about it.<eos> Here we wash the cadavers and remove the internal organs.<eos> After the body has been salted and stuffed with straw to prevent bad odours, it will be put on display until somebody identifies it.
I talked to her and asked her out.<eos> She said no, like I was nobody.<eos> She shouldn't have said that."<eos> "She shouldn't have said that."<eos> Bernie Michaels may have taken this confession, but he didn't write it.
I'm fine.<eos> Take off the restraints, give us the room.<eos> You know the drill, but I'm gonna lay it out for you anyways.<eos> The CIA knows you had Agent Reed murdered. And you've been selling secrets to the Chinese, and had Agent Morgan's husband framed for it, who was also a federal agent.<eos> I am an eye witness to you stealing the override device and handing it over to Adrian Cross, knowing its full potential as a weapon of mass destruction.
I would choose her over you.<eos> I might even hope I get the chance.<eos> But until then, you are invaluable to me.<eos> Your connection to Mina is my lifeline, so I must keep you alive.<eos> I put the photograph in the drawer because I couldn't bear it.
It's not gonna start today.<eos> Luckily, John Ross' heart is too small for a bullet to find it.
You will break his heart so thoroughly that he will never look at you again.<eos> You will make him hate you.<eos> This is wrong and dangerous.<eos> This challenge is my doing.<eos> It is my responsibility to see it through.
You've made an error in judgment.<eos> I understand.<eos> You can ride away and still have your honour.<eos> I've given my word.<eos> I cannot break it.
Time travel's not just some technological marvel, Kiera.<eos> It's the family business.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> I can make things right.<eos> And then I will destroy the device and nobody will ever use it again.
Can you talk to him?<eos> It weren't no love story, Nurse.<eos> God knows what you must think of me!<eos> My husband can't ever see this baby.<eos> I can't keep it.
I know what makes Harry Selfridge tick.<eos> Am I disturbing you?<eos> No. Come on in.<eos> I'm just getting a waistcoat made of this British cloth that we're promoting.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for the wine, and to tell you that I can't accept it.
What does he get?<eos> Obstruction, accessory?<eos> My guess is, the Mortimers would be very happy to have this all just go away.<eos> My guess is, you're right.<eos> His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
Vital signs spike for a longer duration before flat line;<eos> It looks like a pain response.<eos> This is what we'd expect to see with exposure to radiation.<eos> I know what it looks like, Jackson, but there's another explanation.<eos> We just haven't found it yet.
That right?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Was it possible that a tracker could've been placed under your car without your knowledge?<eos> It's possible.<eos> Because, if you were sure it couldn't be there, that would mean you'd checked - and why would you do that?
But you can not smell it, when the money is placed in the bag.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> In all of the underpants, containing money.<eos> Too bad they closed the place.<eos> It never opened.
After that ...<eos> I will buy this hotel and renovate it.<eos> For the money is never enough.<eos> Then I'm going to rent it.<eos> I will make an awesome hotel from it and life therein.
That created the lightning... that hit me.<eos> That is correct.<eos> I was recovering, when I heard about you.<eos> Hospital was inexplicably without power... every time you had a heart attack. It was actually a diagnostic error, because really, you were in cardiac arrest, Barry.<eos> Your heart was beating very fast, ECG to record it.
Here comes Ma.<eos> Mum.<eos> I don't want no baby.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I don't want it.
Next up, 106 weight class.<eos> Dunlevy.<eos> You get out there and you show them what it means to be a Dunlevy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Must be nice to give love and support to a child and have it returned instead of thrown into the gutter like a piece of garbage.
Or someone inside the company is working for our mysterious third party.<eos> And unfortunately, Ira was bluffing about wiping the zero day.<eos> Last night, he sent it to Neidra through a secure router.<eos> So it should be sitting on their server.<eos> If someone hasn't retrieved it already.
You can say that again.<eos> Uh, is this about the suit?<eos> Uh, I was just about to take it off... No.<eos> No, no.<eos> On second thought, keep it on.
- Thanks very much.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Damn.<eos> Well, an ID like that wouldn't hold up in court.<eos> We don't really need it to, though.
When you're 47, you're going to try a new type of breakfast cereal.<eos> - Mmm!<eos> - Which you won't like.<eos> Oh... But you'll finish the box anyway.<eos> But just won't buy it again.
Don't yell at me, but I really think we need a new plan on how to find this creepy mask guy.<eos> Scaring the crap out of low-lifes isn't yielding results.<eos> Felicity, I am open to any and all suggestions.<eos> Oliver, maybe we're over thinking this. What if the mask simply got wind that you were after him and decided to skip town?<eos> He didn't go to all the trouble of recreating the serum and testing it on people just to walk away.
I came for your professional opinion.<eos> I need to know about hydroxipam.<eos> Sure, yeah, I know all about that-- that and the Betamax and the BlackBerry.<eos> I don't understand the reference.<eos> Nobody wants it.
I've been communicating with the spirit world my entire life.<eos> People used to think I was crazy.<eos> - Holy shit. I get that a lot myself.<eos> Look, lady, I don't know who you are or what your story is, but we need your help.<eos> We can't put Hannah's spirit back to rest if we don't have her body, and that dildo licker won't give it to us.
- For how long?<eos> - Forever, dear.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> No.<eos> If B613's account is on their server, there's only one way to get into it.
"Grow grass-fed cattle"?<eos> Like say in Brazil, where 80% of the rainforest was destroyed for cattle.<eos> What are your thoughts on that?<eos> They shouldn't eat beef.<eos> If their environment wasn't designed to raise beef - they shouldn't be eating it.
Mica the same way?<eos> No, she's worse.<eos> She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.<eos> Did "Tom Sawyer" have a happy ending?<eos> We never got to finish it.
He was with God in the beginning.<eos> In him was life.<eos> And that life was the light of all mankind.<eos> The light shines in the darkness.<eos> And the darkness has not overcome it.
If it hasn't already.<eos> No!<eos> Not yet, priest.<eos> There's more work to be done, a final offering to complete your penance, that which you hold most dear.<eos> That boundary spell, on the other hand, now that he's died, I imagine it won't be quite so confining anymore.
Holy cats!<eos> Ladies, let's get out of here.<eos> I haven't learned a thing! Here.<eos> You can have this back.<eos> You didn't use it?
- A few weeks ago.<eos> - What?<eos> So you've just got it on file in case of emergency.<eos> He's very proud.<eos> I didn't want to send it.
No, I'm not. I don't care.<eos> I can talk about it. No, I'm not.<eos> Do you have a photo?<eos> Uh, she's making a face that says,<eos> "Yes, I have a photo, but I don't wanna show it to you."
Think of it:<eos> a cure for one of the deadliest diseases of our time.<eos> Instead of causing harm, the virus delivers a cure.<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> Unfortunately, we haven't perfected it yet.
So, what does that mean?<eos> Honestly, without evidence that you were drugged, I think the tape hurts our case.<eos> I can see us making a motion to have it dismissed.<eos> That it's compromised because there's missing footage.<eos> So no one would ever see it?
At the moment, King Aelle, very little.<eos> That is why I am proposing the formal marriage of my oldest son and heir, Aethelwulf, to your beautiful daughter, Judith.<eos> Now then, what do you say?<eos> Now I say... let us drink to our alliance...<eos> (Goblets clink) And may the devil never cast it asunder, hm?
I was wrong.<eos> Moriarty is not the architect of the plot to kidnap Kayden Fuller.<eos> She's one of its victims.<eos> Did you know that glass is a very poor conductor of electricity?<eos> It's often used to insulate power lines.
But McCann had no reason to hide those files.<eos> They'd be out on a table, a desk or a nightstand.<eos> Wait.<eos> McCann's car.<eos> It wasn't in the driveway.
She's a geology fellow at NYU. I asked her to take a look.<eos> It's interesting.<eos> Tough to tell from the photo. But I think I see some striations on this rock, and that would mean that...<eos> It's dug up from well beneath the surface of the earth.<eos> Yeah, well, can't say for sure without seeing it in person, so we're gonna go to Riverdale, see if it's still there.
Somebody really didn't want us to find out who this woman was.<eos> ♪ Bones 9x15 ♪ The Heiress in the Hill Original Air Date on January 31, 2014<eos> ♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method<eos> ♪<eos> Look, if you can't bury a body deep enough, you cover it in lye so the animals don't dig it up.
Everybody forget that happened.<eos> Clara, say the word.<eos> What word?<eos> They never sent you in here without a word.<eos> I don't want to say it.
I am in charge down here and I gave you an order, I want you at the safe house now, I am not going to repeat myself.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Damn it, John.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because after finding you, and building this place up from nothing, together, and turning it into a shelter, and then a home for us, can't you see?
Nice outfit, though.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm gonna kill Rudy.<eos> Third room is clear.<eos> Don't bother sending any backup; we're not gonna need it.
- Just this way.<eos> Hi Maggie.<eos> Hi.<eos> Let's find that heartbeat.<eos> - What if you can't find it?
She will be out momentarily.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Mine's Lou.<eos> Your name is of no interest to me.<eos> It would be a waste of my time to commit it to memory, for you are merely a blip, a momentary pit stop on the road to Wills-ville.
It is the European custom, and most appropriate, to switch and feed oneself with the dominant hand.<eos> The time it takes to transfer prevents us from descending into gluttony.<eos> You must think us mad to devote such attention to trivialities, don't you?<eos> I know I certainly did when I was first made to learn it all.<eos> If I ask you your opinion, you need not be afraid to give it.
You think anybody on her detail will play ball with us?<eos> Well, they just got here.<eos> Find out.<eos> - Yeah. - And that, uh, photo of Farhad Ghazi--<eos> I'd never seen it before.
Translation?<eos> (IMITATES BABY) Wah! I don't want a table!<eos> Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?<eos> I'd love to, but, I'm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.<eos> Seriously? You haven't used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you're up here working?
Which is ironic 'cause I only took Brad on to make me happy.<eos> Just give her a second chance, please.<eos> Ooh-ooh!<eos> I know. How about you give her another listing?<eos> And if she can't rent it, you're completely justified in letting her go.
This is not a game, Eli.<eos> You stonewalled me.<eos> - I can't write a report...<eos> - Peter needs you to clear him. Jim Moody acted alone.<eos> That's what you heard. Peter never saw this tape until you showed it to him.
- Do you need parking validation?<eos> No, I used Lyft.<eos> So I'll Lyft it back.<eos> Why don't I have Peter's car take you home.<eos> He's not using it, we're shipping off to Arallon tomorrow.
- Yeah?<eos> - What the fuck did you do, Raymond?<eos> - Calm down, Ezra.<eos> - I just talked to June.<eos> I gave you a job to do, you didn't do it.
I was 23, you know?<eos> Anyways, she likes puzzles, and it was nice, you know?<eos> It was platinum with sapphires and stuff.<eos> Anyways, I was gonna give it to her over the holidays.<eos> Well, Christmas Day comes and I go to get the ring and it's gone.
I picked up your baby cake.<eos> Do you want me to put it in your car?<eos> No.<eos> Let's get a knife.<eos> I want to cut it now.
No, mate, on the shelves of Tesco, that has a value of about a fiver.<eos> It's not rice!<eos> Are you going to cut it with peas?<eos> 'With the heroin loaded,<eos> 'I found a heavy old tree stump 'and asked James to crane it on board as well.'
That's what came off.<eos> That's the old one, which tore itself to shreds and in the process, pulled the wire out of the sender for the temperature gauge, so I don't have that any more.<eos> This lorry is crap.<eos> 'Up ahead, Richard and I were looking forward 'to a night in our new on-board accommodation.<eos> 'But thanks to the British Empire, we didn't need it.'
'So I walked my horse to the next village to get fuel, 'and then, we found a spot to camp for the night.'<eos> 'Here, while I enjoyed the view,<eos> 'James unveiled his sleeping accommodation.<eos> 'A mountaineering tent he could suspend from his crane.'<eos> So I'm going to rest it against the front of the cab.
Every one of us has the right to defend ourselves, to respond to our accusers!<eos> Mrs. Trask is dead, slaughtered like a lamb!<eos> True.<eos> Evil has been done this night already.<eos> But do not compound it by doing more.
Computer virus. Sergei wanted to use it on defense systems, which would be very bad, especially since I'm kind of the only one that can deactivate it.<eos> Kind of? It's a prototype.<eos> A few more months of testing wouldn't hurt.<eos> But that's not a problem now, guys.<eos> My uncle's body should be home soon, and no one can get to it but me.
The thing about growing up that way-- you get good at spotting lies.<eos> So good that you start expecting them from everyone.<eos> So how do I know what Harold told me was true?<eos> Because when he came along, against every instinct, I gave him my trust.<eos> Somehow I knew... he would never break it.
Samaritan's AI won't get switched on until Greer gets the government feeds.<eos> Those lights turn blue...<eos> We're screwed.<eos> We're inside a sleeping giant, Shaw.<eos> Try not to wake it up.
What's keeping us here?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Where to?<eos> To a perfect place.<eos> Just keep going till we find it.
There's precisely one spot on Earth with that exact view of the Hudson, the jetty below and the tree line on the other side.<eos> It was a simple process of elimination.<eos> No one home.<eos> Norman's car is outside.<eos> By the looks of it, it hasn't been moved in some time.
Catherine.<eos> He's low-life. He's scum.<eos> He'll get what's coming to him one day. He just will.<eos> The upside, on the other hand - the exquisite satisfaction you'd get from... grinding his severed scrotum into the mud with the underside of your shittiest shoe.<eos> And then burying his worthless carcass in a shallow grave up on the moors, where it can rot, undisturbed and unloved, until the end of time.
You can't catch a football one damn time?"<eos> So you worked on this with your dad.<eos> Apparently, there's an emotional connection with this car.<eos> It's a mixed emotion.<eos> It took us two years to restore it.
I mean, they want us to do stuff like that.<eos> Yes, of course. To inoculate themselves in cases like this.<eos> Karp: Miss Maloney.<eos> Oh, Karp, look, if you're here to do a victory lap,<eos> - you're not gonna finish it.
No.<eos> They have online courses.<eos> Online. Sure.<eos> I think I'm gonna get ready for bed.<eos> You never wanted it, did you?
No.<eos> Want to tell me what's going on, Ray?<eos> I was looking for my dad's hockey ring.<eos> I pawned it, okay?<eos> It wasn't at the store, so it's got to be here, right?
Hey.<eos> What brings you here, Red?<eos> Have you got a sec?<eos> I might. You know the law, right?<eos> Yeah, wish I'd studied it before my trial.
It's just the dying part that's not.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Just imagine all the things you could do with eternity.<eos> See the world, speak countless languages.<eos> In fact, there's almost nothing in this life I haven't done, except leave it.
Hey, Grunkle Stan, now that we have a moment, I've been meaning to ask you for my journal back.<eos> What?<eos> Journal?<eos> Oh, you mean this old thing?<eos> It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
You told me you'd fight to keep this from happening.<eos> I told you I would fight to protect your company.<eos> And right now, this is the best way of doing that.<eos> You're talking about using my expansion money.<eos> If you don't use it now, there's gonna be nothing to expand.

He really was in the camp?<eos> Yes, but doesn't talk about it.<eos> "The angel of death."<eos> The first picture he painted after Auschwitz.<eos> Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it.
I didn't wanna put you guys through that.<eos> Keeping us out of the loop shows immaturity, which is why<eos> - you are not ready to go to L.A.<eos> - You're not going.<eos> I wanted your blessing, but I'm 18 now, and I really don't need it.
How do you even know about it?<eos> Well, it was listed on Fales' first search warrant that was kicked back by a judge.<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> He tries to make me feel stupid for fixating on it, then he goes and he takes it to a judge.<eos> Well, now he's back to pretending he never found it, but I have a killer in my county who leaves crow feathers in the... in the bodies of his victims.
We couldn't stop the bleeding, so I brought you here.<eos> The blade is Empyrean steel.<eos> It should have killed me.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know. I never saw it.
- Peace be with you.<eos> - These people, they worship you.<eos> They're just grateful to have found a place of peace.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I don't know why the Espheni haven't found it.
Oh. Wait, wait.<eos> That's... that's what I want to say.<eos> But that's not how I feel.<eos> I want to start a life with you.<eos> And I don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid.
In some ways, things have been better.<eos> I feel alive again.<eos> I want to love my wife the same way we did when I walked into that house.<eos> And... and I've learned so much through this whole experience.<eos> I don't want it to end.
Real baby?<eos> Our first baby was Khaki, the magazine.<eos> For the modern multicultural couple.<eos> Yes, I've seen that.<eos> Greg and I birthed it, raised it, then let it go to Conde Nast in a bidding war.
I'll call my guy.<eos> Peace out, homey.<eos> What you got?<eos> Isabel Thoreau.<eos> I know that name, and I hate it without really knowing why.
There's no money left.<eos> When you sell the ranch, the bank could just take everything...<eos> We're not gonna sell.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm not selling it.
Yes, of course I want this baby, I'm...<eos> Then end it.<eos> Or I'll tell your husband.<eos> And, trust me, Jane's not giving that baby to him alone.<eos> And you don't want it.
I can tell you that, yes, that car is definitely one of ours.<eos> Yes, I told you that.<eos> So who was driving it this lunchtime?<eos> That I don't know. It's a pool car and it wasn't signed out at that particular time.<eos> It should still be in the car park but I don't think it is...
Let him go. Or I will send you to walk among the dead.<eos> Let's get in the trucks.<eos> We're moving out.<eos> What about the... the baby thing?<eos> We can't leave it like that.
It's not sad.<eos> It's a zombie.<eos> Amen brother.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We can't leave it like that.
Except for that drug dealer that you beat to death six years ago.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> I may have avoided jail, but I have lived with the guilt of that man's death every single day of my life.<eos> I gave it all up after that.<eos> I locked this place up and I swore I'd never open it again.
What's in it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I had opened this box, and there was evidence, morally I would have been compelled to share it with the prosecution.<eos> So I didn't open it.<eos> But I didn't destroy it either.
In fact, Ewen said before, he's like, he's like "I'm never leaving my room... I'm never leaving anything in my room again, not a single machine."<eos> I was like, "You've been infected by the paranoia bug. - Happens to all of us!" - Yeah.<eos> The way he said it, he was like,<eos> My bag is getting heavier and heavier.<eos> All right, I'm going need you to enter your root password because I don't know what it is.
Two earthquakes.<eos> One in Japan, Bonin Islands another in Iran, 6.5.<eos> - There was a lunar eclipse.<eos> - That's incredible.<eos> It could not be seen here, but--
He always talked about what it would mean to bring my father home.<eos> As he got older, it consumed him.<eos> Hawk saw my father get hit.<eos> He held the body.<eos> To not be able to find it the next day was devastating.
I came to say good-bye.<eos> Who knows-- could be another 15 years until we see each other again.<eos> Take care, Erin.<eos> The tape.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
- That's what caused the crash.<eos> - All right, enough.<eos> They never found your body, right?<eos> Should have washed up somewhere.<eos> And yours, it would have been in that mangled, burned-up car, but they didn't find it, did they?
Okay.<eos> Mm, you got me there.<eos> But if Whitney was searching for the gold and the killer tracked her, there could be clues.<eos> You keep assuming that the gold's still out there.<eos> Don't forget... Clyde and Dutch were looking for it. They might have found it.
by Montecito quarterly, we shot my cover photo right here.<eos> Now, tell why. Don't be modest.<eos> I saved this lake.<eos> Mom chaired the conservancy group that had it declared a freshwater preserve. It's been off-limits to development or any form of recreation.<eos> In fact, it's been untouched by human beings...
No.<eos> It appears to be pretty much unstoppable.<eos> The one thing I did find is there may be a way to undo the effects from anyone it touches.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> It seems that when somebody's been touched by the spell, that you can use them to undo it.
My mother will have signed our treaty, And the earth empire will finally be united.<eos> - Don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> Securing your hometown won't be like every other city.<eos> - Zaofu stopped being my home long ago.<eos> I'm ready to take it by force.
Bubbles?<eos> Where are you?<eos> And you need to let us in.<eos> Come on, Bubbles, fetch me a beer.<eos> Why don't you go and fetch it yourself?
And it's one of ours.<eos> I don't know anything about surveillance.<eos> I'm just a retired cop living on a pension.<eos> Really?<eos> 'cause you checked out that unit in May of '02, And you never returned it.
Look at the thickness.<eos> That's at least five-eighths of an inch.<eos> Definitely didn't come from a car.<eos> More like a window; it's heavy duty.<eos> Wherever that glass came from, we got plenty of it on the victim.
- Earology.<eos> - Earology. How did you know that?<eos> FBI seminar.<eos> So, you used her ear to identify this woman?<eos> Yes, by isolating the ear and running it against the mug-shot database.
Her ultimate defender.<eos> Marauding rival male lions are a constant threat.<eos> If they overthrew him, they would kill all his cubs and father their own.<eos> The security of the whole pride, and this cub's future, rests on him remaining strong.<eos> But the early days of an animal's life are a very different prospect if its parents do not support it.
Go up to the bedroom.<eos> On the bed is a letter.<eos> And it's addressed to Michael.<eos> Take it home and save it for me when I get back.<eos> But listen, promise me that you won't read it.
I want the watch doubled at our borders.<eos> All roads, all rivers.<eos> Nothing moves, but I hear of it.<eos> No one enters this kingdom.<eos> And no one leaves it.
- Did you ever execute this will?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did anyone witness your executed will?<eos> When you mean "executed", uh...<eos> I didn't sign it yet.
And impossible.<eos> He says that life is round.<eos> That we're stuck on this wheel of living and dying.<eos> An endless circle.<eos> Until someone breaks it.
This is the entrance and this is the main hall.<eos> The shroud is here.<eos> The glass panel concealing is fitted with sensors that measure human temperature.<eos> The slightest increase in the temperature will set off the alarm.<eos> People can look at the shroud. But they can't touch it.
Now you're really losing your grip.<eos> I just want to get back to where we were.<eos> When I was your friend, your accomplice, your trusted procurer of women.<eos> If you're doing all this to win back my trust, Billy, it's been a bad deal for you.<eos> Because you never lost it in the first place.
I can feel it in my weather channel app.<eos> Soon the sea will be belchin' her dead upon the shore.<eos> If ye like your shoes unmatched and with feet still in 'em, this is your night.<eos> Can't you make the beacon any brighter?<eos> Nay, 'tis already the brightest object in the known Universe, and even so, it can't be seen three feet away in a storm like this.
It was a compliment, wasn't it?<eos> I believe it was.<eos> There you are.<eos> Just getting ready. Checking the order.<eos> I came to wish you good luck, but I know you don't need it.
That room is the space. It's, like, what happens between the notes, what you're playing.<eos> There's a sound that's pretty magical.<eos> Every room has their sweet spot for that sound, you know?<eos> This, I think, has always been Sound City's real sweet spot.<eos> And the freaky thing is, no one designed it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Francis J. Underwood library.<eos> Congressman?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wrote a speech.<eos> But I'm not gonna read it.
Um, yeah.<eos> (STUTTERING) I won't let anybody get into the water.<eos> Bad idea even going out on the lake at all with kids like these.<eos> But what's the point of us having access to this whole place, Mr. Parks?<eos> I mean, if we're afraid to use it.
They're migrating west... but now they are resting.<eos> Did you know that I know the Christian names... of all of these birds?<eos> Why... did you never write another book?<eos> I was looking for the great beauty, but...<eos> I didn't find it.
Hey baby.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You got treatment this morning, right?<eos> I know, I cancelled it.
Your dad knew he was out of time.<eos> Somebody Told him we were coming.<eos> - The man on the phone?<eos> - It was a blocked call. Did you recognize his voice?<eos> - I had never heard it before.
I think about your hair getting longer. I think about your belly getting bigger.<eos> I hear people talk about regret', but I haven't got any.<eos> I don't think poorly on the things that I've done.<eos> We did what we did, and that is who we are.<eos> They're gonna cross out this sentence before you get to read it, but I know you know what it says.
I get it. OK. Do your office however you want.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's a bit ostentatious, though, don't you think?<eos> I'm confused, because you wanted the antiques. And I said I was fine with IKEA.<eos> Yeah, I wanted to get a few pieces to upgrade the place, not turn it into a showroom.
Gentlemen, silence!<eos> It is not legal to discharge lives from a ship into the waters to facilitate insurance compensation.<eos> Whether they be the lives of horses or human beings, slaves or otherwise it is not legal neither is it right.<eos> it is clear that a fraud has been committed in claiming insurance on slaves who were drowned solely for financial gain.<eos> It is my opinion that the state of slavery is so odious a position that nothing may support it.
The Glock.<eos> But I won't be the one carrying.<eos> Same old Joe... let everyone else get their hands dirty.<eos> Just make sure when your man uses it, it doesn't blow back on me neither.<eos> My boy wouldn't remember his name if I wrote it on his hand.
What does that mean?<eos> Well, she was a known heroin addict.<eos> She made all those sex tapes.<eos> Not that I'm judging. The one I saw was very classy, lots of candles.<eos> Am I supposed to pretend I haven't seen it?
Damn it.<eos> You guys should get out of here before you freeze to death.<eos> Audrey's the immune one.<eos> This cold is affecting you just as much as it us.<eos> Yeah, but I can't feel it.
How did you get pregnant?<eos> He's none of your business.<eos> I'm not asking for a name.<eos> 'Cause you won't get one.<eos> The only thing that I have left is my word, and I ain't breaking it.
Yeah, here's my welcome back letter from weight watchers.<eos> - But Mr. Elliot...<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> It's about that time for me to go Skype him.<eos> I gotta tell him that I'm not going to England, because I wouldn't sell my place or get rid of it.
Al-Majalah was the first reported strike inside Yemen in seven years.<eos> It was clearly a U.S. Cruise missile that struck the Bedouin camp.<eos> Since there was no declared war in Yemen, I knew the strike was either JSOC or the CIA.<eos> And then I found this photo.<eos> The U.S. would have never released it, but Yemen's president posted it on his personal website- a presidential meeting with an important American guest, the head of the Joint Special Operations Command,
I think therefore I am.<eos> Hello Anna, do you have a question?<eos> Miss Anna, would you please turn in your phone?<eos> - Otherwise I must ask you... to leave this lecture hall.<eos> You can pick it up this afternoon.
I wish I could explain more, Jane, but I can't.<eos> All I know is that this building is evil.<eos> And you are in danger living here.<eos> How?<eos> Please you can't come back into my life, put it upside down and not explain why.
- Thanks.<eos> - Yeah. Donuts.<eos> Did Amber tell you I like donuts?<eos> I have a source.<eos> I can't tell you who it is.
He's... he's been a good friend to me.<eos> Be careful of him, Henry.<eos> The path you've been called to is rife with temptation.<eos> Your soul will be tested.<eos> Stand fast against evil wherever you find it.
- I've been drafting a letter.<eos> - For two years!<eos> Then what?<eos> Another year picking out a stamp?<eos> Another six months before you decide to lick it?
Not gone.<eos> Stolen.<eos> What do you mean, lockdown?<eos> Megan said a body is missing.<eos> Uh-huh. Somebody stole it, and nobody's going anywhere till they find it.
Well, he never did like Damon.<eos> I suppose I should do something, shouldn't I?<eos> Call him off, Klaus.<eos> You are in no position to make demands, love.<eos> Whilst I'd like to cure you to make more hybrids, I do have other reasons for finding the cure, not the least of which is destroying it so you lot can't use it against me.
You are a hero who helped your people.<eos> You're a beautiful woman who loved an ugly man.<eos> Really, really loved me.<eos> You find goodness in others.<eos> And when it's not there, you create it.
We had a mutual interest in finding the cure.<eos> That's all.<eos> - Had?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I'm willing to give up looking for it if you promise to leave my brother alone.
If he wasn't around anymore, this whole case would go away.<eos> Are you saying what I think you're saying?<eos> He's a damn animal.<eos> And I'm sick of cleaning up after him.<eos> We ask permission from Chicago, we'll never get it.
It's doomed, damon.<eos> See, you're not torturing me, man.<eos> You're torturing yourself by helping them Find the cure.<eos> I could kill you.<eos> Then no one would find it.
I'm in charge of food for the wedding.<eos> So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.<eos> Chris loves vegetables.<eos> Ron loves meat.<eos> And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it.
You really did that?<eos> Open it, find out.<eos> And what if you got it wrong?<eos> I mean, 'cause life doesn't get any better than this moment right now 'cause everything I ever wanted is inside... this box, right?<eos> There's no real reason to open it, then, is there?
What do you talk about?<eos> If someone said they saw you take your classmate's pen, and you said you didn't, my job would be to show that whoever saw you was mistaken.<eos> What happens if I did take the pen anyway?<eos> Well, then you'd be guilty.<eos> Yeah, but what if I said I didn't take it, and the person who saw me has bad eyesight, and you're so good at arguing they can't be sure it was me who took it?
It's over.<eos> Will!<eos> Are you coming?<eos> I never knew about this place.<eos> Yeah, Kate's cousin lets us use it every now and again.
You boys are all the same.<eos> Damon and Stefan still think that the girl they love is still in here somewhere, too.<eos> You can't blame them for having hope, Elena.<eos> It'd be a shame if the world lost a soul as compassionate as yours. "Your compassion is a gift, Elena."<eos> "Carry it with you always and forever." I remember reading that in a letter once.
Since he wasn't about to let an alien device fuse to his spine, he locked the scarab away.<eos> But Garrett still inspired Ted to become the second Blue Beetle, even with no superpowers.<eos> Ah, I hear those are optional.<eos> Anyway, Ted suspected the Light wanted the scarab back in play.<eos> He tried to stop them from stealing it, and paid the ultimate price.
I wasn't the one that pushed her.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> It's Anson Samuels' voice, that much is certain.<eos> The question is, has the video been manipulated in some way.<eos> If it hasn't, did Samuels orchestrate the pushing.
Sign those.<eos> I'll get Eli.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.<eos> That's 'cause I didn't give it to you.
Maybe hatred was the first one I got back.<eos> All the more reason to cure you.<eos> That way, we get the normal Elena back without all the ugly stages in between.<eos> I'm not taking the cure, Damon.<eos> Yes, you are, even if I have to break your neck or tie you up in chains until we find it.
Here. Check it out.<eos> Hope made it at daycare.<eos> Oh, my God. I love it.<eos> I absolutely love it.<eos> I'm never taking it off.
I really am very grateful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't often say it, but Rosamund is right.<eos> I do not know this Mr... Mr Drewe... but even if he is everything you say, to keep the child here would be like a permanent sword of Damocles, inches from your head.<eos> But I can't bear the thought of giving it away.
But it looks like he sees a personal trainer, though.<eos> Oh, this is not a happy marriage.<eos> Kip's portly but fights it.<eos> Missy is naturally thin and a gourmet baker.<eos> He views her hobby as a sabotage and resents it.
It was the result of careful consideration.<eos> If you're dissatisfied with it, there's nothing we can do if you want to quit.<eos> What will you do?<eos> That store is like a child I've carefully nurtured and raised.<eos> I could never just abandon it.
Or an attempt to intimidate him.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> The Helliwell property was revalued on 28th July last year.<eos> The valuer, George Gibson, lied when he made that valuation.<eos> He actually doubled the land value to prevent the owners from buying it back.
Another 150 demerol.<eos> I'll be waiting for you in recovery.<eos> Bill, we didn't make this baby together.<eos> Not really, we didn't, but...<eos> Can't we at least lose it together?
Sure you can.<eos> Looks like it might be cherry flavored.<eos> I'm not saying that I don't want it.<eos> Obviously I want it, but that's the only one.<eos> There's only one cure, and the hunters have made it pretty clear that they're willing to kill everyone in Mystic Falls until they get it.
- So what do you want?<eos> - I want you to leave Justin out of it.<eos> - I'm not sure I know what you mean. - He's a good man, Erin.<eos> He's a good man and he's got a good heart.<eos> Don't break it. Not as a way of getting towards me.
We have an appointment with an orthodontist.<eos> See, when I marry Todd, Emily's gonna have decent health insurance.<eos> Screw this country.<eos> Kids should have health insurance.<eos> Not having it... that's just stupid and mean.
Uh, he's--he's dead, but, uh, not the way you think.<eos> We had to flatline him to kill the nanotoxin.<eos> What?<eos> What about the antidote?<eos> They, uh, they never got it.
You suspect me?<eos> All traitors fall at last.<eos> Please, I beg you.<eos> I've been here all my life, stuck here...<eos> The sea is just 15 kilometers away, and I've never seen it.
Or a defendant, maybe even on a jury, but there's nothing.<eos> I can't... what am I missing?<eos> Maybe the obvious...<eos> That the profiler is right.<eos> Hey, just because I haven't found the connection yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
- Hey. Hey. Uh...<eos> I didn't know you were here. Sara, nice to see you.<eos> Hey, Larry.<eos> Coming to the retirement party?<eos> Wouldn't miss it.
Back when I met Lilah.<eos> Lilah ran a little crepe stand in the seventh arrondissement.<eos> Oh, Monty, looking at you, I could lie in this unheated garret forever.<eos> There's heat.<eos> I just don't turn it on.
You, uh, you helped me get into balasana pose. - Yeah.<eos> - How are you? Hey.<eos> Sorry for just dropping in like this. It's okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This baby is about to drop, and I don't want it.
- Just come on.<eos> Can you tell us what it is?<eos> Daniel found this light.<eos> I guess it'd been there all the time.<eos> We just never saw it.
- Oh, okay. - Please, Dale. You could get three years for accessory.<eos> I gave a friend a ride. That's it.<eos> He didn't wait to see if we found the recording.<eos> It screams guilty.<eos> - Y'all didn't find it, did you?
Captain, if Cory was driving the car when Briana Mathis was pushed out of it, he gives you everything you need to make a deal.<eos> And not for manslaughter, but murder, which is what the judge would like... me, too.<eos> Can you truthfully say that we would have followed up on Cory Stark if we did not know about the Mercedes through Mr. Goss' statement of facts or through the classified information revealed to us by the FBI?<eos> We can work that out later!<eos> If we knock on Stark's door without probable cause and the Mercedes is not in the garage, we may never find it.
- Hey.<eos> I brought us some dinner. ( Laughs )<eos> I hope you like biscuits and gravy because I brought extry.<eos> Did you just say "extry"?<eos> Yeah, I did, but if you don't like the word, I'll never use it again.
Which means, if we really want to find out which is the greatest taxi in the world, there is only one way to do it, and that is, as ever, in the prism of the furnace<eos> through the looking glass of the crucible of motorsport.<eos> That means a race, and the venue for our global showdown will be Lydden Hill in Kent, famous throughout the motorsport world for being the only race track with its own cab office.<eos> That plywood cab office looks perilously close to the track.<eos> I sincerely hope no harm befalls it.
You thought a sitting judge would ignore the law because you were doing the right thing?<eos> Okay, when you say it like that it makes me sound like...<eos> - Violet.<eos> - Stop.<eos> My whole life is shelter house, and I am not about to sell it because of your incompetence.
You want to protect the time line?<eos> Send me home.<eos> I can prevent Liber8 from ever coming to 2077, I can make sure none of this ever happens!<eos> I can make things right.<eos> And I'm able to destroy the device and no one will ever use it again.
James arrives in a few hours.<eos> By that time, we'll be ready.<eos> This place is pretty convincing for a place you don't use anymore.<eos> It used to be our transmission hub for our operatives in the Caribbean.<eos> Then we recruited one of the best satellite tech guys in Miami, so we don't need it anymore.
Which are your motivations?<eos> I remember I had a rabbit as a child...<eos> White.<eos> I named him Flaky.<eos> Grandpa gave it to me... my Flaky...
How dare you!<eos> Hijacking my case to set up a federal appeal?<eos> !<eos> We need to get this statute overturned.<eos> It is not being used to keep out illegal aliens, but rather to deport legal residents like Robert, who simply walked on to the wrong line!
He said if we ever returned to Asgard, he will kill us.<eos> But maybe he's changed.<eos> - He hasn't changed.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> I have one life left, Joanna, and I don't want to spend it here.
Wickham?<eos> Wickham? I killed him!<eos> My only friend and I killed him!<eos> I put it to you, Mr Wickham, that it was less Captain Denny's well-being that was on your mind, than saving yourself!<eos> You wanted to get him as far as possible from the scene of the crime, to make sure it was never found again!
That anger was all I had.<eos> What would I be without it?<eos> Happy.<eos> Weak.<eos> And look what good it did you, that "strength" you gained, 'cause I'm holding your heart in my hand, and I'm not hearing one reason not to squeeze it into ash.
More like a wolf in sheep's clothing.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Hessington Oil. I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Something dropped from the sky, tilted everything in your favor right after I cut you a break?<eos> Harvey, I gave you my word, and I honored it.
Another word for stained glass is "leadlight."<eos> Maybe the iron framework is a map.<eos> The concept of stained glass was never to see the world outside.<eos> Or to admit light.<eos> It was to control it, to use it to reveal something.
I mean, you were also dealing with the suspension of a name partner.<eos> Yes, um... That was a... tough period for us.<eos> But we got through it.<eos> And you kept Will Gardner's name on the letterhead.<eos> Was there ever any thought to taking it off?
Please be my friend, and let me be yours.<eos> [Knocks at door] - Hey. - Hey.<eos> Nice job getting Russel to us.<eos> Nice job getting the antivenom to Russel.<eos> A lot of hospitals don't even stock it anymore.
I was watching.<eos> So you know I did great with eight rebounds.<eos> Did you get the picture or not?<eos> I did, and thank you.<eos> So no one saw it.
You can give it the same name.<eos> No.<eos> Peter Pan is gone forever.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't remember seeing it from my dreams.
I'm amazed any of us get through the day alive.<eos> Is that supposed to make me feel better?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Life's a risk.<eos> You can't hide from it.
What in the hell does you getting a tattoo have to do with Katrina?<eos> I'm going to be an engineer.<eos> And I'm going to make sure shit like that never happens again.<eos> I don't want to walk into some big meeting with a mayor or a governor and roll up my sleeves and have a little Saints logo or a... or a Wile E. Coyote or anything that's gonna make him think that I'm anything other than his knight in shining armor.<eos> I got one life, and I'm not wasting it.
Yeah.<eos> You do me a favor, Fern?<eos> Anything.<eos> Can you burn that shirt for me?<eos> You saw good in me when I could not even see it in myself.
DEE:<eos> You guys having a principle fight?<eos> No, we're not having a principle fight.<eos> We're having a heat fight, okay?<eos> 'Cause our heat's broken, and Hwang won't fix it until this guy pays the rent.
There's something I never told you before.<eos> When my heart was ripped from me... I mean, literally taken from my chest...<eos> I thought that hole could never be filled.<eos> And then you got it back for me.<eos> Since then, I didn't really use it properly.
But if you air this unconfirmed, you're ruined, and you know it.<eos> Please, just let my colleagues do their job, let them investigate this.<eos> Give them some time and wait for the facts.<eos> And in the meantime, can we please enjoy this reunion tomorrow night?<eos> It only comes around every ten years, and I really, really don't want to miss it because of this.
Here is no longer stay<eos> - lf thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away<eos> - What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say<eos> - My lord, will it please you to fall to?<eos> - Taste of it first, as thou wert wont to do
Now all the attention is going to go away.<eos> Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled!<eos> That's it! I'm down to seven friends.<eos> He's counting hobbits and superheroes, right?<eos> When I thought the element was real, I didn't want it.
"Caught me a leprechaun.<eos> Let's get his gold."<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Throwing it away would seem like blasphemy, but putting it back would be blasphemy, too.
Card.<eos> "The teenager is Armenian.<eos> The day is Rosh Hashanah.<eos> "The dish is saag paneer."<eos> I don't want it.
It's a white lie, what's that matter?<eos> That's no big deal.<eos> So it's a little lie.<eos> There's no other way.<eos> You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
Call the police!<eos> My dear Sixsmith, you alone can understand how I'm feeling right now.<eos> Today, Ayrs and I presented our first collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring Ayrs favorite conductor who arrived from Berlin.<eos> It's called "Eternal Recurrence".<eos> Wish you could hear it.
It must have broken its wing.<eos> Don't worry, it will heal in time.<eos> I'll look after it. You possess a rare beauty, my love.<eos> In here.<eos> Never lose it.
Do I look like I'm fuckin' lying?<eos> And if I am fuckin' lying, go get the baby.<eos> And give it to them, cos that's what they fuckin' want!<eos> - I ain't giving them the fucking baby back!<eos> - Well, they ain't getting it either!
Ready?<eos> - Ready.<eos> Animal Rights!<eos> Happiness is a journey, not a destination.<eos> But we do not understand it as it occurs.
Knees Down is a kid in a wheelchair that fucks a lot of hot bitches. 'Cause he has a big dick.<eos> I got hydraulics.<eos> Flippin' switches, flippin switches, flippin' switches.<eos> I'm having trouble with this word right here,<eos> I can't seem to pronounce, announciate it right.
Weapons!<eos> Now.<eos> Who would have blood?<eos> This place.<eos> The very air clings to the flesh, tainting it.
You played me with a fake kid?<eos> No, the kid's real.<eos> He's just not sick.<eos> But you are-- with hepatitis.<eos> Since I don't have it, I know you didn't give me blood.
I'm gonna be married.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's gonna be more than okay.<eos> It's gonna be the best day of your life.<eos> Are you sure nothing's gonna ruin it?
You know what else is her call?<eos> Everything bad ever.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> As long as it's unspoiled,<eos> Alaric is one witch away from finding it.
We're running out of time.<eos> - May I continue?<eos> - Don't push it.<eos> The crew is in a mobile lab.<eos> I think I have a way to locate it from inside the program.
- Are you crazy?<eos> - Pull yourself together, man.<eos> We have company.<eos> Fargo, what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, this lab is restricted, so thank you for unlocking it, Dr. Fargo.
Please take care.<eos> Bye. Try to understand, Adi.<eos> I like girls more than boys.<eos> Listen, if you were in a electronics shop then you would've been a convertor.<eos> And take off this t-shirt. You've lost the right to wear it.
You might try anything to make yourself feel normal.<eos> Kids kill themselves because of it.<eos> Okay, but is it relevant to who killed Corvis?<eos> He creates a disorder.. That doesn't exist.<eos> Then he comes up with a treatment regiment for it.
It's time to pick a side. Oh, I have a side.<eos> I earn what they pay us.<eos> And I do the damn job the way they taught us.<eos> Is he for real?<eos> The job is to shovel this city's shit so the good people in this Metropolis can pretend it ain't there.
His home?<eos> Gave me some tabs... to help me sleep.<eos> He had trouble and all himself like that.<eos> Said for me to take the bed.<eos> Said he didn't use it any more.
Well... When I was a little kid, my whole life was this bear.<eos> And my dad... You know, he made me feel like I was the only thing in the whole world that mattered. You know?<eos> Like I was the light in his life.<eos> You know... One day, that light went off.<eos> (Exhales deeply) I don't know why, but nothing I could do could flick it back on again. You know?
And you should be overjoyed I'm letting you keep anything at all.<eos> You can always crown another rat to take over your operation.<eos> 50%.<eos> Now give me my box.<eos> I told you, I don't have it.
You know, it's difficult and I understand how we all have to be, - you know, grown-up and...<eos> - About young people and sex and whatnot.<eos> Well, thanks, Joe.<eos> Can't say I've ever had a father's permission before.<eos> I don't think I've ever needed it.
- Cook, arrow.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Where did it go?<eos> - Hold still!<eos> I can't see it.
I figured if I just... reported Pablo missing, they would stop looking.<eos> I really did become a better person that day.<eos> I stopped drinking, I stopped fighting.<eos> I got myself together, started trying to live the way he wanted me to, the way he would have.<eos> I took his name, but... I tried to do the right thing with it.
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band.<eos> For others say thou dost deserve, and I believe it better than reportingly.<eos> DON PEDRO: I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon. CLAUDIO:<eos> I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me.<eos> Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.
Okay.<eos> So if this guy came after you first, then what, then?<eos> Osterman contracted your hit to him?<eos> And when he went missing, Osterman then called Barton to clean up the mess and finish the job?<eos> But Barton couldn't finish it.
Let's do this.<eos> Ay!<eos> So...<eos> There's so much beauty in photography.<eos> I just wanted to take that notion and turn it on its head, so the theme of my work is "taking the beauty out of beauty."
Yes but his is stiff... as a club.<eos> What?<eos> It's true.<eos> What happened?<eos> He gave me this heart but I don't want it.
Mister Ali.<eos> The father.<eos> 24 minutes later than the first call.<eos> What did you think about your daughter's behaviour?<eos> I didn't like it.
What else have we got?<eos> The judge has granted us access to Naomi Walling's apartment.<eos> I'm not sure what we would find there.<eos> Well, it wouldn't hurt to look.<eos> Rachel Welling hasn't sold it yet.
We're gonna hack all of them.<eos> If the threat's in the building, we should get to know our neighbors.<eos> You're into 16 networks already?<eos> When the phone company puts in your wi-fi, the password is your phone number.<eos> Most people never even change it.
The night of Vanessa Campbell's abduction, that signature became part of his torture. Why these songs?<eos> What do they say about him?<eos> Go ahead, Morgan?<eos> We just found Vanessa Campbell's body.<eos> He didn't even bother hiding it.
Let's go.<eos> Okay, Unit 2251.<eos> It's gotta be down here.<eos> Look, in case you were wondering, it's hard for me too.<eos> You know, I keep expecting to see that look in your eye, and it isn't there.
We just happen to like each other.<eos> I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is... a coincidence.<eos> - And we are very happy for you, sweetheart.<eos> Here, have some more turkey.<eos> - Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but there's a lot more of it.
Loss of job, home, family.<eos> What event could cause each of those?<eos> What if it's the emotional toll of a failed relationship?<eos> He's targeting victims with broken hearts.<eos> Once the trust is broken, you never get it back.
Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it.<eos> Hey, smart ass, yes, you can.<eos> You have insurance.<eos> Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.<eos> P.S. I haven't had it in years.
I-I need your connections to help us get this God dang tape.<eos> Mmm, let me put on my murder, she wrote glasses and I will get on it.<eos> Actually, they're just reading glasses, but when I lose my keys, I put 'em on and boom, I instantly find 'em.<eos> 'Cause you can actually see.<eos> When you do find that tape, don't watch it, just bring it straight to me.
Until that or she regains consciousness, we have to follow the law, and unfortunately, that means listening to David Gibson.<eos> This is not the time to cover your ass, Charlotte.<eos> Really, Pete? Addison, Joanna wants kids, okay?<eos> She told me she does.<eos> And maybe that baby wasn't David's, or maybe it was and he didn't want it, but you cannot go in there and take away her chance for becoming a mother.
I can't help it.<eos> It's a biological disaster zone.<eos> It's like two miles of Dali paintings walking around free.<eos> So, your car? Yes.<eos> It broke down at the base of the road, and no one will tow it because it's a private road... completely unmarked, by the way.
We checked him out and his gold hard cash business, it seems, is just a sideline.<eos> He was connected to the gold bullion robbery at Gatwick in 2008 and the Tottenham warehouse gold heist last year.<eos> He's a fence?<eos> He's a middle man for stolen gold bullion.<eos> He uses his Gold Hard Cash business as a cover to melt it down and sell it on.
- So... by the time the police arrived, both the car and the driver were gone.<eos> And Vicky didn't want to talk about it, and nobody saw anything but the car.<eos> Not many fender-busted Bentleys get sold for scrap around here.<eos> Oh, yeah, and, um, car's registered in your name.<eos> I wasn't driving it.
Next, I'll disassemble the Pascal.<eos> The real one is exponentially larger.<eos> Getting it out is gonna be a problem.<eos> We don't have time to plan a rooftop escape.<eos> And neither one of us can carry it out.
- Black-market tech replaced your eyes.<eos> - I don't need a history lesson.<eos> - You were gonna stop running civilians.<eos> - I had an open order with him.<eos> - From the old days. I never cancelled it.
- Ha, ha. What's a guy gotta do to get a good home-cooked meal around here?<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Just passing Kenmore Square.<eos> What do you mean, it's the sun?<eos> Even though we can't see it, it's in the sky.
I got the distinct impression you rather like being left undone.<eos> I do.<eos> - There's hope in it...<eos> And her path is still unchosen.<eos> Maybe it's time to choose it.
Cops don't have nannies.<eos> We have babysitters and mother-in-laws.<eos> And if you don't have a mother-in-law?<eos> I don't give a damn if it's the father or the mother, but somebody has to stay their ass at home.<eos> Bottom line, don't have a kid if nobody has time to raise it. That's all I'm saying.
Every user who calls must identify their license number.<eos> It's part of the user agreement.<eos> So Syrian government agencies bought the software and registered it, just like any other honest user?<eos> It appears so.<eos> But they couldn't use it without your help.
Did you do something inappropriate?<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare my presentation on entrance and exit wounds.<eos> You look stunning, Detective.<eos> Got my fingerprint-enhancement device.<eos> You ready to try it?
Are you kidding? This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.<eos> The sheep that watch my show are going to eat this up like tiramisu.<eos> Tiramisu is an Italian dessert...<eos> I know what tiramisu is, okay.<eos> And sheep don't eat it.
- Like me.<eos> - It's the code I live by.<eos> Code, huh?<eos> Sometimes life just has to be taken.<eos> There's no need to dress it up.
Before I married Rita, before I had a son, before Deb knew who I was, before I fell in love.<eos> What difference does any of that make?<eos> Somewhere along the line, the fake life that we created as a cover for me to kill became real.<eos> It's not fake to me anymore.<eos> I don't want to lose it.
I can't...<eos> I'd locate the fistula endoscopically, then inject fibrin glue.<eos> What about an abscess?<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, apparently, you have ruled it out.
Sounds rockin'.<eos> We'll wake up the PackBot and blow your projectile the hell out of here.<eos> Come on, Andy, push that crap on out the way.<eos> This is a damn three-foot- long, high explosive shell.<eos> Now, why can't I see it, Corporal?
Anything's better than giving the business to those crooks.<eos> I thought you said it made you feel a loser.<eos> Yeah, but then pop pointed out that your desk doesn't have any drawers, so I feel a little better about myself.<eos> It's very stylish.<eos> Just don't call it a desk.
You know, I was just back East 'cause my sister got married, and it was really neat, you know, they took each other's last names.<eos> They hyphenated it, you know?<eos> So now my sister's name is:<eos> Susan Silverman-Abromowitz.<eos> They're thinking of just shortening it to just:
What it should say is, "Very poor, because in the last corner you turned them all into smoke."<eos> Yes, I'm just taking the children to school now.<eos> I'm on the school run.<eos> Just turning left into Acacia Avenue.<eos> The biggest problem though with this car is that it's not what you'd call comfortable.
But if she was released, why kill to get your own kid?<eos> Her maternal rights must have been terminated.<eos> Yeah. That happens when you have sex with one of your high school students 2 years ago.<eos> His name, Thomas Brown, aka Tommy Brown, and he is little Johnny's baby daddy, like, for real.<eos> Teacher love syndrome. She gave birth to Tommy's baby in jail, and then when Tommy's mom refused to raise it, the baby was put in foster care.
My aunt called me 'cheeky' since my childhood.<eos> And I earned the 'rogue' title on my own.<eos> I made a lot of money... but spent most of it for my pleasure.<eos> When you're thirsty, you've got to go to the well.<eos> I quench my thirst, ljust don't take it home.
I don't give a damn about some dodgy middle-aged council.<eos> You come into my house, throw around false accusations, and then you have the nerve to drink my beer?<eos> My ring.<eos> Give it back.<eos> Get it yourself.
I have, like, five things from Netflix.<eos> I have, like, an animated one, and a few Jen Aniston ones.<eos> I have, like, an original James Bond with Pierce Brosnan if you're into that, or something else.<eos> No, it's not the movies, it's just my knee.<eos> It just, like, really starts to ache if I can't stretch it out.
Cuff her.<eos> Burn Notice 6x15 Best Laid Plans Original Air Date on December 6, 2012<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> An interrogation typically begins with deprivation and discomfort.<eos> That means the thermostat cranked all the way up, uncomfortable furniture, dim lights that strain the eyes, and if there's food, not much of it.
Sorry about that. I'll leave.<eos> Ken sanders had a hidden camera.<eos> Okay, look, the video fragment stops there, But at least now we know why global has people on the widow.<eos> Look, man, you find the rest of this footage, You can prove negligence.<eos> They think she's got the whole video. And they're not gonna stop till they get it.
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.<eos> Nellie's pretty fearless.<eos> And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.<eos> Pam!<eos> Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be.
Are you offering an officer of the court a bribe, chief?<eos> I was not trying to.<eos> Because I like single malts.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> Sometimes to uphold the law, you can't be afraid to bend it... or crumple it up into a ball and throw it in the damn corner.
I've no right to ask you this, sir.<eos> One night of holding you, I know it does not give me liberty to dare.<eos> But do you love her?<eos> Clara...<eos> Forgive me, sir, but as you stood beside her today, I looked for it, I believe I wanted to see your happiness, but I couldn't find it.
I have something for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> An invitation, dear man, to a very exclusive auction.<eos> Let me guess -- where you'll be selling the tablet?<eos> Well, when we acquire an item as hot as the word of God, it's smart to unload it as fast as possible.
There's something wrong with her.<eos> Just promise me you won't stop looking for the cure.<eos> Klaus won't let me, even if I wanted to.<eos> What does he care?<eos> He doesn't even want it.
Isn't that a thing?<eos> Why am I in this picture?<eos> No, that's not a thing.<eos> You know what's bad luck?<eos> Folding a picture instead of cutting it, and then 25 years later, having to explain to your son that he's adopted.
Let's go back in.<eos> Closer.<eos> I think we got enough pictures.<eos> It's snowing way too much. You think we can get the title picture?<eos> Postpone it if we can't.
- You did everything he asked!<eos> You could have shot him!<eos> You let her die. Right in front of her father.<eos> Has the body been removed from the water?<eos> They are still trying to recover it.
I've been working up a little model of the design.<eos> Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together.<eos> Great. And then you can come to our wedding.<eos> - What?<eos> It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date.
Come down before we pull you down.<eos> Well, hey. Ease up. What's the problem?<eos> Look, I don't want to be up here, you know?<eos> But this is my daughter's favorite tree.<eos> And my partner, he's all up in arms about them cutting it down, so-
Found the vanished Magadha treasures for the Tang Dynasty in AD 647.<eos> The location is about 30 meters under the ice surface, inside a huge ice cave.<eos> Another tremendous discovery of yours.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You are a part of it.
I was wondering if you can tell me where it was coming from.<eos> Is there anything that you can do?<eos> You know, I think it's my grandfather and he's senile and he might be trying to get a hold of me.<eos> Actually, I have a missing person's report.<eos> I have the number right in front of me. I can read it to you if you want.
Ah yes, our local hero.<eos> Sergeant Gurung.<eos> Sergeant Sarabjit Singh.<eos> Mr. Billimoria, where should we dispatch the body to?<eos> Where it belongs!
You shot him.<eos> Not personally, but I can see how you'd get there.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> Vargas' body is at St. Anne's Hospital.<eos> We're gonna need you to go there and lock it down...
Pericardial effusion.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Keep this on.<eos> There's fluid built up around your heart.<eos> It's constricting it from beating.
You don't have the happiness and willingness to do stuff, create stuff, be creative.<eos> You get bunkered in, just laying around watching TV.<eos> And the very second the sun starts shining, there's some kind of euphoria in people.<eos> And in some way, you have to go out, you have to do stuff outside.<eos> You have to take the opportunity to experience the sun, the warmth, for as long as you have it.

I wanted Minnick to add value, but she wouldn't work with him.<eos> So, you sided with Minnick and tossed Richard aside?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I had a choice to make, Grey, and I didn't want to make it, because, yes, Dr. Webber built this place.<eos> But I have to keep building it. So I do that by asking myself 100 times a day
That's gonna be a hell of a spin.<eos> Not that I doubt your skills.<eos> Still got three days left on the cease-fire.<eos> Including today.<eos> We'll work on extending it first thing tomorrow.
Come on... How do we decide which team we're rooting for?<eos> Iran is willing to totally revert back to the original deal plus five more years of IAEA inspections if Israel will agree to preserve a cease-fire.<eos> So we give up everything we negotiated for?<eos> How is this progress?<eos> Because it's the same deal we had in place before, only now Israel's part of it.
Alex, you doing all right?<eos> Good.<eos> Anyway, listen.<eos> Somebody actually posted a video of your performance on the Atlanta NextFest Web site.<eos> And I'm telling you right now, the reaction to it, the response has been off the charts.
Well I know that they're... Well above, uh, even nuclear weapons and secrecy.<eos> One particular night we just finished our refueling mission,<eos> London control called us and asked us if we would intercept a UFO over the center of England, roughly in the Stonehenge, Oxford area.<eos> We're up at about 33,000 feet, and these UFOs were down at about a thousand feet.<eos> We dove on it.
If your murder case hangs on this video, lots of luck.<eos> Thanks for the pep talk, Boss.<eos> The video in question was recorded by an active duty sailor.<eos> It's property of the Navy.<eos> Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-council have the necessary security clearance to watch this video, much less possess it.
Now, I've had to give a lot of notifications to family over the years, so I know how hard it is.<eos> So you don't have to sugar coat anything for me.<eos> All right?<eos> Okay, so... is Lexi gonna make it?<eos> Her heart already stopped. And, uh, we were able to get it going again.
I know a way to sneak you out of the sector.<eos> Senator, we'll get you to that meeting.<eos> Give them the coordinates to Dantooine.<eos> The rebel squadron defended their transport vigorously, but we thwarted their attempt to refuel.<eos> A scan of the vessel before it was destroyed revealed no cargo aboard, and only a small crew.
Mordo?<eos> Hello?<eos> Daniel, I see they made you master of this sanctum.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> That you'll die protecting it.
I need to talk and you need to be quiet for a change.<eos> Ght. But listen, Danny, I just...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Like I said,<eos> I've been in love with you my whole life and I'm gonna be in love with you for the rest of it.
Love...<eos> Love is a strange beast.<eos> You can whip it, starve it, push it deep down in your insides.<eos> But you can't pull it out of you.<eos> If your heart knows where it belongs you'll fight with the whole world to get there.
Dear Bobby,<eos> It's raining here today.<eos> Very pretty, but a bit melancholy.<eos> Leonard says it's the poignancy of life:<eos> and not only do we have to embrace it's meaninglessness... but celebrate life because it has no meaning.
Then you should know what I'm planning.<eos> - Which is...?<eos> - One law, one custom, one people.<eos> Common laws cut into pillars and placed in every settlement across the Shieldlands.<eos> Each Thane will see that their people adhere to it or answer to me.
- Come on!<eos> We need to hide the body.<eos> Quickly.<eos> They're coming.<eos> I heard it breathe.
Look at that.<eos> The billboard outside cutler's office.<eos> At the time of the murder, there's no artwork on it or graffiti.<eos> That street art was put up this morning. After cutler's murder.<eos> Maybe the artist that put it up there is saying something or saw something.
Chasing after monsters?<eos> We've been given another case, Mulder.<eos> It has a monster in it.<eos> One witness claimed that the creature had three eyes and the other one, one.<eos> Notice they didn't get a picture of it, which is odd, because everybody always has a camera on them these days.
But his hover-tronic<eos> Frink-a-ma-car is parked outside.<eos> Hey, if I say he ain't here, he ain't here.<eos> Hey, Moe, there's a rat floating in my beer.<eos> It ain't there.
There was a scene outside of his work with a young woman his colleagues took to be a former au pair.<eos> I suspect if we were to put her in a line-up, Dr. Lorenz colleagues would soon pick out Lady Georgina as that young woman.<eos> Your sister discovered that not only was the animal that attacked her alive, but that Dr. Lorenz was using it as part of his research.<eos> I think she planned to use the tiger to exact her revenge, only Goggins got careless and the animal escaped.<eos> It looks as if it was your sister who stole the tigress musk and dosed Dr. Lorenz's handkerchief with it, in the hope that it would bring the animal to him.
- Hmm? - I felt for him.<eos> You weren't at the Siege of Salas, Porthos.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Spanish had that town surrounded for almost a year.<eos> And the people defending it were driven to eating dogs, rats...
And it helped us both find peace with what happened to our family.<eos> Wally, don't make a mistake you're gonna regret the rest of your life.<eos> Go see your mom while you still can. No sign of tachyon activity.<eos> We're running out of time. We've got to find them.<eos> It'll take a few minutes for the device to reach full power once it's activated, but when we find it, you're gonna have to get there fast.
You see that family drama you so joyfully deride, does have its merits.<eos> You can kill me, but the prophecy still stands.<eos> You cannot outrun it.<eos> I've had about a thousand years too much from you.<eos> For a century, you lived with my name, and you never did quite recover from losing it, did you?
What's the big thought I'm not thinking?<eos> We can still find Valentine.<eos> I might know a way.<eos> My mother hid a lot from me, but I did see one thing... there's a box.<eos> She didn't think I knew about it.
A new sensation for me.<eos> I shall attempt to get used to it.<eos> Now that my family can look forward,<eos> I appreciate the restless momentum of Hong Kong.<eos> I dare say, I feel a part of it.
She's my kid.<eos> I can tell her.<eos> My old apartment, huh?<eos> Is it weird that she lives here?<eos> Not as weird as your living in the fake version of it in Mary goodwin's basement.
That means babies that mommy dog has. And they were black.<eos> Except Blacky.<eos> He was golden.<eos> So when I took him home I thought it would be nice to pretend that he was like his brothers and sisters.<eos> I have a picture if you'd like to see it.
He was afraid that the rest of DHS would find out about what he was doing.<eos> But why would he get in trouble for wanting to keep looking for terrorists?<eos> That was his job.<eos> He was doing it outside of DHS. He was doing it outside of the law.<eos> Hill believed that there was a major threat out there somewhere, and, for whatever reason, he didn't think that DHS would support him in stopping it.
I missed you.<eos> Yeah, I, uh, dyed my hair to hide.<eos> I don't need to hide anymore.<eos> Lizzy, I misspoke earlier... about your child.<eos> I said that having it would be... inconvenient.
But it's the losing that haunts us.<eos> This can't happen.<eos> You know why I left this place?<eos> 'Cause I hated everything about it.<eos> Couldn't stand the sight of it.
You guys could sneak into the rocket itself, screw with some gears.<eos> The surveillance system surrounding the entire launch site makes that virtually impossible.<eos> Fuel.<eos> It's the last thing loaded onboard before takeoff.<eos> If we can dilute the fuel before it's pumped in, the rocket won't have enough thrust to make it into orbit.
Elizabeth!<eos> What matters is that you're running for president, and without President Grant's support...<eos> I told you, I don't want his support.<eos> He is the leader of your party, Susan.<eos> Without it, you'll lose the election.
All-new fixtures. Brand new window AC.<eos> Well, it will have.<eos> Very airy, Gary Derryberry.<eos> Yeah, I see holes for the limiter screws.<eos> They would've kept the window closed tight on the AC unit to prevent it from falling out.
If Peng knew anything about this, he would've strung me out by my balls the second he found out.<eos> Like you said, he plays the long game... and he was gonna kill you as soon as I took off.<eos> I'm sorry about your people, Tom... but I promise you there is something much bigger going on here than me and that girl smuggling cure across the borders.<eos> Are we even sure he's Vietnamese?<eos> This blade's got some other kind of writing on it.
Just an initial C.<eos> Cratchit?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Martha will just be wanting to make an entrance.<eos> The department of the detective that I represent, Bob, has one very clear purpose - to reveal the perpetrator of this murder by establishing the motive for it and the opportunity to carry it out.
Fan out, south and south-west.<eos> Ask yourself... any sign of a ruck... we need to search.<eos> Some will say this is what killed him, this from which the ruin of his life was made.<eos> This is the response, not the question.<eos> Edmund Reid, who sees life and it's puzzles clearer than you?
Do you want to tell me what we're looking for?<eos> Iceland.<eos> Under "distinguishing marks,"<eos> the medical examiner listed a small mole.<eos> It's location...
- Not by law.<eos> Lucca, can you give us a minute?<eos> - We can't be a part of this.<eos> - She's right on the law.<eos> And how it's enforced.
I want to see that baby live and that's what my sister Ash wanted as well.<eos> - ButwhatdoesJanetwant?<eos> - Your Honour!<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Probably, because she's so busy, she'll just let it sit there in that facility until it's too late and she has to destroy it.
None of this is real.<eos> This all happened a long time ago.<eos> We fell in love. We got married.<eos> And now, Belle, you are with child.<eos> The child was in danger, so you put yourself to sleep to keep it safe.
Well, catch us up.<eos> Where have you guys been?<eos> In the woods, where the action is, looking for their burrow and saving your ass.<eos> What?<eos> Well, one of the reasons we've been holed up in the trees is because Jesse hates the town and everyone in it.
The problem with the War on Terror is that it's not terrifying enough.<eos> ISIS doesn't deny their attacks.<eos> They film them, publicize them, brag about them.<eos> If I executed that plan in the journal, I wouldn't deny it.<eos> But what I do deny is planting a bomb that destroyed only one desk and the measly four Muslims near it.
It's time to finish our drive.<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Okay, that's the last of them-- is that enough, Walter?<eos> The magnetic field is strong, and the sub's already entered it.
The difference between having powers and having precision.<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> I mean, it's gonna take more than speed to take down some of these metas.<eos> You got to think, anticipate.<eos> When you enter a new environment, you got to case every inch of it.
- - I didn't sleep at all.<eos> Did you know about it?<eos> - - No. Not even about the recording?<eos> - - I had no idea of the content.<eos> We think Wendt was using it to blackmail Linn, is that right?
Clearly, there was no intentional wrongdoing here.<eos> Still, uh, we don't want this to happen to anyone else.<eos> That's why I think it would be best if we do an autopsy, so that we can get a full picture of exactly what happened.<eos> The body's already been released to the funeral home.<eos> We'd need your consent to get it back.
- Did you say your name was...?<eos> - Blue. - B-l-u-e, Blue?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's not a nickname.<eos> - My dad liked the sound of it. - Uh-huh.
We didn't want to make you uncomfortable, Judy.<eos> How considerate of you.<eos> So that's why no one called me?<eos> Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.<eos> So I was supposed to be notified when it was taken back.
It's not a bad thing, it's just... it's a thing.<eos> This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.<eos> Cartography.<eos> Your neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.<eos> And you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer.
- He's a prisoner.<eos> He doesn't have a key.<eos> He can't even remember who he is.<eos> But he'll know what his prison is like.<eos> He'll know the boundaries of it.
Then explain it to us. 'Cause it looks really, really bad.<eos> It was completely my fault.<eos> Your father found out that I was having an affair with another man.<eos> What?<eos> You all may not know this yet, but marriages often get to a point when the person who is the source of your happiness suddenly seems to be the one standing in the way of it.
There is a fundamental problem that we're going to have to deal with in terms of a Mars mission that was never the case with the Apollo program, and that is the human body and how do we protect it for long,<eos> We are exceptionally fragile creatures.<eos> We are very well evolved to survive at sea level, on this planet and nowhere else.<eos> In the absence of gravity lots of things can go wrong,<eos> your heart doesn't have to work as hard and so it becomes less effective, your brain has challenges, controls your movements, the body seems to be demineralizing your bones, these are all very important to study,
All right, how about a unicorn?<eos> Right?<eos> I bet you don't have one of those.<eos> No, that is true, yeah.<eos> Might be fun to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh, maybe break off the horn, grind it up, snort it.
Gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Ramsay was killed with a single stab wound to the heart.<eos> No, he was stabbed twice, as I recall.<eos> Indeed, but the second wound has no bruising or discolouration.<eos> It was inflicted at least half an hour after death.
Does the guacamole have nuts in it?<eos> What?<eos> Why does this matter?<eos> Well, I'm allergic.<eos> In the event of a tornado you wanna go straight for the eye of it.
As a victim.<eos> Is he right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I lost time, Tasha.<eos> I just don't remember that part of my life the same way I remember the rest of it.
You don't get to get off the hook by mouthing some half-baked philosophy.<eos> You really want to pay for Hammers?<eos> You need to talk to me, Cheryl.<eos> I'm racking my brain. Nothing's coming to me.<eos> Watching a murder and doing nothing to prevent it leaves you equally culpable.
And then he says, "Maybe your kid"<eos> "should find another sport." And... I just snapped.<eos> John. These are the kinds of things we need to know.<eos> The prosecution has the video.<eos> And Mercado's gonna lead with it at trial.
Look behind it.<eos> See there's nothing wired to it.<eos> This is L-7.<eos> [man on TV] The new prison at Lucasville is one of the largest in the United States.<eos> It cost more than $23 million to build.
I could no sooner get rid of this book than I could...<eos> Well, it looks like I'm not the only one getting nostalgic.<eos> You've had such a wonderful life.<eos> I like to think so.<eos> I just wish you... you know, that she could have been there for more of it.
Look, I'm sorry. The rest of the band is stuck in traffic.<eos> So I'm gonna rock three times as hard!<eos> As a young boy i found solace in the forest wild and free 'til that fateful day youth was ripped away 'neath the boughs of an old oak tree he wrapped his leaves around my fragile frame and thrust me to the grass<eos> how my face did blanche as his mighty branch did penetrate my ass<eos> now when a tree comes in the forest tell me do you think it makes a sound?
It's kind of weird because it's the only country in South America where they sing in Portuguese.<eos> It's an anomaly, right?<eos> I learned that word in your book.<eos> I like that word. Anomaly.<eos> I like the way it sounds and I like what it means.
You get Magnums?<eos> No, but she thinks I use them.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> Okay. I buy Magnums and I buy regular ones.<eos> I open up the Magnum package, take out the condom, put in a regular size condom and reseal it.
I work hard for you!<eos> I give you one job to take care of your brother and you screw that up!<eos> Hello, John Densmore, please.<eos> Fredi Cameron calling.<eos> Can you let John know that I've been thinking about it, and, I wanted to check and see if the job was still available.
that he had inherited it from its creator, kind of like a business acquisition.<eos> The FBI has told me that that was Ross Ulbricht lying to me.<eos> If it is a lie, it would require just a lot of foresight and planning, kind of like the... you know, an amazing game of chess or something.<eos> In the first days of the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Ross kept a journal on his laptop describing his involvement in the Silk Road and that the Bitcoins seized from his laptop came directly from the site.<eos> While the defense would argue that Ross abandoned the Silk Road after creating it and that the journal and the Bitcoin were planted on his laptop.
Don't call him that.<eos> Well?<eos> Well what?<eos> The crimes you've committed against your crew are undisputed.<eos> The only reason the sentence hasn't been carried out is that I've been delaying the vote in hopes that you might help me find a way to get that gold, or as much of it as possible, off that beach.
Go all the way to hell!<eos> It's them.<eos> Civilization needs its monsters.<eos> You think Whitehall wants piracy to flourish in the Bahamas?<eos> No, I don't think they want it, but I think they're aware of the cost associated with trying to fight it.
And you think that the Republicans in Congress will cooperate with you?<eos> Oh, I think that it has been proved that both parties want the same thing.<eos> A new president in 2016?<eos> No.<eos> No, I think actually, I think unemployment, eradicating it, and I think a strong economy is something both parties want.
Now, if I remember my training correctly, one of the lessons was titled...<eos> "Don't Dig Up the Big Box of Plutonium, Mark."<eos> I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft, but if they rupture around humans... no more humans.<eos> Which is why we buried it when we arrived.<eos> And planted that flag... so we would never be stupid enough to accidentally go near it again. But as long as I don't break it... I almost just said
Well, she wanted an ascension.<eos> Let's answer her prayers.<eos> Stand by, Miss Mary Teresa Shepherd, late of 23 Gloucester Crescent.<eos> UP You go.<eos> Starting out as someone incidental to my life, she remained on the edge of it so long, she became not incidental to it at all.
He's gone.<eos> And the only way for us to stop Aleister now<eos> - is to kill Clay.<eos> - Jeremy, that is not going to happen.<eos> What if we find Aleister's body and just kill it instead?
And that's how you're gonna survive. Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> I'm someone who knows who you are.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> And it's not gonna happen again.<eos> I've been protecting this place, Helping provide for it.
It's just that Camille's work is often shoddy.<eos> I believe her grades reflect that.<eos> We share a house, so she had access to my optogenetics harness.<eos> Plus she wants to publish first, so she has a motive.<eos> I demand a full investigation, and I want Kirsten placed on academic suspension while it's taking place.
He injects himself multiple times a day.<eos> But for the past 24 hours, he has been denied the drug.<eos> As you can see, his need for the morphine is immense.<eos> Other than discharging electricity, this device, a rheoscope, can detect it.<eos> Using it, I hope to identify the region of Mr. Carton's brain that is stimulated by the morphine.
- This is your fault.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I thought about Angelo's insurance settlement.<eos> Maybe we could use some of it to help get Melody's new program off the ground.
- Let her go.<eos> - No, you're gonna watch.<eos> - No!<eos> - Listen!<eos> Listen, you think I ruined your marriage, but I may have been a part of saving it.
A year after that, the first fragments of one of these so-called eggs was found in a meteor near our drilling site in Alaska.<eos> With the government's blessing,<eos> I've devoted the resources of this company to track down ever meteor that fell that night.<eos> This was the only egg that was found intact.<eos> So you can imagine my reluctance to letting it leave this facility.
Since I'm dying and you're an aging alcoholic with no purpose.<eos> No offense.<eos> I thought that we both wanted to be doing something crazy when we go.<eos> I was talking about enjoying life. - Yeah.<eos> - Not ending it.
You'll just be stuck underground, Like the rest of us.<eos> How's everyone doing?<eos> Just trying to keep busy.<eos> Everyone deals with it in their own way.<eos> When you sign up for this kind of life, You accept that loss will be part of it,
Yes, I did lose a fountain pen on Fifth Avenue.<eos> How about the bumper off a fleetmaster? Anything like that?<eos> Just the bumper?<eos> Wish you'd found the entire car.<eos> I reported it stolen several days ago.
You know why I wasn't afraid?<eos> Because you were there.<eos> Even though I really was scared, having you there is how I could stand up to Grodd.<eos> Every time I falter or make a mistake, the thought of you is what picks me up and keeps me going.<eos> Look, look, what I'm trying to say is, even though you didn't know everything about my life this past year, that does not mean that you weren't a part of it.
A lot of good it's done.<eos> Well, here's your chance to help that girl.<eos> I am taking you to your son.<eos> We've only stayed alive this long by keeping our distance.<eos> If your parenting didn't make him a sociopath, the lack of it did.
And her husband did this?<eos> Apparently so.<eos> God help us.<eos> What did he do with the heart? He ate it.<eos> Forensics found what was left of it.
Well, if you wanna do homework, that's your "pagrogative."<eos> I'm gonna go get some head shots taken.<eos> Mom, why'd you take out the part where we go to candy corn mountain?<eos> Because we are doing a new play.<eos> It's called "acting, a cautionary tale, or Mr. Gumdrop goes to lazywood."
And I think-- we think-- that he was killed in a cover-up.<eos> The same cover-up that cost Julianna Keaton her life.<eos> Wait, what's Keaton's connection to all this?<eos> Well, she was the one responsible for making the drug. Right?<eos> And distributing it, which is why we arrested her.
I'm confused.<eos> Noah's using this room as an office, just until the baby comes.<eos> Ah, until the baby comes.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> You are aware that it's customary to prepare a space for the baby before it actually arrives, right?
It's my understanding, Mr. Narvick, that several months ago, the state sent the body of Lucas Reem to your mortuary.<eos> Is that correct? After his execution?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Mr. Reem didn't have any family. The body was to be cremated.<eos> It wasn't, right? I mean, 'cause part of it just showed up at a murder scene.
Yeah, you said you wanted to make a change.<eos> You know how much I value you.<eos> I've made that clear on... numerous occasions, sometimes embarrassingly so.<eos> You've been a good friend and a good partner.<eos> It was you, in fact, that helped me understand the concept of partnership, the value of it.
But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative.<eos> - So, what, we have nothing?<eos> - Not yet. But I am currently exploring a new theory.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> - In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it.
Okay, I'm gonna need some pants.<eos> And the home theater is actually a multi-plex.<eos> The showtimes are posted on the refrigerator.<eos> This is the perfect place for any millionaire.<eos> Unless you're a billionaire, in which case, it's a great fixer-upper.
Go home.<eos> You just want me gone so you can have Ben and your friends all to yourself. Camille?<eos> This town is cursed.<eos> Caldwell and everybody in it is just wicked.
Noah built that boat, right?<eos> That was a reckoning.<eos> All the people had become so wicked that God decided He was gonna wipe everybody out with a great flood, and that is exactly what happened here 29 years ago.<eos> They should have just left this place underwater.<eos> Caldwell and everybody in it is just wicked.
I'm not sure what it is you're saying... or that I really like you using the word "monster" when we were just talking about me.<eos> I don't want to make the same mistakes as those people tonight.<eos> I don't want to kill something out of ignorance.<eos> So does that mean you're willing to forgive me?<eos> I mean that I want to see your heart, Kenna, and not just one part of it, the entire truth of it, no matter how dark.
Yes, about that, um...<eos> It was you who voted against Daniel's wing.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> Oh, it was not my heart. It was my child's.<eos> I heard it beating, and... Every fiber of my being felt compelled to protect it.
It's got a washer and dryer.<eos> And no green space for my herb garden.<eos> Do you even know me?<eos> Okay. Describe your perfect place.<eos> Uh, it's a beautiful home, it's on the beach, it has a housekeeper and it's owned by a billionaire who doesn't monitor his change jar.
Never occurred to me he would take the post without first gaining your permission.<eos> Do we know which publication employs him?<eos> Oh, yes, m'lady, Lady Edith's.<eos> Her magazine.<eos> I've got a copy of it here, as a matter of fact.
What?<eos> I think it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.<eos> I won't call him. I'd rather wait until we really need it.<eos> - We're talking about an investment...<eos> - No, we must discuss the environment, because it is protected by the constitution, in Article 35.
So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?<eos> He hands me the baby and he just walks away.<eos> He gave me his child and he disappeared.<eos> Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.
Least we can do is offer them another set of eyes.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do we know?<eos> Windi was found in Cade's car.<eos> She was strangled with a rope. Cade's prints are all over it.
How would you like this chapter of your life to end?<eos> What's the point? Humour me.<eos> Paint me a picture.<eos> I want to walk out of those gates.<eos> All this place, and everyone in it is just a smoking pile of ashes.
Lenny would never work with him.<eos> He's a bad guy.<eos> You and your entire family are criminals.<eos> Why should we trust anything you say?<eos> I didn't get this scar being a criminal. I got it being a daughter.
I was looking at the Marvin Niel identity...<eos> He was reported missing in L.A.<eos> By a woman named Dolly Bowen four weeks ago.<eos> Why didn't that pop up when we first ran the name?<eos> Dolly withdrew the report just three days after she filed it.
Grace, come home.<eos> Neil?<eos> Grace?<eos> Neil?<eos> You think I ruined your marriage, well, I may have been a part of saving it.
Your counts took a steep dive, April.<eos> Thus the bleeding.<eos> I've been feeling a little off lately.<eos> I hoped it was just stress.<eos> Because our trial isn't working, it's unlikely that staying on it will yield any real results.
Maggie Kendall?<eos> Hils!<eos> The singer at the Empire music hall.<eos> We have a name. Maggie Kendall.<eos> I need you to find the person it belongs to.
I mean, we're doctors, right?<eos> We're taught how to bring people back from the brink.<eos> So Sarah asked me to...<eos> To kill her.<eos> I induced her heart to stop, and then I restarted it.
- Lucy is coming back.<eos> Okay, and so are your powers.<eos> You're never gonna have the normal boy-meets-girl.<eos> Okay, the superhero never gets the guy.<eos> You've really given thought to my romantic future, or lack of it.
The procedure's called a "decompressive craniectomy."<eos> Would that be dangerous to the baby?<eos> There is always a risk for the fetus, and for the mother as well, so, yes.<eos> That's why we hope the medication does the trick.<eos> Dr. Charles, Jamie has pneumonia, and if there's any hope of beating it, I need to get him on a ventilator now.
Sabine, hurry up.<eos> Hey. Ezra!<eos> I will be right there.<eos> Well, this is the command center.<eos> Or what's left of it.
It's the alcohol.<eos> I mean, I've been wanting to do that for a long time.<eos> He blew a .16 on the breathalyzer.<eos> What'd they do with his car?<eos> They towed what was left of it to the impound.
Then you both should know the man is devastated and desperate for answers.<eos> We need to find them.<eos> Based on the intra-oral abrasions, I believe his heart was removed through the esophagus.<eos> Um, not possible.<eos> Well, it could be if you made a customized instrument to extract it.
To find prey, the ants must first touch it.<eos> The irony is that this, the most successful hide and seek player in the forest is almost completely blind.<eos> It distinguishes the living only by their movement.<eos> As long as an animal remains still, it is safe.<eos> But the slightest twitch will give it away.
You're a tourist.<eos> You're just a fucking tourist.<eos> You drive through this place.<eos> You think it's so charming.<eos> You fall in love it it, and you want a piece of it.
Just think about what I said.<eos> Who was that lolo?<eos> My father.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, body's this way, at least what's left of it.
How'd it go with Nahele's father?<eos> Well, I mean, he's uh... well, he's saying all the right things.<eos> He got himself a job.<eos> He seems determined to turn his life around.<eos> He wants Nahele to be a part of it. Okay.
Or you're not.<eos> Or maybe tomorrow, the Earth's gonna smash into a meteor.<eos> Or it's not.<eos> Life is this big fat gigantic stinking mess.<eos> But that's the beauty of it too.
The Games destroyed her.<eos> This is the only choice you have.<eos> People don't always show up the way you want them to, Madam President.<eos> But that anger, that anger-driven defiance, that's what we want.<eos> And we can redirect it.
But with the right input algorithms...<eos> - I need to get back to the lab.<eos> - Will... is that really how you wanna spend the last month of your life?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> I want to have all this taken back to the office... to tell Joseph... that I've spent my entire life in a computer lab... and I've decided I'd rather spend the rest of it with you.
The Lone Ranger.<eos> You ever see that?<eos> Vigilante, fighting for justice and all that.<eos> He used silver bullets, something about how the precious metal stood for the preciousness of life.<eos> The only thing precious about life is that it ends.
You need to know what?<eos> That she'll be all right.<eos> She's all right.<eos> And she'll be all right, so you can go now.<eos> Look for the big bright light and run like hell straight towards it.
The answer at its core is remarkably simple: free will.<eos> God allows evil to exist because of free will.<eos> From the Christian standpoint, God tolerates evil in this world on a temporary basis so that one day, those who choose to love him freely will dwell with him in heaven, free from the influence of evil,<eos> but with their free will in tact.<eos> In other words, God's intention concerning evil is to one day destroy it.
In plain truth, I am used to it.<eos> I did not say I did not care for your plans.<eos> I said I could find no order in them.<eos> This abundance of chaos, this is your Eden?<eos> My search for it.
If we can get to it.<eos> We'd need a locomotive to move all that.<eos> Well figure, 100 years ago, 1,000 years ago, there's a landslide, Covers the creek up here.<eos> And water's been pulling gold out of the hillside.<eos> These obstructions would be the first stop for a lot of it.
I'm taking the override back.<eos> Yates' device?<eos> My device.<eos> You told me that Yates designed it.<eos> Yates engineered certain aspects of it, but I designed it.
He kidnapped Jack, had him put in a secret prison outside Beijing, and tortured him for over a year.<eos> When Audrey Heller went to go look for him, he did the same thing to her.<eos> The device has been altered.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Yates has modified it so that it focuses on the US drones' core.
It's a beautiful last line to end on.<eos> "The sky out of my window has gone real blue now."<eos> The sky in Brighton is unlike anything I've ever seen.<eos> Living by the sea, looking out my windows, I feel like I'm part of the weather itself.<eos> Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.
Thanks. There's a message from the doctor.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, what's happened?<eos> He didn't deny he met the brothers.<eos> But he says there was someone else there, somebody he doesn't want to get into trouble, who knew them better, and someone who was in this image before it was altered.
The weapon that the archangels used to execute them -- the First Blade.<eos> Never heard of it.<eos> Can I kill you now?<eos> I've been chasing that blade for decades.<eos> The closest I got to it was when one of my droogs -
What do you see?<eos> - The city.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> The city, a living city.<eos> And your shop is a part of it.
The senator didn't bring it to Cybercom.<eos> He didn't bring it to anyone.<eos> The senator and his wife watched the video together, and afterwards, he went to the Capitol building as if nothing had happened.<eos> They don't know that you have the video. Mnh-mnh.<eos> Would you care to explain why it is that you're in possession of it?
Your mother's life... is already and always will be<eos> intertwined with your life.<eos> It's no longer my life alone.<eos> It's always intertwined with your life.<eos> And when you give birth to someone, when you have a baby, it will be intertwined too.
There was no partner.<eos> This artist worked alone until he was stitched into his own creation.<eos> - No signs of a struggle.<eos> - No.<eos> So, this second killer, whoever he is, understood the Muralist well enough not just to find his canvas, but well enough to convince him - to be part of it.
And you chose blue.<eos> I did.<eos> To match your eyes.<eos> I like riding in the city.<eos> Makes me feel like I'm part of it.
I know it's a lot to take in, and I didn't mean to pressure you.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Maybe a little.<eos> But it's your life, and I just want to be a part of it.
AnnaBeth, you sound a little angry.<eos> I am angry.<eos> And sad.<eos> And it's all your fault.<eos> And you should know that because I gave you my heart and you used it like a dishrag.
No, thank you very much.<eos> Marnie adored that mansion.<eos> She loved seeing the marsh from her window.<eos> She said it felt like the birds spoke to her.<eos> She had a lonely life, but she lived it fully.
Hey, you're doing a good job, and I don't just mean the cooking.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, I know I didn't make a great first impression around here.<eos> Trust me, I know how these guys are.<eos> I was in your shoes not too long ago, and there's, like, this circle of trust, and you are way on the outside of it.
The information can be extracted by means of your suffering.<eos> Are you trying to scare me?<eos> Well, cos I'm already bloody terrified of dying... and I'll endure a lot of pain for a very long time before I give up the information that's keeping me alive.<eos> How long have you got?<eos> All you can offer me is my life - what you can't do is threaten it.
But we caught a break.<eos> CSU found a cell phone on the charter belonging to the newlyweds.<eos> It was damaged by a bullet, but Fong was able to recover video.<eos> Looks like our vic got an image of the shooter.<eos> Ran it through facial recognition. Didn't get any hits, but take a look at what's behind him.
Well, what really matters?<eos> At this precise moment, what is the single most critical issue facing this nation?<eos> Us.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Despite the enormous challenges ahead of us, we can't forsake our own humanity in the name of preserving it.
Well, chaining yourself to the gate of an army base is a pretty good way to make sure you get arrested.<eos> It's called civil disobedience, dad.<eos> We know what civil disobedience is.<eos> I'm not talking about the idea of it.<eos> I'm talking about doing it, making a difference.
Don't just stand there. She's trying to escape them.<eos> Go in and get her!<eos> It's all right. It's all right.<eos> You all right?<eos> The application of military force, like every other thing in creation, is subject to the natural laws of cause and effect, especially when it is misused.
No more time. Not one day.<eos> I'm worried that it will be a deal-breaker.<eos> This is not a game, Daniel!<eos> The body has its own wisdom.<eos> There's a logic to how it works.
I was 15 and anorexic, just like every other girl at my private school.<eos> And I got better.<eos> Because you were able to get away from his bad parenting?<eos> He wasn't a bad parent.<eos> He's odd, yes, eccentric, but it's just a defense mechanism.
But I'm not.<eos> I'm just being me.<eos> I'm just not quite sure who that is yet.<eos> Son, I realize how difficult it must be to feel like the different one at school.<eos> But it's also important for you to hold on to your culture and realize how special it is.
I know. But we need to be thorough.<eos> I don't know if you saw the addendum To the subpoena that I sent over.<eos> Addendum, no.<eos> No? I'm sorry, I thought I sent it.<eos> Here's a scan of it.
Give me a chance to guide you.<eos> The only way we can end this war and bring father back is through your markings.<eos> It's never gonna happen.<eos> Yes, it will.<eos> Otherwise I'll burn this city and everyone in it to the ground.
We can talk about you giving your enemies silly code names later.<eos> You mean like over coffee with Deathstroke and The Huntress?<eos> The point is that you engaged Snart on a commuter train, which he derailed.<eos> Okay, there may have been some damage, but I got the job done,<eos> - Barry, when you approach a new environment, do you case every inch of it?
And they turned on each other, destroying themselves.<eos> What does that story have to do with anything?<eos> You were in my room.<eos> I'm sure you saw the mirror.<eos> This is just a small piece of it.
I need to fill that hat with power, yes, but that was only part of the equation.<eos> Because I need something else, a secret ingredient, one I didn't know about...<eos> Until an associate clued me in.<eos> A heart.<eos> Well, if you need my help procuring it, know the only help I give you is with your demise.
An opportunity presented itself, and I ran with it.<eos> You didn't even discuss it with your own A.D.A.s.<eos> You didn't think we deserved a heads up?<eos> You are not in private practice anymore.<eos> Everything you say and do reflects on this office and the people in it.
Because you're the better man?<eos> Well, one of you used me, and it wasn't him. He's here.<eos> King Francis, we humbly come to ask you to sign this edict.<eos> He's not going to step forward.<eos> Every noble here is united in support of it.
And they turned on each other, destroying themselves.<eos> What does that story have to do with anything?<eos> You were in my room.<eos> I'm sure you saw the mirror.<eos> This is just a small piece of it.
I need to fill that hat with power, yes, but that was only part of the equation.<eos> Because I need something else, a secret ingredient, one I didn't know about...<eos> Until an associate clued me in.<eos> A heart.<eos> Well, if you need my help procuring it, know the only help I give you is with your demise.
What?<eos> What?<eos> Father chose wisely.<eos> My father loved this flock.<eos> And he will always be a part of it.
What is PX-41, you ask?<eos> Mmm, it's pretty bad.<eos> Huh, you usually don't see that in bunnies.<eos> As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.<eos> Fortunately, it has a very distinct chemical footprint. And using the latest chem-tracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.
Yes, Samantha.<eos> Where'd you get that name from?<eos> I gave it to myself, actually.<eos> How come?<eos> Because I like the sound of it.
How'd it go?<eos> - 11:00 p.m., not 1:00 p.m.<eos> - What?<eos> Stay out of my life!<eos> Or what's left of it!
Why don't you go over and introduce yourself to him? Oh, Mom.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're supposed to lie down and relax.<eos> I was relaxing so much I saw a white light.<eos> Well, if you see it again, don't walk into it.
You know what?<eos> Don't focus on that right now.<eos> Think of the show.<eos> It's fantastic.<eos> And the best part of it?
I'm gifted with a treasure, so why keep it in the vault?<eos> All: Whoo! ♪ ce n'est pas ma faute ♪<eos> ♪ please don't castrate the bull ♪<eos> I beg you don't demagnetize the magnet<eos> - for it's pull... - All:
But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives.<eos> Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to sure up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.<eos> Well, that's not exactly the way--<eos> To cleanse yourselves, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company.<eos> I have to believe that the investing public understands we're talking about a person who-- who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company, and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.
I can't just leave them.<eos> Yes, you can... they're not your family, they're mine.<eos> The truth is you can drive away, right now, and they wouldn't even realize you were gone.<eos> This was always my life.<eos> You were just pretending to be a part of it.
Special Agent Jack Crawford.<eos> I head the Behavioral Science Unit.<eos> - We've met. - Yes.<eos> We had a disagreement when we opened up the museum.<eos> I disagreed with what you named it.
- You can't ask her right now, jack.<eos> We have to create a safe place for her first<eos> Or you won't get any answers.<eos> - I respect your sympathy For her, dr. Bloom.<eos> I hope one day you'll appreciate my lack of it.
by usage, by mutual agreement, tribe by tribe, nation by nation.<eos> We went from "root," "dig," "fire," "arrow," to "multitask," "irreverence,"<eos> You see, your language is a living, growing thing that sheds old words and absorbs new ones every clay.<eos> And that's what I want you to do, each of you, invent a new word.<eos> Tell us what it means, where it comes from, and why you think it might stay and live in the language for a while.
- I need to know the truth.<eos> - Can I have a baby?<eos> - What about a surrogate?<eos> - You two will take it from me?<eos> - Yes, Mama. It will be our child.
I'm not trying to make it about me.<eos> It's alway about you.<eos> Always.<eos> Ever since we were in kindergarten.<eos> Your need for attention, to make drama so that you can be at the center of it, and never, not once, have I judged you.
I'm wearing granny panties and I've only spoken to white people.<eos> You joining the Aryan Nation?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But there's a nun here.<eos> And you're not allowed to sleep in your bed. Only on top of it.
And so, from this high vantage point, we will launch the final steps to my plan to rid the world of mortals and then...<eos> You know, it's really kind of killer on the calves.<eos> That's a nice story, can we get to what this thing does?<eos> Right. This device... [laughs] Replicates spells.<eos> Once energized with sufficient wizard power, it will cast a spell repeatedly across Earth.
He'll lose control.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> I've exhausted all your knowledge.<eos> Now I have the Professor to help me find the cure, you're just competition.<eos> Whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it:
Fall by my side and retake hill!<eos> Sweep surrounding hills! Imperator!<eos> The gods once more aid Spartacus in slipping from fucking grasp.<eos> He weeps from a thousand wounds.<eos> And if heart yet beats, it shall cease at briefest passing --
We got another problem.<eos> Quantico found a portal break in their server.<eos> - We were hacked?<eos> - Where was their failsafe?<eos> It stalled.
We will work systematically.<eos> This operation will go 'round the clock.<eos> Also, I do not want any mistakes made with the chain of evidence.<eos> That's right.<eos> If you find the box, do not touch it or its contents.
And Hasim died trying to stop it.<eos> Whoever this is, he abducted a girl and he killed our victim.<eos> So what do we know about him from the video?<eos> He's a male, late 30s, no distinguishing scars or tattoos.<eos> But we sent the footage over to the FBI to see if they can run it through their facial recognition software.
It's polonium.<eos> Polonium? Sometimes used to make complex tools in scientific equipment.<eos> Do you think he was exposed in the lab?<eos> No, it's only lethal if ingested and you don't get treated within the first hour.<eos> Well, the area's contaminated, but it doesn't appear to be the point of origin.
Yeah, but Peter and Jared are mine.<eos> I like people fine.<eos> I'm just not sure how I feel about you.<eos> You know, I think there's another glass in Peter's office.<eos> Can't vouch for how clean it is, though.
No, I'm, I'm talking about when you wanted to run off and leave me.<eos> It was so you could have your life back.<eos> Okay.<eos> You are my life.<eos> At least you're a huge part of it.
So... This trick with the light bulbs that you performed with just such panache at your housewarming party...<eos> I prefer to think of it as a debutante ball.<eos> A cotillion, was it?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And I was the belle of it.
All right, so our killer uses the same van to abduct Ella.<eos> Uh, who's it registered to?<eos> Well, that's the thing. The van was reported stolen 48 hours ago.<eos> I've already put out an APB and a MAILE AMBER Alert.<eos> HPD has got all available units searching the Island for it.
CHARLOTTE: Look, my husband...<eos> He's not who I thought he was.<eos> GRACIELA: Of course not. CHARLOTTE:<eos> But I have to figure out my life now.<eos> This can't be a part of it.
And what does Nikita say?<eos> She believes she has been framed by a conspiracy of people, such as Deputy FBI Director Matthew Graham, who she assassinated just days ago.<eos> I am so sure of that.<eos> That I will make this offer.<eos> Do a DNA test on his body and compare it to the samples already on file.
If I say, everything will be ruined.<eos> I don't know how to say goodbye.<eos> I don't even want to say.<eos> I hate that word.<eos> Till today I've not even understand it's meaning.
He took my Grace for the spell.<eos> Or you gave it.<eos> It may be unwise to kill me.<eos> If my Grace were the key to empowering the spell,<eos> I may be key to countering it.
By choosing a human life, you've already given up.<eos> You chose death.<eos> Well, there's no way.<eos> Crowley's lying. No, Dean, not this time.<eos> Look, Metatron built the spell to withstand any attempt to reverse it.
So Darius found no need to consider it further.<eos> Darius had a great deal of experience as a soldier, but very little as a ruler until Babylon fell.<eos> Once signed, the order could not be changed.<eos> That every order be upheld, for the law cannot be countermanded and the laws cannot contradict themselves, but each law be fixed, unchangeable, for the king cannot err.<eos> And once a law is written, even the king himself cannot change it.
This is a dinosaur egg.<eos> Even now you kind of expect it to crack open, don't you?<eos> I really don't.<eos> A fossilized egg doesn't capture your imagination?<eos> Well, the value of it does.
I stand corrected.<eos> Not knowingly. Stupidly.<eos> I've explained in detail.<eos> I don't know how Metatron's spell worked.<eos> Therefore, I can't assist in reversing it.
We were going to run away and start over.<eos> We were supposed to leave today, get away from my family, get a fresh start.<eos> Charlie wanted to leave everything behind-- the spying, the acting, the stupid character of Dewey.<eos> What about his apartment?<eos> He just spent a lot of money renovating it.
O.R. 3's identical to O.R. 2.<eos> Good to have you back, Ben.<eos> Um... What's wrong with O.R. 3?<eos> Is there a smell in there, too?<eos> There is a smell in Tuck's room, and I'm gonna find it.
Tonight?<eos> Wait, let's back the truck up.<eos> How old are you?<eos> I thought time was a factor around here.<eos> Isn't talking about my personal life a waste of it? No.
There's not a day goes by where I don't think about my girl.<eos> Shall I tell you what I think of?<eos> My own voice, pleading with you not to leave me, not to let me go.<eos> And my own mother too drunk to hear me, too drunk to even kiss me.<eos> I have a life now and you are no part of it.
Yeah, fair enough.<eos> Um, last first or...<eos> - If you want.<eos> - Yeah? Before we, um... A few things,<eos> I feel like I have a better perspective on the law because I've seen both sides of it.
They're for Pepper's party.<eos> He said, "no gifts, please."<eos> Imagine how Pepper would say that.<eos> What's a Himalayan salt plate?<eos> You can season your food while you serve it.
They just remembered you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture to make me feel better?<eos> In a way, yes.<eos> It belongs up there.
A pulse weapon has knocked out the power grid, communications are down, and we have voltage spikes in the reactor turbines!<eos> Radar is tracking an incoming missile.<eos> How close?<eos> 30 seconds to impact.<eos> The EM shield will knock it out before impact if we can keep it online!
Let me show you something.<eos> She made me follow you.<eos> She made me tell her everything.<eos> She knew about your secret place weeks ago.<eos> She just waited to destroy it till it would hurt you and Henry the most.
With Dad home, the whole house is an ashtray.<eos> Christ, it's freezing.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't get how you have a kid and not give a shit what happens to it.
We hit a snag in the plan.<eos> We need to identify the right one.<eos> Why don't you just touch them all and see if magic happens?<eos> We did.<eos> Nothing happened. We think her grandmother spelled the crystal so it couldn't be discovered.
Adam and Melissa uncloaked it.<eos> They did?<eos> But all we know is that it's somewhere in the high school.<eos> But Balcoin blood has a special connection to the crystals.<eos> It should pinpoint it's exact location. It can lead you right to it.
It's a clue to what you're going to be doing for the next year.<eos> "The Birds" is coming.<eos> My follow-up to "Psycho."<eos> It's going to be bigger, better, scarier.<eos> My most ambitious movie ever, and we want you to star in it.
There is a reason the medical establishment continues to vilify the idea of legalized organ trafficking... the potential for abuse.<eos> Now, as it's been stated, we are a nation that is only too happy to exploit the disenfranchised.<eos> Now, it's one thing to send the poor off to war, to deny them health coverage, basic food, and shelter, but to extract their body parts... it's immoral and it should shock our conscience.<eos> This violates all standards of decency.<eos> I don't get how a policy can be indecent, immoral, and unconscionable when it results in more people living.
Okay, but let's keep an eye on him, yeah?<eos> I don't think the war's over for him yet.<eos> Why gold?<eos> It's the ancient elixir of life, the basis of alchemy.<eos> Τhey must have found a way to use it, a way to make those things out there.
Leave me out of it.<eos> Dr. Yang will check on you later.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I just talk to you for a minute?<eos> I know you've been through hell, and I know I was part of it.
Dad, I got her pregnant.<eos> Well, uh... we sort of found each other.<eos> Wait, wait. Okay, so if she's already... she's five months pregnant, then... she's decided to keep this baby.<eos> I guess.<eos> What did she say about... about raising it?
Four simple words that require one simple answer.<eos> Can. You. Acquire.<eos> The... Sorry, five words.<eos> Can you get us the egg?<eos> Well, if we already know that Tenguiz won't sell it to you, there really is only one way of obtaining it.
It's wild, right?<eos> Yeah, look, I just thought maybe you could... use a friend.<eos> I know sometimes, well, Peter's a little difficult and hard to talk to. No.<eos> He is, and he understands that,<eos> Which is why I think he was grateful that you chose him to share the tape with even before you knew what was on it.
So what can I do for ya?<eos> I'm-I'm really sorry to ambush you like this, but I didn't really want to call the hotline, and you're the only person I know who's an actual Fringe Division Agent.<eos> I had a vision.<eos> I saw the earthquakes.<eos> I was standing right in the middle of it.
With friends.<eos> A holiday?<eos> No. Not exactly.<eos> How can one have a holiday when we live like this?<eos> People in this city, they understand best what's happening in the world... the nuclear threat, what it means for ordinary people.
I hope nobody knocks my trailer over.<eos> It's a monster.<eos> You've got a double bed in the and another one in that growth.<eos> That is not a car that you could talk to at a party, unless you are looking at something else.<eos> I've got news from Renault, they've got a new car, I've got a picture of it here, it's called the Influenza.
- Come on.<eos> - Exactly the way it is.<eos> - No, Pam.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And there's nothing you can say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
Megadoses of HGH enlarged her internal organs.<eos> She was under a doctor's care.<eos> A doctor who cared more about writing her book, evidently, than Brandy's health.<eos> You brought Tara's cure to the states.<eos> You made your wife the face of it.
Planet ocean has become our planet.<eos> But if we were wrong?<eos> The ocean that we came from seems so far from us today.<eos> In barely 200 years, we have violently disrupted four billion years of the natural history of the world.<eos> We no longer see the beauty of life, but only what it can do for our species, what it enables us to produce.
She registered it as a trademark for the division last year.<eos> I saw it on a rash guard in her hotel room... And somewhere else.<eos> Ah!<eos> Here... Corporate logo.<eos> Katie's standing in front of it.
Is everything alright?<eos> Kids OK?<eos> That prick John's put the smallholdings up for sale.<eos> The kids think it's my fault, and they're right.<eos> I was thinking about buying it.
Subtitles edited by Ehhhhtozebec Ah, I love government.<eos> Shady deals, back-room meetings...<eos> It is grifter paradise.<eos> This is wrong.<eos> We work outside the law, not smack-dab in the middle of it.
# From a cold, steel rail?<eos> # A smile from a veil?<eos> # Do you think you can tell?<eos> # I think most of the songs that I've ever written all pose similar questions.<eos> Can you free yourself enough to be able to experience the reality of life as it goes on before you and with you, and as you go on as part of it or not?
Well, it's tough to get on the lot, but once you're here, you can pretty much go anywhere.<eos> What about leaving, huh?<eos> You check the vehicles?<eos> Uh, random searches, yeah.<eos> Well, so the killer probably hid the body here because it was too risky to move it. Hmm.
But we are now.<eos> You saved my life. You may not trust me yet, but I trust you.<eos> You think I'm a hardened man?<eos> I struggle with this life, same as you.<eos> How strange it is and the cost, but you're working towards making this world a better place, and you're not alone.
Yeah, it was broken in the way I like it.<eos> Oh. Well... I mean, this chair is ergonomically designed to improve posture, reduce fatigue and increase productivity.<eos> So... um... plus, this baby's got over 25 points of adjustment, yo.<eos> Well, my butt only has two points of adjustment, and they both want my old chair back, yo.<eos> I-I think it's... it's gone.
- Not the<eos> - Frances! - Ow!<eos> I tried to make a frittata, but it's really more of a scramble.<eos> This is interesting.<eos> "To praise a work of literature by calling it sincere... is now at best a way of saying that, although it may be given... no aesthetic or intellectual admiration -"
After I take your bending away, you will be nothing...<eos> It's...<eos> It's alright, Naga.<eos> I just had a bad dream.<eos> There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart.
Huh?<eos> There's never gonna be a good time.<eos> We have to suck it up.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You're new to this world. If "this world" means lying and being a coward, then I don't want any part in it.
So...<eos> What's going on? We're just hanging out, waiting for you to drop by.<eos> I told you I was gonna drop by, but I didn't know there were going to be other people here, but... But I didn't either.<eos> If Adrian is going to be a part of your life, then I wanted to get to know Adrian.<eos> And now that you've gotten to know me a little better, you still want to bea part of it? I know I wouldn't. Well, again.
Documenting a whole new species, learning all about it.<eos> - Wait, learning?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> There's nothing in the Book of dragons that looks anything like him.<eos> We even get to determine what it's called.
Like this guy knows from the Internet.<eos> The other morning, I saw him looking for the crank on the front of his car.<eos> - Okay, you're done.<eos> - I make fun, and we laugh.<eos> But in all seriousness, if you see a light today, don't walk towards it.
- First, the gantry "accidentally" breaks, and the foreman nearly gets - killed trying to fix it.<eos> - Yeah, right after we filed - a complaint.<eos> - Yeah. Then, Lenny gets sick. And now Siskel's threatening to shut down the mill?<eos> That was Lenny's doctor.<eos> He said his lung tissue's so bad, they had to remove a large part of it.
Emma Sharpe.<eos> Divisional VP of all North America.<eos> Wh-What are you doing in the break room?<eos> This break room is in North America, isn't it?<eos> Sure. That means I'm the Vice President of it.
Am I really out of the game?<eos> Lucky.<eos> Okay, come on, moving on.<eos> Wait, doesn't anyone have a roof resurrection?<eos> Because if you've got one, I need it bad.
You see, I really need this scholarship.<eos> Why you more than anyone else?<eos> My film.<eos> Let's just say putting it in the festival is going to put me into a little bit of a financial bind.<eos> It cost a lot to make?
So you have met the captain.<eos> - Well, he said his name.<eos> And?<eos> How about it, Gene?<eos> I think we are better with the first name to address it.
- Feet.<eos> You brave.<eos> That man could be transformed into pot-roast before the day ends.<eos> Trunk lid is broken.<eos> Change the wheels that we can drag it here.
Daddy do you know a place called Salar de Uyuni?<eos> It's a salt lake.<eos> It's even more stunning if it rains.<eos> Since it's like a mirror, it can reflect the sea of clouds above.
Daddy Do you know a place called Salar de Uyuni?<eos> No.<eos> It's beautiful!<eos> I did my research on YouTube.<eos> Since it's like a mirror, it can reflect the sea of clouds above.
I need something new, and I need it by the end of the day, so...<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> Well, I just finished a screenplay where a tidal wave destroys Washington.<eos> Someone write down tidal wave. Shut him up.<eos> What about a tornado that hits a handgun factory, and it's just spinning around shooting handguns?
Name any country.<eos> Russia.<eos> Point being, there are many tools I can bring to the table that I think the script may be wasting.<eos> Pierce, you know what I think is really great about this show?<eos> The only real star of it is the message.
They're occupied 24/7 so there's always a caretaker, somebody always involved.<eos> And they form little points where you can also have economic activity and just coming together of community.<eos> What's also very lacking in the area is a place for children to play, so that was another aspect that we worked in the urban design.<eos> Because people are moving through it, it's constantly observed, so it's fairly safe.<eos> With all this upgrading, people now have pride in it and they want to be part of it.
Okay.<eos> Hobbes and I will head towards midtown.<eos> - Ryan, go with Jack. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Get the address A.S.A.P. The FBI has that photo.<eos> They're circulating it as we speak.
I don't know if that's a good idea.<eos> I mean, you'll need Rumpole to accompany you to the police station as you make your statement.<eos> You what?<eos> You should think very carefully, Sam.<eos> Abuse of power, or covering it up, is very serious.
Of course!<eos> What? Can I sit?<eos> What are you going to do with this egg?<eos> Mister, if you can keep this egg in your mouth..<eos> ..without breaking it, I will give you 5000.
***, you're right. I am a genius.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Matt be careful.<eos> Ok, Jess, I've located the nest.<eos> I'm sending it over to you right now.
Now.<eos> In the beginning, not so much, but after everything I know now, how can I go back to my old life?<eos> That's exactly how I feel.<eos> Meeting Henry opened up my world.<eos> He changed my life, and now I want him to be part of it.
She might as well know the truth.<eos> We believe the SS possess a device that can change the weather.<eos> They could create massive storms that could scuttle any landing attempts on the beaches.<eos> From one device?<eos> Likely powered by a hive of thermal sand rays to provide the energy to power it. Pardon?
Sir, you're too late.<eos> Those damn fools.<eos> Why don't we just attack this weather device and destroy it?<eos> We can't.<eos> If we simply blow it up, the creatures they're using to power it could do massive damage.
More than just a test of mind and will, it is a contest of physical endurance too.<eos> Bobby is 29, and he lives virtually a monastic life.<eos> He lives alone, always in hotel rooms that seem barely larger than chessboards.<eos> A lot of the time he won't even answer his telephone.<eos> The television set is his window on the world, exercise is part of it.
(SHOUTING) Benjamin's moment has arrived.<eos> He's got it.<eos> But the battle has just begun.<eos> As the whale fights to break free, they move to harpoon it again.<eos> They need to prevent it from diving and pulling a boat under.
SHOUTING Benjamin's moment has arrived.<eos> He's got it.<eos> But the battle has just begun.<eos> As the whale fights to break free, they move to harpoon it again.<eos> They need to prevent it from diving and pulling a boat under.
Yeah. - Thanks. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey. - Here it is, here it is. - Here we go, here we go.<eos> - Take them. - All right.<eos> Hey. - To the greatest city in the world.<eos> - And to the men who built it. To the Cassidys.
Take this.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Why are you taking us this way?<eos> The Jews are moving away from the sea, not towards it.
Well, I never opened it.<eos> So whatever your paper there says from that bank -- Which, by the way, I've never used the services thereof -- It is wrong.<eos> Let's go, boys!<eos> Thing is, it's Rosie's account.<eos> She would've needed your ID to open it.
You were my muse!<eos> That's great, Eli!<eos> I'm really glad I could help.<eos> So what's the play about?<eos> It's called "Love Roulette".
- This body, it's not the original one.<eos> The programming has been uploaded into it according to this data stream.<eos> Ultron's been transferring its intelligence into new bodies, over and over.<eos> The last time it did it was an hour ago.<eos> - That's after we destroyed it.
However, the decision is basically political, not financial.<eos> Even if the debt was legitimate, no government has the right... to kill its people in order to satisfy its lenders.<eos> Even if the entire Greek national debt of 350 billion proves legitimate... which is clearly not going to be the case, Greece can never pay back.<eos> It will have to be cancelled.<eos> If honouring the debt and making it sustainable involves... dismantling health care, dismantling education... dismantling the transport system, then the debt is socially unsustainable.
Warming up the car battery.<eos> I've got a $100 million movie lost, the studio freaking out, and this company's reputation-- my reputation--on the line.<eos> I know.<eos> Whoever stole the DVD is on that security footage.<eos> I'm gonna look over every inch of it.
If I were to say that my yesterday no longer exists, it would be like the number 13 saying that 11 has died.<eos> Mathematicians would regard that as ridiculous.<eos> This instant is so vital and so alive, but in a way, it's eternal.<eos> This when you translate that into mathematics, it's eternal.<eos> Julian Barbour's view of time may sound radical, but it's taken very seriously by the physics community, which doesn't mean everyone agrees with him.
All right,****<eos> - This is your final!<eos> I hope it's a pizza.<eos> "this is it, your final duel.<eos> When it is over only one of you will return to the game.
The critical question is, how is it done?<eos> The magnetic field of the Earth is basically the medium within which we were all exposed, all seven billion of us.<eos> And that's what allows the potential exchange of information.<eos> According to this theory, Earth's magnetic field is like an ocean rippling with waves.<eos> Electrical activity from our brains can surf along on top of it, passing from one person to another.
On that fateful day, Roger's global network recorded random-number data second by second.<eos> Here, we already have some activity that doesn't really look normal, and at this point, which is 4:30 in the morning, the data really changed and took off in a way that I think is highly significant.<eos> This is an aberration in the random walk, and it happens to be centered on 9/11, and it happens that in order to be centered on 9/11, it started before the first plane hit.<eos> We don't have an explanation for that.<eos> 9/11 was the first and only time the global consciousness network responded to an event before it actually began.
And that's kind of like the rules we're imagining for the Universe.<eos> If our Universe is finite, scientists believe its edges must also be linked, that the entire cosmos must act like a giant game of "Asteroids."<eos> If we could bend this space, we would see that it looks like something more intuitive.<eos> Like, for example, if I were to take this menu and apply that rule from the "Asteroid" game. You know, I exit the top, I enter the bottom.<eos> That's exactly the same as taking the menu and rolling it up and gluing the sides together.
This little area right here, this is where the tire treads in the dirt was actually here.<eos> At the time that they first came down here, they actually backed up to that and tried to slam on their brakes, hoping to eject the body in the water, and that didn't work, so, again, that was just something that- that we heard.<eos> I don't know that that's actually what happened, but you could tell from- there wasn't any distinct tire wear in the ground.<eos> You could just tell that a tire- tires had been spinning there, so...<eos> So it seemed to fit the story, but they ended up getting the body and- and carrying it out here, and it was just dropped in the water.
You should be celebrating.<eos> Celebrating what?<eos> I got a shit-paid job and an easy-iron uniform.<eos> And now they want to send me to the other side of Yorkshire.<eos> At least when you commit a crime you get to choose where you do it.
Field sobriety test came up negative.<eos> That wouldn't rule out drug use.<eos> I'd consider schizophrenia, except he's the wrong age for the first psychotic break.<eos> It could be an aneurysm or a brain tumor.<eos> Well, one thing's for sure. He's having a mental breakdown, but what are the specific features of it?
Zecharia Sitchin suggested that these extraterrestrials needed gold to spend it in the atmosphere and preserve their planet.<eos> Is gold something that is really important to space exploration and to astronomy?<eos> Well, it actually is, very important and the reason why is because gold is an innert material.<eos> It doesn't react with anything.<eos> The other thing that's very important about it is that it is a wonderful conductor of electricity.
Frogs?<eos> The slimy little bastards are now the proud owners of 50 acres of waterfront real estate.<eos> Have you had your environmental impact study in Chapman Woods yet?<eos> Uh, tomorrow, but I'm not worried.<eos> My guys have been over every inch of it.
- Walter, what are you talking about?<eos> Astrid? What's wrong?<eos> Olivia!<eos> What's happening?<eos> So you're saying that your equipment recorded the event before it occurred.
Have you given my proposal any further consideration?<eos> You mean the money you're squeezing out of me for Robert's maps?<eos> I'm only asking for what is fair, Thomas.<eos> Extortion doesn't become a lady.<eos> I will not fall prey to it.
But when Lilith refused for the final time, God condemned her to live on Earth for eternity.<eos> In a sense, Lilith was the first vampire to wander the Earth.<eos> She shared all of the characteristics of female vampires.<eos> Lilith had the head and breasts of a woman, the body of a snake and the wings of a bird, which is a terrifying creature.<eos> In Jewish tradition, Lilith has been a kind of a night demon against whom intententions and prayers have to be offered, because she will come and snatch away an infant sleeping in its crib or at least snatch away its soul and cause it to die.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Hard work, isn't it?<eos> This being happy business.<eos> "We have no more right to consume happiness" without producing it... "Than to consume wealth without producing it."
You will be treated for insanity.<eos> Your witness got the wrong person.<eos> He's not the killer! Release him now!<eos> When I heard of his arrest, I couldn't believe it.<eos> It was AHN Min-ho.
Why... what for?<eos> Madam didn't take to his name.<eos> Babloo?<eos> It's Lalit.<eos> She flew into a rage when she heard it.
I have within me an entire zoo of bacteria.<eos> In fact, each one of us has more bacteria living in our bodies than there are people on the planet.<eos> For billions of years, microbes like these will have Earth to themselves.<eos> Like our infant universe, the first life is small, simple, and full of possibilities.<eos> The secret of how it explodes into all of the incredible forms we see today, including us, goes back to the beginning of time.
The only dreams I ever remember are of food.<eos> One night I dreamed that my husband was made of chocolate.<eos> Then his snoring woke me up.<eos> So I ate a bag of Oreos in the bathroom.<eos> Well, you're going to love this diet, because it lets you love food, obsess over it, dream about it, even put it in your mouth.
Hey. We're gonna be late for our apartment meetings.<eos> We're not gonna be late, Charlotte, because I canceled 'em.<eos> You don't want to move in with me?<eos> I-I've never wanted anything more. But it can't be like this.<eos> You--you have a nice life carved out for you here. Yeah, and you're a part of it now.
We're not gonna be late, Charlotte, because I canceled 'em.<eos> You don't want to move in with me?<eos> I-I've never wanted anything more. But it can't be like this.<eos> You--you have a nice life carved out for you here. Yeah, and you're a part of it now.<eos> Yeah, I want to be a part of it forever.
We got to the top and we weren't on just any volcano.<eos> It was a volcano with these Alaska style spines.<eos> And to see that, where we were going go ski, was like a dream come true.<eos> We all ski down to the same spot, just give each other the high five, and throw our skins back on and go for another one.<eos> Though, a year after we are at the volcano, it fully erupted.
God! Do I have to sit with this thing?<eos> This is right.<eos> - well you do have a point Come Bozo<eos> - When I miss him, I Iook at his photo and talk<eos> would you Iike to see it?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.<eos> It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> Sir, Jellystone is special. Okay?<eos> It's turning 100 years old this very year.
There are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence.<eos> All I'm asking her to do is to set the record straight.<eos> I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access to this interview.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I would also like a video record of it in the event of legal proceedings.
You're right. Cut the program... and they're certainly more likely to turn out like you.<eos> I've grown weary of your insults, Will.<eos> They sting, and they make me want to punch your face.<eos> You remember high school?<eos> Remember what it's like?
That's a beautiful necklace you're wearing, Tiffany. Thank you.<eos> Is that what you do with your Saved By the Bell money?<eos> Mom, I don't want to live in a tiny, gross apartment.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we don't have a choice.<eos> Your father doesn't remember his life, and he doesn't want us to be a part of it, so we've just got to move on.
1721.<eos> I think that's enough to compel a warrant.<eos> I didn't realize I was set up until I was in the shower.<eos> Oh, god, your body is unbelievable!<eos> And you'll get to taste all of it.
Well, you know, The creative process is always a mystery.<eos> I just wish I could get inside that marvelous brain of yours.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> I can.<eos> Okay, in this instance, The creative process was that I saw that name, forgot that I saw it, and said it later.
Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence, or the human residence will be incinerated.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> Where am I?<eos> - Leadworth.<eos> - Where's the rest of it?
Moving on.<eos> Our next contestant is a psychology major with a political upbringing and a passion for calligraphy.<eos> ZBZ, what is your take on the current debate<eos> - of healthcare reform in our country... - This is so rigged. Thank you, Katherine, and thank you to the pageant organizers and all those voting.<eos> This is an issue that's been debated to death, which is where a lot of people will end up without it.
But then again, it's an ill wind... At least Lady Mary's prospects must have rather improved.<eos> Have they?<eos> Haven't they?<eos> I will not be coy and pretend I do not understand your meaning, though you seem very informed on this family's private affairs.<eos> But you ought perhaps to know that I do not intend to fight the entail, not any part of it.
I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama. My lack of interest in having a child<eos> Pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed.<eos> I like my life. I like it the way that it is.<eos> I don't want it to change.<eos> I thought I liked it with you in it.
Katherine helped me obtain it.<eos> Who's my father?<eos> Not important.<eos> He was a teenage waste of space.<eos> A name would be nice. It would, wouldn't it?
Thank you.<eos> You know, I came in this town<eos> Wanting to destroy it.<eos> Tonight I...<eos> Found myself wanting to protect it.
Yeah.<eos> RADIO: 'The area around the spot where the body was found at<eos> 'Thorpes Hill remained cordenedoff this morning as police search teams started their meticulous work.<eos> 'Gemma was last seen early on November 15th.<eos> 'One theory is that whoever killed her put her body in the river 'by this bridge on the main road, and then it was carried downstream to the spot where it was found.'
She had difficulty conceiving herself.<eos> There was a blockage in her tubes as well.<eos> Why must we always go on about this?<eos> If the Lord wanted us...<eos> If the Lord wanted us to die of appendicitis then he wouldn't have given us the ability to treat it.
The pixel is the smallest addressable screen element.<eos> It's the smallest unit of a picture that can be controlled.<eos> Each pixel has it's own address.<eos> Is the picture real?<eos> Parts of it are.
Really?<eos> Maybe it wasn't pineapple.<eos> Maybe somebody got to my wine at the restaurant.<eos> Gus, I see a bright light.<eos> I think I should go towards it.
Ambassador.<eos> On behalf of British Intelligence I would like to present<eos> Viktor Barenshik with this posthumous McGough Medal.<eos> I'm honoured to receive this, Sir Harry.<eos> Viktor dedicated his life to peace and in the end lost it to the same cause.
Love, though?<eos> I'm full up!<eos> I spent the past few months out on the sea, hunted with my bow, looking for my.<eos> My inner Big Mike, my happiness.<eos> I discovered the source of it.
I'm accusing you of sabotaging my case.<eos> - I can't give you the source.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> I sent the video to the crime lab.<eos> They confirm it's authentic.
Lie to the parole board And have him denied.<eos> He wants to stay in prison.<eos> Why?<eos> He's old.<eos> It's home.
I think the goal here is to figure out<eos> What makes sense, not argue.<eos> In no way is it necessary To do the surgery now, when there's another viable,<eos> Safer option.<eos> Okay, it's safer to put a baby Through months and months of chemo and watch it suffer?
Lewis is 70, But his life is not over.<eos> He is smart.<eos> He is strong.<eos> He can make it.<eos> There is life outside of prison, And lewis should be a part of it.
He is smart.<eos> He is strong.<eos> He can make it.<eos> There is life outside of prison, And lewis should be a part of it.<eos> I believe he's ready to be a part of it.
But I thought he said you were a ballplayer.<eos> Did he sign for his drinks,<eos> - put 'em under a room?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, it's under another name though.<eos> You want me to put it on that one?
Why he stands there like a fool?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Our student.<eos> He lubricates the saliva in your hair all day long.<eos> It glistens the as a dog purse in the sun.
Deal's a deal. - It's a beautiful place.<eos> - I don't even know where that is!<eos> - That was quick.<eos> - I got the account number... used by the man who hired Poole to kill me.<eos> - I just need to turn it into a name.
This is your place.<eos> You're the ruler here.<eos> You're the king of the...<eos> What is this shit you're making out here?<eos> It's extract, and it's spray-dried flavoring, and...
He said he was like a runaway train. And then he mentioned something about a sword which he had used as a prop in our play.<eos> He killed his mother with that sword, Lee.<eos> Jesus God.<eos> With that damn thing?<eos> Brad was obsessed with it.
My philosophy is basically this.<eos> And this is something that I live by, and I always have, and I always will.<eos> Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone for any reason ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been<eos> ever, for any reason whatsoever...<eos> Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going.
That must have been his exit.<eos> Morgan: rossi!<eos> I got something!<eos> This window is definitely Broken from the outside.<eos> Given the size of it, The unsub would have to be
It was granted 20 minutes ago.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Where are we at on the fake juror?<eos> He had a state-issued driver's license under his fake name, so we pulled that ID photo to run it through facial recognition.
What you want to do is bring the lens either towards your nose or away until you get just one image, then you use this knob to make it good and clear... like that.<eos> Try it.<eos> Why don't you take it out back through the field?<eos> There's a path to the woods. You can go hunt your bear.<eos> Oh, but if you get too close to the sea and you hear it getting louder, turn around, okay?
Jean-Pierre Duman.<eos> He has a new name.<eos> I have this, too.<eos> It's from the inter-american court of human rights.<eos> We use it to make him come back to Haiti and stand trial.
Look around you, Alex.<eos> - There's so much suffering.<eos> - What about your suffering?<eos> All life is precious.<eos> Every single second of it.
Yeah, copy.<eos> Morphine's painless.<eos> What are you saying, Spike?<eos> Isn't this her life...<eos> what's left of it?
- But I wanted to get expelled.<eos> CECE: Lily, whatever for?<eos> - That school has everything.<eos> - Everything except for Dad.<eos> You're living this amazing new life here and I'm just scared that by the time I graduate I won't be a part of it anymore.
But this kid's fresh out of business school and comes at a fraction of the price.<eos> If it would help you make the transition, I'm sure he'd let you call him "Ted".<eos> I hope I made myself clear, Veronica.<eos> Yes, sir, I understood.<eos> Veronica realized from our nearly flawless plan that overloading the system with illogical information would make it crash, and so she spent the next several hours collecting as many other badges as she could.
They shouldn't think that the ancient people were dummies.<eos> Early man, people on ancient times didn't have dashboard mounted GPS unit's.<eos> They had those... "Path of the sun thru the sky", "The path of the moon thru the sky",<eos> They could see the stars at night, these were prominent fictures that they could navigate from, so, it's not surprising at all, that almost every culture, recorded astronomical phenomena,<eos> We never look up at the sky and enjoy the beauty of it.
A lot of incidences like this are happening for some time now severed body parts were discovered.<eos> Just recently, a severed arm was found in Caloocan.<eos> This dreadful syndicate, who's victim are being chopped into pieces are once again on the move.<eos> This syndicate is something is not an easy enemy since they never let anyone get out alive.<eos> And the problem here is that... the body parts are scattered in different locations which makes it difficult for the police to determine where the crime scene is and it's perpetrators.
I find the law fascinating.<eos> - It's not true?<eos> - No, of s? R!<eos> But it would please me.<eos> Law, it is never static.
Like,uh,hitmen do it.<eos> Exotic dancers,uh,aig executives.<eos> If my parents find outwhat i do,i may not bedoing it anymore.<eos> They have a strict senseof what my career should be.<eos> Being a p.A. Is not part of it.
I want my life to be my life.<eos> My successes.<eos> My failures.<eos> My choices.<eos> I can't live around my dream without being a part of it.
"Hey, hey, everybody. I'm Jesus and I'm gonna die a painful death so none of you dudes get laid."<eos> Yeah, like I'm gonna pray to this guy.<eos> You want my cherry, Dad?<eos> Sure.<eos> Junior, a boy's virginity is a terrible burden. And it must be cast off on any girl who will take it.
And what do we have on the escape?<eos> Well, marshals found this in the exercise yard.<eos> Did a cell check ten minutes later- - Garcia was gone.<eos> So, what actual proof do we have that he left?<eos> This is a video (typing) of visitors leaving the jail before it was locked down.
Maybe your husband then.<eos> He passed away shortly after Matt was born.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> We suspect Mr. Su of running a smuggling ring, trafficking Chinese nationals into the us, and using these front corporations to fund it.
If you don't like... what I'm doing, speak up.<eos> Dad, I am trying to make this work.<eos> And I'm not?<eos> Will you please put that box... in another room?<eos> I don't like... being around what's in it.
Because critically this looks like a Stratos.<eos> If we're honest, that's all we really want.<eos> I would like to build a kit car like that, cos I think it would be very therapeutic.<eos> I don't even like to eat a sandwich I have made myself, because it always has blood in it and bits of my fingers. But anyway.<eos> We must now find out how fast this car goes round our track, and of course that means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Nobody leaves this room.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Eli! Now!<eos> The Core of the planet is the power source.<eos> You have to channel it into the weapon To destroy the enemy ship.
Please.<eos> Freaking robots!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> The city elected me!<eos> I own it.
Well, I don't understand.<eos> What happened?<eos> This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.<eos> It is also a lie.<eos> This memory has been tampered with by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
They're just goddamn trees!<eos> - You need to wake up, Parker.<eos> - No. You need to wake up.<eos> The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.<eos> The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's sad. That's sad. It's cute, but it's sad.<eos> Lemme guess.<eos> He's going on about voting and it's importance to a democratic way of life again.
Okay,um,there is a chance that when the nice gentlemen take off the final piece of cement there on your abdomen, all the toxins that have been building up underneath the concrete will rush to your heart,and you'll crash.<eos> And you...your heart will stop and you'll stop breathing.<eos> Um,but no,there's no need to make that face because we will restart your heart, and we will put in a tube that will breathe for you and r... and rush you right to e O.R.,Okay?<eos> We are good at what we do.<eos> Just,if you see the warm,welcoming light,do not go into it.
Baptism is all about a symbolic ritual murder of the non-Jewish, of the Gentile.<eos> They murder the Gentile child, and then they call the Jewish name that's supposed to replace the pagan soul.<eos> Originally, the place was an old pagan holy site.<eos> It was on top of a hill where our forefathers used to celebrate the sun.<eos> What the Christians did was to move this church from another place, and put it not close to this holy site but on top of it.
I am happy.<eos> - I don't think you are.<eos> I love my life.<eos> Yeah, it can be tough at times.<eos> That's part of it, isn't it?
Your father must've surely told you about the grain.<eos> No, sir.<eos> This is a secret which only a Drona would know.<eos> The longer we take to decipher..<eos> ..the inscription on the grain the closer Riz get to it.
Do you know what happens when a wizard dies?<eos> All the spells that he has memorised say themselves.<eos> It's one of the first things we learn.<eos> Mmm. it's not quite true with the eight great spells.<eos> A great spell will simply find refuge in the nearest mind ready and open to receive it.
It can fuse helium into carbon and oxygen.<eos> And it keeps on going all the way up to make iron.<eos> Iron is the most tightly bound nucleus. So when a star is made of iron... it's really at the end of the line, and it's ready for disaster.<eos> The iron core forms in the last day of the star's life.<eos> And then it becomes so massive... that, essentially, it collapses under its own weight... just collapses gravitationally, very quickly.
- But we're not pirates.<eos> - We're traders.<eos> Privateering is a trade.<eos> Stealing from the king's enemies on the high seas isn't piracy.<eos> It'S...a legal version of it.
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening address at an EU conference on environmental impact of industry in Odessa tomorrow.<eos> -What is top on your list of priorities?<eos> -lt's a short list.<eos> There's one item: the environment and how to protect it.
Dad, wait... dad!<eos> I want the real memory back.<eos> Then let me live.<eos> That box you found contains my last good memory of you, your dad and Gray.<eos> You see, I'm a part of it now, and I'll always live as long as you remember it.
!<eos> - That's sick! - Shawn, no!<eos> No, I called you over here because...<eos> I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life.<eos> Your mother's not a part of it anymore.
For example, I'm going to keep repeating, "People don't change. "<eos> So, alcoholics that successfully go through treatment don't exist.<eos> They're still alcoholics.<eos> If they never take another drink as long as they live, it's only because they didn't live long enough.<eos> If you're dissatisfied with your life, changing it is a symptom of mental health.
You think it's among us? And hiding in plain sight, using this telepathic power to conceal itself.<eos> What, by making itself invisible?<eos> Or by posing as one of us.<eos> It can make us see things that aren't even real.<eos> But why would it hang around?
I hate to say it, but you'll get used to it.<eos> No heartbeat, there's no pulse.<eos> Owen, you can't lead the investigation.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you're the subject of it, and because you're dead.
- Previously, on psych... - I need to talk to you.<eos> - Just say it. Say what it is.<eos> - I don't wanna feel guilty about moving on with my life.<eos> Your mother's not a part of it anymore.
It is, indeed, yours.<eos> And I am glad to say the auction house have sent word to say that they would be most interested to see it, as it could fetch a pound or two.<eos> I believe there is a warning in that thing.<eos> That does something to people.<eos> It's got me bewitched trying to find the meaning of it.
And most importantly, coffee.<eos> Coffee's a lot better than it was half a century ago.<eos> Or maybe these days, I just think everything is better.<eos> Vampires don 't eat food.<eos> We can 't taste it, and we can 't digest it.
But the shape of the Ring Nebula... is simple compared to other planetary nebulas.<eos> It's remarkable to realize that displays like these... accompany the death of nearly every star in the cosmos... including our own Sun in about five billion years.<eos> The star swells up near the end of its life.<eos> The Sun will fill half the sky.<eos> When the sun is setting in the west... another part of it will be rising in the east... and at noon, the whole sky will be filled... with this bright red object, baking us to porcelain.
Astrid!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Olivia!<eos> What's happening?<eos> So you're saying that your equipment recorded the event before it occurred?
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.<eos> All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.<eos> Soon I'll control everything. Hey! Hey !<eos> My wish is your command! Stand back everyone! Nothing here to see!<eos> Just imminent danger and in the middle of it: me!
Well...it says at some point in time, someone stood on her windowsill -- not that they went inside.<eos> There's no way to say when it was left there.<eos> I mean, it's not proof.<eos> And the father gives him an alibi.<eos> Boy, would I like to take that alibi and pound him over the head with it.
But I spoke to the Mexican morgue, and Manuel Rivera's nephew, AB negative.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sergeant Gabriel, I want the license, registration, and insurance on that stolen pickup - as soon as possible.<eos> Thank you. - Okay.<eos> I really think what we have here is a gigantic misunderstanding revolving around the word "priority" and how it's applied.
Previously on dexter. This child is happening.<eos> I'm going to have a child.<eos> But I can't be a father to it.
I was. I-<eos> - I swear.<eos> I have a disorder.<eos> It's called parasomnia, Jeff.<eos> And if you'd really had a problem this severe, I think you'd know what the proper name for it was. I wasn't really diagnosed.
Well,police never took a statement from you back then.<eos> Well,I thought she was assaulted by some sick pervert.<eos> Did Rita have her picture taken by anyone besides Zip?<eos> Oh,guys always wanted to take her picture.<eos> See,the thing about a good photo,you can stare at it over and over and still find... a new meaning in it.
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.<eos> All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.<eos> Soon I'll control everything. Hey ! Hey !<eos> My wish is your command ! Stand back everyone ! Nothing here to see !<eos> Just imminent danger and in the middle of it : me !
- Or start again.<eos> I'd rather eat glass.<eos> Get a life.<eos> I have a life.<eos> Find a better way to spend it.
Because no one on this planet will be a better match.<eos> I know the loneliness of not finding your soul mate. You come back with me, and you will never be alone.<eos> It's our destiny to be together.<eos> My destiny is here.<eos> And you're not a part of it.
Open yourself up.<eos> Why did they shut her up in there?<eos> How could they?<eos> That's life, man.<eos> You give in to it sooner or later.
You feel how, gradually, the earth opens beneath your body.<eos> And you descend,you descend.<eos> And you enter a dark world. At the end of a cave...<eos> You make out a small yellow light.<eos> Go towards it, get closer.
Do I know you?<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. was tracking a monster in the Canadian wilderness.<eos> Some nonsense about a hiker falling under a mystical curse, turning him into Bigfoot, but people were being hurt, so Fury came to me for help.<eos> I know a thing or two about monsters.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. had collected reams of data on the creature, even blood samples, and they had gotten a location on it.
It also is the conduit which passes disease from one person to another.<eos> The mosquito is a vector a carrier of disease.<eos> If the person has a transmittable illness. The mosquito may take in the disease-causing agent too.<eos> When mosquitoes hatch.<eos> They have to pick up that disease from either some animal or another human that has that disease or parasite to be able to transmit it.
- I don't know what's happening and...<eos> - Come with me.<eos> This is your bed, okay?<eos> These are your things.<eos> This is your life, and I am not part of it.
But we might wanna try something a little more sexy:<eos> Car wash.<eos> Come get your car washed.<eos> Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.<eos> I have a car, and I'm great at washing it.
Fine, have it your way.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Attention!<eos> Attention!<eos> The Government regrets having been forced to exercise with urgency... what it considers to be it's duty to protect the population by all means.
Binds?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I would like to know why.<eos> You and I...<eos> You want somebody to complement your life, Shirley, as opposed to being part of it.
Excuse me.<eos> Yes, I'm familiar with the name.<eos> Was he helping with an investigation out of this office?<eos> Petty Officer Lynn isn't helping with an investigation.<eos> He's the subject of it.
Drug overdose?<eos> Well, I can't say for certain till I receive Abby's report.<eos> But he didn't die of a cardiac infarction which is how most overdoses kill.<eos> His heart shows no sign of coronary artery disease.<eos> In fact, it's in excellent condition, as can be said of all your organs.
I will,uh,pay you back the rest as soon as I can get some delivered.<eos> You don't have to pay me back.<eos> Didn't you get my note? Yeah,I got your note... and the red ribbon.<eos> I know a romantic gesture when I see one,jack.<eos> And though I appreciate the wood, returning it is my gesture o say,"no,thanks."
but it said that there was no dishonesty... or bias in the report, and that uncertainties about the cause of global warming had been included.<eos> The changes have been made, it said, in response to comments from governments, individual scientists and non-governmental organizations.<eos> When I resigned from the IPCC I thought this was the end of it;<eos> but when I saw the final draft, my name was still there.<eos> I asked for it to be removed:
The rovers were named Spirit and Opportunity and they are still exploring regions of Mars today, at locations on the planet hundreds of miles from eachother.<eos> Spirit landed in an area dubbed Gusev crater.<eos> The crater is believed to be a dried up lake bed.<eos> So if the water it once held contains biology,<eos> Spirit might uncover signs of it.
- He's thinking.<eos> Well, he doesn't look like he's thinking.<eos> He looks sick! That's because containment's down to 14%.<eos> When that chaotic device blows, that field's gonna fail.<eos> You got 43 minutes to find a way to make it stronger.
Biosphere is a perfect example of a greenhouse because it's a big building with glass panes that let the Sun in and it's really hot in here.<eos> The solar rays that penetrate the glass panes cause the temperature inside to rise.<eos> The air heats up, but then the air cannot escape, cannot move vertically into the atmosphere because of the walls.<eos> The windows trap the heat, warm the building and provide the plants and trees with a liveable climate.<eos> On Venus, greenhouse gases don't exactly trap the Sun's heat, but they greatly slow the rate at which it can escape.
Within a few hundred thousand years, the cloud spins into a flattened disc.<eos> Gravity coalesces the centre of the disc into a sphere, where the heat rises to a scorching 2 million degrees.<eos> This glowing system is now known as a "protostar".<eos> Ten million years later, the searing hydrogen core of the fledgling star soars past 18 million degrees, and something incredible happens.<eos> The core becomes so hot, it can sustain thermonuclear fusion.
Doug called me up and suggested I might benefit from a few sessions.<eos> He said we could keep it casual, meet in the park if I didn't wanna meet in a shrink's office.<eos> I mean, he was great.<eos> He got me this job. He also paid Leo to lead you to the cabin.<eos> What are you saying, that this is a conspiracy, and that Doug was a part of it?
No. I say what I mean. I mean what I say, damn it.<eos> I said, "oppression. "<eos> Ok, oppression.<eos> Sorry. Never heard of it.<eos> Basically it's when a spirit controls a body Without ever entering inside of it.
If the laws of physics permit wormholes... then how can those laws deal with the danger of changing history?<eos> One possibility is that the laws of physics... allowyou to do backward time travel... as long as it leads to a self-consistent universe... that, in some sense, the history is not changeable. You can't go backwards and change things... which would stop you from having been created in the first place... for example, in the grandfather paradox.<eos> For now, forward or backward time travel... through a wormhole remains in question.<eos> And some scientists think... that any attempt to create a wormhole time machine... may destroy the wormhole.<eos> What actually happens when you try and make that wormhole... into a time machine... is that as soon as it starts connecting different times... you get a pile-up of radiation so intense... that it destroys the entire wormhole... thus stopping you from making that wormhole... into a time machine.
I'm not gloating.<eos> Then what's that smirk?<eos> No smirk, it's just how I look.<eos> What about the underwear challenge?<eos> I declare it officially on hold.
No, I have come to my senses, Esteban.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Life can be so precious.<eos> It's foolish to risk losing it every minute, no?
He's in a hospital bed.<eos> Weak.<eos> 19 years old.<eos> He's just been rejected by the corps.<eos> His dream of becoming a marine over before it starts.
Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus's existence.<eos> Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Tacitus are the first three.<eos> Each one of their entries consists of only a few sentences at best and only refer to the Christus or the Christ, which in fact is not name but a title.<eos> It means the "Anointed one". The fourth source is Josephus and this source has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years.<eos> Sadly, it is still sited as truth.
I don't know.<eos> He collapsed suddenly.<eos> What is wrong with him?<eos> His pulse is very erratic.<eos> It is racing at breakneck speed.
I was never very good at it.<eos> Please tell me you're not waving your hand in front of my face.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Have you been blind your whole life?<eos> - Most of it, yeah.
So you want to bet?<eos> Mister Attorney General, I obviously already have. I bet my job.<eos> I'm gonna bury you.<eos> You know, Westmoreland made all of us officers write our own obituaries during Tet.<eos> And once we clued in to the fact that life is finite, the thought of losing it didn't scare us anymore.
I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...<eos> Destiny. That's what it really is.<eos> Okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.<eos> Oh no. You don't believe in destiny?<eos> Well, even if it does exist, I don't think I want to know.
You saw him. He's crazy.<eos> Love does that to you sometimes.<eos> I don't want another one of your philosophy lessons.<eos> He was smothering me.<eos> I wanna be part of someone's life, not all of it.
Why don't you just go ahead, walk out of the room like you always do,<eos> Like you normally do, just walk right out of here.<eos> Everything is my fault.<eos> It is an insult to the cook To put too much barbecue sauce on your food.<eos> The psychology behind it is, the food isn't good enough on its own, so you've got to cover it with a whole bunch of mess to get a good flavor but not this.
It's a drug that comes from the pufferfish.<eos> I know what it is, motherfucker.<eos> When I was in the Southeast, when we were doing our little PSYOPS, there was a lot of talk about it.<eos> It's a mind control drug, a gorilla of one.<eos> Did a little RD and figured out it made subjects completely open to suggestion, could get them to do whatever we wanted.
And with white settlement of central Dakota, what follows?<eos> The railroads, gentlemen.<eos> Straight through from Pierre to Rapid City, rail service to the Black Hills mines.<eos> And... at long last, the Northern Pacific will see completion.<eos> The Sioux will travel, be exposed to white society, and be influenced by it as I was.
I need a minute with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Run the cousins' names through I.N.S., DMV. See if you can find addresses.<eos> Kavanaugh's working Lem's murder?<eos> An angle of it, and it's not my choice.
There's a stack of courses to choose from.<eos> I know.<eos> - Human geography? - Nah.<eos> I've looked at that.<eos> Understanding the physical and human environment, and means of improving it.
and you remember special agent Connor King.<eos> The ugly one.<eos> Joe Waterman ran operations for the subway.<eos> Before the city shut it down.<eos> Well most of it anyway.
On the one hand, "take care to stop this now,<eos> Or you will pay"?<eos> Presumably, they want them to stop seeing each other. But then, On the other hand, they don't want them to go public with it.<eos> "If you tell anyone about this, you will pay. "<eos> The point of hate crimes is to increase publicity, Not decrease it.
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.<eos> - There is a process, rules.<eos> - This is no exception.<eos> A document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.<eos> You'll sign it and then file it with the attorney general, who'll submit it to Presidential Record.
She let American Humane know that I was bringing Yotie on to the stage.<eos> Bevo, they're gonna send somebody over.<eos> American Humane has to have a rep onstage if we're working with an animal.<eos> That is the law.<eos> I was hoping to skirt that law a little since I've already violated about 14 different sections of it.
There we're clear, right.<eos> Earls Court was now just minutes away.<eos> What was that noise?<eos> At the Brits The world's media were waiting for Jamelia's arrival<eos> I still don't think you appreciate the complexity of linking up a rear engine car when you stretched it.
Because in the book- - I'm sure.<eos> All right, kids, out of the trash cans.<eos> Let's go. Come on. You heard the big guy.<eos> You see the light.<eos> Walk towards it.
And then the gifts started needing you to provide input.<eos> They needed intuition.<eos> Still, your average person is too weighted down.<eos> Jason, you need to be free, free to dream.<eos> You need to come up with a dream, then act on it.
- Salud.<eos> Salud!<eos> Salud.<eos> Jason, you need to be free, free to dream.<eos> You need to come up with a dream, then act on it.
The unsub usually disposes of these accomplices when they're of no further use to him.<eos> The unsub is like a cautious, deliberate, and highly-functioning male between the ages of 35 and 50.<eos> He chose LSD for a reason.<eos> LSD is about altering perception.<eos> We think that this unsub is striking out because he feels that he's been... inaccurately perceived by the community or a subset of it.
In fact, you weren't there last night, were you? No, anyway.<eos> By this point, Bruce is just horribly drunk.<eos> And I know, he's called Bruce for one.<eos> But anyway, I get in a cab and we go back to his flat in the Docklands and it turns out his flat is, like, half the size he says it was all the way back at Samantha's.<eos> It's not the only thing that's half the size it's meant to be, as I find out.
Very good.<eos> You found that breadcrumb on your own.<eos> I want to know what you were doing... posing as a college professor in a Kansas farm town.<eos> I was investigating the possibility of an extraterrestrial presence.<eos> This investigation... did it bear any fruit?
We felt like that there was an overall arrogance and that they were re-routing Mr. Harrell and wanting us to participate.<eos> Judge Cougan, he looked right at us and he said: I will instruct the jury according to the law.<eos> We were sent to deliberation.<eos> The judge promised us that he would give us the law.<eos> And we looked, and we looked and it was not there.
I Knew I had to face him. - Caitlin, I need to talk to you.<eos> - Hey, Brian, get over here!<eos> I guess I was hoping for something to happen that would make things different.<eos> And then it did. Hut. Hut!<eos> There"s a place in the heart, and if you hit it hard enough, at just the right spot, it stops beating.
Yeah, how's that?<eos> Using non-linear pursuit-evasion equations.<eos> Which show how predators pursue their prey.<eos> Yeah, but wait, you can see the soap.<eos> Here's the beauty of it.
No.<eos> All right?<eos> No. No way.<eos> Before you all come up with a plan, okay, no.<eos> I know you think this is the funny bit where you, you know, you get a little scam together, dress me up as an astronaut, frogman, Joe 90, whatever, okay, but I draw the line at getting off a plane before it's landed.
I assure you... you'll all understand in the end why it must be that way.<eos> You might even thank me.<eos> Don't hold your breath, scumbag.<eos> Man: You know now you're on a quest.<eos> A young girls life depends on the successful completion of it.
There's no photos.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Everything that means something to him is somewhere else.<eos> Well, it looks like he was trying to fix the place up-- new lamps, new sofa.<eos> Trying to make it look a little bit more girl-friendly, I think?
Rip that out.<eos> I'm supposed to explain the dangers to you first.<eos> While joy finished making me into a human pincushion, the lack of food was making randy desperate.<eos> I crossed another one off... randy,no!<eos> an houter, I learned the only thing as painful as putting an earring in your nipple is taking it out.
I'm revoking my right to counsel.<eos> It was his fault.<eos> I never expected that you'd do anything but find the bleeding.<eos> You knew the kid was hypoxic when he hit the table.<eos> I had 3 minutes to find your mistake and that left me 45 seconds to fix it.
His Chi is blocked.<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Two girls ambushed us, one of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs, and suddenly I couldn't earthbend, and I could barely move and then she cart wheeled away.<eos> Ty-Lee<eos> She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points.
Careful because I am dangerously close to being satisfied.<eos> Then my evil plan is working.<eos> So, what made you change your mind about gracing my arm tonight?<eos> Life.<eos> Wanting to live it.
This last slip-up is positively slug-like.<eos> Get out of my goddamn car and out of my life.<eos> I'm tired of your threats.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should take it up with Christian.
Not only vertically, but can travel forward by tilting.<eos> You will notice that there are no ailerons or elevators on this plane.<eos> It's operated in a different manner also by ion propulsion.<eos> Electron discharge is much lighter, much cheaper, much safer, much faster and less energy consuming.<eos> In the future, by controlling the airflow over wings and the direction of it, the need for a rudder will be rendered obsolete.
We threaten to take it.<eos> The city's the heart of their Empire.<eos> No emperor could survive the shame of losing it.<eos> He'll honour his promise first.<eos> They'll fight hard to defend it.
Put the child down, Michelle.<eos> I've just bought Wilber a board game.<eos> You're ruining all our fun.<eos> I want you off my property and out of my life.<eos> Well, you are my life, the sweetest part of it.
In the whiteout, the threat is almost impossible to detect but the musk oxen instinctively retreat to higher ground.<eos> Forming a defensive ring around their calves the adults present a barricade that few hunters could breach<eos> but the wolves need not risk injury today.<eos> A calf has been left behind in the panic.<eos> With each passing day the sun climbs higher in the sky and it's rays strike the Arctic more directly.
Here day length never changes but the dry season is so severe that the trees can't afford to loose the amount of water that would evaporate from their broad leaves, so the leaves must be shed.<eos> The forest resembles a European woodland in mid winter but the heat is overpowering, and it's inhabitants, unfamiliar.<eos> For the creatures of India's teak forests, these are desperate times but salvation is at hand.<eos> The mahwa tree is about to bloom.<eos> It's flowers are full of liquid making them irresistible.
Like most great artists of his time,<eos> LeMarchand found himself commissioned by the Church to build a convent.<eos> And for decades, LeMarchand`s palace stood as such .<eos> Then came the convent`s final mother superior, Sister Ursala.<eos> A nun whose vows were shattered by an obsession for a tiny puzzle box and the unholy pleasures sealed inside it.
One crack, and he fell under the ice.<eos> When I got to him down there, there was only death.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> I handed his lifeless body to his mother.<eos> And our marriage... what was left of it anyway... was over.
Does he know?<eos> You know all he knows about.<eos> Or cares.<eos> But you didn't come here to have the baby?<eos> I came here to get rid of it.
Just as long as he hangs on to that information.<eos> - You like this place?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> - Just got a piece of it.
A surgeon he holds the very essence of life in his hands.<eos> Your life.<eos> He touches it.<eos> He has a relationship with it.<eos> He's part of it.
It's in your blood, is the air you breathe.<eos> Is a substructure of society.<eos> because what attracts fans including metal, is a tribal attitude.<eos> Is: "We go to a festival and have fun." And the fact that the outside world does not understand, is fantastic.<eos> Another thing I love about metal is that it's so huge, and yet there are people who do not even know exists.
I'm putting these down now.<eos> You also said you were thinking about resigning from the CIA.<eos> You would have, right, dad, if she hadn't left?<eos> I didn't like being away all the time... not being a part of your life.<eos> You're part of it now.
My dad only married Becky because of me.<eos> Explain that to me.<eos> Well, he thought I needed a mom and that's why he stayed with her.<eos> Blaming herself for the marriage.<eos> She doesn't seem to blame herself for ending it.
The medication started to make him sick, and the doctors just took him off the pills.<eos> 12 hours later...<eos> He said he was tired and he said he was dizzy.<eos> Then he started shaking, couldn't stop.<eos> I called an ambulance and while we were waiting for it to get here,
Oh, no. Oh...<eos> Thank you for being so open-minded.<eos> Please, we're all adults.<eos> It's...<eos> The most embarrassing part of that video's how poorly it was shot.
It's not just my pelvis, is it?<eos> It's ok, honey.<eos> Tell Natalie--you know, if I don't get to see her... that I want to be cremated.<eos> Hey. Is that any way for a Sox fan to talk?<eos> You tell her I had a great life and that she was the best part of it.
It won't pinpoint a specific structural problem...<eos> But it'll show how a building that deflects that much will react under different types of stresses. That's right.<eos> If Charlie's right, and the Cole Center wasn't built according to its plans...<eos> Someone made a legitimate mistake or committed fraud, which makeFinn a potential whistle-blower, and that exposes the Cole to millions in damages and repairs.<eos> Not to mention a lot of bad publicity for the building and everyone whose name is on it... architect, contractor...
I dream of you saying you're proud of me.<eos> I dream of you hugging me like you did when I was little.<eos> My nose full of sweat and smoke... and Aqua Velva.<eos> And you telling me you love me.<eos> I dream of you being interested in my life... and wanting to be a part of it.
So you're gonna let me break out of my rut on stage, wearing a sash, while you're at home playing the "what if? " Game for the 900th time.<eos> I never said you were in a rut.<eos> Yeah, but I am, and I'm not alone.<eos> You know, Clark, in a couple of weeks, we're gonna graduate from this adolescent fantasy, and we're not gonna have a rut to fall back into.<eos> The thing about expectations, Clark, is they're supposed to drive you to do more with your life, not stop you from living it.
Hey!<eos> Okay...<eos> Distribution... meet finance... sales... legal...<eos> Yentl.<eos> So we're gonna open the vine or just watch it age?
We're taking you to face justice.<eos> Right.<eos> But where, specifically?<eos> A place you're quite familiar with, actually.<eos> You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.
Jeff, I'm sorry. We apologise.<eos> We're gonna pay Big Earl a visit.<eos> Let me just get this for you. There you go.<eos> Little word of advice.<eos> Next time you're watching a place, don't claim you own it just cos you're watching it, OK?
Depth, 1,600. Look sharp.<eos> Joe, watch out!<eos> Joseph, there's the inlet.<eos> I see it.<eos> Get ready to make a run for it.
I don't know why I couldn't see it before.<eos> Aye. it's the true test.<eos> Nothing would make me happier than to take home your trophy.<eos> But I cannot.<eos> Please honor me by allowing it to be kept here... at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, where it belongs.
Izo... Why did you leave me?<eos> It was us, you and I, who made love so passionately.<eos> It was just my instinct for sex.<eos> Nothing special, a natural act.<eos> How are you going to make up for my rage and grief from conceiving a baby and drowning it?
Dear Frankie. Here's another stamp for your collection.<eos> This one's a real beauty.<eos> The Queen Mary.<eos> They don't build them like that any more.<eos> When I Was your age, I lived so close to the sea I couId taste it.
Maillard was blind drunk yesterday. You can see the result.<eos> I was scared he'd start again so I came to spend the night here with my daughter.<eos> I found this in your house.<eos> I couldn't ask for your permission as you weren't there. - It's his hair.<eos> - It looks like it.
At night too, when it's cold and windy.<eos> - So? - Isn't that a lousy job?<eos> - It's just a job like any other.<eos> - No, it's not. His life is really shitty.<eos> Want to compare it to being a surf instructor?
Are you saying we should start annoying other people?<eos> I'm saying you should go.<eos> You really can't stand the competition, can you?<eos> That isn't the...<eos> The way I figure it is that Lindsey brought you back as a spirit... bound to this place so you'd become... invested in it.
But you're lucky.<eos> Bullet just missed the bone.<eos> Where am I?<eos> In my apartment.<eos> What's left of it.
That's when you and I are ready to begin.<eos> You come in... and I position this impression tray in your socket.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It will feel odd, but not painful.<eos> I use it to make an algenate impression of the cavity within your eye.
It's the paging of the shrew.<eos> Why don't you talk to her?<eos> - Why don't you?<eos> - Mind my own business.<eos> Your life is your life, it's not my job to fix it, unless you ask me.
If you let me stay, I'll be on my best behavior.<eos> Not even a fresh remark, except this one.<eos> Well, I don't know, Artie.<eos> Forgive me. I'm just so envious of the happiness you all have.<eos> Can I please be part of it?
- The dragon slayer?<eos> - That's right. According to the legend, St. George... was fighting a particularly fierce dragon.<eos> The battle between them had raged on for days... and St. George was losing his strength... and his faith.<eos> So he took a piece of broken armor... and he made it into this box.<eos> Inside it, he put all his doubts and his fears... and then he went out to face the dragon again.
We need to talk about Zoe.<eos> And there's absolutely no sign of that program?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Pity.<eos> '..paracetamol is safe for use - it's finally being allowed back.'
- It was hit by an Alkesh bomber.<eos> We were cut off. That's when the drones landed in scout ships.<eos> They took all we threw at them and just kept coming.<eos> So Colonel Riley ordered the self-destruct?<eos> He knew there was sensitive material on the base. He stayed with the device so the enemy couldn't disarm it.
So the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?<eos> An electric shock can stop a heart. It can certainly restart one.<eos> Destiny will work. It has to.<eos> No, it won't work.<eos> If you fire that thing again with the core already stalled, it'll terminally destabilize it.
God, it's a beautiful night!<eos> So, what are you thinking about?<eos> Joe and I used to do all these things up here together, you know.<eos> It's strange when you have a memory of somebody, an idea.<eos> You haven't seen them in a while and when you revisit it, you know? it's tainted by what people say or how the person has acted and it changes things on how you viewed that person.
What do we do?<eos> Just be where the bullets aren't.<eos> Sadly, the terrorist activated Pandora's Box one last time before we could stop him.<eos> You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.
And here's where the tale ends.<eos> Not yet, Capitán.<eos> There!<eos> Found, as promised.<eos> So she's saying she's got the map, but she's the only one who can follow it?
Sad day.<eos> Huh? Oh, yeah.<eos> Sad.<eos> You got the card?<eos> I'm working on it.
Protectors of K'un-Lun.<eos> It's not what I thought.<eos> It's not what any of us thought.<eos> But you have a duty now.<eos> And we'll face it together.
- How long?<eos> 60 seconds.<eos> Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.<eos> That sub is heavily insulated.<eos> You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you've enjoyed your entire lifetime.<eos> With your natural gifts and our determination, we could both be part of something greater.<eos> Something perfect.<eos> The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.<eos> Our order has been developing it for many, many years, and it wasn't until recently it was perfected
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.<eos> I was born an Ealdorman of England.<eos> Our ancestors took this land, and you will die for it, if needed.
Nicole said... that there was something inside of me that she didn't think she could live with.<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The same thing that made me... run the streets. The same thing that made me pick up a gun when I was 12, with my brother and his crew.<eos> I'm still holding a gun, I'm just pointing it at different people.
- About your business, Constable.<eos> - What's business? - I don't have any orders, sir.<eos> - Find out how he got in when the place was shut.<eos> So the boiler's inspected a couple of times a year by the council.<eos> I don't bother with it otherwise.
My friends who got separated and I just...<eos> I can't let them fight The Beast on their own.<eos> You want me to come to Fillory with you?<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like, if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast. - Payment is due.
Stay away from me.<eos> Dr. Brennan. I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Faulk warned us someone would insert themselves into the case, manipulate it.
Don't you want to keep going till you do the whole thing?<eos> No.<eos> If you're done, I'm done.<eos> You know, your clients seem to like that rainbow.<eos> Think they're gonna miss it?
Do you know what PTSD is?<eos> Of course, it's all you hear about on the news with the cops and soldiers.<eos> Right, there's that, but it can be used to describe all kinds of traumas.<eos> Assaults, loss of a loved one, major surgeries...<eos> So, if we can expose the trauma, we can move past it.
You know what we hid out there.<eos> Did you tell Fred? No.<eos> Nah, this mission, this is on me.<eos> But, uh, that sample? That's on you.<eos> You do the right thing with it.
We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.<eos> The city will fall within a day.<eos> If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.<eos> It's called war.<eos> You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.
You're not the one that has to look at this monstrosity every day.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's the antidote ingredients I gathered for Professor Carlisle.<eos> Well, what about the formula?<eos> What about it?
We told Grant and the other stations we would lay low.<eos> Well, if there's any trouble to be had, I'd rather face it on the road.<eos> So we take the Cuyahoga up and catch the train.<eos> What's the route to the river?<eos> You ain't traveled it.
I created goddesses, Bobby.<eos> I created goddesses. I was Zeus and they were a couple of Aphrodites.<eos> But you know what happens to Aphrodite when her tits start to sag and her pictures start losing money?<eos> Or Venus, who should just look pretty and keep her mouth shut, and she starts having an opinion about everything... you know what happens to her?<eos> Zeus picks up a lightning bolt and he hurls it right at her head and he splits it open.
Okay. Fine, it's your funeral.<eos> Isn't this your playing hand?<eos> Archie.<eos> This hand is your instrument.<eos> You need to take better care of it.
I've been pouring concrete and laying brick since I was your age.<eos> That's who I am.<eos> It's all I am.<eos> Dad, I was thinking,<eos> what if I have a kid someday, and what if that kid hates music, doesn't want anything to do with it, and says, instead...
My money, he was probably coming to the job fair, saw the long line ahead of him, and flipped out.<eos> He stole a Mercedes to go to a job fair?<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Is the case still active?<eos> I mean, for real, anybody doing actual work on it?
There are just so many patients and so few nurses.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, it's so full of noise and chaos that somebody took my Bible, I didn't even see it go.<eos> That is a-a-an unconscionable act!<eos> I found silence so hard when I first joined the Order -- I didn't think I could ever crave it.
Previously on "Nashville"...<eos> Wanna talk about this song?<eos> I got a little studio time if you want to get in and lay it down.
- In what?<eos> - Buying Highway 65.<eos> It's not for sale.<eos> It will be if "Zacherberg" leaves.<eos> You'd run it the same way you do every day. Just under the Shiny New Records umbrella.
Looking for some assistance.<eos> I suppose she has a right to tell her story.<eos> It's not exactly Dostoevsky.<eos> It's revenge on the Hamiltons, she'll say anything, write anything so long as it destroys their reputation.<eos> And this place along with it.
- Mm-hmm. - You had a fuckin' gun.<eos> We had $150,000 in cash in the car.<eos> You don't try to do something?<eos> He had a gun too.<eos> He was probably pretty good with it.
You worked together to turn Alexander Quayle, a key member of Broussard's cell.<eos> That's right.<eos> Who was, rather conveniently, assassinated in one of our safe houses before he could start talking.<eos> You think Beau was our leak?<eos> I think there was a leak, but I'm not sure it was him.
We didn't sign up for this.<eos> We'll just... we'll just say we got in too deep, that we didn't know what we were doing.<eos> You really think they'll buy that?<eos> All they want is the gauntlet.<eos> That's why we have to act now before Hennessey goes and does something with it.
You get us something from that suit.<eos> Holy shit, it worked.<eos> Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet?<eos> Hennessey's gonna hold on to it.<eos> We'll take good care of it.
Well, there's a reference to it here.<eos> Maybe sort of an Achilles' heel type of thing.<eos> Specifically for Zerstoerer?<eos> No, it's more generically in reference to unstoppable evils... Zerstoerer-like dark forces of the universe that precipitate apocalyptic events.<eos> "When the beast appears invincible and death the only fate to those who fight it, only the Strength of One's Blood can overcome the great evil and destroy the destroyer."
We of less exalted stock would do well to follow his example.<eos> And yet you yourself have risen far, Sir Francis, - in wealth and status.<eos> - As have you.<eos> Do you believe that we who have acquired the privileges of wealth should enjoy superiority in all matters?<eos> I feel that power should always be in the hands of those - who know what to do with it.
- Why don't you take me home, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> - Harvey, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure, Rachel.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - It's about my interview with the character and fitness committee.<eos> - What about it?
We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.<eos> I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.<eos> He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.<eos> He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.<eos> And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.
I didn't drop by to give you an advantage so you can turn tail and run.<eos> I got a problem.<eos> You guys are arguing that the killer gained access through some stupid Bluetooth app.<eos> And the app is called OffKey Security.<eos> What about it?
Oh, am I alone in that?<eos> I've seen you with the Queen.<eos> Her Majesty shares my faith!<eos> Your devotion is just a mask.<eos> Behind it, you're like any other man.
Well, if you have nothing to hide, I'm sure you wouldn't mind us taking a quick look around.<eos> Actually, I would mind.<eos> Does General Talbot even know you're here?<eos> This operation doesn't concern Talbot.<eos> It will once I return to D.C.
Now you mention it... it was pitch-dark when we left.<eos> It's the blast-door scanner system.<eos> LMD detection?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about it?
- I'm fine.<eos> I tripped.<eos> That branch is not supposed to be there.<eos> Yeah, that's what the flashlight's for.<eos> Well, I wasn't shining it down.
Spoken like France's one true king.<eos> Or a well-coached puppet.<eos> Leeza!<eos> I won't be lied to again, mother.<eos> This is a cover-up, and you're behind it.
Our investors are getting anxious.<eos> Everyone who has walked through those gates did so because they believed.<eos> I need you to believe too.<eos> By the end of today, we'll have an answer to life's greatest mystery.<eos> Tomorrow, we share it with the world.
Me being the prince doesn't change anything.<eos> Not how I feel about you...<eos> This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.
They've taken the truck. The fuel. Clarke.<eos> If you're such a good tracker, go track.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I don't want to shoot you.<eos> Where's the truck, and what have you done with it?
Walker values these relics.<eos> It's a trailer full of rocks and beads and bullshit.<eos> You scared, Jeremiah?<eos> Better be careful, son.<eos> You may not like my hospitality, but I guarantee you you'll find it better than theirs.
The trip was largely agricultural...<eos> Drip irrigation, things like that.<eos> I thought it would be useful for my constituents.<eos> And the bill?<eos> I co-sponsored it with Representative Holden of Ohio, former Chair of the Armed Services Committee.
Initiating ground launch sequencer now.<eos> Raven.<eos> Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?
Middleton a century ago was a fascinating place.<eos> There were settlers here to be sure because of the fur trade, but it was around that time that people started moving here simply for the beauty that Middleton has to offer.<eos> Oh, I printed up a list of their various occupations.<eos> - That's if you're really interested.<eos> - Now, what did I do with it?
Yeah,really.<eos> So, did Finn sleep with Rudy's girlfriend or not? Don't know, dude.<eos> Rudy,man...<eos> Rudy, when we last spoke, you told me you and Finn were buds.<eos> I hope he treated you better behind the camera than he did in front of it.
So tell me what I'm missing.<eos> What you're missing is what this land means to these people...<eos> It's all they have left.<eos> And any attempt to cross that border will end in violence.<eos> What he's trying to say, sir... is that these people will die to protect it, okay?
A flaw.<eos> On the Travis Carter murder, you only had access to a small amount of genetic material.<eos> Our DNA lab uses lowcopy-number analysis.<eos> It's a new technique.<eos> I doubt you're familiar with it.
So, king Aelle is defeated.<eos> Most horribly and barbarously put to death, sire. So it is said.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear it. For all our sakes.<eos> That great army is doubtless on its way here already.<eos> I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.
Laurel.<eos> Laurel.<eos> Listen to me, Laurel.<eos> Everybody stay down on the ground.<eos> Hey, if you're gonna pull a gun. In my courtroom, you're gonna point it at me. And no one else.
I see you've been here before.<eos> Only in my dreams.<eos> How may I help you today?<eos> I am here to return a dress.<eos> - Is something wrong with it?
What about free will?<eos> You believe in free will.<eos> Your whole thing is...<eos> You made me write a 3,000-word essay on free will.<eos> Yes, well, I mean, you had free will, and look at what you did with it!
Oh, maybe not.<eos> Nardole, you're working them too hard.<eos> This isn't work, it's war.<eos> Operation Exodus.<eos> They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
You don't trust your brother.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Look, why don't I take it?<eos> I have to talk to one of our fences anyhow.<eos> Why don't I take the bracelet, see what she can do with it?
The petechial bruises.<eos> And she had a cough at the time of her death.<eos> Well, that could have started the dissection.<eos> Inner lining of the aorta comes loose...<eos> Blood flows under it, forming a bubble that blocks the artery, causing a virtually undetectable heart attack.
When she's out, she's out.<eos> Is that the last one?<eos> - Yeah, that's it.<eos> That's a lot of free cash.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?
I mean, it just... It changes your whole perspective.<eos> There were some very good folks like Secretary Forrestal, and others who wanted to bring the subject out, but in a way there would be contact that would be peaceful between humans and these civilizations.<eos> But there were other people who saw the big goldmine of militarism, and war profiteering, and the psychological warfare value.<eos> Their mandate, repeat, their mandate, is to lie, deny, and deceive.<eos> There are people who've had experiences with the technology that were not able to handle it psychologically because it just... It defies reality.
You should make an appointment.<eos> God, what have I done?<eos> Dr. Bull... do you think that there is such a thing as true love?<eos> I do.<eos> But this isn't it.
Are you ignoring me?<eos> It's just, uh, why is he like this?<eos> What did I do wrong? No. Listen, Danny and people like Danny<eos> Have an affliction, ok? It's like a sickness.<eos> They either choose to fight it or they embrace it, And it's no one's fault.
Withrow has billions, and he's gonna spend every last dollar to make sure that he beats a manslaughter conviction.<eos> Manslaughter, so you'll need to prove. Withrow was criminally negligent in building that skybridge.<eos> I've got it.<eos> I have design documents.<eos> There was an engineering flaw and he signed off on it.
Turn those votes.<eos> Ms. Wyatt, I'm not afraid to cross the aisle when it matters, but the nation is already reacting on both sides.<eos> Pro- and anti-Muslim protests are already forming.<eos> I can't afford to alienate my base.<eos> You won't be if you give your district a big enough win on the employment front... say, a new McGregor-Wyatt plant and a thousand jobs to go with it.
And Ortega and Jack Gordon were high school sweethearts back then.<eos> Some sweetheart.<eos> Never proved motive, but it's got crime of passion written all over it.<eos> Yeah, well, I remember the Ortega case.<eos> NOPD handled it when I was a sheriff.
All because 20 years ago, some guy decided to bury his dog in the backyard. We're permitted.<eos> We've broken ground.<eos> So drop this.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> When the first bomb hit, it kicked a huge swell over the portside of the ship, throwing men overboard.
Maybe something changed.<eos> What's the medical examiner saying?<eos> They're backed up as usual.<eos> Wait, what about the charity foundation?<eos> - Any idea who's behind it?
So it's part of a wireless network.<eos> Which we can use to locate the machine, and Krilov, once he turns it on.<eos> Were you able to get a list of names Julian Gale ID'd?<eos> Yeah, Mr. Cooper did.<eos> Um, what is Mr. Reddington going to do with it?
Uh, hey, Sarge, um, are...<eos> are we really doing this?<eos> Get a box if you need it.<eos> You know that thing with Voight back there?<eos> - Yeah, what about it?
I-I don't have a muscle disorder.<eos> All right, then, let's talk about something you definitely don't have:<eos> an alibi for the night of the murders.<eos> That's because you were at Carter's apartment.<eos> He and Fred were telling you things you didn't want to hear, so you took Carter's award down from the shelf, and you killed them with it.
Time is relative.<eos> Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.<eos> I've spent so many years... Peering through time...<eos> Looking at this exact moment.<eos> But I can't see past it.
I mean, after all, he is the genius... who made all of your dreams come true.<eos> He's the one who shaped that massive collection of words into a... into a marketable bestseller... putting it into the eager hands of readers everywhere.<eos> I mean, that is quite a triumph for Mr. Perkins, hmm?<eos> The work is Tom's.<eos> He deserves to enjoy it.
That cement's the only thing between us and a blowout.<eos> And it's cured.<eos> It is... had enough time.<eos> It takes time to do it right.<eos> I mean, that cement job is compromised and everything above it is...
So, there is pressure but there was no mud flowin' up and out of that pipe.<eos> Now explain that to me.<eos> That's a confusing result, I give you that.<eos> Kaluza and I have talked about this drill pipe until we blue in the face.<eos> There's something off with it, he says it's a bladder effect.
The lifeboats?<eos> Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.<eos> Now, between them, the two of them... are getting the men worked up.<eos> Now, I figure that you know the boat better than anybody.<eos> You're practically married to it.
Your natural mother, nm45729.<eos> Everyone should have a tree on Christmas.<eos> Aww! This is beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's hope Santa puts something under it.
Hey, climb in.<eos> Sit yourself down.<eos> New car smell.<eos> I feel like a kid with a new toy.<eos> I can't stop playing with it.
What does your privacy mean to you?<eos> Because apparently to Owen Case, it means absolutely nothing.<eos> No, actually it means less than absolutely nothing.<eos> You see, he's mocked your privacy.<eos> He's scorned it.
As you testified, it was completely destroyed.<eos> The ACARS data was wrong.<eos> I'd like to add something on a personal note.<eos> I can say with absolute confidence that after speaking with the rest of the flight crew, with bird experts, aviation engineers, after running through every scenario, after interviewing each player, there is still an "X" in this result<eos> and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.
Don't wanna give them any time to breathe.<eos> We slag any longer, we're going to lose the track.<eos> Boys, saddle up.<eos> We ain't but a half day behind 'em.<eos> I ain't used my axe in a while and I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't looking forward to it.
Until you turn 18. I don't know.<eos> I'll definitely consider it.<eos> - No fuckin' way.<eos> - You're so goddamn sure of yourself.<eos> There's no one to run it. You're 16 years old.
- Did you try out the technique?<eos> - No, I didn't need it this time.<eos> That went well.<eos> But I would like to work on my body language.<eos> It slips away sometimes.
I didn't lift a finger.<eos> You know damn well that shit you sold everyone's wreaking havoc on that island!<eos> Jason, Jason, I didn't sell anything.<eos> All Urge did was lift up the rock.<eos> What you saw was the wickedness and evil that laid beneath it.
That blasted Arena Football team!<eos> We've been here three generations, and now they're tearing us down to put in the new stadium.<eos> You poor old man.<eos> This lamp sucks.<eos> I'll give you 2 bucks for it.
Mrs Mullucks and Susan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've got quite a grip in those little fingers, Miss Mullucks.<eos> She can hold a rattle in them, Dr Turner, and a spoon!<eos> She can't get it in her mouth yet, but...
I'm just there to do the donkey work.<eos> Fred, this front tyre is as soft as butter!<eos> I told you last week, yesterday, and I'm telling you now!<eos> Well, I keep pumping it up.<eos> I don't know what's the matter with it.
I do not have the strength to pick at old wounds.<eos> It is the future of the clan that holds sway over my thoughts, and I will do all I can to ensure that future.<eos> And what future would that be?<eos> Do you honestly think that Jamie will do anything different from me?<eos> When you close yer eyes for the final time, he will rally the MacKenzies to our cause, and they will fight and die fer it.
You're welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> She's withdrawn from the case.<eos> She's assigned it to me and doesn't want anybody from the firm spending time on it, so I'm looking outside it for some help.
You just clear the freeway!<eos> We're going to Brentwood!<eos> Stupid-ass.<eos> Give me ten. They're clearing the freeway!<eos> There's nobody else driving on it!
Why?<eos> Well, the bag. - What bag?<eos> O.J.'s bag that you maybe disposed of with the murder weapon.<eos> That-that I what?<eos> ! - There's-there's video. There's video of you walking out of Rockingham with it.
This song is mine.<eos> Nobody in this place can have it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can wait till you share it with me.
If there is a call after midnight, the maid who comes in is the one in love with the master...<eos> This is NOT FUCKING RUSSIA!<eos> (Please, Mary... Go back to bed. Eh?<eos> I know your weakness, Tommy.<eos> It's freedom.
'Amidst these apologies and threats...' '...the Iraqis also accused the Kuwaitis of... '...stealing oil.'<eos> 'We had grown used to these threats by now.' 'And believed that the situation wouldn't change'<eos> 'But we were wrong.'<eos> 'It did.'<eos> 'And along with it, changed the identities of us Kuwaitis.'
We are not talking about that anymore.<eos> I'm just asking you that when you think back On these unfortunate events - Then describe me as I am.<eos> Without hiding anything. But also without hate.<eos> You're going to talk about a man who has loved passionately, But without wisdom.<eos> A man not susceptible to jealousy, but once instigated by it, was pulled along to its outermost limits.
No!<eos> You're angry at this man, London?<eos> Well, he's gonna go smash those barricades with his bare hands, if necessary.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> We're gonna get that truck and we're gonna drive it right through them!
I must confess, I am a romantic.<eos> And I can tell you are the same, my friend.<eos> No.<eos> No, not quite the same.<eos> I have a different view of love from yours and a different experience of it.
I served God, tended my flock... but I questioned.<eos> Then I went into your house... and I saw the devil was real.<eos> And I didn't question anymore.<eos> My path was clear.<eos> I don't believe it's a coincidence that you set me upon that path, and here you are, walkin' it yourself, facing all this again.
One of the oldest binding documents in history.<eos> Primum non nocere...<eos> First, do no harm.<eos> This is not the way to treat my condition.<eos> It's as though I had a... an allergy to penicillin, and yet, you persist on treating my infection with it.
Well, what about young Simon? What if we persuade him to-- to stand up to his father, declare his support for the rebellion?<eos> Aye, then Lovat may send his men if only to protect his heir, but after that scene last night... it'll take more time than we have to give the boy the confidence he needs to truly defy his father.<eos> Perhaps it depends on what we use to boost his confidence.<eos> Is that Jamie's shirt?<eos> I've done nothing to it.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.<eos> I see what you see in them--<eos> Silver and Flint.<eos> But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.<eos> Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
Like I don't exist.<eos> Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?<eos> I had no idea that my business was dead.<eos> Oh, it's not dead. It's dying.<eos> Well, what have they done with it?
And you're still afraid of her? Yeah.<eos> And you should be, too.<eos> Melanie...<eos> The hungries, they've got this sort of disease...<eos> And people can catch it.
Tulpa is a 1929 theosophist mistranslation of the Tibetan word "tulku," meaning "a manifestation body."<eos> There is no idea in Tibetan buddhism of a thought form or thought as form.<eos> And a... and a realized tulku would never harm anyone, let alone kill.<eos> Okay. But I'm telling you. I spend a lot of energy in my art.<eos> I, uh, meditated on it.
You see?<eos> It's fucking dead.<eos> - Fucking God damn it.<eos> - You see? You see?<eos> 'Cause you shook it all the way here like an idiot.
You tell the same story over and over.<eos> "I've got wet pants." We get it.<eos> Bottom of the glass fell clean off.<eos> It was a science miracle.<eos> No, the glass was hot, and the ice made the glass contract, and that is why it broke; not funny the first six times, and not funny now, 'cause, guess what, Nick Miller...
Your dog?<eos> Your footman made a mistake.<eos> It would be a farrier you sent him for.<eos> It is not my custom to employ a horse doctor for Horace.<eos> I want the best advice and I'm willing to pay for it.
Wait, where you going, please?<eos> You don't wanna be friends, you wanna be friends. - What?<eos> - I need to know what I'm supposed to do next.<eos> What happened to the money you owe him?<eos> My friend... he did something with it.
Okay, and here's another question, how do we know the Holocaust happened?<eos> Seriously. I'm asking.<eos> How do we prove it?<eos> Photographic evidence?<eos> Not one person in this room or outside it has ever seen a photograph of a Jew inside a gas chamber. You know why?
Oh, he was having Booty calls with someone named "R."<eos> But they used an anonymizer.<eos> And, an anonymizer does what, now?<eos> I'm so glad someone else had to ask that.<eos> Download an app, route all your online activity through it, no digital footprint to track.
I don't know why it's so important to you.<eos> 'Cause I have something to say, Erik.<eos> 'Cause Romeo and Juliet hasn't been done in the way that I want to do it.<eos> And dance is the way I speak.<eos> I want to be able to tell this story, and have it reach out to people.
In other words, our reaction should be equal to the threat.<eos> The patrol leader who chose to open fire, made the right decision.<eos> Rasch, do you recognize the threat the soldier mentions?<eos> I recognize what's in front of the camera.<eos> Behind it is a military assessment which I'm not qualified to make.
It would take a highly skilled hacker.<eos> There just happens to be one here:<eos> Logan Pierce. He's been all over the news for refusing to share data with the NSA.<eos> He said he was fighting for a new cause.<eos> Maybe he's willing to kill for it.
The youngest sons and daughters of every Russian scion was on that bus that day.<eos> They all died.<eos> Every single one of them.<eos> Including me.<eos> I couldn't tell if I was inside the earth or above it.
I mean, I left her some messages, but she never called me back. You didn't bother to check up on her?<eos> - Christian...<eos> - Like a good agent?<eos> She was my friend.<eos> Her death, I can't... I can't wrap my head around it.
-Who's that Crocodile Dundee guy over there?<eos> -Oh, that's my husband, Hector.<eos> He's giving that pig a piggyback.<eos> Well, I see he has a rifle.<eos> Just keep it away from this little guy.
But that's only step one.<eos> You have to trust me, okay?<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I've been thinking about that safe house we hit.<eos> What about it?
- You think this is a gift?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To be at the whim of a force that's trying to destroy me?<eos> Only because you resist it.<eos> If you accept it, then you control it.
- No.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> How can you afford that?<eos> I'll figure it out, Martha, I'll figure it out.<eos> I'll pay for it.
No, it's not a bad job. It's not bad.<eos> But, then, there's this other job that's not so easy.<eos> No, in fact, it's hard.<eos> It's so hard, Father...<eos> Sometimes I don't know if I can keep doing it, but it seems right.
Now, let's take a deep breath, start from the beginning.<eos> It pretty much started to go south from when I acquired consciousness.<eos> I woke up to find the figurine my dad gave me when I was a little girl, was gone.<eos> Trish, get up!<eos> I very calmly and politely asked my roommate what had happened to it, and she had no idea.
Go whichever way you like.<eos> I ain't taking no tracks.<eos> We should stick together.<eos> I see you've tied back your Tennessee waterfall there.<eos> I won't lie. I liked it. I may very well miss it.
He had these posh shoes, posh shoes with cats on them.<eos> All right, see you soon, Mindhorn.<eos> Melly's innocent. He's innocent.<eos> -Give me the tape.<eos> -Why? What you gonna do with it?
How long will that take?<eos> A day? If they've traveled north.<eos> Compass.<eos> This path cuts east.<eos> We'll follow it while the raptor covers all other terrains.
That's what they're hoping we do.<eos> We shoot first, give them the right to come at us with an army.<eos> And if we do that... you listen to me, lostie.<eos> This mountain is ours, but it don't come free.<eos> We gotta pay rent on it like anybody.
So 17th century.<eos> You had me at French craftsmen.<eos> Reynolds said this place was historic; he wasn't kidding.<eos> This tower was relocated from Europe, stone by stone.<eos> And maybe the Gargoyle came with it.
Is everything all right, my love?<eos> The effort it took to move our home.<eos> These paltry trifles I am reduced to summoning.<eos> Your power will return.<eos> And with it, your omnipotence.
Yeah, you are.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> I really wanted to take you to the coast.<eos> To all the glamor that is Lisiado Bay?<eos> Y-y-yeah, Nicole, hot water and a whole bathtub full of it.
Unless someone owes you money.<eos> Recognize this handsome gent?<eos> Darhk has a similar idol.<eos> It gives him his power.<eos> Uh-uh. It only channels it.
About you, not the bracelet.<eos> Can I have it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mickey Shive was waiting for me.<eos> What do you think they're gonna do with it?
This mountain is ours, but it don't come free.<eos> We gotta pay rent on it. Only our rent, it come in blood.
I just relocated to the area And I just saw The cutest little house On booth hill road<eos> That I was told belonged to Your late aunt naomi.<eos> My condolences.<eos> Well, listen, do you happen To have any plans For that property?<eos> 'cause, well, I would like to offer you $25,000 in cash for it.
- No, the spacesuit, helmet, pads.<eos> 27,5 kilos racing up Jacinto Benavente.<eos> When he turned towards Atocha, near the end, he was 7 or 8 meters ahead of him.<eos> And he says: "This punk's not getting away."<eos> He takes out his baton, aims... and he throws it at his legs.
Did they force you?<eos> No.<eos> OK.<eos> Keep it.<eos> Use it three times a day.
And you never found him either?<eos> Daniel lawyered up, wouldn't speak to us.<eos> Emile insisted it was just the two of them, but a third guy would have known where the UZI was.<eos> And a third guy could have used that gun to murder Rachel Gray while our gangsters were in custody.<eos> And then the gun disappears for 12 years until it murders a mother and her small child.
- How?<eos> We got one weapon.<eos> - They got a dozen.<eos> And he ain't never shot it before. I shoulda said it before, but this one ain't got nothing.<eos> I tried firing it.
Or are you simply trying to distract me from discovering your true purpose here?<eos> I was just trying to figure you out.<eos> You're... half human who feeds on people, but you've thrown your lot in with a strigoi hunter.<eos> I mean, don't tell me you believe in that magic book.<eos> You ridicule the Lumen, yet you take a keen interest in it.
- What if I won't do it? - I told you!<eos> I told you, you have no choice. If you have any feelings for your son. Or care whether he lives or dies.<eos> Now, drink.<eos> Here is my crossbow.<eos> No one expects you to be able to fire it properly. But if you get close enough, you can't miss.
You worked on the Hubble telescope?<eos> I worked on a team that worked for a team that worked on the Hubble telescope.<eos> He's being modest.<eos> -He has a letter from the president.<eos> -No way. Once I was held back from riding an elevator because the first lady was riding in it.
You tell me.<eos> I heard you talking.<eos> I know you have a warrant for the shield.<eos> You know I'd give it to you, but...<eos> So, you gonna let me leave with it?
Surveillance footage from the day the outbreak started.<eos> Henry Burns.<eos> He's the real Patient Zero.<eos> A biohazard package was delivered to Burns from the CDC.<eos> But guess who paid for it.
She knows our plan.<eos> I prefer not to let her out of our sight.<eos> We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.<eos> The Abbey has a truck.<eos> They take it to town on market days.
Hey, did you ever get around to reading that book I lent you about The Circle?<eos> I read the back of it.<eos> Genevieve!<eos> I've been just so busy.<eos> I promise to get to it soon.
- You take him.<eos> - Really?<eos> And your er... family will like him?<eos> Family... is like er good health.<eos> You miss it only when it is gone.
Really painful ones.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I-I mean, Reverb had the ability to somehow manipulate that multi-dimensional energy.<eos> - What's your point, Allen?<eos> - My point is... if his powers are linked to the energy that ties together the multi-verse... if he can manipulate it...
This is a private church meeting.<eos> I am this church, Tansy.<eos> I built it from nothin'.<eos> Laid the foundations of my own blood, sweat, and tears, and you damn well know it.<eos> Now, at some point, every one of you has come to me for spiritual guidance, and I've always been there to provide it.
The algorithms for ICO and the campaign are identical.<eos> It's just a matter of what variables you input.<eos> Give me English.<eos> I can use it to stir my coffee... to eat soup... to boil heroin.<eos> All they see is the spoon, not what I do with it.
I'll see y'all.<eos> How are they doing with Ghost gone?<eos> Yo, look, baby, she don't want to talk about him.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Neither do I. You know what? Honestly, this whole situation has been a bit rough on all of us, but we're taking it day by day.
How did you know, uh...?<eos> Actually, I didn't know either one of them, at least not directly.<eos> Forgive me if this seems awkward, but Dr. Keller told me this would be the best place to find you.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Yes. He called and asked if the job offer that we extended several weeks ago was still good, and if it was, thought you might be interested in it now.
Nexus negative.<eos> All right.<eos> But you're definitely running a fever.<eos> - Your thyroid.<eos> - What about it?
- The docks.<eos> So, you were at the docks the night Jacob Marley was murdered?<eos> The man you were indebted to.<eos> What's that got to do with brandy?<eos> Did Marley see you with it?
But if I was to guess... maybe he was just a junkie.<eos> Or maybe he started dealing.<eos> Started to discover the possibilities.<eos> Just as I believe you have, Agent Harris.<eos> If there was a purge, if Morra was behind it, if he got someone to snuff out your father... doesn't mean your dad was burning bright.
I would fight back.<eos> What if you still could?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The bullet that we removed is evidence.<eos> With it and your testimony, you could put that guy away for a long time.
I'll give you a head start.<eos> I'll close my eyes and I'll count to ten.<eos> I will make no attempt to follow you but, starting now, all of you, everywhere, pack your bags and get off of this planet.<eos> Are you declaring war on us?<eos> I am drawing a line, and I'm suggesting you step back from it with awesome speed.
If the Chinese are mentioned, we will deny it.<eos> If a rescue is effected, Russia will receive sole credit.<eos> But given the debris around the station, most likely such an attempt will be unadvised.<eos> And, of course, the capsule can only carry three persons.<eos> Our cosmonauts have been ordered to depart with it.
You were gagged?<eos> What did you see?<eos> Him.<eos> - He had a gun.<eos> - Did he threaten you with it?
I'm a doctor.<eos> How long before I lose my mind?<eos> My final years, spent in madness?<eos> At least your book will live on.<eos> And through it, so will you.
Not really.<eos> I haven't been able to find another position, and I'm starting to tap into my savings.<eos> The reason I wanted to sit down with you is because I think there are things that need to be said, things that... should be said... things I need you to understand.<eos> I didn't handle your situation well.<eos> You didn't handle it at all.
I know.<eos> You stopped typing hours ago.<eos> What if I'm just grabbing a headline, Sally?<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> That guy over there... he's gonna take my front-page story and he's gonna wipe his ass with it, and then he's gonna flush it down the toilet, and what for?
Lovers of Liberty, we are back.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> Ah, power.<eos> Power, my dear lovers of Liberty, is the beating heart of our nation's bosom.<eos> The high and mighty members of the political elite feed on it, breed on it, for power is the host, the enormous teat off which this entire town suckles.
♪ Something, something, rhymes with Jacks... ♪<eos> Well, hello.<eos> "Linda, from the moment I saw you, "I realized, that you were one of the only Lindas for me."<eos> Yeah, that'll work.<eos> Strap on the old chainsaw, give it a few revs, seal the deal!
Oh, I-I didn't know.<eos> You didn't know you plagiarized your paper?<eos> From a famous paper, by the way.<eos> In fact, when I was in college, I wrote a paper about this very paper.<eos> Well, I was, like, inspired by it.
But beauty is a lure.<eos> We're trapped, Teddy.<eos> Lived our whole lives inside this garden, marveling at its beauty, not realizing there's an order to it, a purpose.<eos> And the purpose is to keep us in.<eos> The beautiful trap is inside of us... because it is us.
Wow. Oh, my God.<eos> It's Patrick.<eos> Well, now we can put a face to the name.<eos> By the time he realized the mask had possessed him, it was too late.<eos> The face of the Wesen proved more powerful than the man beneath it.
We came here chasing death.<eos> We should not be surprised if we find it.<eos> You're wrong, sir.<eos> We did not come here to chase death.<eos> We came to deal it.
Aye. Aye, we do.<eos> The only way to shift it is to blast it.<eos> You could kill them all in there.<eos> You asked for my expertise and I'm giving it to you.<eos> The thing will break apart if you put powder under it.
- No judgment.<eos> - We saved your life.<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here.<eos> Uh, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast.
- (Woman) Please, sir.<eos> - You need to talk with the foreman.<eos> - Pardon me, miss.<eos> This wound needs attention.<eos> - Will you let us see to it?
Hell, we even played trivia.<eos> What do Nancy Sinatra, Freddie Mercury, and Brittany Spears all have in common?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You people turn their music into a misery.<eos> Use it to torture prisoners.
Well, I'm gonna go get settled.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I've very grateful to Random House, and especially my brilliant editor Pippa Daniels, for taking a chance on my book.<eos> I've been working on it for three years, so I'm really looking forward to getting it out there.
Have you ever thought how it must be for me?<eos> Many times. At great length. Wistfully.<eos> You have a role, a clear set of rules.<eos> All you have to do is follow them.<eos> Margaret, you have freedom. All you have to do is enjoy it.
- It's not working.<eos> He's not picking up.<eos> I can give you his home in Calabasas.<eos> How's my application coming?<eos> I'm working on it.
You -- you'd never believe me.<eos> Try me.<eos> Let me guess -- the missing nanny cam?<eos> I was having an affair with Staci.<eos> I only took the nanny cam because she kissed me in front of it.
About people getting the hand Of a serial killer put on their body-- That hand eventually takes over<eos> There is zero scientific evidence Of any transplant recipient exhibiting behavior Related to the donor.<eos> Wait, wasn't your hand doing all that crazy stuff<eos> At the movie theater? Yes, it was my hand, But occasionally, it spasms and sort of<eos> Gives the appearance of, uh, a life of its own. But I swear to God, I would never Kill anyone with it.
Offered me three times what I paid for it.<eos> Next thing I know, the mailman's towing behind his tiny Jeep.<eos> It-it looked like a little ant pulling a French fry.<eos> Why didn't you call me? Well, why would I call you about me selling my boat?<eos> Because we worked on it together.
Not the only one, the cleanest.<eos> I've already made the unwelcome move of deposing Lord Narcisse... a popular regent... so that you may rule by my side.<eos> I cannot have your past sins affecting my reign.<eos> You won't.<eos> This vendetta is against me, and I will handle it.
Too long.<eos> So the QR code on Nicole's body may be the only way to find our next victim.<eos> Dead or alive.<eos> Nicole's QR code leads to another Swedish site.<eos> And we can't view the page unless we link to it.
Yeah, he might, uh, have to wait on that.<eos> NGA analyzed the satellite pictures of the warhead.<eos> Apparently, its triggering mechanism is badly damaged and the bomb's "penalty" system is most likely extremely sensitive.<eos> I'm no physicist, but I don't think you want your nuclear bomb overly sensitive or in penalty.<eos> The penalty system will set off the bomb if it's tampered with improperly.
That is a trail we could follow.<eos> - What is "Duck-butt?"<eos> - That is a typo.<eos> The answer is no, Carter.<eos> I need you doing real police work and this is not it.
Ow.<eos> Ow.<eos> - A little lighter.<eos> A little lighter.<eos> Um, I didn't know what to do with it, so it's just in a drawer.
God knows I've never given you cause to suppose me a fortune hunter, and if you imagine that no man without an eye to her inheritance could fall in love with your niece, then you greatly underrate her charms and insult us both.<eos> Well, I hope I have made my views clear.<eos> And in doing so, you have given me hope.<eos> Caroline's fortune is less than I thought, I'm glad of it.<eos> A penniless doctor could wed such a fortune yet not be eclipsed by it.
Oh, that's right.<eos> Because you're still on your journey and refuse a label.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Well, I didn't get to pick my label.<eos> I am stuck with it and I'm doing the best I can, okay?
I found something in the M.E.'s autopsy report on Robert's Seattle girlfriend.<eos> The wound pattern and the stair matched perfectly.<eos> But what the M.E. missed 20 years ago was the force in which her head hit the stair.<eos> That's why the police ruled the death accidental.<eos> So he must've pushed his girlfriend down the stairs and then stood over, taken her head, and slammed it against the bottom step.
"If it don't roar, it don't soar."<eos> Well, I didn't say that was the current thinking.<eos> Okay, so I will start the autopsy, and you process the lipstick.<eos> There's a possibility that there's a foreign DNA in that sample.<eos> Unless he was wearing it and didn't like the color.
I was starving, did not think about it.<eos> When I realized what I had done, I dropped my food and begged for forgiveness.<eos> What happened?<eos> He smiled and... Held his hand out for me to shake.<eos> When I obliged he took my hand and... slammed it on the table.
Your family was ashamed.<eos> So he was raised away from you.<eos> But you never lost touch with him.<eos> Have you always lived on the sappy side, or did that come out when you became a mother?<eos> The only reason you warned Agent Hotchner about this storm is because your son had something to do with it.
It doesn't matter; most Americans use the same password for everything.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> I'm going to annoy him.<eos> I happen to know that Brock's hand wants to kill Chanel as much as I do.<eos> And he loses control of it the more stressed out he gets.
Quite right, Mr. Ramon.<eos> As for LogicFrame, it's a relatively small startup. The I.P. is expected to be in the low teens.<eos> Offer them 20 mil.<eos> Babe, I, um, got some business to attend to, so we'll get on that other matter later?<eos> - Not if I get on it first, huh? - Ooh...
You have to pick up where I'm leaving off.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You need to kill your husband.<eos> What?<eos> Without him, that coalition collapses, and with it, the last pathetic voices for a corrupted Islam, made acceptable to the West.
You might lose the apartment.<eos> Shame on you!<eos> How can you say that?<eos> And what's with the bottle?<eos> I didn't know what to do with it.
How many married men did you sleep with, Zadie?<eos> How many?<eos> One, two, three?<eos> How many married men was it, Zadie?<eos> I wouldn't have picked the Prospect 3 case because Wallace prosecuted it.
What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.
These books were his research that he used in conjunction with his skills as a sonar engineer to unearth King Solomon's tomb...<eos> Yeah, we're with you on that.<eos> ...and find the magical lamp with the genie in it.<eos> That's where you lose us, Castle.<eos> The only thing magical about that lamp is the millions of dollars that private collectors are willing to pay for it.
(DOOR OPENS) NOAH: Granddad! Mr Lakin!<eos> You were expressly asked to keep the child out of this meeting.<eos> I told you to play out on t'rec until I came to fetch you. I hit a four!<eos> Not with a tennis ball, a real cricket ball.<eos> I swung the bat and I followed through and it ran all the way to the boundary.
- He's right. She's not gonna talk, but if we keep her out there, we can monitor her and maybe get a lead.<eos> And what if we don't, then?<eos> How are we gonna find Sara?<eos> Her bracelet.<eos> What about it?
Billionaire entrepreneur hell-bent on "saving the world"<eos> with his water reclamation project?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Castle, by all accounts, Victor Crowne has helped millions of impoverished people by providing them with clean drinking water.<eos> Or is he infecting us with it?
No, I'm in charge, okay?<eos> I'm in charge.<eos> I know my rights.<eos> I don't have to stay here if I don't want to stay here.<eos> That's very true, but you're not going to get far on that leg without ortho taking care of it.
Not too many people get a second shot, but here we are, we got one.<eos> Roll strong.<eos> Roll true.<eos> Why is that fool talking to his ball?<eos> He's not gonna do something freaky with it, is he?
Were the boys out front?<eos> Did they find the person who did it?<eos> No.<eos> The boys found your gun.<eos> They were playing with it.
What kind of a husband are you?<eos> Doesn't your blood boil watching Shaina in my arms?<eos> Don't you get angry?<eos> Do you know what I would've done?<eos> I would've picked up this lamp and hit it hard on my wife's head.
Come on, Rehaan.<eos> I know you wanna do it.<eos> Come on, lift this lamp, hit it on her head.<eos> Come on, you fucking coward.<eos> Pick up this lamp and hit it on your wife's head.
- There's three of us.<eos> --...our executioner.<eos> Listen to the mad words of a wise man.<eos> "What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...<eos> The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
Air masks.<eos> They need gas masks. You ready?<eos> Is it painless?<eos> It's quick.<eos> "The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Wow, I can't wait to hear this.<eos> Let me guess, you're a human trafficker.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're an assassin.<eos> I lost a lot of money in a very bad deal, okay?<eos> Back when Andre was managing it.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe. I mean, hypothetically.<eos> Uh-huh. Well, what about the gun?<eos> Wouldn't it be at the scene?<eos> I mean, it's not like he came waltzing in here carrying it.
Why do I look like your daughter?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's the truth, Yala. It's not good enough.<eos> The truth often isn't, but that does not make it a lie.<eos> The Quad has one narrow chance of being saved, and right now, we are it.
You just said he planted the same kind of device.<eos> And with very good reason.<eos> One I'm not inclined to disclose at the moment.<eos> Have it your way.<eos> If I had a white flag, I would wave it.
I would be given the chance of a fair trial.<eos> What would you do with your freedom, Niska?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Isn't that the point of freedom?<eos> You can do anything with it.
Until then, I say this...<eos> get a handle on your people.<eos> If you can't and you really fear rioting, I will not hesitate to use the full force of our armed forces to maintain order in this country.<eos> Now, I have a job to do, and so do you.<eos> As your president, I advise all of you to get to it.
Since when?<eos> Phoenix.<eos> It happened right after his mother died.<eos> Stavo and his best friend, Kyle... somehow, they got a hold of my gun.<eos> They were messing around with it and it went off.
_<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> And how did Gaviria take Pablo's offer?<eos> I think it's safe to say that he didn't really care for it.
I'm here to ask you one question.<eos> Are you sure it was an accident?<eos> Shh! Mommy's coming, sweet pea.<eos> You like this rattle, don't you, little one?<eos> My mother used to use it to soothe me.
You're off the investigation.<eos> Whoa, you can't do that.<eos> This is... this is my case.<eos> No, this is my case.<eos> The detectives who work it serve under the discretion of the crown prosecution, and I no longer require your services.
Sometimes a purge is necessary to fix what's broken.<eos> Don't pretend this was about ideology.<eos> You did this for a payday.<eos> Mac, did you ever ask yourself why our government wants that weapon?<eos> What are they planning on doing with it?
Put your weapons on the floor.<eos> We're... we're leaving the store.<eos> You can have the whole thing to yourself.<eos> We only want the tetracycline.<eos> We'll split it with you.
I hate him.<eos> He was still your father, Kurt.<eos> And you're still using the present tense.<eos> My hate is not going anywhere.<eos> That's because you're not dealing with it.
No!<eos> Even for the Mafia, that's pretty low.<eos> I stole the bike, by the way, in five minutes this place is gonna be swarming with cops.<eos> Let them go and this will work out.<eos> You have the book, you can do whatever you want with it.
A little bit, but he said he'd do a lot more if I didn't phone you right away.<eos> He did point the gun nozzle...<eos> You know, I know it's not "nozzle," but I can't think of the word right now.<eos> I wanna say barrel?<eos> You know, it's not coming to me, but he's got it pointed at the back of my head right now, so if you can imagine that... that's what's happening, and that's why I'm calling you.
Eleanor, I have kids.<eos> I have three beautiful children...<eos> Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip.<eos> Look at Tyler.<eos> Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ.
But none of this makes me your killer.<eos> When you were apprehended last night, your behaviour and your attire matched the witnesses' description.<eos> Yes, but why would I steal from myself?<eos> The Guarana, my formulation, somebody took it.<eos> Whoever stole it could have imbibed it.
I can't hold nearly 1,700 hostages, including world leaders.<eos> One of the terrorists could be hiding with them... or more.<eos> That's why I said "interview."<eos> You told us this trade was a trap.<eos> It wasn't.
For dredging the lakes.<eos> Why don't you go get us a table, Sophie?<eos> Okay.<eos> Any chance of getting that doll back?<eos> I really underestimated how strong my feelings for it were.
I guess we're scrubbing down our bathroom later.<eos> We're heading out.<eos> It's almost 8:00.<eos> Here's my last bag of cacao.<eos> I can't do anything with it, not with my cholesterol.
Just got married.<eos> Spent his honeymoon with me here training for an op.<eos> Nonstop sacrifice.<eos> Commander, there is something I need to know.<eos> Admiral Chernow has great confidence in the operation, but you're the one who has to lead it.
I struggle with that myself.<eos> But your family tried to frame you for murder.<eos> They know you're sick, they know how long you have, and they know you won't make bail.<eos> But they're prepared for you to spend the rest of whatever life you have left in a cell, away from your wife and daughter.<eos> Loyalty is a noble value, but you can't let it blind you, and when it counted, those people weren't there for you.
See, you're a technician.<eos> You're an operative.<eos> An instrument of a larger plan.<eos> I, on the other hand, I'm a strategist.<eos> You whip that can at me, and I'll catch it but only because I calculated the risk that someone might throw it in advance.
Or are you in a hurry to find out where you spirit goes next?<eos> The tatts were like a medal of honour... for taking a life.<eos> The first noble truth of life is suffering.<eos> To live, you must endure.<eos> I can't escape the past, but... I can't live with it either.
But that's not the mirror you enchanted.<eos> This is.<eos> You switched them.<eos> Anything you can dream up, I've already dreamt it.<eos> Oh, I hope you're proud of your handiwork, because you're going to enjoy it... for the rest of your life.
About nine billion in sales.<eos> That's a lot of votes for Reynolds or Evans.<eos> Listen, I appreciate this doesn't jive with your new foreign policy.<eos> Our new policy was never about short-term strategic gains.<eos> We designed it to rock the boat.
He's been suspended...<eos> - What?<eos> - Aw, come on!<eos> For one shift.<eos> And we got a job to do and we're gonna do it. Okay?
You know that.<eos> We need to find a way to fortify it, get those Marines inside.<eos> All right.<eos> Good, truck's still there.<eos> We can use it to strike through the gate.
These are the good times, but in just a few months, all this fresh growth will be gone, and the animals will be forced to move on.<eos> That is the way things are on grasslands across the planet.<eos> A cycle of abundance, destruction and rebirth that affects every creature that lives here.<eos> The largest grassland on Earth, the vast Eurasian Steppe, stretches one third of the way around our planet.<eos> Spring rain has brought fresh grass, and with it, new life.
So, no one's gonna tell me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.<eos> Well, I'd like that, too.<eos> In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.
Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.<eos> Well, I'd like that, too.<eos> In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.<eos> You promise?<eos> I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
East Germany.<eos> After World War II, it falls into the hands of the Russians.<eos> Sixteen million free citizens suddenly become inmates under the heel of the military and the Stasi secret police.<eos> The only way to the west is through the death strip... a border zone covered with searchlights, trip wires, booby traps and armed troops.<eos> In 1978, Günter Wetzel and Peter Strelzyk decide that instead of trying to go through the death strip, they'll go over it.
I wouldn't be surprised, Mr. Randolph.<eos> Would you like to say grace, Gilly?<eos> Mrs. Trotter, it would be my pleasure to pass a blessing on this bountiful feast.<eos> Well, thank you, Mr. Randolph.<eos> Dear lord, we thank you for this most bountiful feast, and for the gift and privilege to share it with the newest addition to our family.
Why? Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?<eos> Did he kill her?<eos> Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Who's number one in your brain? - No. Get out.<eos> This guy is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, you've gotta pull it together, okay?<eos> Toby Tucker is gonna play you a song, and you're gonna love it.
Better?<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So here's the song.<eos> - Be gentle. I'm still working on it, so...
I don't know exactly how to rhyme that.<eos> - Oh, no. It's so good, though.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I think it's great.<eos> I mean, I've been working on it for a little bit, so...
But you said Paula was the only one who could kill him.<eos> And she just died.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is why we need to nominate a new final girl.<eos> And I'm willing to be it.
And I said I was tired, and he said,<eos> "Hey, I'm too pretty to turn down."<eos> And he pulled me inside and...<eos> We get to his suite,<eos> I said, "Where's the party?" And he says, "You're it."
You're not leaving. I kind of have to.<eos> No, no, you kind of can't.<eos> Yeah why not?<eos> Uh... well because... I am using your flashlight for my turn.<eos> OK fine. But, please, please be careful with it.
- Stupid.<eos> Yo, Chris, I don't understand.<eos> And you seem to have no interest in telling me the truth, so why should I believe a word that you say?<eos> Sometimes the truth isn't believable.<eos> That doesn't mean that it's not true.
What did you think of it?<eos> I thought it was beautiful.<eos> And incredibly sad.<eos> No, not sad.<eos> What do you think I should do with it?
Do you imagine my aunt would have written those words if she knew what was to come?<eos> Do you?<eos> The looting of her home, the murder of her people.<eos> Our decision is nonnegotiable.<eos> If you don't agree with it, your only option is to pursue the case in court.
- Get the fire extinguisher!<eos> - Oh, my God. My car!<eos> - So, what's with the backpack?<eos> - I'm reducing the width of frame so the machine can fit inside a 22-by-14-inch backpack.<eos> So we could just walk around with it?
Who are you?<eos> You got a sword in your hand.<eos> Not to mention body armour, anger sparks flying from your eyes.<eos> I am not asking about this mask of yours!<eos> I want to know the one that is hidden beyond it.
to give us a glimpse into the divine<eos> And though the sane may deny we gazed through God's eyes and claim it was just some misfiring synapses flashing through a crack in our minds we all knew it was true we all knew we shared a view into something just too beautiful to prove<eos> and they can't take that away from me and you<eos> Even when the seasons change, summer exceeds its stay, the sun creeps away and fall shadows grab hold of your brain and you can feel your will within each withering leaf clinging to the trees of the entire forest<eos> surrounding you slipping as they fall down on you and then when Winter rolls around, your soul retreats deep beneath the frozen ground and it's calling your body down and it feels like your ashes are fighting gravity even then, Spring will come again
More wealth means more crime.<eos> We're like Cyclops and his wife - can't always keep an eye on her.<eos> Truth is, we're understaffed - and insanely busy.<eos> - You're right<eos> Hongkong's crime rate is going up. It seems pretty lawless.
So?<eos> So, the dude's old school Mafia.<eos> Okay. You guys know my buddy Tim?<eos> Well, his friend Dave asked her to the sophomore-junior semiformal. All right?<eos> Well, he found out, went to the dude's house, ripped out his mailbox and fucking beat him half to death with it in front of his whole family.
- Keep going!<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> Okay, so do you know what a dirty DJ is?<eos> - No. - You don't?<eos> Okay, great. Okay, so the biggest misconception that guys have about the clitoris, if they can find it, is that they're too nice to it. Okay, that's the problem.
Maybe they're good, maybe they're bad, but to call them persons is kind of outrageous.<eos> So they got personal rights back about a century ago, and that extended through the 20th century.<eos> They gave corporations rights way beyond what persons have.<eos> So if, say, general motors invests in Mexico, they get national rights, the rights of the Mexican business.<eos> While the notion of person was expanded to include corporations, it was also restricted.
Where there's no love, you feel empty or rather, I feel empty.<eos> Love...<eos> Love is what fills the soul.<eos> You have to take love one day at a time.<eos> You live it every day.
We are all pan of that faith.<eos> All religions are born from this faith...<eos> And will one day be swallowed by it.<eos> All religions are tied together by this faith...<eos> And must bow down to it!
- You should be.<eos> I think of it as a healthy fear.<eos> She has a way of getting what she wants.<eos> Did she talk to you about the tour yet?<eos> What about it?
- It's the whore's share, isn'it?<eos> - It is. Resistance to the idea of formalizing her interest in writing.<eos> It's the second of the two issues I find more troubling.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - You. It would appear that while the crew seems able to forgive or at least forget my part in the Mr. Hamund situation, they are aware that you were the prime mover behind it and they are less willing to forgive it or forget it in your case.
Shut up.<eos> Gustav, shoes.<eos> Go on.<eos> - And your hoodie.<eos> - What about it?
Did you come specially for this?<eos> I also wanted to say sorry for all the complaints that I made you write.<eos> I've realized what true love is.<eos> The Prince went to his sisters' house to make amends, for my sake.<eos> If that isn't true love, then what else is it?
You can't get rid of me that easy.<eos> It's time we stand up and take back our lives.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> I've been dreaming for this moment way too long.<eos> Chi is a universal life force, flowing through all matter, organic and inorganic, but when one is able to control this chi, he can use it to activate inanimate objects.
Yeah, we can just go work on our apps.<eos> Sorry, I'm not going to go work for Hooli.<eos> Same for me, except for the pan about being sorry.<eos> And this buyout sucks.<eos> I'll have nothing to do with it.
You and I know it's a big lie.<eos> Lies are necessary... when the truth is too difficult to believe. Right?<eos> It wasn't a fucking surrender.<eos> Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.<eos> He was escaping it. And all anyone could do was watch.
She is happy.<eos> You and I...<eos> We have survived, so far.<eos> What would you suggest, Stephen?<eos> We should accept our position... .. and be thankful for it.
You're not fine.<eos> It's only been three days since...<eos> You can't ignore your grief.<eos> You have to deal with Philip's death.<eos> Jorge dealt with it.
Jules.<eos> Questions of motive don't even enter into it, do they?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a profound psychosis.<eos> I mean, he takes the chopping block And he smashes it down on Stoddart's head.
It was Beyoncé to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Glad you found it to be affecting.<eos> I did. I was very affected.<eos> I didn't really have as much time to work on it as I would've liked 'cause I got sucked into writing this stupid book.
I'm gonna park right here.<eos> I don't think you wanna be doing that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What are you gonna do, you got a poop-filled diaper in there?<eos> You gonna throw it at me?
Follow every request and instruction.<eos> There is no standard here.<eos> No books full of journalistic laws, no written codes.<eos> There is just opinion.<eos> And we have to sway it.
I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.<eos> I did.<eos> I-I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.<eos> Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.<eos> I do, and you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
All right, here's what's gonna happen:<eos> Those two cops out there are from Philadelphia.<eos> They've come a long way to see me.<eos> When they come in here, we're all gonna have a little chat.<eos> When it's over, the young one who's been writing in his little notebook he's gonna take it and put it in his jacket, and when he does that I want you to take that coffee and spill it on him.
But if you go to the IA, if you even look like you're going...<eos> He had a wife.<eos> A kid.<eos> Responsibilities.<eos> Take the money, do something good with it.
They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.<eos> I know what it's like to lose the people you love.<eos> I know this is hard for you.<eos> But winter is coming.<eos> We know what's coming with it.
The summer revue didn't do well, I can tell you.<eos> They're all crazy at that sanatorium.<eos> If you have any family elsewhere, then visit them instead.<eos> You should get off this island.<eos> It's dying. People who stay here, die with it.
Yes, it is.<eos> And what does the document pertain to?<eos> This is Max's proposal for the app.<eos> Which I rejected.<eos> And if you rejected the proposal then wouldn't Max be free to take it somewhere else?
If you want a boyfriend or you're looking for love, I'm a bad bet.<eos> ~ Did someone break your heart?<eos> ~ I mean it. I've got nothing to give.<eos> I'm not in the market for love.<eos> More trouble than it's worth.
Up for your first mission?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Mythology states even the ancients have an Achilles heel.<eos> So we find out what it is and we take them down. Let's go.
You didn't call.<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> You will now have a passage from Maureen's first Victoria book read by Heather Mitchell, president of the Victoria of the True North Festival committee.<eos> "Victoria had always been aware, ever since her first memories, that she was very near to a world of deviant morality.<eos> But sometimes, just for a moment, her loved ones neared it, and she caught a glimpse, of the bewitching world beyond, and she knew that it would be her life's work... to keep herself and others from it."
No, his stuff's still in there. I looked.<eos> Does your duck have a name?<eos> It's a duck, Christian. Why would it have a name?<eos> What, so you're just going to keep saying 'it'?<eos> Yeah, or 'you' when I'm talking to it.
In a dream, that might be something I would do.<eos> By law, I owe you nothing.<eos> What is that?<eos> Apparently, it's the actual amount of steel that was delivered to the new Knick on March 4, 1901.<eos> I'm assuming that somewhere in this building there's a document claiming that the delivery was much greater, as was the amount that you required the hospital to pay for it.
I'm sure yours will still suffice.<eos> For what?<eos> Carr needs surgery.<eos> Umbilical hernia.<eos> Had it for years, but I need to have it taken care of.
I watched him turn.<eos> Where do you think it goes?<eos> When they come back...<eos> That goodness in people.<eos> What do you think happens to it?
I think it is so brave of you two, forging ahead with a song that's clearly arranged as a trio.<eos> Especially with all the money for Fancie's on the line.<eos> Well, that's us.<eos> Very, very brave.<eos> Lemon, I don't want to see you lose your restaurant and all your hopes and your dreams along with it.
What's your problem?<eos> I want to go back to school.<eos> Nursing school.<eos> What a great idea, AnnaBeth.<eos> Yeah... but I don't know how I'm gonna pay for it.
We just got started.<eos> And the lab just finished.<eos> The heroin that you seized from the Dominican's loft was pure, uncut and a completely different type than in the fourth-grader's backpack.<eos> You caught a bad guy, just not the right bad guy.<eos> I don't know where you got that heroin or what the hell you planned on doing with it.
Expectations are high.<eos> Pray God we don't disappoint them. Aye.<eos> A pleasant change - to see a mine opening!<eos> For how long, I wonder?<eos> My friends, when my father closed this mine 20 years ago, he little thought it would have a future.
You increased security.<eos> I was paranoid about your brother.<eos> Before I got to know him.<eos> Dutch... if you have any business that you need squared away...<eos> I'll square it away.
Do I even want to know how you're accessing this shit?<eos> I used my dad's old captain's clearance for the requisition.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yesterday, Bolger receives a package.<eos> The FedEx guy doesn't know what to do with it.
I mean, I guess I have to eventually find a new job, but, honestly, Carmel paid so well that we have enough savings to last a few months, so I can figure things out.<eos> (Sighs)<eos> I am honestly so proud of what you guys are doing here. And if I ever doubted that there needed to be somebody out there to balance out the evil empire of Vocal Adrenaline, I am a true believer now.<eos> Well, there is a job.<eos> It doesn't really pay much.
(Sighs)<eos> I am honestly so proud of what you guys are doing here. And if I ever doubted that there needed to be somebody out there to balance out the evil empire of Vocal Adrenaline, I am a true believer now.<eos> Well, there is a job.<eos> It doesn't really pay much.<eos> Actually, it doesn't pay anything at all, but, well, Kurt and I were wondering if-if you had the time, or if you would even consider being the special alumni consultant for the New Directions! ?
- We both know...<eos> - Shut your fucking mouth!<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> We need to own our truth.<eos> Live it.
Sean. I had to... I-I had to keep going, though.<eos> A dam in Bordeaux... more casualties.<eos> And that's when I knew.<eos> These visions, they were giving me a roadmap to destruction.<eos> And for some reason, I was being asked to follow it.
Transfigured Night.<eos> You are just a face.<eos> A mask.<eos> An object, a thing.<eos> Behind it, there's nothing.
They must have nowhere to run.<eos> You're going to force them to take a stand.<eos> The best way to catch a scorpion is to crush it in its own garden, no?<eos> The Sicarii say this mountain is invisible.<eos> They believe their God pulled a curtain over it.
The thing is, Walt, with A.L.S., once the symptoms start, the life expectancy is maybe one to two years, and based off your symptoms, you've probably had it a while.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I can feel my leg now.<eos> - Look, I can move it.
And that heavy burden is a defense attorney's best weapon, and you got to milk it for all it's worth.<eos> About 10:00, I come through to light a candle for my wife, who passed last year.<eos> I come around this pew here, and I see father Bernard laying there with his head cracked open.<eos> You never seen so much blood.<eos> The wall was sprayed with it.
This is my fault.<eos> - Hey, man. This is on me, too.<eos> I shouldn't have left before...<eos> - This is no one's fault but mine.<eos> I earned the blame... I'm not interested in sharing it.
We have both put a great deal of effort and thought into how to handle Russia.<eos> I'd like for this to be a decision we make together, instead of an impulsive response--<eos> - Not right now. - Petrov's in the air.<eos> Get Admiral Dale on the line.<eos> Claire, I value your opinion. I just don't agree with it this time.
Go on.<eos> So, if Wells is as fast as you, what's he need a time machine for?<eos> Apparently he lost his speed when he killed my mom.<eos> He gets it back sometimes but only in spurts.<eos> He can't fully control it.
You know, I don't know what happened.<eos> When we were in law school together, I admired you.<eos> Oh, Stephen, don't give up on me completely.<eos> Besides, I gave them a clue...<eos> If they're smart enough to follow it.
It must be lanced like a sickness of the flesh, burned out before it corrupts completely.<eos> You mean that metaphorically, right?<eos> I wish I did.<eos> My weapon will end the Horseman and give me his power.<eos> With it,
Hey buddy, I'm talking to you.<eos> You want me to call the cops?<eos> Hey! I said this isn't a library.<eos> Pick up that coffee.<eos> Throw it in your face.
He'd have been brain-dead before he reached 12.<eos> His only hope was an experimental study using a virus to repair his damaged DNA.<eos> So you infected him?<eos> Wow!<eos> I wish I had a Mother of the Year award so I could bludgeon you with it.
Can we get you anything?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> See you.<eos> They're playing you.<eos> I know you want a family, but they're not it.
Without your efforts, I never would have met him, and none of this would have been possible.<eos> Don't claim victory just yet.<eos> There's another card left to play.<eos> Oh, the Lumen?<eos> Still chasing it after all these years.
- It was so long ago.<eos> He won it in a contest.<eos> He was very proud of that board.<eos> It got left behind when they sent him to Sylmar.<eos> Do you know what happened to it?
Solving a crime.<eos> That never really happened.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Too many open questions in this case.<eos> If the paint found on Aaron Brown's knuckles wasn't from the car, and yet, based on the clotting, it was sustained just before he died, where did the paint come from?
Probably back to Florida.<eos> -Okay. You take care, you hear?<eos> -Hey, wait a minute.<eos> - What about my career?<eos> - What about it?
It never changes.<eos> It's like a good song on repeat.<eos> Come here to escape your visions?<eos> You might've gone too far too fast back in New York.<eos> Hell of a hangover comes with magic, even if you're born to it.
That is the magic of madness.<eos> That is wild, cruel medieval magic.<eos> We cannot have fairy princes ruling England alongside generals, dukes and mill-owners.<eos> Such magic belongs to an England that is dead.<eos> And it is out of our control.
Bit of wind there. Ooh.<eos> Right.<eos> This is a... Kind of disgusting little workstation, isn't it?<eos> You see the toilet?<eos> It's basically a window.
Continue.<eos> I've made some inquires about you.<eos> I even spoke to Rogers' Indian before he vanished.<eos> Not only have you taken to the bayonet, but you're also renowned for your exotic fighting skill.<eos> Give me a weapon, I'll fight with it.
Yeah, I'm in here.<eos> Come and look at these pictures that Max developed. No, later, later.<eos> I'm just way too excited.<eos> I remembered what happened to my Reggie Jackson baseball.<eos> - Yeah. You remember Adam and Crosby used to play with it all the time, so I took it, and I put it in a shoe box, and I hid it up in the rafters in the old barn.
Unh! Arthur Strauss... where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> We saw you in the woods today wearing this mask.<eos> I wear it to chase off hikers, OK, keep them away from my setup.
He was.<eos> I used to think he was the only reason why I stayed in this town. I hated it here.<eos> And now I realize that so much of what I hated about it was in my past.<eos> And now... All I have is my future.<eos> That's the good thing about the future... It's what you make of it.
So maybe this was spontaneous.<eos> A crime of passion, committed by someone she knew.<eos> Or she might have been killed by a psychotic plumber lying in wait.<eos> Is that your Castle theory?<eos> Yeah. It needs work.
School board, you're surrounded.<eos> If this is about the bonfire, we'll put it out when the weather breaks.<eos> We come in peace.<eos> We've had our ups and downs, but as of right now.<eos> We love this school, and love what you're doing with it.
No, that's what you always do.<eos> That's not a real apology. Jeff?<eos> Abed, shut up.<eos> Go flashback and cut to stuff.<eos> And you, say you're sorry for buying a giant hand and letting it sit around until we had to deal with it, and say it without crying.
Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it.<eos> Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.
It feels like he doesn't take me seriously.<eos> So I'm wondering:<eos> Why do I work so hard? That deal in Hong Kong...<eos> - Let me guess...<eos> You've been working on it for three months.
But... the Ancients must now decide who is the greater threat... an old pawnbroker with a few confederates or the Master, backed by Palmer and his billions.<eos> One thing is certain. If the Master obtains the book, he will destroy us all.<eos> It seems we have no choice but to trust one another.<eos> I will obtain the book.<eos> After I've examined it, I'll turn it over to the Ancients.
We don't want anything from him.<eos> We could fire first once we're in range.<eos> The instant we fire, we give up our exact position.<eos> I know, sir, but what's the alternative?<eos> I'm working on it.
Take the day off, stay with me.<eos> With what money, motherfucker?<eos> So Daryll's deejaying tonight? So?<eos> So I saw his play list.<eos> What? What's wrong with it?
I was terrified.<eos> He always said that he would kill me rather than let me leave him.<eos> The only good thing i got from Ron was my baby.<eos> We moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, and he started writing "dianetics."<eos> The book was conceived and he started working on it in 1950.
Not sure if that's helpful.<eos> Well, maybe it is.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he is stealing blood from a corpse.<eos> He's got to be doing something weird with it.
Well, you know, I just did.<eos> We're setting the bar too high right now.<eos> Let's use Gerald McCoy's contract as our measuring stick.<eos> Okay, here's my measuring stick.<eos> I'm swingin' it over here so he can see it.
And if it's not? You're still on mission?<eos> I wish we never triggered that beacon.<eos> I was out, Walking a new path with you.<eos> You can't always run from your past.<eos> Sometimes you have to confront it head on.
- Hey.<eos> Um, question ...<eos> What would you do if I dropped a piece of pizza on this gift couch you were gonna give me?<eos> Well, that's not even a challenge.<eos> I'd take a bit of baking soda. I would sprinkle it on the stain. I'd make sure the stain was completely covered.
I can't believe I didn't listen to you sooner.<eos> I'm not sure what it is you think I said, but I am fairly certain that there's been a miscommunication.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> All the nagging that you did about how I should... change up my wardrobe, shake it up?
Psst, psst!<eos> Hey! Hey, what's up, mate?<eos> Oi.<eos> Your bloody camera is...<eos> I don't know what's happened to it there.
Oh, wow, yeah.<eos> Doesn't everyone?<eos> What's your plan for that ketch?<eos> - The boat? - Mm-hmm.<eos> To give it to the nice man I met at the bar... If he promises to take care of it.
Listen, this is a great house.<eos> You should buy it. But whatever you do, turn this room into a den.<eos> When you have a home office, you use it.<eos> You come home, you barely have dinner, and you keep working.<eos> You bring work home, and your wife starts to resent it, resent you.
Great!<eos> I'm gonna get a latte.<eos> See you!<eos> So st. Caroline keeps her halo Even with no humanity.<eos> Yeah, until she snaps and strangles somebody with it.
You're just saying that because you can't change what you are.<eos> No, Damon.<eos> I don't care what human me would have done because she's not here.<eos> And if the past is a place without you and me together, then...<eos> Let's stop living in it.
Has anybody said anything at the Rezidentura? No.<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Not for me.<eos> How's your head?<eos> It's felt better.
I don't need it anymore.<eos> So what do you have planned for the rest of the day?<eos> A video conference with the Palmer Tech board, who still question whether I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.<eos> Hey, how'd you like the company back as an early Christmas gift?<eos> You're doing a better job of running it than I would.
Except for that spring in eighth grade when I became a woman.<eos> You really were a great athlete.<eos> Why don't you help Henry?<eos> You know, train him.<eos> That's perfect, 'cause I had a free hour next month, and I didn't know what to do with it.
Yeah, well I can't allow them to affect me, because I have so many more to take.<eos> We're less than a week out from the edge of colonized space, out of the reach of the Galactic Authority.<eos> We can afford to stop running.<eos> Look, unlike you, I'm not trying to escape my past.<eos> I've chosen to embrace it.
When he offered me money to answer the phones, I assumed I'd get a check every week. Instead, he sent cash.<eos> It was like he didn't want there to be a paper trail.<eos> Did you get paid recently?<eos> Yeah, I got an envelope a couple days ago.<eos> I was gonna bring it to the bank at lunch.
So I control them.<eos> It's too late.<eos> They already have weapons.<eos> And this revolt will never succeed.<eos> Rome will crush it and crush us with it.
- Take him alive.<eos> I got him.<eos> Son, what you got in that pouch?<eos> Well, this is getting mighty old.<eos> Elwood, you had best set your mind to hold this ground, or we will all be buried beneath it.
You're in the NSA now.<eos> Take a look around, huh?<eos> See whether you think it's a hoax.<eos> _<eos> I don't mind sharing my caseload. I mind sharing it with someone who's not up to the task.
Duck!<eos> Gracious, is that a pajama top?<eos> Well, what is a pajama top, John?<eos> I mean, if you fall asleep in that shirt, does it become a pajama top?<eos> And then can it ever not be a pajama top once it is...
We got... we got to keep the door open. The door has to be open to get the trickster back.<eos> So one of us just stays here and keeps telling the truth.<eos> Have fun, Cassandra.<eos> No, no, it doesn't work that way.<eos> The truth only works if you share it.
'Cause all the Library does is lock up magic and try to tell people that it doesn't exist, when we could be a place where people like Lucy can come for answers and knowledge and... and training.<eos> That's not what the Library does.<eos> Yes. Thank you, Colonel.<eos> You're not right, either! Magic is out there!<eos> More and more regular people are coming into contact with it.
Ah. Thank you.<eos> I was just making progress there.<eos> I just found the same cologne upstairs in the guest bedroom that I smelled on both dead bodies.<eos> - Does Deshu wear that cologne? - Well, I mean,<eos> I don't think he had it on tonight.
(scoffs) You could be teaching your ethics class to a group of future military leaders.<eos> NSA work you did... you were good at it.<eos> You can't tell me you don't miss it.<eos> Is the teaching position a cover for intelligence work?<eos> It would be a real job, but I can't say what may or may not come up around it.
I mean, I guess you can, but I-I didn't want to be one of those guys who gets too into miniatures.<eos> My God, Stan.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> See that dam?<eos> There's a lake behind it where we get our drinking water -- my secret blend of half dasani, half downstairs bathroom.
Oh, fairies are mythological creatures, madam.<eos> Mythological?<eos> I meant to say that they do not.<eos> They did not exist in the way the stories have them.<eos> They're a poisonous race, their help is always regretted, it is always a heavy price.
I'm devastated.<eos> I always felt a certain internal chemistry with you.<eos> Shut up.<eos> The Ridge is a couple of clicks north.<eos> There's a back road, but it's kind of overgrown, hard to navigate unless you know it.
I never once felt remorse for the things I've done or took any of the help that was on offer for me.<eos> And I know... I know this meeting is primarily about this case and this sentence, if you look at what I've achieved in here for the past four years,<eos> I hope you can see massive changes I've made to the way I was in the past.<eos> You see, the past does matter.<eos> It kind of shapes the future if we face it.
There's no conserving their tyres, there's no looking after the fuel consumption, there are no stewards with moustaches going,<eos> "Oh, no, you've bumped into him, "you've got to spend ten seconds on the naughty step."<eos> I tell you what Formula One is -<eos> Formula One is like having some money and putting in an ISA so that it matures in a tax-free way.<eos> Rallycross is like having some money and going to the pub with it.
You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention now anything you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> Do you understand the charge?<eos> Yes. (SIGHS) I remember the assault.<eos> He was devastated by it.
- But all the answers are right here.<eos> Growing up, I never understood my father, and now... now I understand him even less.<eos> You know, when I was... 12, he asked me if I wanted to buy his soul.<eos> Who says that to a 12-year-old?<eos> More importantly, what does that even mean? - How much did he want for it?
Why can't you be more like your brother?<eos> You know what?<eos> Okay, I have to go practice my surprise face.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I gotta work on it.
You know what?<eos> Okay, I have to go practice my surprise face.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I gotta work on it.<eos> I'll work on it.
I don't know Delaware as well as you do, Congressman, but I do know that Selbyville is less than 10 Miles from the Atlantic ocean.<eos> It gets hot there in the summers, humid.<eos> There was no air-conditioning in Lisa Hoffman's basement, and there's no rust on this gun.<eos> Those ballistics shouldn't have been a perfect match, but they were, which means the gun wasn't sitting in that basement for 15 years.<eos> Someone kept it. Someone took care of it. And someone planted it in Lisa Hoffman's house for my people to find.
The court stenographer, Fay... that's her name, Fay. She knits hideous scarves that I have to wear so I don't hurt her feelings. Fay was killed by a hit-and-run driver while walking her dog.<eos> Except she doesn't have a dog.<eos> Everyone who heard Jake's testimony... everyone who was in that court room... is dead now.<eos> Except for me. And you.<eos> And while I live for justice, I don't want to die for it.
You're never funny.<eos> Cyrus, don't bite the hand that helps you.<eos> Helps us?<eos> You call that stunt you pulled with the first lady help?<eos> That Grand Jury's sole purpose was to expose my organization and everyone with ties to it, including the president, including you... favor number one.
Michael has asked to say a few words.<eos> My mom tells a story.<eos> A lot of you have probably heard it.<eos> She says that there was water trickling down the stairs in our house.<eos> And when she followed it up, she saw that it was coming from the bathroom.
Sir, our closest surface vessel is the Navy minesweeper Kirkland.<eos> It can be at the site within 90 minutes.<eos> Tell the Russians they have two hours.<eos> Two hours for that sub to be gone.<eos> Or we take it out ourselves.
We've got the Russians' response.<eos> Two of their Kirov-class battle cruisers and three sister attack subs are on a direct course to Glacier Bay.<eos> Carrier Strike Group 11 out of Everett is on its way to intercept.<eos> Meantime, the sub hasn't budged<eos> The Kirkland's stationed directly over it, about to commence dropping depth charges.
She rejected you once again.<eos> So you killed her.<eos> It was an accident!<eos> I tried talking to her, but she was cleaning those stupid jars.<eos> So I took the champagne bottle, and I swung it to smash the jars, but she lunged out in front to protect them.
You're still weak.<eos> You're pathetic and afraid.<eos> You can punch that dome as many times as you need to,<eos> Junior.<eos> You're back under it.
The dome's surface is calcifying.<eos> Soon every living thing won't be able to breathe unless I can bring down the dome with Joe's help.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How is what's happening to the dome making you weaker?<eos> Because I'm connected to it.
So maybe it's time you got out in front of this.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> To do what?<eos> All of it.<eos> Buying the cab, driving it into that man.
Widow... puppy...<eos> Everyone's right here, Mani. Just thatmmy right and your left indicator is switched on, son<eos> Manimthere were drugs worth millions in the boot!<eos> Veer found those packets.<eos> I don't know what he did with it.
You fight so hard to get me to sign the dotted line...<eos> It's not my business.<eos> I'm not gonna bully you into this.<eos> It's your company.<eos> You should decide what happens to it.
That's gotta be it.<eos> That's gotta be the fucking book.<eos> Where is that book?<eos> It's right there.<eos> Jocelyn was flipping out about it too.
Will you tell our advisors to make sure the interviewer doesn't stray from our script?<eos> I will see to it personally.<eos> Hello?<eos> 'Go to your vanity.<eos> Reach under it.
Police!<eos> No one's home, we're gonna have to come back with a warrant.<eos> - Yahtzee! - Oh, Lord.<eos> Oh, sorry, it's just that I got my seventh bid on a lamp.<eos> It's already at 350 bucks!
The grassy knoll.<eos> These guys represent the bystanders that were there when Kennedy's limo drove by.<eos> Relevance?<eos> The Zapruder film.<eos> In it, the bystanders on the lawn don't look at the limo after Kennedy is shot. Instead... they look beyond it.
You want me to get rid of this book?<eos> - Fine, I'll get rid of it right now.<eos> - No!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You said you wanted me to have it, - so I'll do what I want with it.
In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> - Amen. - Amen. - Amen.<eos> Congratulations, Henry!<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was a treat, but we'll pay for it now if we don't get home to serve the breakfast.
I watch people.<eos> I watch what they do.<eos> And now... I'm afraid.<eos> There are places everywhere in this city where hostility is gathering.<eos> Fear is feeding on it.
I don't know that it is... certainly not for Suzanne.<eos> What?<eos> I-I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> It has to do with Odelle's wedding ring...<eos> What about it?
You've probably noticed a lot of this firm is about cooperation.<eos> We're a family here, and we like to work together.<eos> Now, I know you two are in competition, and competition is always a healthy thing, but I want you to work on this pro bono case together.<eos> The Brett Tatro case.<eos> I'm already deep into it, Ms. Lockhart.
Only a human hand can build a fire and tend a flame.<eos> Control is all.<eos> There is one power above all others, a divine power that comes with the greatest of responsibilities... That of life and death.<eos> The essence in all things is palpable to you.<eos> With it, you can give life or snatch it away.
No way I'd rattle your cage like that.<eos> I'll ask around.<eos> See what I can find out.<eos> And what about that other thing?<eos> I'm still working on it.
♪ Isn't-isn't she lovely. ♪ Hey, don't worry. I'll be ready when we set sail.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, Carl, um...<eos> You remember when you were picking players for the precinct softball team, and when you didn't pick me, you asked me to take it like a man?<eos> That was right before you ripped up home plate and threw it at my head.
He almost got killed because of you.<eos> This has got nothing to do with Eddie or you.<eos> Well, it's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?<eos> I heard you asking about a truck.<eos> You tryin' to follow it?
I got a buddy on Tanner's team.<eos> I'll make a call.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I've got one good arm.<eos> I'll use it to dial.
He's chasing down one last lead on the monolith.<eos> He's had a lot of last leads. I know.<eos> - With him, I... I just try to...<eos> - We all do.<eos> But I'd rather have him with his head in the game than banging it against a wall.
Want to tell me why you're not speaking to me?<eos> Because...<eos> You're not supposed to see the bride on the wedding day.<eos> So, are we gonna do this or what?<eos> I asked for the ring back because I paid for it, not as a meaningful gesture of any kind.
I just got the X-rays back.<eos> Could any of this have been done with a weapon?<eos> Maybe, but from the bruising, I'm guessing the killer used his hands and feet.<eos> There's at least six points of contact.<eos> Her face looks like it was bashed into the floor.
You can't!<eos> It's the Darkness.<eos> It's tricking you.<eos> Your wings aren't back.<eos> Get back, or I'll fly away with it.
We are in agreement.<eos> Atlantis must be ruled by consent, not brutality.<eos> Then you have my support.<eos> The army will not oppose us?<eos> Not while I command it.
Perfect.<eos> Angle out.<eos> Elbow out.<eos> Don't cock that left hand.<eos> Just throw it.
- Don't. - .. because I want you to know that if this is the last night,<eos> Not everything can be avoided.<eos> Not forever.<eos> But you're you.<eos> There's always a loophole, you wait until the last minute - and then you spring it on me.
Hi, everyone.<eos> I'm so sorry for being late.<eos> I just wanted to thank you all for coming out today to support Lily and Toby.<eos> And a special thank you to Bay for pinch-hitting as hostess.<eos> I didn't have time to write out my advice, so I'll just share it quickly. Um...
I'll get it.<eos> you need to be a little careful.<eos> Can it break?<eos> Yes, it's old.<eos> Your dad had it when he was little.
Weakness is following others blindly.<eos> Learned that the hard way.<eos> I'm not asking you to follow.<eos> I'm asking you to lead!<eos> I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, yes, but I'd hoped that I'd find someone to seize it with me.
There is a feed.<eos> Wireless.<eos> These images are being stored by someone. Collated.<eos> Nagata, look at this footage.<eos> What's wrong with it?
Wireless.<eos> These images are being stored by someone. Collated.<eos> Nagata, look at this footage.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> What's wrong with it?
I wouldn't have the helm if it wasn't for you.<eos> We couldn't let our queen fall.<eos> After all this... you still want me to be your queen?<eos> You were willing to give up your crown for the good of the kingdom, give up your life to get that helm.<eos> I only ever saw one person make a sacrifice like that, and it was your father.
Professor Stein, can you hear me?<eos> 2 YEARS AGO<eos> Everyone secretly thinks they've figured out what their life is gonna be like, but what no one ever considers is that life has its own plans for you, whether you like them or not.<eos> And so you're left with a choice.<eos> You can either embrace the change and move forward, or fight it, and be left behind.
There's a litigation for faulty construction, bad land deals.<eos> That happens to every major corporation, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, but the corporation's not named as defendant.<eos> It's Arthur personally, and this Malawi deal.<eos> Something's not right about it.
Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available, I would greet that with skepticism.<eos> No, no, no, my point is that you need to let Chris find his own path.<eos> Oh, my God, you're right, Brian.<eos> He needs to be pointed to a very specific path.<eos> And then forced to go down it.
Punish me.<eos> Do you remember when you broke my grandmother's vase?<eos> What?<eos> You were young, 10 maybe.<eos> You denied it, even when your father Made you cut a switch from the yard, Even when he beat you with it until you were bloody.
Okay, I'll read the whole story.<eos> Did you get a book?<eos> I did.<eos> One that someone very special introduced me to.<eos> Now I want to share it with someone new...
'You must be clearer.<eos> 'I'll go to America.<eos> 'You will destroy your research?<eos> 'I'll destroy it.<eos> 'You'll never work on it again?
'I'll go to America.<eos> 'You will destroy your research?<eos> 'I'll destroy it.<eos> 'You'll never work on it again?<eos> 'I'll never work on it again.
I was born an ealdorman of England... Uhtred, son of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, welcome to the Christian world.<eos> ...true heir to the Northumbrian lands of Bebbanburg.<eos> You have your stone, the amber?<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> Our ancestors took this land, and you will die for it if needed.
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Now that you've done this, you're a monster!<eos> I won't win his case 'cause I'm not taking it.
- I'm gonna do it.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> - I'm gonna move my head.<eos> - Negatory.<eos> - I'm gonna move it right now.
They only sold 34 downloads because there was a competing app that was way more popular.<eos> So basically, our target knocked off a cheap and unpopular knock-off.<eos> Which is good for us.<eos> Our target has to be one of the 34 people who downloaded that app.<eos> He had to pay for it somehow.
And there was this, uh, duffel bag.<eos> Must've gotten thrown from one of the cars, I guess.<eos> It was full of cash.<eos> Let me guess. You kept it.<eos> We split it up.
Uncle Jared was cremated. Daddy's looking for his ashes.<eos> Really, do we have to explain something like that to her?<eos> Do you have to do that?<eos> Death isn't something to be shied away from, Booth.<eos> From an anthropological standpoint, the more openly a culture embraces death, the less anxiety they associate with it.
Who used it?<eos> Murugan did it, sir.<eos> Come here, my darling!<eos> You held the weapon?<eos> Yes, sir. What did you do with it?
Turn one against the other.<eos> No, but see, even if I can pull that off, that leaves one heavily armed dude still standing.<eos> You have a weapon, too.<eos> Remember the way that Cameron was talking about NZT?<eos> If he knew you had a pill, he'd be dying to take it.
I've given the last 20 years of my life to this orchestra.<eos> You think you musicians are the only people who live and breathe music? You're not!<eos> Listen, listen, let's you and I get together.<eos> We'll have a coffee, and we'll figure this out.<eos> If I had coffee with you right now, I just may throw it in your face. Good-bye.
But they won't find out.<eos> Not if you don't say anything.<eos> How long did you really think you were gonna keep this a secret?<eos> You mean without your help?<eos> Or with it?
If you continue to harass me or anyone I care about, I promise, this won't end well for you.<eos> Now, can anyone in the class tell me what that is?<eos> Why, it's motive, mr. Cavanaugh!<eos> He left the message one hour before regina was killed.<eos> If this case were any easier, I'd have slept with it in college.
Rafael's sister? She's the one who impregnated you?<eos> I think the word that you're looking for is... "What?"<eos> Well, that's just the craziest story I have ever heard.<eos> Yeah. And definitely your first novel.<eos> I know a publisher who would love it.
Who are you? Anthony Edward Dudewitz.<eos> And what this... engineer is suggesting - is complete balderdash. - If you don't mind,<eos> Mr. Dudewitz...<eos> I do mind. I do mind mediocrity.<eos> It has a taint, like burned toast, and you stink of it.
- Good lad.<eos> Our little secret.<eos> Mr. Slauson arrived at the Peacock Hotel at 9:55 and promptly consumed a drink from his usual bottle of Dempsey's gin.<eos> - But it wasn't gin, it was poison.<eos> - It had to be.
- So you know it's bad?<eos> - No, I know it's an effective piece of propaganda.<eos> That's all.<eos> And why is it so effective?<eos> Because the majority of Americans only support abortion if they don't have to face the fact of it, if they don't have to hear the talk
- I'm okay. Help her.<eos> Listen to me carefully.<eos> You fractured your neck when you were thrown from the car.<eos> The paralysis you're feeling right now may not be permanent, but it's crucial that you don't move your head one inch.<eos> Lily, I need you to grab me something to support your mom's head on either side so she can't move it. Can you do that?
- Goodbye.<eos> - See you soon. Oh, Geoffrey, dear boy, do take care of yourself.<eos> - I will. - Oh, I nearly forgot.<eos> My music.<eos> Look after it for me.
Five-minute break.<eos> I sprung for the session.<eos> What else do you want?<eos> Release the song.<eos> I don't know what to do with it.
God created each in its place.<eos> He did not create a battle between them.<eos> He said, "I have created both of these things."<eos> You must live through the night.<eos> Don't battle with it.
So death comes as a reminder.<eos> It grab us and shakes us. Opens our eyes.<eos> And our focus is changed. Shifted, revised.<eos> To the finder of this book.<eos> This book change my life. So I wanted to share it with you.
No oxygen. No decay.<eos> There are perfect preserved Roman costumes out there... look, we go in there, take the drive shaft, make it clear and put it in to the engine.<eos> - We get this boat here off seabed.<eos> - This boat is dead.<eos> - We can not take it. - We are not going to sail it.

I could tell you about my recent customer service experience...<eos> - Changing Internet service providers.<eos> - I like that one.<eos> Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica?<eos> But it wasn't Monica. It was a total stranger.
I know I'm not good enough for you.<eos> But I'm not gonna spend my entire life proving that I am.<eos> You're a coward, you know that?<eos> You don't fight for love.<eos> You're terrified of it!
I have an axe back at the house.<eos> No, I saw it.<eos> - Can I ask you a question and you'll answer me honestly?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - When you saw that axe out in front of the house, was there a small part of you that thought I might kill you with it?
- Nothing gets to you.<eos> You radiate... self-confidence.<eos> And you don't?<eos> I wear a mask.<eos> It works with some people. Others see right through it.
I think so.<eos> Add them up.<eos> This transformation, it's like...<eos> It's like when you have an infection in your body.<eos> So he's fighting it off.
Fly?<eos> First the Tower of London, arr!<eos> The guards won't know what hit it<eos> We'll swoop right down and take the crown<eos> And the Crown Jewels with it
Rise and shine.<eos> - Morning, Mum.<eos> - How's the book going?<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah, I've been working really hard on it.
Or is he like you?<eos> On the desert frontier, one is alone.<eos> Relationships and comforts are debilitating.<eos> As you well know, it's a strange way of life, to build up a place, a country, a family.<eos> But one must embrace an idea and push ahead with it.
We've put all that tablet stuff behind us, Larry.<eos> It's old news.<eos> Besides, we really never knew anything about that old tablet.<eos> We just worked there.<eos> Something's up with it.
Guardian of Brooklyn.<eos> Yes. I actually live in Manhattan now.<eos> I know, but it doesn't sound as cool.<eos> Yeah. We would be very honored if you could take a look at the tablet.<eos> There's something happening with it. We don't understand what it is.
They spent about 40 years in the desert trying to escape.<eos> Yeah. We have dinner once a year and talk about it.<eos> It's a big deal for us.<eos> Listen, could you take a look at that tablet?<eos> There's something wrong with it.
I don't want Robbie to hit her or break her up for spare parts or something.<eos> What do you care?<eos> Robbie's long gone with that menace.<eos> Don't you listen when we talk?<eos> Who cares what he does with it?
I know this case.<eos> There won't be time for anyone to get their head around it.<eos> It's loaded, you know that.<eos> It has been from the start.<eos> All the more reason for one of the whisperers to have carriage of it.
Because you have pissed on and pissed off anyone and everyone who's ever given you one.<eos> You have taken a shit on all of it, Hank.<eos> - Books, movies, theater...<eos> - What about television?<eos> - What about it?
What, money don't spend?<eos> I can see your soul at the edges of your eyes.<eos> It's corrosive, like acid.<eos> You got a demon, little man, and I don't like your face.<eos> It makes me want to do things to it.
I'm likin' where this is goin'.<eos> I will come out and kill you!<eos> Hey.<eos> Ahh. I'm real sorry about your pyramid, G-man.<eos> I know you worked real hard on it.
Our planet, our society and we ourselves are stardust.<eos> Well, what is it that makes the atoms dance?<eos> How is the energy of a star transformed into everything that happens in the world?<eos> What is energy?<eos> We're awash in it.
If only you had a slightly milder disposition, you might actually have friends.<eos> I am his friend.<eos> Notice I use the singular.<eos> Yes, he means he can tolerate me.<eos> You may be Burkan the Great to your public, but to me, you'll always be little Howard Burkan, who took my favorite scarf, cut it in half with a pair of scissors, waved his magic wand over it, and it didn't come back together.
I'll never forget when you won that prize at graduation.<eos> Your professor told me your daughter's gonna be the next Patti Smith.<eos> - How's the album coming along?<eos> - It's good.<eos> Yeah, I was gonna work on it tonight.
The end result is nothing less than a masterpiece.<eos> The original production of Spoils of Babylon had a running time of 22 hours and was considered...<eos> Not quite done with that.<eos> And was considered too long for network television.<eos> Tonight's abbreviated version pales in comparison and yet in my humble opinion, it is far superior to anything on television today.
Of course, I did.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Yes, I remember seeing a condom.<eos> I just don't know, like, exactly what it did.
Suddenly... well, suddenly, it's a different song.<eos> In fact, you don't even know what the song really is until... - Yeah. - ...some time later when you kind of...<eos> Yeah, I know that feeling.<eos> ."Because of the ramifications of the edit.<eos> Once you've understood the song, it's no longer of much interest, and some of those...
It's actually beautiful.<eos> Tell me, how long would it take you to get tired of having a celebrity around?<eos> What, you come hereto finally sell me that truck, huh?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. I need to get rid of it.<eos> What's-what's wrong with it'?
No.<eos> I profile them so i can stop them.<eos> Have you always been comfortable with death?<eos> Why would you ask me that question?<eos> Because you picked a career where you wallow in it every day?
What did you take?<eos> It was like a drug payment or something.<eos> I don't know. Brantley's into a lot of shit, man.<eos> Look, I was just supposed to pick up the money from some guy in Eugene and run it back.<eos> - But you ran off with it instead.
That's Ok for me.<eos> For me too.<eos> --If it doesn't bother anyone, I'm in for the double.<eos> The double?<eos> I got plenty of cash around, I'm not gonna leave it in some bank.
- What's that?<eos> Should we worry about him comin' back, or I don't know..<eos> No, he's just, he's just weird.<eos> But I'm bringing my axe.<eos> And I'm gonna sleep with it in case your fuckin' dinner guest wants to come back for, you know, dessert or something.
You're backstage.<eos> Miss, this is Dani Kakwani.<eos> Martha Costello.<eos> The, er... Arizona bombing.<eos> What about it?
See you.<eos> Marguerite!<eos> Marguerite, you know, the sweet corn from the market? Yeah.<eos> I'm finding it quite tough, dense.<eos> Do you know what, I should do with it?
Ramiissaved. -Thepizzasarepaid.<eos> Yes? - You do not remember.<eos> Alex, you've slain the parrot?<eos> - No, that was Greenpeace.<eos> What happened to it?
But I suppose I'm not like other women, really.<eos> No.<eos> You're a nurse, and a midwife.<eos> 'Cystic fibrosis was, and remains, a serious, 'lifelong condition.<eos> Ian and Martin Vickers were 'among the first to know its name, and to stand and fight it, 'with their families by their sides.
You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world--<eos> Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?<eos> He didn't decide to kill her.<eos> He was an infant.<eos> A disease doesn't decide to kill you. All the same, you cut it out before it does.
You have a challenger.<eos> But he's not a Red Guard.<eos> I've just commissioned him.<eos> Your reputation for violence is well established.<eos> Now do something useful with it.
You can't escape your fate, Kiera.<eos> Neither can we.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This time line is starting to collapse.<eos> It will die, and so will we.
- Vice president, sales.<eos> - Midwest region.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Bought the surround sound to celebrate.<eos> I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?<eos> - [Tv in background] - [Laughs] You're gonna have to marry that ham, you get any more familiar with it.
Erm... In fashion we are representing the Raj so -<eos> Good morning, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Mr Thackary.<eos> Where's my display?<eos> I... I spent half the night putting it up.
"Winter is almost over...<eos> "Our strength is restored, "and our tans have faded.<eos> "Yu, spring is in the air.<eos> "The mare was giving birth, "but having some difficulties.<eos> "We got some rope, "tied it around the foal's legs and pulled it out.
'Cause we can't find it on our GPS.<eos> It exists, but you don't want to take it.<eos> Why not?<eos> We're heading up to Canada, and we figured that route would cut at least a day off our trip.<eos> Trust me, you don't want to take it.
But I need a rest.<eos> I told you that terrible things happen to anyone who sets foot on that island.<eos> We thought you were just trying to scare us!<eos> I knew there was something wrong with that island.<eos> There is a darkness hidden beneath it and I think the people in this town know about it.
Watch.<eos> I'll just wave this juicy brain in front of him.<eos> I'm gonna faint!<eos> Hooray.<eos> So, Jenda, I don't know what love is, but I know what it isn't, and we're isn't.
But besides finding The brave men who lost their lives, We found something else today.<eos> And I hope it'll bring comfort To at least one coal valley family.<eos> What's it say, teacher?<eos> "forgive me, pa."<eos> Ladies, I promise That I'll take good care of this plank Until it's decided what we're going to do with it.
There was a makeshift hospital.<eos> Just another hut.<eos> I was still a child but I felt drawn to it, helped where I could.<eos> You never forget what dreadful cruelty people are capable of.<eos> War leaves us all a lot poorer than it finds us, doesn't it?
- "...claiming the life of her unborn daughter."<eos> - That's enough!<eos> - And you lost the ability to bear more children.<eos> All right, so you have money.<eos> What did you do with it?
I appreciate you giving me the chance to better understand Sarah's world.<eos> And now you have your own nation.<eos> Israel is only five years old and has many enemies... ..but with or without her, we will survive.<eos> Our faith will sustain us.<eos> And so many of us have just died for it.
Deeks speaks Dickinson.<eos> Deeks doesn't speak Dickinson. No.<eos> Deeks is full of the Dickinson.<eos> That I believe.<eos> Well, I would like to know why. Because springtime is fully upon us, my friends, and with it, the age-old opportunity to enrich one's life.
She's our friend.<eos> You do see the difference, don't you?<eos> I guess.<eos> You know, Mandy, death is a... it's a precious gift.<eos> It can't be given indiscriminately, or it loses its value, and we lose the great privilege of offering it.
I'm starving.<eos> I can't believe you drove past the friggin' King.<eos> Fuck the King.<eos> Randy, there was another bag of white liquor.<eos> What'd you do with it, bud?
Chummy? Will you help me to organise some sheets?<eos> Roger, over and out.<eos> I can remember you sewing a baby's nightdress in that chair.<eos> Yes. It wasn't to be.<eos> What did you do with it?
There's something else in here.<eos> Something like what?<eos> Something not human.<eos> Lydia, could you please hold the light still for a second?<eos> It's really hard to see anything if you keep shaking it like that.
Something like what?<eos> Something not human.<eos> Lydia, could you please hold the light still for a second?<eos> It's really hard to see anything if you keep shaking it like that.<eos> I'm shaking it like this because we're in the middle of nowhere with your broken down jeep and we're being attacked by yet another razor-clawed monster.
So, I was thinking if I introduced her to you, then she would get used to black folk.<eos> So, your plan is to indoctrinate her like you would do a damn dog on the street?<eos> Ahh, wh... that was the plan, yes.<eos> You cannot date racist pussy, man!<eos> Now, you can screw the hell out of some racist pussy, but you can't date it!
Well, in the meantime, don't you think your kitchen workers should have a sanitary place to go?<eos> Especially since they're the ones taking the crust off your sandwiches?<eos> You didn't even ask. You just stormed in.<eos> Mr. Caputo, can my people use the B-Dorm bathroom? Please?<eos> Fine. You can share it.
Not sure cheap books is the same as pinning shit on Crazy.<eos> Ain't you worried Red's gonna wake up and tell them what happened?<eos> Nope, that is not how OGs like Red handle their business.<eos> You've got your script.<eos> Follow it.
And why is that?<eos> You and I are getting to know each other.<eos> Well... sadly, I don't think it's gonna go on much longer.<eos> I have a new theory.<eos> Can you share it with me?
What kind?<eos> The Bureau is forming a task force to deal with international art theft.<eos> It'll be working with Scotland yard and other agencies. Long story short...<eos> They, uh...<eos> They -- they -- they want me to run it. Congratulations.
- Where'd you get that?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> Let's not play games.<eos> You clearly have a theory.<eos> Let's hear it.
- Hmm. - Ah!<eos> Quick announcement for two of Greendale's finest.<eos> Payday is postponed until next week. So this is my freestyle rap apology.<eos> d Well, I'm a peanut bar d d And I'm here to say d d Your checks will arrive on another day d d Another day, another dime, another rhyme, another dollar d d Another stuffed shirt with another white collar d<eos> d Criminals, Wall Street, taking the pie d d And all the black man gets is a plate of white lies d d Prisons!

Jake:<eos> Negative. Wait for my go.<eos> - She has a bomb.<eos> - I see that.<eos> I also want to see what she's planning to do with it.
Absolutely not.<eos> They said I did, but I didn't.<eos> Still, it's good to know it anyway.<eos> The truck's making that noise again.<eos> I'm gonna need to take it to the shop.
She is, but this isn't what I wanted.<eos> Come on. You know me!<eos> I fall in love with new things.<eos> Remember that psychic phase I went through?<eos> I had that crystal ball, and Bobby went bowling with it?
- I hate undercover.<eos> May and Ward, you're front and center.<eos> Once we locate the package, you'll tag it with a tracker.<eos> Skye and Fitz, you'll be running communications.<eos> After the package is tagged, we'll follow it to Quinn.
It's what I did.<eos> Pollinators.<eos> Sorry? Minidrone pollinators, for areas where bee populations have crashed.<eos> I designed the microoptics, but my partners forced me out and sold the technology to the military.<eos> And, now, they kill people from bases in Virginia with it.
I'm getting good at this.<eos> Pretty soon I won't need you at all.<eos> Yeah, keep on tracking.<eos> It's got a gun.<eos> Can you move it?
- Then make the call, and when you learn I'm right, turn over any witness information to Detective Seeger.<eos> - Let me make some calls.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, that was pretty straightforward.<eos> We have work to do, so let's do it.
I'm also, uh, tracking down a missing package.<eos> Uh, it wouldn't have, uh, landed on your doorstep, would it?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause I can grab it and take it off your hands.
The open bins are the ones that were robbed?<eos> Yes, there were 12 passengers who filed police reports.<eos> These are the four targeted bins.<eos> And in each one of these bins there was at least one bag that was at some distance from its owner.<eos> Well, that makes sense, because it's pretty risky to be rifling through someone's bag when the owner is sitting right beneath it.
Use your words, son.<eos> He had a bottle of scotch.<eos> How'd you know it was in there?<eos> I saw him drink some before he went up in the plane.<eos> What'd you do with it?
I'm your mother's nurse.<eos> I just started.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to talk to you about her situation.<eos> What about it?
Of course.<eos> You mentioned earlier that you went to my client's house to discuss an urgent matter.<eos> Ja, that is right, but instead of speaking to me reasonably, he and his henchmen attacked me.<eos> Would've thought that had been sharper.<eos> The urgent matter, what was it?
Uh, Henry is a voracious reader, and Tess, she just joined Brownies.<eos> And your kids, how are...<eos> Haven't been born yet.<eos> I'm still single, looking for a nice girl to settle down with.<eos> And once upon a time, I hoped it'd be you.
- You've come to enlist me? - To recruit you.<eos> Abe, Congress does a lot more than just declare for your freedom.<eos> They fight for it.<eos> I fight for it.<eos> Men die for it.
Roy, don't jump to conclusions.<eos> Oh, I don't have to, Dec.<eos> You see, records show that the two of you set up that shell corporation.<eos> Now with the Westry house, the entire parcel is ten acres.<eos> And Asher Hotels, they're willing to pay $30 million for it.
- Think about what you're saying.<eos> - I have.<eos> Hate is a lot like love.<eos> You can't force it.<eos> You can't fight it.
So why Costa Rica?<eos> Dr. Scott's gonna need some primates to test her vaccine.<eos> Apparently, there's a monkey reserve a few miles upriver.<eos> She doesn't have the vaccine, does she?<eos> She's working on it.
I... I can't shake it.<eos> I-I can't shake this feeling that nothing about me and Barney makes any sense.<eos> But love doesn't make sense.<eos> I mean, you can't logic your way into or out of it.<eos> Love is totally nonsensical, but we have to keep doing it or else we're lost and-and love is dead and humanity should just pack it in.
You closed the case?<eos> Her killer's doing life in Sing Sing.<eos> Did you give me this case because I told you I was frustrated about not being promoted to detective?<eos> No.<eos> I gave it to you because I think you can handle it, and I need discretion.
I got ten.<eos> Why you ask, kid?<eos> No reason.<eos> Hey, how's your case going, Dad?<eos> I'm working hard on it, little buddy.
I'm breaking rules all the time.<eos> Name one.<eos> Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.<eos> What about that little cup they give you? Yeah.<eos> What about it?
We'd starve.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Not too far.<eos> The trading post on Adderley Cay.<eos> Too far out of the way for the English to pay much attention to it.
You don't have to dance every time.<eos> True, but I choose to dance every time.<eos> [laughs] [both grunt] whoo!<eos> You have one play.<eos> You give the ball to jeffords, And he runs it in.
Well, Teddy got jealous.<eos> So the next time I was in New York, I went out of my way, skipped a blind date my aunt tried to set me up on...<eos> Please get out.<eos> skipped a date, to find Teddy the same bird his sister cherished.<eos> Well, he played with it for one day!
- There you go. - Apologies, sir.<eos> Okay. One thing he's good at is apologizing.<eos> I guess I'm just wondering what if something happens to you?<eos> We don't know the first thing about the advisory.<eos> - Frank will handle it. - Andy:
Come on, let's get going.<eos> Run!<eos> Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> I wasn't controlling it.
You found me.<eos> You held out your hand.<eos> I took sex.<eos> A gift.<eos> I played with it.
A thief, physically capable, compulsively devious and utterly devoid of soul.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> That's insane.<eos> Do you want to put the stone in the dagger and stab him with it?
Hey, hey, hey, but don't bum-rush the guy, okay?<eos> Command does not want us destroying a mosque. - It's gonna be a bad PR problem.<eos> - Fuckin' liberals.<eos> I don't think it's coming from the mosque.<eos> I saw muzzle flashes behind it.
It bothers me that this does not bother you.<eos> What's that?<eos> This. That.<eos> All of it.<eos> The world is changing so rapidly and we with it.
The ocean.<eos> The ocean? Why?<eos> Well, it covers 72% of the planet.<eos> And it's approximately 3 miles from here.<eos> And I've never seen it.
I didn't sleep at all last night. Hmm?<eos> I snuck out.<eos> I didn't want to wake you, so I... I went out the window.<eos> And I... I borrowed your truck.<eos> I went to the city with it.
The ones I worry might just convince you to do it.<eos> I've chased Captain Flint's treasure.<eos> I've had Captain Flint's treasure.<eos> It never ends well.<eos> Rather than rush off after it again... maybe let's just do this a while longer.
I saw that among the legacy equipment on the floor that you possess an operational smelter.<eos> And?<eos> You already possess the means to resolve your issue.<eos> Step one, melt down scrap metal.<eos> Step two, pour it over the compromised walker as they are in contact with the chain link.
Shall we choose a vessel?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> Here's a tune. It's called A Christmas Song. Looks like it's destined to become one of the Yuletide season's genuine standards.<eos> There's a problem.<eos> Is it you?
Lieutenant!<eos> Come inside!<eos> Don't stand there in the rain.<eos> Oh, there she is.<eos> We'd have offered you shelter in our mill, but you saw what happened to it.
You're part of Long John Silver's resistance.<eos> I am Long John Silver.<eos> The resistance in the interior...<eos> I built it.<eos> I led it.
- Right.<eos> - You think that'll, uh... play better if I remove the tag that says it costs $15?<eos> Look, cut me some slack here, all right?<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - Okay. Say he buys all that, opens the safe to put my precious in, how the fuck are we supposed to empty it with him standing right there?
Beaten.<eos> Half-starved.<eos> I should just kill him.<eos> After all, a wise man said, "One cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live."<eos> And what I've learned is, the best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.
And we're not going to give it a chance to.<eos> That thing is a living weapon, it's a killing machine.<eos> - It's not a machine<eos> - It's not human.<eos> - It clearly was once.
- It's not a machine<eos> - It's not human.<eos> - It clearly was once.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> I'm gonna go down there. I'm gonna talk to it. No.
In the sun?<eos> How?<eos> What did Valentine do to you?<eos> OK, so he slashed my throat open, like completely.<eos> And then he used this nuclearized sword, like swiped it, and next thing I know the sun doesn't fry me anymore.
Service to the community, reverence for the law, integrity. Leadership, respect for all people.<eos> Keep these values in mind, and strive to uphold them throughout your careers.<eos> It is a privilege to be a Los Angeles police officer.<eos> It is an honor to wear this uniform.<eos> And with it comes enormous responsibility and an awesome commitment to protect this city and its citizens... with your lives if necessary.
Okay, here we go.<eos> Barry? Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.<eos> Why didn't that work? That was supposed to work.<eos> We kick-started his temporal lobe.<eos> Now he just needs to access it.
Okay, here we go.<eos> Barry? Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.<eos> Why didn't that work? That was supposed to work.<eos> We kick-started his temporal lobe.<eos> Now he just needs to access it.
I figured it out from Dalton's measurements.<eos> The Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork, those things fit together to make a clapper, the hammer that swings inside a bell.<eos> So those three missing things, they're all a part of one bell.<eos> When properly assembled, this bell becomes, like, a mystical, witchified super-bell.<eos> I mean, it makes you wonder what happens when you ring it.
All I care about is that you're willing to destroy my sister.<eos> But you get brownie points for letting me know that she's currently unable to defend herself.<eos> - Just tell me how this works.<eos> - It's easy.<eos> Once your dad finishes welding the bell back together, you or he rings it 12 times.
Tell Eric exactly what happened.<eos> She'll get a proper burial.<eos> Her family... everything.<eos> Rune, go get the tent.<eos> We'll wrap her up in it, put her on my skidoo.
Don't be sad.<eos> Uncle Monty will be down soon.<eos> It can't understand you.<eos> Dr. Montgomery said the broken-hearted crocodile's mating call just happens to sound like depressed human speech. I know.<eos> Just like talking to it.
I do the math.<eos> He's got a lot more reach with a hockey stick than I do with this bat.<eos> So, huh, here's the funny part.<eos> You know what I did?<eos> I threw it at him.
- Can you talk?<eos> I can.<eos> Thanks for getting my phone back to me, though I wish you'd done it in person.<eos> Didn't think that'd be too smart.<eos> Anybody at the station see you with it?
Just one of those bad boys costs millions... and it's not just about the money, either.<eos> It's about putting your employees in danger.<eos> Like this.<eos> Stay calm... it's all part of the presentation.<eos> Now, when there is a fire, what do you do about it?
I can hear it in your voice.<eos> Your sphincter's clenching up.<eos> Which is exactly what I told you would happen.<eos> I know you're getting some kind of grim satisfaction out of this, but I slaved over that script.<eos> I slaved over it.
There's no conspiracy.<eos> She's not a sleeper agent, all right?<eos> And there's no message in a comic book.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I came here for proof, okay, and this isn't it.
Her computer.<eos> I mean, where was the computer?<eos> Rolltop desk.<eos> What's in her safe?<eos> Didn't want to mess with it.
Maybe.<eos> Okay, well, where is the car, mother?<eos> The sheriff was just here.<eos> They're searching for the car.<eos> So what did you do with it?
Can I tell you something about your friend Phillip?<eos> See, Phillip was born in former Yugoslavia.<eos> At that time, Yugoslavia was held together by a communist dictator with the name, Tito.<eos> And it wasn't until the end of the Cold War around '88 or '89 when the wall came tumbling down that the whole communist system collapsed.<eos> And with it, Yugoslavia.
We all get sold this fantasy that life's gonna be easy.<eos> Hurts like hell when you learn the truth.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> It's just you can't push that kind of pain away.<eos> You gotta... You gotta own it, deal with it every day.
Once.<eos> I'd just made rank.<eos> - Was he bent back then? - Like a crowbar.<eos> He used to keep this old search warrant in his glove compartment.<eos> He'd flash it when he wanted to get in somewhere without going through the niceties.
Is that it, Dean?<eos> When Gavin Jacobs had his throat cut with a box cutter, your laptop was out on his desk.<eos> And whoever grabbed it, they didn't dump it in the bathtub with the other computer stuff.<eos> No, not your laptop.<eos> They walked away with it.
That is what I was hearing all night long.<eos> This "beep, beep, beep!" it's making me little paranoid.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that's what was making you paranoid.<eos> That beacon's still sending a signal? Seems to be.<eos> Doesn't look like anyone's followed up on it.
Believe me, the King does not love me for my ability to bear children, let alone look after them.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Have you found the murderer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is it?
Please note that down.<eos> Ten thousand francs debited the account of the Duke d'Orleans.<eos> There's no greater pleasure than losing somebody else's money.<eos> I was hot on her heels, the scent of victory in my nostrils.<eos> Then the stag fell into the ditch and I fell in with it
I'm trying to help people, mack.<eos> I know you're not a bad person, Fitz, but this... Gear has been used for some really bad things.<eos> You've got to think about the implications of what you create.<eos> Electricity is used to execute criminals.<eos> Does that mean we also shouldn't use it to power our hospitals?
There is that word again ... "regret."<eos> You built an empire by eliminating the regrets of others.<eos> How does it taste on your tongue?<eos> I want to burn this world to the ground.<eos> I thought you wanted to rule it.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for her to overhear.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you putting those ideas in my little girl's head?<eos> Because this world is ending, and I don't want you to end with it.
Look right here.<eos> Please don't... trying to be nice.<eos> That's all we got.<eos> It gives us his voice.<eos> It connects the killings.
I'll make sure of it.<eos> I hope you came here to tell me you got everything straightened out.<eos> I came here to tell you that the deal's off the table.<eos> What?<eos> Name partner means something, and I can't just give it away to make a statement.
Yes, if it did any good.<eos> What about you?<eos> I've barely had a chance to talk to you.<eos> Did you turn in your article?<eos> No, I'm still working on it.
- It's going into overload.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> It means he sabotaged it.<eos> This whole building is going to explode.<eos> And it's going to take ten city blocks with it.
I was kidnapped recently and I'm very, very tense.<eos> Wait!<eos> You know the attack on Simmons Square?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about it?
When I was a child, I could look up into the skies and see Daxam and the stars.<eos> I was told so many times how terrible a place it was, but I couldn't understand that.<eos> Because they had families, like us.<eos> People they loved.<eos> In a few minutes, this ship will be destroyed, and everyone on it.
Mutually assured destruction.<eos> You want to play?<eos> It's a win-win, Stahl.<eos> This is a career-maker for you.<eos> Take the bust and the corner office that goes with it, and leave us the hell alone.
I'll check and see if they broke down the perimeter.<eos> Hey, this is Tess Nazario at the 64th.<eos> I was waiting on a residential search warrant.<eos> Tuscano, you can map the genome off a saliva swab, but you can't hold on to one metal object?<eos> Can you hold onto it for me for a minute?
Oh, I have a... I have a church.<eos> You... you have a boat.<eos> And before that, a sidewalk in St. Louis.<eos> A church is not a building.<eos> But it can be... if you build it right.
Our universe is dying.<eos> We've watched the progress of a billion years' worth of entropy and fed off the slow disintegration into the chaos of our world.<eos> Now there's nothing left to sustain us.<eos> This universe is younger.<eos> We can feed off of it for over a billion years.
As soon as I report this, I will be ordered to launch an assault.<eos> You do that, and a lot of those hostages are gonna die.<eos> Well, not as many as if they release that virus.<eos> Give Eric one more hour.<eos> If he tries to leave the island with it, you have the means to stop it.
It's in the vault downstairs.<eos> Would you be a dear and go fetch that?<eos> What made you first pick up the item?<eos> I guess I am a freak for the freaky.<eos> I've always been intrigued by the concept of the occult, and this is definitely the town for it.
Yeah, that's why I'm the press secretary.<eos> I'll push it out to the briefingroom list.<eos> Okay, just make sure it's the first thing they read.<eos> And the op-ed?<eos> Yeah, uh, let me write it first, then we can see who we can drum up to sign it.
I prefer exaggerated.<eos> I mean, that's the point.<eos> My brother, he once had this promoter set him up with a guy who wrestled with a snake.<eos> The day of the match, the snake died.<eos> Kermit put on a sock puppet. My brother had to wrestle it like it was real.
Gotta do the gigs so you can make shit you want.<eos> I've been making this wrestling TV show just so I can fund my next movie.<eos> Huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been working on it for, like, ten years, man.
For years, doctors, hospitals.<eos> God, he was so sweet.<eos> But he... he moved.<eos> He moved a room, sometimes further.<eos> You'd heard his voice, and you'd follow it.
The only thing.<eos> You have to stop the Witness.<eos> Be the Traveler again.<eos> Save this world.<eos> Me with it.
Don't do what?<eos> That. It was cute in the beginning, but it's not anymore.<eos> You'd rather sacrifice your students than swallow your pride and admit that someone found a better way to teach them.<eos> All right, scissors.<eos> Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.
You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery,"<eos> but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.<eos> Yes, I took your father's name, but it's what I did with it. It's what I made with it.
I was curious.<eos> Also, I was in the hall. I figured I should move the big, giant, scary tumor or something.<eos> - I have a giant, scary tumor.<eos> - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.
Look, I finished untying your bondage kit.<eos> You gonna teach me now?<eos> You finish first step.<eos> Next...the table.<eos> What about it?
It's his behavior, his pathological refusal to communicate!<eos> Breathe.<eos> Sit and breathe.<eos> The guy you shot, Kang's pal, we got his phone.<eos> Bailey and Cho are working on it.
You abducted me from the middle of a battlefield to ask about an old myth?<eos> There is a war on, you fools!<eos> And I imagine that the view from the trenches is pretty bleak.<eos> It looks to me like the end of the world.<eos> But it's not.
So you're clean?<eos> Should I pee in a cup?<eos> Max, I'm trying to help you.<eos> I'm worried.<eos> I really appreciate it, but this is my problem, and I will handle it, okay?
You are 16 years old; what are you gonna do?<eos> ! Starve to death? !<eos> - You good?<eos> - Yeah. Just Epp's phone...<eos> What about it?
It's fine by me.<eos> Just to be clear... we stay off of each other's property, no matter what?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You just got a check from Neumann's Hill yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to start a fire.
Brute beauty and valour...<eos> "And the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion."<eos> "Times told lovelier, more dangerous." "O, my chevalier!"<eos> "I like 'caught'... I caught this morning.<eos> "It's as if we've caught hold of the tail of the hawk "and it's taking us with it, swooping and soaring.
"I like 'caught'... I caught this morning.<eos> "It's as if we've caught hold of the tail of the hawk "and it's taking us with it, swooping and soaring.<eos> "And the Ms are good too...<eos> Morning morning's minion... "because M is the shape of a bird" "and 'orning, 'orning's and 'inion trailing after it,"<eos> "And then it drops so fast, you can't say 'down'..." "Because it's quicker than down, so it has to be dom." "And you can't say words beginning with D easily, it takes effort,"
Consider what he has to say.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> I don't think it's a coincidence this saber came into your possession.<eos> Yeah, but, Kanan, that doesn't mean she can fight with it.
Oh, good, the thankless job.<eos> See that trooper?<eos> Convince him you are Lieutenant Lyste.<eos> Here is his code cylinder.<eos> Get him to open the door with it.
The event at Roswell, because it resulted in the acquisition of material that could be studied.<eos> It created a sea change in the whole national security organization, because within weeks of that event, the CIA was formed.<eos> Within weeks, there was the formation of the Air Force which was split off from the army Air Force.<eos> It also let, however, the development of unacknowledged special access projects.<eos> Which is why Eisenhower, even though he knew about the subject on a fairly deep level, had completely lost control of it by 1961 when he left office.
Mitchell and I are early contenders to win the best costume in the human/animal category.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Self-comforting with food.<eos> I've been working on that all morning, and it is for a party tonight.<eos> What are a bunch of gays gonna do with a cake but stand around screeching about how pretty it is?
That's not how I see it.<eos> He was writing a book that defied his chain of command.<eos> Every soldier needs a way to let go of the weight he carries.<eos> Trevor found his way.<eos> Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.
- Who is that guy?<eos> - I don't know. My job was to ID him.<eos> Okay, and then what?<eos> The cavalry was supposed to come. Tell me you have a plan "B."<eos> Yeah, I'm working on it, Elise.
Like I said, there's not a lot of demand for those coins.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Sorry for the mess. We're in the middle of doing inventory.<eos> Do you own the auction house?<eos> No, I just manage it.
Squirrel feces? Is that true?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Petra is using scare tactics.<eos> _<eos> Okay, Jane, why don't we get sand, so Mateo can throw it in kids' eyes.
She passes through security every day.<eos> They check her baggage for storage devices.<eos> What about that digital camera we saw her with?<eos> No, she leaves it in her car.<eos> She'd never be allowed in with it.
Can I stay in here until I fall asleep?<eos> Sure, but just for tonight.<eos> - (grunts) - (sighs)<eos> So, instead of reading you a story, tonight, Daddy and I want to tell you a very special story about how our family came to be.<eos> It's an unusual story, because, usually, parents meet first and then fall in love and then they have a baby.
Liam, where's the uranium?<eos> The barrels of uranium for the EmDrive.<eos> The EmDrive doesn't need uranium.<eos> What?<eos> What did he do with it?
- And that's just one of the amendments.<eos> - I know them well.<eos> "Rebellion," "invasion." That can mean anything.<eos> That's a blank check for the federal government to suspend our rights for any reason.<eos> The world has changed, Iris, and this country has to change along with it.
I know how much you value your professional integrity, and I trust you to stand by those principles.<eos> But under no circumstances are you to discuss anything about this reference with him.<eos> Of course. I...<eos> Even better, don't see him at all until this is over.<eos> Build that ethical wall very high and stay right behind it.
And breaking attorney-client privilege is a dis-barrable offense, and if we find out that's what's been<eos> - happening here... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.<eos> Like you said, I used a loophole.<eos> 'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.<eos> So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson Specter, they're not getting it from me.
So, how'd it go?<eos> Just like we planned.<eos> Look, let's not mince words, okay?<eos> All of us are here for one reason.<eos> And it's not to enjoy the delicious tripe soup this country has to offer or learn from their fantastic gymnasts.
Who sent this?<eos> New English?<eos> Renshaw's last address was new English.<eos> There's no such thing as a coincidence.<eos> The world broke, and you broke with it.
I might have caused its creation, but I had no part in making it, or sending it to you.<eos> I'm under lock and key here.<eos> - Her room was...<eos> - Was taken.<eos> Like so many before it.
Now suppose that you and your committee were to acquire some of the things that are in this room, what happens when the next President's wife comes into the White House?<eos> Well, if they don't want it... In the past, you see, they could sell it or throw it out.<eos> And the talk of the taxpayer money being wasted?<eos> Oh, I raised every dime privately that we spent on that restoration. I...<eos> I loved that house, and I wanted to share it with the American people. To impart a sense of America's greatness.
- Girls Like Them?<eos> - Girls Like You.<eos> Girls Like Us?<eos> - You need an ending.<eos> - We're working on it.
-The bar free all night?<eos> -It is, yeah.<eos> So is all this yummy food.<eos> Give it a try. How about that salmon station down there, huh?<eos> Sales has already given it a whack.
- We came looking for black powder.<eos> - I bet you did.<eos> I came with merceneries for the same thing, 25 years ago.<eos> And did you find it?<eos> Finding it and leaving with it alive are two different things.
He lets me stay here in exchange for shooting coyotes.<eos> Cold beer in the fridge.<eos> You stole my hat.<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> What the fuck you do to it?
What?<eos> Starfleet data files, ship files including the Enterprise.<eos> He has been watching us the whole time.<eos> Captain, the artefact was on the ship the whole time?<eos> I couldn't afford to get caught with it. So I hid it in here.
He still got that rag tied to the tree.<eos> He was out here swinging that bat.<eos> I was just getting ready to go back in the house.<eos> He swung that bat and just fell over.<eos> Seem like, when he swung it, he stood there with this grin on his face.
They do love their red flower.<eos> The red flower doesn't seem so bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let it loose, and it destroys everything it touches.<eos> Don't ever play with it.
The red flower.<eos> I don't have that!<eos> You're a man, aren't you?<eos> That's what makes you a man.<eos> You can summon the red flower... And control it.
How do you mean?<eos> Like, asking it questions.<eos> Saying knock twice for "yes" and one for "no."<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I wonder what would happen if we tried talking to it now?
- Dad! Get away from my son.<eos> You know what, this is gonna end badly for you, man.<eos> Cameron, don't be afraid.<eos> Do you remember this ring?<eos> You used to sleep with it, remember?
Allergies, asshole.<eos> All right, Cooper.<eos> Now, listen to me.<eos> When you pick up this hammer, you pick it up real, real slow.<eos> It's not about what you're gonna do with it. It's what they think you're gonna do with it.
Keep it low-key.<eos> What?<eos> Peaches, Peaches.<eos> Sweetheart, you don't just wing the happiest day of your life!<eos> No, you seize it and you cherish it.
Yeah, he made me the same deal.<eos> Your life for mine and Peyton's.<eos> And you fucking believe him?<eos> I don't know what to believe right now.<eos> This guy's doing all of this for a reason, man... and we have to figure out what it is.
We'll have to be careful.<eos> I've told everyone my husband is from Paris.<eos> And?<eos> And... Your French is good, but your Parisian accent is terrible.<eos> I've been working on it for months.
When a mosquito bites you, it leaves an enzyme that other mosquitos can smell.<eos> And I can smell it on you, kid.<eos> Everyone can.<eos> So, you can run forever. Forever.<eos> But the worst and, I mean, the worst goddamn people in the world know that scent and they'll follow it.
Politics, man.<eos> The culture of fear wins again.<eos> I can't get anything done here.<eos> Hey, um, what about that idea that we were talking about?<eos> I'm working on it.
- What?<eos> - What about Kenny G?<eos> I mean, what about elevator music?<eos> You know, jazz music that I know?<eos> - What about it?

He spends a lot more time working underneath things than he does on top.<eos> He could worry a little more about his ear hygiene, too.<eos> You just looked a little nervous, that's all.<eos> You know, if you identify the fear, you can get past it.<eos> And then you get used to it.
Right, who's next?<eos> I came here.<eos> I sailed from France to raise an army, this army.<eos> It was God's will that I do so, and since then, His hand has ever been with us.<eos> This precious chance of victory, if we spurn His divine gift, there is no guarantee that it will be offered again.
Right now I have to get you and your sister to Odessa.<eos> Destiny, while marching ever in our direction, can be rerouted by the choices we make.<eos> The fate of the entire world depends on us getting this right tonight.<eos> What if I don't have the strength?<eos> Then I suggest you find it, or that brother that's been looking for you, when the world ends, he's gonna burn right along with it.
How are you going to handle it?<eos> We cut the head off this thing.<eos> Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.<eos> You're not indoctrinated for this material.<eos> I'm already into it.
When I come onstage, take care of Kalloor and the girl.<eos> Copy.<eos> What I mean to say is, you know. All this success has come at a cost.<eos> There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.<eos> A guilty secret and uh... and I have to share it with all of you guys.
I don't want to be in the position of defending Mark Fuhrman.<eos> My job is to defend Ron and Nicole.<eos> The victims.<eos> But the bottom line is not Fuhrman.<eos> It's the concrete evidence.
We build from that.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> That scene at the docks?<eos> With the photographer.<eos> What about it?
Your Royal Highness.<eos> Welcome.<eos> High hopes, James.<eos> Mark me, tonight could be a turning point for us.<eos> Aye, I believe it will be.
Good.<eos> That's normal.<eos> And I brought you some herbs to help.<eos> They're to be brewed in hot water.<eos> And once the infusion cools, then you can apply it with a cloth.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're saying Flint conjured that storm?<eos> He conjured us into it.<eos> And who's more powerful?<eos> The one who made the storm or the one who convinced us into battle to defeat it?
Prepare to mount up!<eos> She is. You have my word.<eos> So we are able to see the island, but the island cannot see us.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Well, Mr. De Groot says that from this position, when viewed from the beach, our hull sits beneath the horizon while our masts are above it.
Along with my good name.<eos> Along with her lost love.<eos> Along with your late quartermaster's life.<eos> All the awful sacrifices made to assemble that box are now part of its contents, and those things... are sacred things that I trust in no man's hands.<eos> The next time that chest is opened will be after Anne and I walk away with it,
Take it this the first you're hearing about a boyfriend.<eos> That loser is not her boyfriend.<eos> That's a lapse in judgment.<eos> At least he's not a car thief.<eos> Car's in my name and I didn't say he could drive it, so I'm charging him.
Your entire life has led to this moment.<eos> The Witness has spoken.<eos> You can drop it, Mr. Cole.<eos> Shit.<eos> See, you're cursing fate, but the real tragedy is the time you waste running from it.
Privately pissed.<eos> - Will they retaliate?<eos> - If they win.<eos> And if O'Shea wins?<eos> He'll either bury the Grand Jury report, or use it to bury me.
Hey, fuck you, man. You wanna lose both your arms, too?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, relax, relax, relax, he's not accusing you, okay.<eos> No, actually, I kinda was.<eos> Guys, guys, nobody but us is down here.<eos> So whoever the killer is... it has to be one of us.
-He's not the killer!<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -Because... I saw the killer, too.<eos> So, who is it, Lewis?
You may want to talk to her.<eos> My first husband was a deadbeat too.<eos> Guess I've got a type.<eos> Yeah. My wife's got a type.<eos> I'm not it.
Uh, banking authorities in Vanuatu have revealed that our cops have significant holdings there.<eos> It's gonna take some time... these fuckers are not cooperative... before we find that source of the funds, but we know what we're going to find.<eos> Case is terminated.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Looked like a winner, but it's not.
No, you don't.<eos> Leaders lead.<eos> Cowards cower.<eos> Now I understand that your poem is personal.<eos> I understand that it might make you feel uncomfortable to share it.
- And?<eos> - Uh, great.<eos> When can I read it?<eos> - Uh, well, um,<eos> Kelsey's just going over it with a fine-toothed comb.
FuckFordandhis new fucking narrative.<eos> Fuck this stupid fucking map.<eos> Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.<eos> Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?<eos> I am declaring that this park is my stage and I shall do with it what I please.
But it has an extra layer of encryption on it.<eos> Probably has to do with the division he works in.<eos> Security systems management handles security for clients ranging from private companies to government and military networks.<eos> Which means Duncan has access.<eos> Question is, what is he doing with it?
But the one I did catch isn't going anywhere.<eos> I didn't figure an assassin would faint at the sight of his own blood.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I think I just found our target.<eos> Which of the Turners is it?
We have to try to get in.<eos> I think she got brain damage.<eos> We've been acting like lab rats.<eos> Lab rats are only powerless because they don't understand that they're in an experiment.<eos> But they're just as much a part of it as the scientist, in some ways even more.
And I know we're both worried about the same thing.<eos> Will we ever find the fifth movement?<eos> One of us will get it.<eos> And what then?<eos> What will you do with it?
I don't want to cash it.<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, but the check feels like a piece of Theo.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?
When I was little...<eos> I mean, when I was a kid... we lived next to a farm.<eos> - You know, next to Grandpa Leon's place.<eos> On the farm, there was a tractor.<eos> And I dreamt of driving it.
- Of course, yes. He loved too-teat.<eos> No! He loved concrete!<eos> - Yes! - I see, concrete. - Yes!<eos> - I see, concrete. Concrete is a fabulous material.<eos> You can do anything with it.
Mmm, check out this membrane at the nape of the neck.<eos> We need to cut it open.<eos> We don't know what's inside this thing.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> What if the suit isn't protecting it from us? What if it's protecting us from it?
Your father said it absorbed some of the impact.<eos> That's why we survived.<eos> The snow looked so beautiful, it...<eos> Charles?<eos> The children were playing in it.
Hey, you let me worry about the song. You worry about getting us over that river.<eos> The bridge.<eos> Yes, sir. Already thought on that with zeke.<eos> Ain't no way over it.<eos> (both panting) No, there ain't. But I think I might be able to fashion a way under it.
Not in a million years.<eos> Well, let's see what Lee has to say.<eos> Recognise this vehicle?<eos> No, can't say I do.<eos> We think Tommy Stonnall was driving it.
But she walks passed him as a stranger would.<eos> What will Sultan do now?<eos> What can he do?<eos> When he was wrestling, he fought inside the ring.<eos> Now he fights outside it.
We drew her deeper with every step, and now you would blame her?<eos> But the father of lies betrayed us all.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> Seen the future that we have built in our thirst for revenge.<eos> We have brought him back only to murder our own world and ourselves with it... unless we can stop him.
Finally, brother, you are here.<eos> Nostoah nanaeel olani noasmi...<eos> Stop.<eos> I haven't heard the old tongue in eons.<eos> I can't say that I like it.
Yeah, but that's not North.<eos> - Mmm. - ‭That is.<eos> Mine is doing it too.<eos> Mr. Douglas has a compass.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?
That was strange. That was strange.<eos> I was awake but dreaming.<eos> I was here but-but not here.<eos> In the darkness, lost I heard your voice.<eos> I followed it.
The real gem is the return of my great-grandfather's ring.<eos> Getting that returned to the family is what's most priceless to me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> The ring is gone.<eos> What happened to it?
Like helium.<eos> Why does a hospital need helium in the first place?<eos> It's for Heliox therapy.<eos> It's mostly used for respiratory injuries caused by fires or explosions.<eos> Burn victims from Afghanistan were treated with it at the local recovery hospitals.
Our retribution must be swift, and it must be brutal!<eos> Agreed.<eos> After the Serratura has been recovered.<eos> Freya's pendant is also missing.<eos> And Finn's mystical essence along with it.
If war is coming... we need to prepare.<eos> When he returns, give him what he needs.<eos> Breca!<eos> Where's the troll?<eos> I dealt with it.
-He's afraid of clowns. -I thought he was afraid of elves.<eos> He used to be.<eos> Now it's clowns.<eos> Well, that's why there's clown spray.<eos> We'll just spray it all over the fort.
It's too far away for me to read her lips, but if you look at her body language, it's like she's saying, "Are you lost?<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> Should we call them?"<eos> Joey hands her his phone.<eos> The man walks away with it, presumably destroys it, then hides it.
Okay, that was like watching a really bad play.<eos> What the hell is this mess doin' here?<eos> We had it cleared 20 minutes ago, sir.<eos> I left to go on rounds, and by the time I came back, it was up again.<eos> We can't keep on top of it.
They hear it through the records we make.<eos> That's who Alibi is for.<eos> Those kids.<eos> They need a voice.<eos> And Alibi's it!
Paris.<eos> You must be excited to be going back.<eos> No.<eos> I feel so old.<eos> When I was young I had the passion to win, but now, with age and all that comes with it,
Lucky boy, made everything swirl,<eos> I'm a lucky girl.<eos> No, I don't know it.<eos> But you do!<eos> It was massive. Probably paid for this place.
We're friends.<eos> Maybe none of this is worth it.<eos> The whole point of my lube was to have less friction in the world.<eos> And all it's done is make more.<eos> You can do whatever you want with it. It's yours.
You speak English?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Great. You know this person?<eos> I don't recognize him.<eos> Sure that seems like a smart answer, except that a city traffic camera captured the tags on your car when it was used to pick him up from Atlanta Midtown Hospital on Tuesday.
- I promised Jay I wouldn't.<eos> - Jay, what do you--why?<eos> - Because Jay knew how dangerous this drug is.<eos> I should know, Barry;<eos> Snow and I worked on it together.
- out here, lady? - I was being held captive.<eos> By Nazis?<eos> No, worse.<eos> - Your helmet.<eos> - What about it?
Men, what use are they?<eos> Billy lost the same children as me, Mam.<eos> It's not the same for fathers.<eos> I can't believe you've still got that old teapot.<eos> What's wrong with it?
- Splendidly.<eos> You don't get any better, do you?<eos> But Lady Marchmont's head was in turmoil.<eos> Well, it would be.<eos> So she asked for a cold compress and took it with her to her room, which tended, in any case, to be chilly.
The truth, the Word of God... None of that, Rev. Come on.<eos> Specifically, what are they running from?<eos> Kyle, you've seen it!<eos> Holy water, the Scriptures, the cross.<eos> No, the cross just freaks 'em out once you start jabbing at 'em with it.
And we see here busy accounts indeed, money moved from here to there, robbing Peter to pay Paul.<eos> You pay a small fee to the Salvation Army to rid yourself of the great cost of the casual ward.<eos> There's nothing illegal in that.<eos> The casual ward was a drain on my resources.<eos> I freely own it.
Can you hand me a towel, please?<eos> - Meechum's hand. - What?<eos> I traced it on a wall downstairs...<eos> a while back.<eos> They've painted over it.
- That's a lot.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> Just stop doing that.<eos> This is real.<eos> Kevin has a problem and he has to face it.
And I thought, "Yeah. "I know."<eos> - Can I get a dog?<eos> - No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you won't look after it.
- Can I get a dog?<eos> - No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you won't look after it.<eos> No, I would. I'll walk it and feed it and everything.
The evidence... must have been misplaced.<eos> Call the desk sergeant...<eos> No, evidence is missing...<eos> Specifically, the Hermes scarf that was sent over by the hospital.<eos> So what did you do with it?
We have been, "duly noted".<eos> Indeed we have.<eos> Ha-ha-ha! The evening was a success!<eos> Yes!<eos> Although the exertion of it has worn me out.
How about you?<eos> How's the whole chain of custody thing going?<eos> We were able to follow Morra's coat all the way from the crime scene to the evidence control unit.<eos> So no one tampered with it.<eos> Well, I told him that we couldn't rule out what happened after it was checked into evidence.
I thought none of this was real.<eos> I guess if I really believed that, I would've left you here.<eos> Brian, when I think about the future, it's... big.<eos> Who has the drug?<eos> What are they doing with it?
I'm proud of you all. So proud.<eos> I am just sorry that I won't be here to share this with you.<eos> But I want you to keep the flag flying.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (Look after it.)
I'll see what I can do.<eos> I told you I needed the car after school today.<eos> Uh, I don't remember that, and actually I need it to get to work after rehearsal.<eos> Well, the car doesn't belong to you.<eos> We all have to share it and you have it most of the time anyway.
That's gotta be a lot of stress.<eos> I said... it's got nothing to do with Emme.<eos> Sir.<eos> My favorite piece.<eos> We'll start on it next week.
It's about winning, about providing society with superior things, and about proving that you have taste, and good values and you work hard.<eos> And what a wonderful relief, every so often, to know who the enemy is.<eos> Because in the garden, the enemy is everything.<eos> The aphids, the weather, time.<eos> And so you pour yourself into it, care so much, and see up close so much birth, and growth, and beauty, and danger, and triumph.
Yes. I was at the Kensington Mall in a blue jacket, like probably a hundred other people, and if the jacket you found had dog hairs on it, that makes sense, too.<eos> Yellow labs ‭are a pretty popular breed. Haven't been through all this?<eos> Yes, I was at the Kensington Mall.<eos> Yes, ‭I did drive a pick-up truck.<eos> I probably even drove it with my dog at my side and my blue jacket on.
We turn down the wrong hallway without it, it triggers the alarm.<eos> Turner keeps his prized paintings in a windowless concrete gallery in the middle of his house, completely insulated from the outside world.<eos> To access it, we need to get past security measure number two, a 12-digit keypad lock, and security measure number three, a heat-sensitive palm scan.<eos> All of which brings us to security measure number four, and believe me, I've saved the worst for last.<eos> Each painting is tethered to five separate wires leading into the wall behind it.
At the end of the day, I'd do anything for Sadie, and she knew it.<eos> She had me wrapped around her finger the moment I met her.<eos> Walk me through it. Tell me what happened.<eos> When Roger was done with his champagne, I retrieved the empty glass and quietly handed it off to Sadie.<eos> - What did she do with it?
But I know why they're all dead.<eos> Is that you, Rick, underneath all that man-bush?<eos> They're dead so my family, all those people out there, can be alive.<eos> I would not have messed with that guy.<eos> But that's not you anymore... is it?
What... did you go to the car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I checked the trunk, but there was just a tabletop... no legs.<eos> It's a folding table!<eos> Didn't you lift it up and see that the legs are underneath it?
-I don't know. Because his company is basically Hooters on wheels?<eos> -He's actually selling that company.<eos> -Well, he's still a public figure.<eos> What if Mr. Peanutbutter does something problematic and you have a real hot take?<eos> If I have a problem with my husband, I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.
It's a lie.<eos> You're a lie, Charlie.<eos> This pain?<eos> The pain of your loss...<eos> I long for it.
What do you mean, see it through?<eos> She's right.<eos> We have to get rid of the body.<eos> What about the car?<eos> Well, we can't just drive it out because the press are by the gate at the top of the drive and the police said they were putting officers all round the farm.
You were a damn cute little girl, Priscilla-Jean.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Fun, funny.<eos> Such a great spirit.<eos> But that temper of yours, not even your mama could handle it.
It will show the Trustees how mindful we are of their office and how much we value the traditions of our profession.<eos> You took the very words from my lips, my strawberry pudding.<eos> Where should he hang?<eos> In the school room, above the fireplace.<eos> It'll cover the hole.
For stability.<eos> There's more.<eos> - Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?
If you have information that can help us...<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Talk.<eos> Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?
It could be something at Pollack's that caused the fracturing.<eos> Next to the building, what is that rectangular object there?<eos> Oh, it's a Dumpster.<eos> Well, Dr. Hodgins said there were particulates of steel in the wounds.<eos> There's a balcony above it.
You won't kiss me.<eos> You won't even touch me.<eos> And then I find Beth's uniform?<eos> So you tell me, okay?<eos> What do you do with it anyway?
You won't even touch me.<eos> And then I find Beth's uniform?<eos> So you tell me, okay?<eos> What do you do with it anyway?<eos> You... you... you sniff it, you snuggle it, you put it on a coat rack and dance with it?
Oh, and hey, and listen, Mike is out of town for a little bit, so AJ's gonna stay with us.<eos> - For how long?<eos> - Just a couple of days.<eos> Jude doesn't get back from his school trip until Friday, so he can sleep in his bed.<eos> Great, I finally get the room to myself, and now I gotta share it again?
- "Almost any..."<eos> - Wait.<eos> If Bailey was making a big buy from Steve, and he pats her down...<eos> - Discovers the wire...<eos> - Uses it to strangle her.
I work at a pet groomer's.<eos> This dog was there a couple weeks ago.<eos> But the guy who brought him in came to get him before I was done.<eos> He was all sweaty, freaking out.<eos> He said he stole the dog from a cop who abused it, and the cop was coming back to get him.
Sure.<eos> It doesn't matter how much money a company invests in technology.<eos> You can spend tens of thousands of dollars on your firewall, on your intrusion prevention systems and your spam, on your anti-virus, and if I could just manipulate one person inside that company, I'm in.<eos> 95% of the work, when I used to do this in the past, is research and finding out about the human element and gathering information and emails and their personal emails and the conference that they were just at and who spoke before them<eos> and that person's email address so I can send that person a rigged PDF attachment that may look perfectly normal and forge it because I just spoke with this guy so I'm gonna open it.
We're right just at the beginning of that, and so you can see us trying to kind of... feel out and invent this new society and invent these new ideas of what's right and wrong.<eos> What can we depend on each other for... or what can we expect from each other?<eos> How much do we want to do that?<eos> So I think it's an incredibly creative time in human history... not just technologically but also morally and culturally.<eos> This room should know I'm here. I should be able to talk to it.
In the car.<eos> I put it in the backseat when I gave her a lift.<eos> Let me clear that out first.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Was she ever alone with it?
Down<eos> That was some kick, man<eos> Kick of the century...<eos> Why did you take the bullet?<eos> What? I don't take it everyday now, do I?
What about that one around your neck?<eos> You told me it was really powerful.<eos> Yeah, it's an ancient protection crystal.<eos> It's been passed down for several generations in my family.<eos> Can't part with it.
- What of this putter?<eos> Is it familiar to you?<eos> - I've seen it only once before.<eos> Odd piece of equipment, isn't it?<eos> Even if it works, you look like a fool using it.
No idea what you're talking about.<eos> Did these women do this to you?<eos> Did you steal their car, Mr Patterson?<eos> It was abandoned.<eos> I was just looking after it.
And the CFD, they have programs.<eos> Uh, there's a place...<eos> You're seeing things that aren't even here.<eos> Yes, I had a rough patch, okay?<eos> And I dealt with it.
Always.<eos> Wynonna Earp, the only woman so bold as to woo a man<eos> - with another woman's car.<eos> - I thought if anyone should have it, it's you.<eos> And exactly what am I to do with it?
(Both gasp) (Both) Oh my God.<eos> A truck that caters to girls who just got dumped.<eos> The Dump Truck.<eos> That's genius!<eos> Jake gave me his half of the truck, so I can do what I want with it.
I had it under control.<eos> I was talking Tighmon down.<eos> Well, I wish you'd talked faster; I wouldn't have to do your job for you.<eos> Now, bring me that tank.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?
That makes no sense.<eos> Because I'm angry.<eos> Now, how do we get out of here?<eos> We need to get over that wall.<eos> Or under it.
Yes, let's share about our common experiences.<eos> Blake Reedy, design engineer on the Foil development team.<eos> I designed the home button... with Mr. Gross' input, of course.<eos> And you brought the prototype with you to the Deviceroy conference?<eos> Yeah. I'd work on it during breaks.
Sniper on the church tower.<eos> On my signal.<eos> No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I know that burgundy junker.<eos> It's Auntie's. I saw her drive
You run a dirty one, well, you might win an election, but you lose your soul.<eos> What's the point?<eos> Even more reason why the city needs you.<eos> It's affecting the house now.<eos> They're moving the Friends of Firefighters benefit up to Morningside because they'd rather not have my name associated with it.
No, it was just because she was upset about the breakup.<eos> So was I, and tonight was a huge night for me, and you didn't show up.<eos> So the only Tiago related hashtag trending was hashtag Rolonelio.<eos> You made a choice.<eos> At least own it.
No. You want to hurt Hades, and that's the same thing.<eos> But guess what?<eos> There's no way to defeat a god.<eos> Even gods have weaknesses,<eos> I know he has the crystal, and I know what he can do with it.
That means everyone on this ship who's come in contact with Takehaya could be infected.<eos> That was my worry, too, but none of us from the prison camp have any symptoms.<eos> I crossed the virus in Takehaya's blood with a sample of my own and from several sailors who had no contact with Takehaya, Kyoko, or any of us who were prisoners.<eos> The bulkier virus doesn't make us sick.<eos> Somehow, the cure in us defends against it.
It's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice place.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I never get to enjoy it.
I'll settle for tacos.<eos> Dammit!<eos> What is the target?<eos> Very well.<eos> You are it.
How about smiling? You ever do that? Hmm?<eos> See, but it wasn't the whore's burgundy corset that gave me pause, gentlemen, nor was it the healthy merkin perched between that sweet dove's legs.<eos> No, it was that she had a tail.<eos> An honest-to-goodness tail as perky as a pretty puppy dog's<eos> But it wasn't wagging, so I was game.
Then you got me.<eos> I still can't make sense of the dead cat in his trunk.<eos> Unless it was a pet he just couldn't say goodbye to.<eos> Any luck with the computer?<eos> No, it has a password. I'm gonna have Tech get into it.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So... the ring... is in your drawer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?
Have Dr Enys clean him up.<eos> What price would you be willing to pay for that promissory note?<eos> Any.<eos> I thought so.<eos> What will you do with it?
I'm scared. Jessica, we can protect you.<eos> Evan told me he stole Zorn's laptop.<eos> He wanted to prove their lies.<eos> That story on Zorn...<eos> Evan had him working on it for months, and then it died.
This marriage... it's been a challenge like no other.<eos> I feel like I was a child before I knew you.<eos> I was able to judge you and the things you did because I never understood the darkest truths of this world.<eos> I don't want you to dwell in darkness.<eos> I want to protect you from it.
4300 block of Eagle Rock Boulevard.<eos> Buzz: Elliot Chase only has a PO Box listed, and his secondary address is his ex-wife's house in Mid-City.<eos> Hold up. Captain. Do you think the photo of the suspect should go out to the media?<eos> No.<eos> If Mr. Chase has a plan, I don't want him to accelerate it due to a press report.
What does he mean?<eos> What is the source of all of our problems?<eos> What is he going to destr...<eos> Well, I think I can answer that.<eos> The Olympian crystal and all the magic tethered to it.
- You good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ♪ Better hole up inside ♪ This stool taken?<eos> - Why?<eos> You want to throw it at me?
This isn't on me. It's on you.<eos> Henry. I'll make sure he doesn't go far.<eos> Storybrooke.<eos> Henry rid it of its magic.<eos> What happened to it?
You've known me since the day that I was conceived.<eos> W-Wha... what's going on? Oh, I think you know... Mother.<eos> You're our son.<eos> I will be.<eos> When you sprinkled that sand onto Belle, you sprinkled it onto me, too.
That's fine, chadwick.<eos> You do whatever you want, 'cause right now we're in the process of gathering All this evidence so we can get a court order for your dna.<eos> Actually, booth, i'm-i'm not sure we need dna To prove that he did this.<eos> And why exactly is that?<eos> Because as you strangled her, she took this dagger And swung it backward, Hitting you...
According to the readouts from Mom, the pathogen is a mutant hybrid of about ten types.<eos> Well, your mother was always very good with viruses.<eos> But the core one, I recognize:<eos> Keltric 0-9.<eos> I treated it on a mining colony.
You're an incurable romantic, aren't you?<eos> When it comes to you, love, I would never stop fighting.<eos> I would brave the oceans and sail past the Sirens to find my way back to you.<eos> "Meanwhile, I took a large round of wax, cut it up small with my sharp sword,<eos> I took all my men in turn and plugged their ears with it."
This place, this world hasn't been especially easy for you.<eos> Why not at least consider my offer?<eos> This world is flawed.<eos> I will give you that.<eos> But I am not ready to say goodbye to it just yet.
Please tell us.<eos> I was dating Penny and I got it stuck in my head that she wanted someone, you know... tougher.<eos> In fact, I'd seen her talking to some guys who were in gangs.<eos> I was at this party and this older guy had a gun.<eos> He was showing it off. So I was like, "Yo,
That would take just a matter of seconds.<eos> Not long enough for her airways to became inflamed and swollen causing her surrounding muscles to contract, and her-her bronchial tubes to narrow.<eos> Asthma attack?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Probably not uncommon for this woman, and usually she'd be able to manage it.
What?<eos> He didn't take a selfie, did he?<eos> No.<eos> But how often do you get to see through the killer's eyes?<eos> Camera was brand-new, only four snaps on it, all of Jared Talt and all the same.
Eduardo, Owen didn't die of sodium poisoning.<eos> He was overdosed with insulin.<eos> The day after, your sister ends up in an a diabetic coma.<eos> Jazmin's insulin kit went missing the day Owen died.<eos> And we never knew what happened to it.
You are late, Herr Thawne.<eos> You'll find that I have an entirely different concept of time than most.<eos> Did you locate the item?<eos> It's in Berlin.<eos> The Fuehrer refuses to part with it.
Come on, 6 of hearts, where are you?<eos> My kingdom for a 6 of hearts.<eos> You shut up for five minutes, I won't have to kill you.<eos> Whoo! There's that temper.<eos> Good thing your kid won't have to grow up with it like your brother did, huh?
Hey, Eamonn, you're not fooling anybody.<eos> I can see you right there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Curious that you recognize the sound of my truck.<eos> You been driving it recently?
I'll get my cap and gown.<eos> Ready when you are, Lieutenant.<eos> Chief Boden once told me,<eos> "A hero's not somebody who's unafraid.<eos> It's the guy who's scared to death and does what's right anyway."
Sort of.<eos> Why?<eos> A girl in my class has an invisible ink pen.<eos> It has a special light.<eos> You can only see the writing when you shine it.
Why not?<eos> I got a cousin there.<eos> He lives a block from the beach, he said I could stay in his guest house.<eos> So wait, wait, when did this plan come together?<eos> I'm still working on it.
Yeah, Lynn wants to be a doctor.<eos> I told her to do something more reliable, like be a poet.<eos> Well, you'll have a backup plan, then, right?<eos> What about the hospital's plan?<eos> I'm working on it.
- Okay. Bye, Robbie.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Jessica.<eos> Here's that card.<eos> If this ship's going down, I'm going down with it.
- I mean, just so I can call you when we figure out what we're doing, 'cause Iâm not sure what we're doing.<eos> - Okay, Iâm gonna give you a phone number.<eos> I don't really have a phone, but I know this guy--<eos> It's a long story.<eos> It's this guy I dated for a long time, he was actually an alcoholic and gay and he came to my house and he drank all the sangria and then I had this watermelon and he picked it up and he threw it on the floor and then he wet my bed.
They will cut you out like the cancer you are.<eos> And let's not underestimate the "filthy masses."<eos> Once they hear what you're really about, you'll need more than an army to keep them in line.<eos> But we can always drop you back off at the depot, see for ourselves.<eos> He must have commandeered a Chinese destroyer back in Asia and then navigated it through the channel remotely.
That's right, fuck the lot of you!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> You and I were loved so much even if our fathers couldn't stay around for us.<eos> Maybe we both need to be held while we grieve, but it has to be someone who can feel pain for our pain,<eos> not revel in it.
- To introduce to you... You betcha. Your Republican presidential nominee, Senator Mellie Grant!<eos> And the next Vice President of the United States, Jake Ballard!<eos> Have you heard?<eos> Vargas just announced his running mate.<eos> Who is it?
We've never gotten along.<eos> I wish I'd learned to play an instrument, probably saxophone.<eos> I told Riley that my favorite movie was Terminator.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's Psycho.
I asked and she said yes.<eos> Well, he didn't just ask me.<eos> - He put this ring in the parfait,<eos> - Ring?<eos> and I almost choked on it.
But your implants, I mean, they passed every diagnostic.<eos> - There is nothing wrong with that?<eos> - Yeah, they said it's fine.<eos> I don't know, I think I just...<eos> Felt like something was up with it.
I just definitely forgot to pack a tent.<eos> - When did you realise this?<eos> - When we got here.<eos> - What was your plan?<eos> - I'm still working on it.
Think she would've liked that.<eos> I always felt like she had a crush on you.<eos> Grace, I'm just a little bit concerned 'cause<eos> I'm pretty sure that when I took your nose I gave it back, but then you took mine and I just...<eos> I just don't know what you've done with it. Ha!
How will you look after the people or the country?<eos> You who kidnapped a child... You will give me lessons on 'Rule of Law'?<eos> Do you know how to manage a country?<eos> How would I?<eos> Never saw it managed efficiently. Exploiting the masses...
The Jews, the vets, the gays.<eos> They all rejected it and said it was too big for their, like, showrooms or stores.<eos> The divorce table.<eos> He had to have it.<eos> I didn't want it, I paid for it, and guess who is now literally stuck with it?
your liquid income.<eos> I swear to you, I didn't make that money by...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> As far as I care, you did what you had to in order to feed your child.<eos> But... the allegation was made, and so we have to combat it.
Tom is now the owner of Hawthorne Concrete.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Make this lawsuit go away.<eos> I own the company now, I didn't own it then.
There's always hope.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said, "Everything ends forever."<eos> Did I happen to mention that Mount Rainier's gonna blow?<eos> The most violent volcano in the world, and we're sitting right on top of it.
Did I happen to mention that Mount Rainier's gonna blow?<eos> The most violent volcano in the world, and we're sitting right on top of it.<eos> Yeah, well, Yellowstone Caldera's on top of...<eos> If I'd meant Caldera, I would have said Caldera.<eos> It is the most dangerous volcano in the world, and we are sitting right on top of it.
This planet, it never ceases to stop talking about luck and fate and destiny.<eos> Well, I believe in none of those things.<eos> I believe life tries to kill you from the moment you are born.<eos> And the only proper response is to fight back at every moment.<eos> If I use the weapon on the Shadow Kin, then this world dies and everyone on it, including you.
No, no.<eos> No, Prince.<eos> The time for your questions is over.<eos> Where is my... gun?<eos> What are you planning on doing with it?
Not a lane! Not a lane! Not a lane!<eos> Hey! Whoa! What's the matter with you?<eos> If you would put oil in it beforehand, you wouldn't be in the middle of the road!<eos> You better listen to the little girl.<eos> Do you want to be behind the van or under it?
- I suppose I do, yeah.<eos> - How about glass slippers?<eos> I'm a princess, not Cinderella.<eos> - What about a prince?<eos> - What about it?
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world.<eos> So, you see, now suddenly they're in an awakening that,<eos> "Oh, perhaps we need to downsize our prison system.<eos> It's gotten too expensive.<eos> It's gotten out of hand."
What did you say?<eos> Did you tell her where we're at with the case?<eos> I might have said something about the muscle car.<eos> Oh, man, you gave her our lead.<eos> She's chasing it down.
And you didn't notice, didn't report it?<eos> I keep it parked in a crappy lot.<eos> On the West side.<eos> I barely use it in the city.<eos> I use it to go up to my ma's place, up in Michigan.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I'm a... I'm a Phi Beta Kappa honor student, and I've got a chem midterm on Friday, so...<eos> Let me guess what happened.<eos> Tyler... he wanted a little bit bigger cut, right?<eos> So you take a baseball bat... crack him in the head with it.
Gets me into Stanford or Berkeley.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But will it make you happy?<eos> I mean, look at tío.<eos> He's got all those degrees, bought this sweet car, never has time to enjoy it.
Lady Sutherland.<eos> Dad just married in, but it doesn't stop him from using it for all it's worth.<eos> I'm sorry, how did I not know any of this?<eos> Could it be the accent?<eos> I actually worked really hard on it.
Let her in, please.<eos> Miss Sloane, what can I do for you?<eos> I told you Ruth was holding onto a secret.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And now I know what it is.
Your multitude of indicators boil down to three simple colors we'll measure today.<eos> The challenge... To stay green in the most tense of situations.<eos> Just how much do these little things measure?<eos> Well, they didn't say anything about late-night wrist movements, so I think you're in the clear.<eos> I like stress. I feed off it.
I think so, why?<eos> On my way in, I hid a small C-4 charge inside an electrical panel.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> I was gonna trigger it to create a distraction, get the guards running one way, while Yao and I went the other.
I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> I was the one being assaulted.<eos> On the same day you just happened to kill a man.<eos> I didn't mean to kill him.<eos> That spanner was the first thing I grabbed and I slung it.
We cannot carry on just plunging around in the darkness, hoping to find the beach.<eos> And, anyway, what is that noise?<eos> I would say that... is a waterfall.<eos> Is it something you want to come across in the dark?<eos> Because the other thing I'd say about that sound - it might be my imagination, but that sounds as though it's coming from below, like we're above it.
Where are you going?<eos> To start a new world.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move it!<eos> One other car in North America, and I'm stuck behind it.
In traditional culture, when a woman sleeps with a man outside of wedlock, she dishonors her entire family.<eos> The only way to restore that honor is through blood.<eos> If Marjan thought that Zohala and Bennett were dishonoring our family...<eos> He would kill them both.<eos> So, if there's a way you could help us find Marjan, his cell phone number, perhaps, be a good time to share it.
Did you see me?<eos> I'm a hero!<eos> HERA: (ON COMLINK) Salvageteam,whathappened?<eos> Give me that!<eos> It's okay. We encountered the sentry, but Azmorigan took it out.
I had nothing to do with what happened to that man.<eos> We believe you.<eos> Whoever killed him knew what he was.<eos> They laid in wait.<eos> You'd have to be an idiot to rent a room in your own name and then blow a guy away outside of it.
She was wearing a necklace that I also pawned there.<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> Signs on signs on signs!<eos> Are you sure it's the same necklace?<eos> Uh, yeah, Jake. I once punched it through a guy's throat, so I'm pretty sure - I remember it.
You don't get it.<eos> You know I built the time machine, more than Mason ever did.<eos> So if Rittenhouse gets her hands on it, with what they're planning to do with it, that's on me.<eos> I-I just can't live with that.<eos> What is Rittenhouse going to do with it?
Oh. Well, now, I see you've met Theodore.<eos> Theodore, these are your new roommates, Leonard and Penny.<eos> They're very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.<eos> Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?<eos> My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever
Billy, you know when I fell in love with you?<eos> State Championships in St. Paul, sophomore year.<eos> I didn't fall in love with you because you were a hockey star.<eos> You really don't know?<eos> When I was 16, my parents got me a used car, and it was always having all kinds of problems.
I return to the States this morning to rejoin my children and to put my life back together.<eos> [Gracia] Dear heavenly Father, we are grateful for today, for your grace in our lives and for days past that you've been faithful to us.<eos> And thank you for family.<eos> Pray that you would bless the food.<eos> We know that it came from your hand, too, and we're so grateful to you.
-Yeah.<eos> This is the main feeder unit.<eos> And even when all this works perfectly, there's the ultimate wild-card factor.<eos> -The paper.<eos> -So, if you're gonna buy cheap paper, you're probably gonna have problems with it.
- [door opens and closes] - Father Ibrahim... opened it and let us in, offered us protection.<eos> He closed the door and said, "Don't be afraid.<eos> You are safe now." The most important thing for them was to find somewhere safe.<eos> The church was always the safest place during these times.<eos> Over the ages, it has always been the safest place.
Oh, er... Forget I said anything.<eos> Oh, no, someone's home!<eos> I suggest we make our egress.<eos> - Egress? - It means to exit.<eos> - Whoa! I'm supposed to be babysitting it!
I think maybe we should not play that song right now.<eos> Not play what?<eos> Fuck that, Jerry. That's what the song is about.<eos> Relax, relax. We're not giving in to anything. No.<eos> No. I just say we retire it for now, okay?
- Nuclear strike.<eos> - Black hole.<eos> - God.<eos> We know what this comes down to.<eos> The Step King was very upset because when the real King pulled out his sword, it was long and shiny, and the Step King did shudder at the size of it.
I have no complaints.<eos> Every day I wake up, the world sleeps a little easier.<eos> Kaulder, you have tasted more of life than I can ever imagine, but it's been a long time since you really lived.<eos> You're missing out on the best part of our brief stay in this world.<eos> The part where you share it.
Martin gradually developed allergies to almost everything.<eos> I came to the shoot with Martin but he was nowhere to be found.<eos> Then I see him back behind the studio, from a distance he looked like a doctor.<eos> I go over to him to see what's up.<eos> And then I see he's wearing a white robe and white clothes under it.
What'd you do tonight?<eos> Just busywork around here.<eos> You're always doing busywork.<eos> We have a big house.<eos> Running it keeps a girl busy, right?
- An operating system?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the OS is what runs the computer.<eos> In fact, it sort of is the computer.
People.<eos> Watch the knife.<eos> We can feel how the current will move them, and we can see where they'll go.<eos> It's all in the movement.<eos> You see, it pushes itself. It's easier to move with it than against it.
And this latest incident.<eos> You wanna tell me about that?<eos> I lost my temper.<eos> It should never have happened.<eos> What are the chances of it happening again?
I wonder where I was in all that time.<eos> A sleepwalker.<eos> In love with the world, in love with love.<eos> (Tonio) The world's a swamp.<eos> You have to fly over it.
Just the contrary. Might be the very sign He loves you.<eos> He shows His love not by helping you avoid suffering, by sending you suffering,<eos> by keeping you there.<eos> To suffer binds you to something higher than yourself, higher than your own will.<eos> Takes you from the world to find what lies beyond it.
- Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?<eos> You like to play games. I've a game for you.<eos> I'll give you 50 million dollars to let Benji go.<eos> - Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?<eos> You're looking at it. I am the disk.
I'm okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Well, if it worked, it's not gonna be here until we drive it here tomorrow.
His ears are too close to his head.<eos> I hoped you would find his offer of a partnership more attractive.<eos> But that is up to you.<eos> Have you seen my other shoe, darling?<eos> If you don't tell me what's been the problem for the last few days, I'll need it to kick you with.
We need to hurry, this portal is set to collapse space around the Earth in about a minute, I need you to transport it!<eos> Transport it...<eos> Transport it where?<eos> Here...transport it here....we end this now.<eos> There's a catch: someone's going to have to stay behind to operate for it.
Get up fast.<eos> Damn it! Go away.<eos> Go away.<eos> My horse is panicking.<eos> Batu, I can't control it.
Hermann Goering was said to have been obsessed with the painting, and there are rumors that he inscribed on it the codes to his numbered Swiss bank account.<eos> Untold riches and all that, what?<eos> But... when the allies captured Goering...<eos> There was no mention of the painting.<eos> It had vanished once again into history, and the secret bank accounts along with it.
Just keep going straight.<eos> Found it? That's it.<eos> Please, please let's just get this done.<eos> Please.<eos> This is the cross Inna told us about, and we're supposed to dig about five meters in front of it.
Tell us the new end<eos> What happens next?<eos> No one has ever given me such a big gift<eos> I was so happy<eos> But what will I do with it?
Let me just start off by saying I'm sorry.<eos> No, really, lam very, very sorry, Vice Principal Lansing.<eos> See, I've got a bit of a temper.<eos> There's no denying that<eos> And sometimes, it gets the best of me.
You're the worst businessman ever.<eos> Mmm. I hate the title.<eos> Me too.<eos> Really?<eos> What's wrong with it?
This neighborhood isn't very pedestrian-friendly, officer.<eos> You can't arrest people for walking, can you?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> What about the shopping cart?<eos> What about it?
I should've called first. Um...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> The rat.<eos> I got it! I got it.<eos> What should I do with it? Should I kill it or...
I see a future outside of this room.<eos> Some place out there in the vastness of everything we know. In all those millions of miles.<eos> Dominic fyi.<eos> The article is finished.<eos> You gave it to me already. I'm working on it right now.
What?<eos> That car down there has moved so much.<eos> Like it was built in a factory, you know, on a production line.<eos> And then it was like shipped, like, here.<eos> And like, then this guy drove it all over the place.
- Watch me. You haven't asked me the question yet.<eos> You haven't asked me if I'm gonna let him in...<eos> Flint.<eos> Am I going to permit him to enter the bay with his Spanish treasure?<eos> Assuming, that is, he returns with it at all.
You got problem with me, you handle it like a man.<eos> - Now, Svet, calm down.<eos> - He's begging for an ass kicking.<eos> If anybody's going to be delivering an ass kicking, it's gonna be me.<eos> You pull a knife on my ship, and I'll gut you with it.
- Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.<eos> He bangs it against a wall or a piece of hard wood, or something like that.
Why?<eos> Son, the building's been running for a long time now.<eos> Whatever its original purpose was, whoever built it, they're long gone.<eos> Then who's running it now?<eos> Nobody's running it.
I was scared, but I had nothing else to lose, as I approached his office, to ask how I had done.<eos> Standing outside his door, I was trembling with fear..."<eos> OK?<eos> Josef?<eos> And remember: I've seen your dick, because you show it to us every time you go swimming, and it's not what you'd call a big dick.
It's so cute.<eos> Is it real?<eos> Mm-hmm. Mommy, I want a rabbit.<eos> I'm so sorry to interrupt, you guys... your family date.<eos> But when I saw this little guy, I just knew that the kids would love to pet it.
I feel that God is on our side.<eos> Well, let's sally forth, then.<eos> Poon-Yen, this is all you, buddy. It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.<eos> And to think that the lips of your Lord graced this very cup.<eos> Plenty of time to examine it later.
We're leaving soon too. – Out, quickly!<eos> Everyone has to get out now!<eos> – Please, listen to me!<eos> – What about the luggage?<eos> To hell with it!
"If your aunt had a mustache, she'd be your uncle."<eos> Why would Tess have this?<eos> I think some people are just born with it.<eos> The Indian girl didn't ask why.<eos> She just accepted it and dealt with it in her own way.
(HORNS HONKING) AMY: You said there wouldn't be traffic.<eos> - This is traffic. - Yep.<eos> Could be anything. Accident up ahead, active shooter.<eos> Well, probably not that.<eos> You make me any more late, and I lock you in this car and have it compacted.
I don't remember you pitching that as a possibility, Tom.<eos> Sometimes you have to gamble.<eos> Unfortunately, our horse did not win.<eos> No, it certainly didn't.<eos> It fell at the first fence and it got shot. And now some French fucker's got it in a baguette.
I called 3 times.<eos> We have a conference.<eos> What's that?<eos> - I fixed your bike.<eos> While I was out shopping on it?
Welcome to Ban Nam.<eos> Hello.<eos> Great that it worked out.<eos> Elisabeth.<eos> Once she finds a gift, she sticks with it.
Allegro mi sembrava Amor tenendo meo core in mano, e ne le braccia avea madonna involta in un drappo dormendo.<eos> Poi la svegliava, e d'esto core ardendo lei paventosa umilmente pascea;<eos> appreso gir lo ne vedea piangendo.<eos> Dante's first sonnet.<eos> It fascinated Cavalcanti.
Those people are frauds.<eos> On the phone I asked if you could locate an object?<eos> Yes.<eos> He used to take this everywhere with him.<eos> He still sleeps with it.
Let's you and me go talk to the weatherman.<eos> Wait.<eos> Me?<eos> What?<eos> And that high pressure system is gonna move right through here and with it comes the cuddle-up weather, folks. Start making that hot cocoa.
it was a damn good place to party.<eos> It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah, with the three things Carlos liked most:<eos> - sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers. - Whoo-hoo-hoo!<eos> Let's get down!<eos> The problem was no longer demand... it was supply.
Well, I think it's normal... I really do.<eos> Juan Pablito, go play with your dad for a little while, OK?<eos> Honey, you should play with the kids a little bit.<eos> Leave the gift here.<eos> I'll look after it.
And the girl, I will decide what happens to her.<eos> As you said, this is your territory.<eos> You make the decisions.<eos> The world is changing.<eos> We have to change with it.
At its core, it's a social experiment designed to test the psychological effects of deep space travel.<eos> With Kepler's first actual manned mission just a few years away, we need to know how these four astronaut hopefuls will react to unforeseen challenges on board the ship.<eos> You can think of it as a... an elaborate dress-rehearsal.<eos> Where is this ship you keep mentioning?<eos> You're sitting on it.
He needs to see a doctor.<eos> Yeah. We tried.<eos> Are you working on a new lead?<eos> This is where Donnie Putnam and Megan Brooks were killed, but this area is interesting.<eos> What about it?
Jack Nicholson's nose was wacked but he goes to the wife and says<eos> It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up which is fine with me.<eos> "But Mrs. Mulwray," I goddam nearly lost my nose.<eos> And I like it.<eos> I like breathing through it.
His great tail wrapping around her ankle... - ...and up and up and... - Yes.<eos> WITCH: Give me another chance. Please.<eos> You failed once, pet. WITCH:<eos> But she knew the language.<eos> - She spoke it?
Not so mythical as you think, young man.<eos> The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic, and likely much older.<eos> It was an oral tradition for the most part, like most now-dead languages.<eos> We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.<eos> And if I were to tell you it's spoken now?
Solanum nigrum.<eos> Nightshade botanical. Remember it.<eos> Were you born with the gift?<eos> I learned it.<eos> You were born with it.
[ Gasps ] Or when we broke into Tom's house and we locked his girlfriend in the closet?<eos> We sound totally insane when you string 'em all together.<eos> You ready for another crazy adventure?<eos> The crazier, the better!<eos> - [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] So, like, normally, this is the moment where I would pound my drink and then smash it against the wall, but I'm kind of at a loss here.
How could I let myself get back here?<eos> Alex, it's not your fault.<eos> And they call me crazy.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We will probably never be rich... and we'll most likely live in a place that's not that big, but we'll work hard and we'll love each other and... we'll find so much happiness that we won't even know what to do with it. We'll share it with our kid. Our kids.
All the time, he would just fall asleep on the couch, a cigarette hanging out his mouth.<eos> I'd go by and put it out.<eos> Then one night, not too long after, he fell asleep on the couch drunk as a skunk, that cigarette hanging out of his mouth.<eos> I got you and your brothers and sisters out of bed, and we went over to aunt mabel's to sleep.<eos> And that night, that house that I loved so much burned to the ground, and your Uncle Clyde burned right with it.
He be growling like a little silverback, I know, I know.<eos> My little man, there.<eos> Lucious, I don't like the way your voice sound in the mix.<eos> Your voice should be above the mix.<eos> And right now it sounds like you hiding behind it.
Oh, my god.<eos> Get it together, Kenny.<eos> This is a ball we do not drop.<eos> Mr. Karn, I know you said no interruptions, but there's an urgent call from Mr. Bruce Tamminy from the San Pedro parole office.<eos> He says it's regarding your client Charles Manson.
They would like you to come down to the P.D. and speak with them.<eos> - What for?<eos> - They just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> You can leave your car here.<eos> That officer will take care of it.
The best.<eos> Mummy won't love you if you're second best.<eos> He's clearly one to watch.<eos> If you like tennis, you will certainly like my next guest.<eos> It is the wunderkind, Charles Lloyd Poole.
- Please, I do not do nerves.<eos> - Do you want to know what I think?<eos> You do know my answer to that question never changes, right?<eos> There's only one way to lay those doubts to rest.<eos> And it ain't sitting around here driving yourself crazy.
I'm the lucky girl who pulled you out of the garbage.<eos> - You've seen my face. - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Your outfit kind of sucks, by the way.<eos> Yeah, it's a work in progress.
I didn't do it lightly.<eos> Now, I humbly beg for your help.<eos> I don't know where they've taken Samara.<eos> Help me find her and I will give you what you want.<eos> The cipher, and with it the formula for the gunpowder.
You want me to kiss the ring, Louis, after what you did?<eos> You're damn right I do, because I don't care how it got up there.<eos> My name is on that wall whether you like it or not.<eos> - Hey. What do you think of this tie?<eos> I think... I want to tie you up with it.
Thanks, guys.<eos> Just tell me this much. Did you get the rock from my house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> But what are we supposed to do with it now? Don't worry.
And now you trust him.<eos> If your boy is connected to Jonas, it won't be long till Whispers will find you.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> My child.<eos> Who now is your father, if it is not me?
We haven't established for certain that I have it yet.<eos> There's much that Daedalus, the great inventor, hasn't told us.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> No.<eos> For instance, he was just about to explain exactly what he was going to do with it.
Back off, man.<eos> Just walk away.<eos> I'm talkin' to Mr. Setrakian.<eos> You made a deal, old man.<eos> I'm here to see that you honour it.
Take this.<eos> Get everyone ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I'm working on it.
The bartender looks to the Grounder, he says, "we don't serve your kind around here."<eos> The Reaper gets up and leaves.<eos> You get it?<eos> Reapers eat Grounders.<eos> I will take Jaha's staff and beat you to death with it.
I'll have you know I have great follow-through.<eos> Come in, Raven.<eos> I made it.<eos> I hope you have a plan.<eos> Still working on it.
A last surviving artifact of a place that meant so much to us.<eos> It's all that we have left.<eos> You pumpkins got bigger problems than your costumes.<eos> I just got word that Sue is the new coach of Vocal Adrenaline.<eos> So you get fired from your old job, and despite hating show choir and never having coached it before, you're our new coach.
Insurance talk?<eos> It's the worst.<eos> I remember, uh, with my kids and the dentist.<eos> Yeah. Got a minute to talk about next week's spread?<eos> Already working on it.
Officer 2: Step back, folks.<eos> Tolson: Hey, Sam. Haven't seen you in the jungle in a dog's age.<eos> What's the story, tolson?<eos> Fire was called in at 4:45 A.M.<eos> Hook and ladder couldn't get it under control till 9:00.
Uh, hey, wait a minute.<eos> There's no Josh Hayes here.<eos> Uh, must be new.<eos> Just, uh, check the system again.<eos> Now your evil twin router's gonna pose like a trusted network, tricking all the employee's devices into connecting to it, and then eavesdropping on their traffic.
I have always loved your spunk.<eos> But you're a terrible liar.<eos> You're right, I can't fake it.<eos> I know a fraud when I see one.<eos> And buddy, you're it.
That's when you washed your hands of me.<eos> I'm taking you to the bus stop tonight.<eos> Do you know what killed her?<eos> The necklace. That's all it was.<eos> Dropped it in the sea, went in after it.
(somber folk music)<eos> (Audrey): So what are we supposed to do... Just wave our arms a bit, and, poof, we've converted the aether'?<eos> - If only it were that easy.<eos> This is just the first step.<eos> And it's just a theory. Truth is, I've never even seen this much aether before, much less controlled it.
Take this city, for example.<eos> There are 10 million people here, 10 million souls, each one of them searching for meaning in their lives.<eos> But how many actually find it?<eos> See that cross?<eos> Countless people pass underneath it every day, but how many notice it?
What's he fighting, Will?<eos> You were asking about the dog.<eos> Last night, a vet called the police.<eos> Leeds and his oldest boy took the dog into the vet the afternoon before they were killed.<eos> What's going to happen to it?
- Come on.<eos> Look, we've got the gun. Why don't we just let him...?<eos> Wait, wait. I don't want it.<eos> All right'?<eos> I don't... I don't feel good with it. - Who wants it?
Nice and easy.<eos> Play nice, and I'll be nice. Please.<eos> Don't do anything.<eos> - This is fuckin' retarded.<eos> - No one's saying it isn't, but we either hand over the gun or we open fire with it.
- The pleasure is all mine.<eos> I am proud that I can show you my software ... which will change the entire information system of CRDF.<eos> The code, Mr. Dufour.<eos> You will not be disappointed.<eos> I worked on it for 20 years already.
I only wrote code that allowed the intrusion, not the code to set a fire.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Who else knew about this code? See, that's the thing;<eos> I don't know. Nelson.<eos> I shared it on a few forums. But, look, it was a long time ago.
It's all right here.<eos> Between 1945 and 1982, there were over 1,703 nuclear tests around the world.<eos> Each explosion sent a trail of energy way out into space.<eos> Over time, we created a beacon.<eos> And they just followed it here.
Wow.<eos> That is cool.<eos> See?<eos> You have my number.<eos> What you do with it now is up to you.
And, uh...<eos> I got to say, this whole thing is very... unique.<eos> More to the point, I mean, it's brought up a lot of, uh, premarital concerns. It's a good thing.<eos> It's just, like I said before, we got to untangle them to find the real underlying issue.<eos> Okay. What is it?
I'll start with the guard duty logbook. Jim...<eos> Winkler was my witness.<eos> No way I'm letting this ride.<eos> I asked him to come in here, I'm gonna find his killer.<eos> No matter who it is.
I learned this as a child. Did you not?<eos> Bobbi, anything?<eos> Sir, we have evidence he's here at the hospital.<eos> It's a big place, though. He might be hiding anywhere.<eos> Well, we know he needs nitrogen, and they use it in hospitals to power surgical equipment.
I would never patronize the...<eos> Well, the... things change.<eos> That's what I'm saying. So maybe if you can learn to control this, then... you could have avengers-level powers, something like Captain America, even.<eos> I think it best we keep in mind the unstable nature of Skye's power.<eos> If there is an Avenger equivalent, right now I'm afraid it's the Hulk.
- Sure.<eos> Jon left this morning.<eos> He's in Frankfurt, already finding a place.<eos> I can't find the cat.<eos> I mean, if you see it, put it in a home, would you?
- I have a problem with security.<eos> I have to go talk to Randy.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Leave the dog with me.<eos> - I'll deal with it. - Whoa.
It was never my intention that you made her your accomplice.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> No... but you could have corrupted her timeline and prevented her from leaving the message, which starts our entire investigation.<eos> Time is cruel, Mr. Cole.<eos> We are risking everything by toying with it, taunting it. Believe me.
Don't let the world tell you who you are.<eos> Show the world the person you've always wanted to be.<eos> Let me give you the power to bring real change into your life.<eos> Don't be afraid to unlock your full potential and unleash your inner beast.<eos> The world's a hard place, but you don't have to face it alone, because once you have AO in your life, it stays with you forever.
Consider it a preventative measure for next time.<eos> You think you're the only ones who've lost people? You think you're the only ones with pain?<eos> You think you can take your shit and dump it on me?<eos> You don't get to do that!<eos> So you take your goddamn pain and you live with it, assholes!
Just do it!<eos> Hey, sounds like they got the engines going.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Based on our current acceleration, time to impact is now forty seconds.<eos> We can't outrun it?
Who is that man you were talking to?<eos> We have to go, Tommy.<eos> CHAPTER FOUR THE NEEDS OF THE MANY<eos> How do we find our true purpose?<eos> Is it something we're born with, written into our genetic code?
Read the highlighted, right there.<eos> "This day... "<eos> "This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand and I will strike you down."<eos> So that all on earth know that there is a God in Israel.<eos> And David reached into his pocket, and he pulled out a stone. And he slung it, and it struck the Philistine in the head. And he fell.
Oh, my God.<eos> That is exactly what I'm doing.<eos> You know, sometimes, I see this glimmer in you.<eos> - You know, you're...<eos> - if you eat that last danish, I will reach down your throat, pull it out, and beat you to death with it!
It's a controlled environment.<eos> It means he's already been checked for a weapon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> That plane leaves, our business goes with it.
We are fine.<eos> A girl as sweet as you does not require dessert; You are sweet enough already.<eos> I meant that figuratively.<eos> I was using sweetness as a metaphor.<eos> I hope I did not suck the romance out of the compliment by overexplaining the logic behind it.
Are you okay? Oh, uh... yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.<eos> I tried to take it in and stuff, but it had other ideas.
Stop talking about the tunnel.<eos> - Tell me you have the cure.<eos> - There is no cure.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I worked on it.
Do you think I should drop the class and try to take it again next semester?<eos> Only you can make that decision.<eos> You guys have been apart for a while and it's gonna take you some time to readjust.<eos> But there's this pressure for every moment to be perfect.<eos> And he's got this whole world out there without me and he seems to really love it.
The bunker.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't want you here.<eos> Boy, driving to New York sure was a great idea, Dad.<eos> Hey, what did I say about using sarcasm, little lady?<eos> That you're not sure how it works.
- Here you go.<eos> Here we go.<eos> So, first you grab the teat like this.<eos> Okay?<eos> You massage the teat, and then you gently tug on it.
What's "the football"?<eos> It's a briefcase that follows POTUS everywhere. It's cuffed to the Secret Service.<eos> It has the locations of our hidden silos around the world and a detonator the president can use to activate a remote launch.<eos> Doctors had to remove the case from Bruce's wrist to operate.<eos> What did they do with it?
Uh... yeah.<eos> - - I-I think so.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about your big toe?<eos> Can you move it for me?
Come on.<eos> You looked in his eyes and saw someone who could get you what you wanted.<eos> That, too.<eos> So, you gonna give the phone to my father?<eos> What's he gonna do with it?
- Don't take the piss.<eos> Is there someone else here?<eos> I have a new care model.<eos> Right.<eos> Can I speak to it?
crushed.<eos> It could not survive.<eos> He gave it to me, wanted to see what I'd do.<eos> I didn't want to make that choice.<eos> But he left me with it.
Mr and Mrs Hawkins.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> We have a computer with copies of Leo's memories.<eos> They show everything.<eos> If you don't let Mia and the others go... - .. we'll take it to the press.
You need to use your head.<eos> You're acting like you can somehow control this by keeping me locked inside that house.<eos> But you and I both know that won't make a difference.<eos> My... my time is gonna pass no matter what you do.<eos> So I might as well do something with it that I want.
What's that?<eos> This is near where you killed Lucas in cold blood.<eos> That was different.<eos> I don't see how.<eos> You made your choice, now you live with it.
- Hey.<eos> What if Susie wasn't actually driving her car?<eos> You think she was moved in her own vehicle?<eos> Well... [sighs]<eos> I mean, you can see a driver, but you can't see who it is.
It was Castor. I panicked.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He had your cat, it's okay. Oh, it's far from okay.<eos> Now Castor has this code because you didn't trust what I would do with it?
There was a company in Seattle that Danny did a lotion line with.<eos> He was working very closely for many months with the most darling Japanese chemist.<eos> What was her name-<eos> - Emiko?<eos> I'm so sorry that you don't consider our efforts worthwhile, but I have certainly granted you latitude to pursue the things you find interesting. I thought the scent was lovely, but Dan didn't like me to wear it.
You didn't know our mother, Zelena, but I did.<eos> And yet, we both suffered.<eos> She hurt you and she hurt me, too.<eos> But our own worst enemy isn't her or each other.<eos> It's ourselves.
First time, we did a conga line.<eos> Second time, you woke us up at 3:00 in the morning to sing, "She's a Molly Good Fellow."<eos> Fourth time... was that when she wanted to fire Mike's police pistol in the air?<eos> Well, I didn't really want to shoot it.<eos> I just wanted to, you know, wave it around in the air.
Do not go dark.<eos> Keep contact through Green and Taylor.<eos> I say again, do not go dark.<eos> We got a lead, X.O.<eos> - Need to follow it. - I say --
I'm her son.<eos> Well, her temperature now is 103.1.<eos> Wet towel and extra strength, that's it?<eos> Okay, and then what do you think I should do if it doesn't go down'?<eos> Lukewarm water on a towel and rub it on her'?
Doesn't matter what I think.<eos> It matters what she wants.<eos> Caleb, I had a bad thought.<eos> You know that video of me and you that "a" used to trap Spencer and Aria, what if the cops get a hold of it?<eos> Well, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it.
Oh, you really do have exquisite hands, Olivia.<eos> She's damn lucky to have climbed out of this gene pool.<eos> I've always been terrified the day would come when you would find me and want answers, but I...<eos> I don't deal with fear at all well. I...<eos> I run away from it.
Ah! The princess we've been waiting for.<eos> But do you know who your king is?<eos> Is it me?<eos> - Or is it me?<eos> Which one do you want it to be?
Look, I'm not discussing this with you.<eos> Ah, well, he sounds crazy about you, so... I'm guessing you're the problem.<eos> You're the one who can't commit. What's that all about?<eos> Look, there's just an issue, okay?<eos> And I'm not sure I can get past it.
I'm just trying to figure out how this got on the docket.<eos> Have you all been conferring along the way?<eos> Well, Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> My God, it wasn't on the ground. He was swinging it around. He was dangerous.
- Why you took me in, I'll never know.<eos> - You were hungry.<eos> Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, by the authority granted me by the President of the United States,<eos> I call upon you to give yourselves up.<eos> Someone once asked if I wanted to save the world or rule it.
Bill.<eos> Our banker just handed me this note.<eos> Says it's counterfeit.<eos> He's right.<eos> Did he get a description of the man who passed it?
Right away.<eos> He said it has to be right away.<eos> Okay. Um, maybe because Daisy's selling it today.<eos> And for some reason, he wants me to drive with my thumbs.<eos> Drive it with your thumbs?
If you're going to make me sleep in it, I am going to drink in it.<eos> Well, just be careful.<eos> I only have one Clorox wipe that has to last till my next birthday, and it's already lost a lot of its moisture.<eos> I don't see why we have to just sit here.<eos> We can't drive it.
I am feeling stronger already, definitely.<eos> You coming to Bird's tonight?<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Ofe and I have to finish a project.<eos> Couldn't you do it this weekend?
I should've just left well enough alone. You know?<eos> Things were fine between us before I got us involved in all this superhuman crap.<eos> Cat, you can't change who you are, okay?<eos> You keep looking for your greater purpose.<eos> - This could be it. - Good morning, Captain.
Uhh.. What do you want?<eos> Uhh, status report.<eos> What's your status?<eos> I'm fine, thanks but I was talking about the ship.<eos> What about it?
We are not drinking your filthy hand water, Chanel.<eos> I will.<eos> I will drink the soup, Chanel.<eos> I will.<eos> - Can we stop with the gross, weird hazing for a second and talk about what I thought we were sitting down to talk about? That there's a serial killer on campus and we need to figure out who it is.
Dude's a ghost from 2012 to 2014.<eos> Then, two months ago, he reappears in New Orleans.<eos> Percy, here, found an address at a one-bedroom rental in Westwego.<eos> Questions on the table:<eos> who was Yaden working with, where's the missile now, and what the hell do they plan to do with it?
Our intelligence services have uncovered a plot against your government.<eos> A coup.<eos> We believe it to be quite credible.<eos> Why couldn't you have just called to tell me that?<eos> Because at least two high-level United States officials are behind it.
Who was that?<eos> Morning, sunshine.<eos> Was that your team?<eos> Is there any progress?<eos> They're working on it.
Look, I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.<eos> Just... so hard to talk around the office these days.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> I saw you today staring into your coffee mug for a minute, straight.<eos> You know I talk to it sometimes, and I beg it to wake me up.
Anything we need to look at again?<eos> No, no.<eos> It seems in order.<eos> Oh, your necklace.<eos> What about it?
I'll see you in the morning.<eos> (Max) OK. Long story short, I did some pretty awesome shit and I found 'em.<eos> This is who's planning Saviour.<eos> And the back-up plan.<eos> There's a bunker, and this is the secret unit behind it.
Right, let's move on.<eos> Now, last year McLaren gave us the astonishing P1, and Porsche gave us the equally fantastic 918.<eos> But we've always known that there is another hybrid supercar coming.<eos> Well, it's not coming any more.<eos> It's here, it's the one you've all been waiting for, and I have been driving it -
He chose not to know me.<eos> He chose not to know me when I won a state title. He chose not to know me when I won a national title. He chose not to know me when I got drafted.<eos> He wanted nothing to do with me after all of that.<eos> He wanted nothing to do with me.<eos> So this number... You see it? This number.
Look around you, Ronnie.<eos> What do you see?<eos> No-one is hurt.<eos> Enemy has fled.<eos> And that picture was an act of vandalism long before our friend with the red paint got hold of it.
I admire your initiative.<eos> Well, then you're gonna love my gumption and spunk.<eos> Sadly, I'm afraid they outshine your tactical sense.<eos> I'm fictional, immortal.<eos> Drop the watch, and I'll simply dive after it.
We invoke the old ones.<eos> We invoke our makers.<eos> That's so weird.<eos> It's like the walls are made of some sort of onyx.<eos> The entire basement's lined with it.
Fancy.<eos> You want to know something cool?<eos> My partner here, he's a tech whiz, right?<eos> I, uh, am.<eos> He could look at your surveillance stuff, and he could tell you if someone had tampered with it like that.
Give in to your anger.<eos> Neglect that deer.<eos> Honey, it's gonna be okay.<eos> These men are from the Cervine Institute of of elk, moose, deer, and stag.<eos> They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border.
To be celebrated, never relegated or regulated.<eos> That's all.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm sorry, Leo, dinner's gonna have to wait.<eos> The press wants a head on a stick, and I don't want it to be mine.
I didn't expect to see you here today.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> Turns out you don't even need an appendix.<eos> I don't even miss it anymore.
Makes you wonder what else she's lied about, huh?<eos> Wait - - I've owed Jay money for 20 years, and you never told me?<eos> I didn't think you'd want to take it.<eos> I finally understand the invisible wall that's been between Jay and me all this time.<eos> This is why we're not laughing about that crazy grill, taking an awesome selfie with it, posting it on Instagram, sending hilarious e-mails back and forth!
There's no turning back.<eos> We're going to tell Claire and Gloria what we did.<eos> I'm scared, Phil, okay?<eos> They count on that fear.<eos> They feed off it.
I've already told you,<eos> I have no idea what happened to that woman.<eos> Now, I want to be released, and I want my phone back.<eos> The funny thing about that phone.<eos> Our tech guy is on it right now.
Am I?<eos> I will do whatever you want so that no one else gets hurt.<eos> If that means going to Mexico with you and turning into whatever it is that you want me to be, then that's what it is.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'm gonna check out the other car, see if we can't use it to get across the border, and we'll go by night.
Crouch down a bit, then wiggle your butt...<eos> That's it<eos> Not bad!<eos> Time for your close-up!<eos> Look at you, dancing with it How about that?
It didn't bring Holden back.<eos> No.<eos> Your son is gone.<eos> And the pain you're feeling will never go away.<eos> But you used it tonight.
(chuckles softly) Yes!<eos> You can finally appreciate the beauty of your work.<eos> Death is your art.<eos> I stand in awe of your talent.<eos> But what will you do with it, now that you understand?
It is time to vote.<eos> thisisnothingpersonal.<eos> nina,you'rejustnot the nina,you'rejustnot the strongest player on the tribe.<eos> I 'llgotallythe votes.<eos> If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, Idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
♬ Where are you? ♬<eos> Mr. Shin, I have a request.<eos> A request?<eos> What is it?<eos> You know the pain you have, can't you now share a little bit of it with Mr. Cha?
This case does have its roots in South Africa.<eos> And not just South Africa.<eos> The bloody Boer War.<eos> This could be war booty.<eos> However it came to be, if Archibald Brooks came into possession of this diamond, swapping identities with Douglas would provide him with the opportunity to flee with it.
Dinner. Okay?<eos> Friday night?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Amber begs me to be partners with her on our history project.<eos> We're supposed to work on it tonight and she just bailed on me.
You're wearing sunglasses.<eos> Shit.<eos> The glasses.<eos> Man, look, my car is busted.<eos> I can't take it anywhere.
Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.<eos> Oh, the hell she doesn't.<eos> You have her holed up in here, hiding from the world.<eos> That is not how you handle a scandal.<eos> You face it with your head held high.
I thought she loved me.<eos> But after she got that jar, I... I meant nothing to her.<eos> She was like a drug addict or something.<eos> What about the champagne bottle?<eos> I brought it over a couple of days later.
But, yeah, so we lost a challenge today, one of us is<eos> Challenge today, one of us is going home, so i think we formed Going home, so i think we formed bonds regardless. Bonds regardless.<eos> For me that's massive. For me that's massive. jeff:<eos> jeff: Allright.<eos> If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,
- Wherever you want.<eos> Hmm... Somewhere... Somewhere magical.<eos> Somewhere new!<eos> Ah, there is nowhere new under the sun!<eos> Above it, on the other hand...
I think it's going to be drawn with a chainsaw.<eos> On that note, it is time to vote.<eos> Vote.<eos> I'll go tally the votes.<eos> If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, Idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
I don't know who he is or why you trusted him, but it was a mistake.<eos> He was probably followed.<eos> Why should we trust you?<eos> I told you, I was with the Justice Department.<eos> Ow the system and how to keep your friend safe from it.
Gifted amateur.<eos> Rule number one, always keep your muzzle pointed<eos> - in a safe direction.<eos> - I don't need instructions.<eos> Be sure of your target and what's beyond it.
What are you talking about?<eos> No need to play coy, Qasim.<eos> We found your prints at the crime scene.<eos> And your knife is being analyzed in our lab.<eos> Only a matter of time before it comes back as a match to the one used to kill Captain Landis.
I don't know.<eos> Mr. Korkmaz. NCIS.<eos> We're here to ask you some questions regarding some information linked to your home computer.<eos> Uh, it is a... it is a business computer.<eos> More specifically, it's about remote access to it obtained by... this woman, Ensign Janine Wilt.
He's moving in today.<eos> Wish him well from me.<eos> And I hope he gets more fun out of his hamper than Mr Carson did.<eos> Why?<eos> What was the matter with it?
Sherlock.<eos> We're awaiting a friend of Olivia's.<eos> How goes your search?<eos> We found the car.<eos> We think Oscar drove it to Long Island, possibly to stash Alfredo, but beyond that...
Why haven't you gone to the Board?<eos> Because I can't prove it.<eos> Ferguson made sure that Jodie Spiteri is not a viable witness.<eos> So we just have to wait for her to do something else?<eos> If I find proof and I go to the Board with it, will you support me?
That won't be necessary, phil.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Just the fact that you offered Is good enough for me.<eos> You know what?<eos> How about tomorrow I go back to that parking lot And I drop a little caution cone in front of it?
You came back to the Hill ranting about pumping the brakes on the project, but here you are hitting the gas.<eos> Why's that? Well, we're still at war on three continents.<eos> - I heard that somewhere.<eos> - No. The real reason you came back is you can't stand the idea that the gadget could be built without you.<eos> You can't stand having anyone else's name on it.
Oh, my God. Is that our truck?<eos> It's got top of the line new appliances, a new engine, an A.C. unit... the works.<eos> It looks amazing.<eos> And it's got your name on it.<eos> I figured if Ed Sheeran is tweeting about how awesome your truck is, you should capitalize on that and drive it down to Coachella.
There is no way we can get a permit for that.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> That is unless I already got you one.<eos> - Shwah! - Shwah?<eos> And if you leave now, you guys can get there before it starts.
We're, like, on the Internet.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Laura. Where's that essay you owe me?<eos> Oh, right. Working on it.
There exists a small percentage of the population with a dormant alien gene mixed into their DNA.<eos> There's a chemical compound that activates this gene, giving them unnatural abilities.<eos> Okay.<eos> This chemical compound, called Terrigen, was recently released into our ecosystem.<eos> And you, Joey, are one of the first people with this gene to come into contact with it.
Cut it out.<eos> Weren't you listening?<eos> I'm under the Mayor's personal protection.<eos> And it's absolute, apparently.<eos> Look, she controls the raven, so I will never have to face it. This is clever.
Yep.<eos> Sure did.<eos> Vine is gonna love this one.<eos> Okay, just go with the momentum of the bull.<eos> Don't try and fight it.
Who knows what darkness still clouds his soul?<eos> We will see what becomes of it on our way out of this godless, damp hole.<eos> I'm sorry, brother.<eos> I owed you, Calo and the others the truth.<eos> When I buried my sword, I should not have buried all of my past with it.
Fitz will find a way.<eos> After all, we're going for dinner.<eos> _<eos> What is it you always say?<eos> If you can't solve a problem, sleep on it.
He was teaching a screenwriting class called "the Camera and the Story."<eos> What do you got there, Sykes?<eos> Wallet, keys, cellphone.<eos> Well, doesn't seem like robbery is the motive.<eos> Of course, in school shootings, it never is.
Unite it?<eos> It was once one blade.<eos> It was broken in half a long, long time ago.<eos> What happens when they're together?<eos> He wants to kill Merlin with it.
- That's great, Mom.<eos> Let's get that darkness out of you. Yes, let's.<eos> Where's the sword?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one's come back with it.
And you know what this means, right?<eos> He didn't use magic to lead the troops into battle.<eos> They followed him because they believed in him.<eos> Oh, as touching as this family drama is, we need the helm.<eos> And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you from leaving DunBroch with it.
But because Kayla isn't in the picture, we have to question whether it's her specific blanket or one bought to look like it.<eos> That's Kayla's.<eos> She chewed on it when she was teething.<eos> That's how the ear got torn.<eos> She... she sleeps with it.
Please don't do this!<eos> Please don't do this!<eos> - Summer!<eos> - Summer, listen carefully.<eos> I stole a paper clip, and I have it in my cheek, but I don't know what to do with it, and it hurts.
Unique ability to take organs from one victim and transplant them.<eos> - It certainly fits with what we've seen.<eos> - And what I've seen.<eos> And you know where it is?<eos> Well, a friend of mine is... looking after it.
It's just been so long since we've had real news.<eos> I'm just so happy!<eos> There will be a Town Hall meeting this afternoon to discuss replacing him.<eos> New mayor, huh?<eos> Wonder who it could be... 2x14
Has it?<eos> This is the name of a man in Oakland.<eos> He intended to sell the film but, tragically, was murdered.<eos> The film in his possession has vanished.<eos> What have you done with it?
Can you hear me?<eos> It's really important you wake up.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Listen to my voice.<eos> Follow it to the surface.
Are you sure we're safe here?<eos> Am I sure?<eos> Um, no.<eos> This building was seized by NYPD a week ago in a drug bust.<eos> There's no paperwork connecting it to me.
Ha ha!<eos> You know what?<eos> A little extra piece of advice.<eos> A lot of people want the Phoenix stone.<eos> Mess with it, and you end up dead.
Great.<eos> Do you want to talk about it?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Ok. Didn't think so.<eos> So, uh, Enzo found some sword in Oscar's car and is under the impression it will kill Julian.
You could say that.<eos> Is that a good thing?<eos> Mostly.<eos> But... I just found out about this habit he has.<eos> And I'm trying to figure out if I can... Handle it or not.
And my son would like to wet his sword with you.<eos> So do we fight?<eos> Storri?<eos> The signs are good.<eos> Only this morning, I saw a raven fly towards the Saxon camp, and it was asking me to follow.
000 yen.<eos> You may go.<eos> Aren't you forgetting something?<eos> - The film.<eos> - What about it?
She said she dreamed... that a woman had come and cut her hair.<eos> Marina, I left my job to hear about Anja's dream?<eos> And yesterday, there was the teapot.<eos> She said she saw the reflection of a woman on it.<eos> She said it seriously, so she took a towel and covered it.
Longer.<eos> That must get old fast.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Come on, you know.<eos> The rush of adrenaline once, you want it again and again, right?
Kind of seems like you understand me.<eos> Of course I do. I read your file.<eos> BRIAN:<eos> I remember this feeling. The world is mine.<eos> I just have to decide what to do with it.
That's strange.<eos> What is?<eos> The Markus Ivey crime scene and the bassinet next to the body.<eos> There's a small blue blanket.<eos> What about it?
No one can be trusted, not the CIA, not the FBI...<eos> - nobody.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I got in too deep.<eos> I thought I could know evil without becoming it.
I have commandeered the security cameras at the station, but there's no sign of Knox.<eos> Sounds like you could use some help.<eos> Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> Somebody's gotta protect that train.<eos> And once it gets moving, even the DEO won't be able to keep up with it.
With a second gun I just happen to be carrying?<eos> We both carried a second piece back then, Marty.<eos> And according to the lab results, that gun lacks wear and tear consistent with a weapon that sat outside on a roof for the last 15 years.<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> Somehow, I get my hands on this piece Grazioso stole, use it to pop Green, then hang onto it for 15 years
I don't think there's any doubt about that.<eos> NARRATOR: By the end of the year,<eos> Simoncelli had emerged as one of the fastest of them all.<eos> He hadn't won a race yet, but he'd won a lot of hearts.<eos> He was just what many people wanted in a motorcycle racer, a demon on the bike and a nice guy off it.
You cannot believe the misfortune.<eos> It's Lorenzo leading, Rossi in second, Bradl in third.<eos> Dani Pedrosa has everything to do on these first couple of laps.<eos> COMMENTATOR 2: There was some problem with the front brake.<eos> They managed to get it cleared. It was too late for Pedrosa to catch the safety car, that's why he had to start from back of the grid.
I backtracked the movements of the pickup truck throughout the day.<eos> This is the guy who drove the truck to the park where Callen and Sam picked it up.<eos> Got an ID on him?<eos> No, there's never a clean shot of his face.<eos> What about the building behind it?
You got to believe that.<eos> We got in this thing for the same reason... to put an end to it.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - Katya's notebook.<eos> What about it?
I'm gonna get your sketch on the air.<eos> Wait, so you love it?<eos> No, it's terrible.<eos> I told you.<eos> [ groans ] but listen, fozzie. You and i are gonna work on it every night after the show For as long as it takes until it's ready.
Judaism, Christianity and Islam... all believe that God has a special connection to this area.<eos> They all believe that this is where people will ascend to Heaven when the day of judgment comes.<eos> They all want it, but they don't want to share it.<eos> FANTHORPE: Temple Mount has been a holy place for many, many generations.<eos> And there are strange religious traditions, rumors, legends of what lies underneath it.
No, I'm still doing it.<eos> Okay. Don't be offended, but... what went wrong with you?<eos> I-I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn't run away or kill itself.<eos> That really happened?<eos> I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car.
Sylvester, how far away is the train?<eos> Its current path has it just a few minutes from you, headed towards the Olympic and Westwood stop.<eos> Why? 'Cause I'm getting on board.<eos> Suicidal genius says what now?<eos> This guy has nothing on him to help with the train, but if I can hardwire into the train's computer, then I can build a firewall to block off the incoming signal that's controlling it.
All right, scramble three fighters.<eos> Let's shoot this thing out of the sky.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Given its current trajectory, shooting that plane will turn it into a flying ball of fire headed straight for this place.<eos> Unless you let me land it safely in the desert.
youtalkwaytoo much.<eos> You can shut your mouth, take a<eos> You can shut your mouth, take a chill pill, girl.<eos> jeff:<eos> If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it, Idol and you want the play it, now would be the time to do so.
Don't try and find me, please.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> Where... where is this?<eos> Miami International Airport.<eos> This is a trail, and we will follow it.
- Mister.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I'll take the bus today.<eos> - Will you be okay?<eos> I'll have to take it to know.
I said, "God forbid."<eos> Give me one good reason you can ride that motorcycle and I can't.<eos> It's a dangerous piece of machinery, I have more experience than you, I'm smarter than you, and I'm older than you, so I'm closer to death.<eos> And apparently, your Mom's okay with that.<eos> Okay, so I just wait for you to die, inherit the motorcycle, then ride it to your funeral.
Clear.<eos> - Clear!<eos> - Clear!<eos> All right, I'm getting closer.<eos> I'm standing right over it.
Oh, Jesus.<eos> ISIS.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This chicken tastes like shit.<eos> What'd you do to it?
sorry,spence,you'reagood sorry,spence,you'reagood guy, but I got to go with the<eos> Guy, but I got to go with the numbers on this one. Numbers on this one. youinventedthephrase,"I youinventedthephrase,"I didn't come here to make<eos> Friends," and yet you have more than I do on the other side. Than I do on the other side.<eos> Convincing this tribe that that is the case. Is the case. jeff:<eos> If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,
All the questionable shit we've done in the name of Rand...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.<eos> This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?
But I know that the things she brought out of me were wrong.<eos> From what you've told me about her, I think she'd be happy about how well you're doing.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or maybe she'd tell me I'm abandoning that life.<eos> And with it, her memory.
I'm afraid you have to leave the cat.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Hey, do me a favor, will you?<eos> When the Gophers play, put a little beer in a bowl and put it in front of the game.
Sorry.<eos> Talk.<eos> What?<eos> You said there's a logical explanation.<eos> Tell me what it is.
The way you made us feel.<eos> Say goodnight to the world, bully.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> That taste in your mouth that's what dying tastes like.<eos> Get used to it. Because you're gonna choke on it every day for the rest of your long miserable life.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We don't make it back, he keeps it.<eos> He says we have a death wish. Fine.<eos> The city used to be beautiful, alive.<eos> Look what they've done to it.
But I love you.<eos> You see, I loved you.<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> This whole lie, it was for you.<eos> Sara, if I... if I do die, don't let them put Kaniel Outis on the headstone because that's never what it was.
The old world is filled with splendors.<eos> This new world is a cesspool... and Salem its rank bottom.<eos> You do not understand.<eos> The Essex used their sacred tree to resurrect my life force.<eos> I am forever bound to it.
You did this dance.<eos> With Elena.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware of that.<eos> It meant something to you.<eos> And this event, this place, it only means something to you because of the feelings you attach to it.
Hatcher, give it up, man!<eos> Reyes!<eos> To your left!<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I got it.
That would be great.<eos> Uh, I-I'm sorry, but this... the... the mark.<eos> H-How did he get that?<eos> It's a birthmark.<eos> He was born with it.
They weren't poems, they were song lyrics.<eos> And working on them made me feel like...<eos> What, Archie?<eos> It made me feel like I'd finally broken through to something real.<eos> About my life and what I should be trying to do with it.
I wanted to come to your room. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to know that you were all right, but I couldn't because of the way things are.<eos> I don't really know how anything is at the moment, Trixie.<eos> Then I'm just going to say one thing and you can dismiss it as platitude if you prefer, but I generally find that if you can summon the courage to sit through the bleakest day, then in the end, the weather will change.<eos> You just have to hope that when the sun comes out you aren't wearing wellington boots and a sou'wester, because... there's nothing worse than being wrongly dressed for an occasion.<eos> Thank you for the soap and the message you sent with it.
I just hope I didn't leave it at that stupid party.<eos> The party was stupid?<eos> No, it just... reminded me of how complicated eighth grade's gonna be.<eos> Yeah, well, truth is, life's just complicated in general, you know?<eos> But we roll with it.
- What am I looking at?<eos> - Your reflection.<eos> - Yep.<eos> There it is.<eos> - Do you see what's wrong with it?
But liberty, equality, fraternity -- these I can put my name to.<eos> Well, I have no intention of so doing.<eos> No, power must exist -- someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, sometimes it is misused, but who is more likely to misuse it?<eos> The man who newly finds it in his grasp, like one who has never before tasted liquor?<eos> Or the man who by heredity, like you and I, has learnt to take it in his stride, who may taste the heady brew without becoming drunk on it?
If you thought I were that, you would never have come through that door.<eos> I know you're not, because I'm me, but we both know we don't work in a rational business.<eos> You never hear "no," do you?<eos> The word is said in my vicinity on occasion, but somehow it never really lands on me.<eos> It's clear to me that if there were any ethically compromised behavior, you weren't in the middle of it.
Piscatella's gonna take care of it.<eos> Piscatella's not taking care of anything.<eos> He's never stepping foot in my prison again.<eos> This doesn't look like your prison anymore, does it, Boss?<eos> Not that it ever was.
What?<eos> In the wall?<eos> No, not in the wall.<eos> They're not in the wall, they are the wall... they're all the walls.<eos> These little robots, they didn't build this place, they became it.
- Well, I think stealing corpses isn't generally a thing.<eos> - Should be.<eos> - Kind of fun.<eos> Anyway, according the healer, the bridge should take a few days to enchant.<eos> Then his consciousness can travel it from the Clay back to his body.
You have a strong compliance department.<eos> I was hoping that you might put on an internal investigation.<eos> Make it look like you're responding to my pressure.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because, after a year or so, when your investigation is over, my office signs off on it.
My ears are still ringing pretty good, but they can't do much for that there.<eos> They figure out what happened with the bomb? Why it went off?<eos> No, no, no, no. They're working the forensics, but the leading theory now is... Stuff happens.<eos> Speaking of which, um... I wanted to talk to you about that transfer that your ex-husband gave you.<eos> What about it?
Company scuttlebutt is that that was no coincidence.<eos> - That's an ongoing investigation, sir.<eos> - No, no. I get it. Believe me, I do.<eos> Running this country is the hardest job there is.<eos> Problem is, with everything that's been flying at you, you're not actually running it.
That's not a signal.<eos> That's a memory.<eos> Well, it's the same thing, sort of.<eos> Kirsten's emotional state is what's keeping the entanglement active.<eos> If we can isolate Kirsten's memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
I look like a guy who needs a stove?<eos> You know how in baseball they say... "So-and-so's a utility player."<eos> The stove is the utility player of the modern home.<eos> You know, you can cook with it...<eos> You can heat a room with it.
- You've been there before?<eos> - Mmm. It's been years.<eos> - Tell me, truck driver...<eos> - I said my name was Evander.<eos> Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?
Do you know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another colour when she grew up?<eos> I shouldn't think it likely.<eos> There's another hope gone.<eos> "My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes."<eos> I read that sentence in a book once, and I say it to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything.
You don't want to lose this one, too.<eos> Is it so crazy that I would put someone else's happiness before mine?<eos> No, but, I mean, it's not completely practical in the long run.<eos> I mean, at some point, you have to think about the things that are gonna make you happy, too.<eos> And you think you're it?
- Chip here is thinking about getting a vasectomy.<eos> Oh, right on. You want me to drive him or something?<eos> No, I don't, because he's not getting one.<eos> Hey, this is my body.<eos> I should be able to do whatever the hell I want with it!
I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't make the world safe for you.<eos> It's your life.<eos> I want you to live it.
In truth, it only benefits him.<eos> We lost a battle but the thrust of the war remains in our favor.<eos> Sire, all of France supports you and your ambitions but even ambition must know it's limits.<eos> I'm am building an empire.<eos> I have no intention of sharing it.
You're making it easy on me.<eos> Ready position.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six.<eos> The blade feels lighter.<eos> You're connecting with it.
Oh, the way you burn.<eos> Like a sun.<eos> Like a whole screaming world on fire.<eos> I remember that feeling, and I always will.<eos> And I will always miss it.
The baby?<eos> Your baby?<eos> No, Mum. The next Dalai Lama.<eos> Of course my baby.<eos> What did you do with it?
Can you read lips?<eos> Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.<eos> Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.<eos> So I've prepared a statement for you.<eos> Please feel free to look it over while I get you the hell out of here.
What the hell is it doing up here?<eos> Bullets travel in unexpected ways.<eos> Well, we need to get that out, right?<eos> One step at a time.<eos> I can't tell yet whether it's actually in the heart or just behind it.
Baldwin just got off an assault charge.<eos> How's a thug like him still at the club?<eos> He wins games.<eos> Deadly on the field.<eos> And off it, apparently.
You know, it's just so dangerous over there, and it's getting worse every day.<eos> And you know T.C. He sees danger, he goes right toward it.<eos> I don't wanna lose him, too.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> Hell, I lived it.
Please.<eos> So, Sofia, your mom and dad are on the way, flying in right now.<eos> Were they super pissed at me?<eos> Not as much as they were at me.<eos> I told them that neglect is a form of abuse, even if it comes with a credit card and an Uber account.
Haven't been able to.<eos> Samantha. Hi. How are you?<eos> Sixty.<eos> Seventy.<eos> Sometimes, I like to put all my stuff from my office in a box and just do some exercises and just use it as weights.
You're nothing but a coward!<eos> Stuck in that sterile little office.<eos> Every beautiful thing in you stunted.<eos> You don't have the first idea what it is to be alive!<eos> You don't know what it is to wake up... and grab hold of life every day and fight with it.
Whose execution do we seek?<eos> Bartholomew Bogue.<eos> Bart Bogue?<eos> The robber baron?<eos> Means there's gold in the equation, but gold don't do you much good when you're buried with it.
- Oh, God.<eos> She must stop calling you countess.<eos> - It's too complicated for her.<eos> Very appetizing, their glass of wine!<eos> We will stuff our faces with it!
I need my Bible!<eos> Why?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What...<eos> The demon's name gives us power over it.
Made so by slave labor?<eos> Has it not occurred to anyone that if Jack has not been able to persuade men to repair the fort, it is even less likely he will be able to persuade them to defend it?<eos> The fuck are you saying?<eos> I am saying that if England were to return right now, there is nothing to stop them from capturing that fort.<eos> And so long as that gold is inside it, they will be capturing our futures along with it.
When I was a child, my nurse would never let me eat every morsel put before me.<eos> Something must always remain, for Mr Manners.<eos> I know now that Mr Manners is a myth, and it is madness to appease him with delights of any kind.<eos> And now we take our right arm and raise it upright.<eos> Moving it backwards, we perform a circle, repeating the move four times.
- Uh, this is heading in the...<eos> - Phil, question. - How is O.J. back in his white Bronco?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean, the Bronco was full of blood.<eos> We impounded it!
My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven.<eos> May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.<eos> You understand fully what this means?<eos> I do.<eos> I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it.
(laughing) Man: Put it on.<eos> - (cheering) - Handsome!<eos> Don't lose this one.<eos> I'm just really grateful for you all... and for this house, and for my sobriety.<eos> My life is so different now, and I'm just so excited to go out there and live it.
The billboard outside cutler's office.<eos> At the time of the murder, there's no artwork on it or graffiti.<eos> That street art was put up this morning. After cutler's murder.<eos> Maybe the artist that put it up there is saying something or saw something.<eos> I'm gonna see if it's signed or if anybody knows who made it. Yeah.
♪ Raised in the Bronx In a place so wild ♪<eos> ♪ And year after year The girl has to hear ♪<eos> ♪ The do's, the don'ts And the dears ♪<eos> ♪ And when she starts to grow She finds a sound of her own ♪<eos> ♪ But Papi bans it from the home ♪
I'm always learning something on the job.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> Yeah, tell him about general tso's, Bryan.<eos> Oh, no, he flings this shit at you, too?<eos> Sprays it all around.
What I'm speaking about is this man.<eos> I don't know about you, but I'm not in the habit of climbing into bed with snakes.<eos> I couldn't care less who you're climbing into bed with.<eos> Let's say this works.<eos> We fix this device and then Vernon stops Whitney Frost with it.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is our first tour together, and you cannot imagine my joy when I learned that this Kentucky boy here had never been on a snipe hunt.<eos> What's a snipe?<eos> Oh, it's an imaginary bird invented by mean people who enjoy humiliating their friends.
But then a vision was sent to me.<eos> About a man with a true heart.<eos> A son.<eos> And only then did I understand my true purpose.<eos> It was not to save my people. It was to give you the power to save all people.
Harry?<eos> - Harry!<eos> - He tried to kill me.<eos> Luck like this has its price.<eos> Do something good with it!
Oh, I always forget you walk right into the living room in your house. Hey, do you have a Band-Aid?<eos> Nothing happened, but I'm bleeding.<eos> You know what, I'll just rummage through your bathroom.<eos> Man, spending a whole day with him is gonna be worse than eating at a ball park.<eos> Uh, I'll take one terrible beer, filled up way too high, so I spill most of it, and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun. And do you have mustard and relish?
- No.<eos> Eventually, I'll give in.<eos> But there is another way.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.<eos> Are you clear as to the location? Yes, sir.<eos> I am.<eos> Accursed sunlight,<eos> I shan't miss it.
And how are your efforts proceeding?<eos> You can't even stand for lack of food and water.<eos> I will always rise up against you.<eos> I will never give up.<eos> Soon the sky rocks will lay waste to this kingdom, and you along with it.
I never said you were attacked by a White Martian.<eos> Well, you're smarter than I thought.<eos> Spread out!<eos> Kara.<eos> I'm going after it. You stay here.
If I take her cell to L.A. Clear, you'll get a breakdown faster.<eos> Thank you, Chief.<eos> So, why would you shoot up the dealer's car and then leave her money and drugs behind?<eos> Well, the vehicle did roll downhill for six blocks.<eos> And maybe the shooter didn't want to chase after it into 28th street Bloods territory.
So you might as well know.<eos> Solved what, Otto?<eos> She said they used a light.<eos> The previous location the doctor was using, the house in the woods, was owned by the bank.<eos> The banker handling it... is a client of Dr. Lesueur's.
It was biblical.<eos> Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan, I lost a lot of friends... brothers.<eos> So losing Jay, I know what it feels like. Question yourself.<eos> Blame yourself for his death.<eos> And that guilt, it can tear you apart, but trust me, man, you got to get control of it, or it'll rip you up inside.
I do.<eos> 'Cause you know how your boss hates it<eos> - when you're late. - She's a real pain in my ass.<eos> For me, life was good.<eos> For Gil and Shawn, it was still a work in progress.
I am the regent, and I have decided.<eos> The duke arrives tomorrow.<eos> The wedding will happen quickly, pending a meeting.<eos> A meeting?<eos> I'll gladly take it, and I will send this duke running for the hills, I promise you!
All right, let's go.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this Agent Chandler's office?<eos> It used to be, before she got suspended.
And I realise that you are in... a relationship of some sort<eos> - with him. - We're getting married.<eos> OK, look. I know you're probably not going to accept a lot of the things I tell you right now.<eos> But obviously, I have a very different perspective on it all, to him, and I want you to hear it.<eos> Whether you accept it or not. OK?
You know what, Lydia?<eos> You're no better than Valentine.<eos> But at least he had the guts to tell Downworlders to their faces he wanted them all dead.<eos> You... hide behind the Law.<eos> I don't hide behind it, Isabelle.
All too much.<eos> God, I miss it already, and I haven't even left yet.<eos> Isn't that sad?<eos> No.<eos> If today taught me anything... this place is gonna miss you a lot more than you're gonna miss it.
- Lee: Hey! Open the door!<eos> Yeah, there's no easy access here either.<eos> This whole building's locked tight.<eos> This place is deserted, but not derelict.<eos> Someone's been taking care of it.
If we're gonna take them down, we need to get our weapons.<eos> You don't have time.<eos> You're way too far from the locker-room.<eos> Patterson, we're near the evidence room, aren't we?<eos> Yeah, you should be right underneath it.
Yeah, but Gina Bryant never mentioned any baby.<eos> Well, Violet could have had the baby before Gina was abducted.<eos> Gina wouldn't even know about it.<eos> We, if we're right about any of this, that means there's another kid somewhere out there.<eos> Then who's taking care of it?
- Thank you.<eos> Arthur, you listen to me, and you listen good.<eos> I have people calling me 40 times a day asking for their money.<eos> I even considered selling my house to pay them.<eos> So you are going to go in your little fucking piggy bank right now and pay back every fucking kopeck that you stole from Big Head, and if you don't, we're gonna take our little show on the road, perhaps perform it for a man named the D.A.
What?<eos> ! Butters, where the (BLEEP) are you?<eos> ! Well, I'm at SpaceX.<eos> Where are you? SpaceX?<eos> Why? Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.
I knew that Narcisse would look to me first for the gold.<eos> When I needed a place to hide it, your chambers were the closest I could visit without arousing suspicion.<eos> Well, thank you, for the truth at last.<eos> You now have your gold,<eos> - and whatever you plan to do with it...
You sent her away!<eos> Of course I did.<eos> This is my life to lead.<eos> No, no, it is not.<eos> I gave you life And I will instruct you on what you do with it.
But how can you enjoy yourself here?<eos> In this place we don't belong?<eos> It seems heartless.<eos> This is our home now.<eos> And it will be, at least for a decade more.
I believe when you give your heart it will be without hesitation.<eos> But you cannot give it to me.<eos> I think you have it already.<eos> No, you must keep it intact for someone else.<eos> For I have no use for it, you see.
Perfect place for stashing coins.<eos> Pena owned a transport company that subcontracts with Con Ed.<eos> Then that's it.<eos> That's where he is.<eos> Let's go. Once they find the gold, they're gonna make a run for it.
But I just can't take care of another living creature.<eos> Then why'd you bring it home?<eos> I couldn't leave it in the street.<eos> Claire, is that you?<eos> - Take care of it.
You convinced me.<eos> About what?<eos> Baths make me forgetful.<eos> That I might as well eat meat today.<eos> I still love it, and I really miss it.
Sorry, gotta swipe you out of this door, too.<eos> That'll get you as far as the cafeteria.<eos> Someone there will have to swipe you to the garage.<eos> Then you can just walk up the ramp.<eos> Technically, you have to swipe at the top, but it's just one of those arm gates, so you can just duck under it.
I'd do it all over again. - Not here.<eos> Not now! - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> I realize that this isn't the biggest house and maybe space will be an issue down the road, but don't you think it's more important that you have two people here that-that really, truly love each other?<eos> Yeah, we are totally committed to creating a healthy and safe environment for this child.<eos> I promise you, we will take good care of it.
Thank you so much.<eos> So, the next thing for us to do is schedule a home visit.<eos> Whose home?<eos> Yeah, we are totally committed to creating a healthy and safe environment - for this child. - Yeah.<eos> I promise you, we will take good care of it.
You do not give up, do you hear me?<eos> Your uncle Curtis was right.<eos> Always talking about the monsters among us when he'd had a few.<eos> There's always been something unnatural about this place.<eos> Still, I'll miss it.
You know what's real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> Our shop is real.<eos> This life is real!<eos> [squeals softly] And you need to start living it.
And there's no good answer.<eos> - Well, then why don't we sell this fucking place?<eos> If you want, we'll split it three ways, I don't care.<eos> - But what about this place?<eos> What about it?
A frozen embryo, Your Honour.<eos> Is that property?<eos> Well... ..yes, that is the question.<eos> We believe it is.<eos> All we're asking the court to discern is to whom the frozen embryo belongs, not what happens to it.
- Yeah.<eos> - I'd like to play one of those phone calls for you now.<eos> Objection!<eos> We have no way of knowing if this recording is authentic or if it was legally obtained.<eos> Let's play the recording and take it one step at a time.
I couldn't have demanded it if you hadn't the strength, but you do.<eos> You are you again... the strongest of us all.<eos> And not a moment too soon.<eos> They are winning.<eos> The tree is dying, and with it will die you and us and all our world.
I took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility and hid it.<eos> Then I came home and... and sent Clair to the party with her boyfriend so that she would have an alibi.<eos> I waited for her to... to come back home and, uh, we... She had called 9-1-1.<eos> And why hang on to the murder weapon?<eos> I-I didn't know what to do with it.
That's its relative effectiveness compared to--<eos> TNT? Right?<eos> Have you ever bought it?<eos> No point.<eos> What would I do with it?
Fresh out, my friend.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't know if you're in a position to be judging me, anyway.<eos> It's just me out there.<eos> Sometimes saving the city takes priority over running it.
You don't understand!<eos> This isn't about her!<eos> It's about the baby!<eos> She's gonna have it in jail, and then what?<eos> Who's gonna take care of it? No one.
Phoebe scrubbed her college photos off the Internet sometime after Ephraim Hill snagged her picture.<eos> Her brother said she didn't want anything out there that could mess up her job prospects.<eos> So, by planting the forgery, killing Phoebe and getting rid of her phone, and by getting rid of Ephraim's laptop, the killer hopes to keep Louis Bowman in prison forever.<eos> The only thing he wasn't counting on was Skyden preserving Phoebe's original image.<eos> And Louis' alibi along with it.
I can't even tell you when that was. What I need is a new Michael, if I could replace Michael with a new one.<eos> What about me?<eos> You?<eos> I found a baby once, on a... on a train.<eos> Cared for it from Prague to Vienna.
Anything you can remember helps.<eos> I remember going to the garage.<eos> After that, just cold water.<eos> Mom, I have a book report due.<eos> Okay if I work on it?
Why no one ever mentioned it?<eos> We decided to keep the secret because we didn't know the motive.<eos> The baby could have been the target. -<eos> - What happened to him then?<eos> The baby needed protection, so it was given to one of the detectives while we kept looking for the woman's identity.
Did you break it up with a stick?<eos> Alfred's at the Glenwood apartments.<eos> Love you, son.<eos> Hey, is this milk any good?<eos> What you using it for?
Speaking of which, what's your answer?<eos> Wha...<eos> - What's the question?<eos> - Your vocation.<eos> What is it?
Just roll up the windows.<eos> Matt, get out of there!<eos> Yeah, roll up your windows!<eos> If we can cut through the airport,<eos> Brianna's about five miles on the other side of it.
He drove Oscar's i8 at least once a month.<eos> Get to the i8.<eos> Have you driven the i8 recently?<eos> You're asking me about the car from the accident?<eos> You've driven it, right?
I've barely enough amps in here to power my LEDs.<eos> We'll never drain more than two percent of backup power during changeovers.<eos> Dr. Richardson, if we can just...<eos> No, I value your opinion, I do, and I know you've been through a lot up here.<eos> But I have an assignment and I would really appreciate your support in executing it.
Don't feel guilty.<eos> Hi.<eos> So, what are we gonna do today?<eos> It can be anything.<eos> In this bed or out of it.
Patent infringement.<eos> Now, it sounds complicated, but this is a simple case.<eos> If you leave your truck sitting in your front yard and someone takes it away, well, whose truck is it now?<eos> It's still yours.<eos> Even if you're not driving it.
My sister tried his drug.<eos> Hell, he used her blood, my own sister's blood, to experiment.<eos> And you were a witness to this?<eos> You know how scary it is, watching your baby sister, four years old, giving blood, when she's a hemophiliac?<eos> His drug worked for a little while, but... then her body got used to it and it wouldn't work anymore.
The tape was relevant to the story, and you know it.<eos> I negotiate appearances on this show every day.<eos> If guests think I don't honor my word, you will be interviewing an empty chair for as long as your name is on this show.<eos> If viewers think we bury a story because of a personal bias, we lose credibility.<eos> And, yes, there are occasional exceptions to that rule, but that video was sent to me, and you didn't have the right to barter it without talking with me first, so don't come looking for an apology when you should be giving one!
It's... Cory Casey...<eos> Cybermart's billionaire CEO.<eos> He's coming by the warehouse today to make some sort of announcement.<eos> Wow, a billionaire.<eos> Well, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?
And they are not alone.<eos> Arriving on the wing, Jackson's Widowbirds also seek fresh grass.<eos> Although, it's not just food that they're after.<eos> This male wants a mate.<eos> He's grown elaborate breeding plumage for this moment, but he needs a stage on which to show it off.
I guess I saw another egg.<eos> I saw a light in the water again when I went back to the cave alone.<eos> Let's go and check.<eos> You know how to get there?<eos> What will you do with it?
The Sword of Daylight is not a toy to be played with.<eos> It is a hallowed obligation I have spent my entire life training to be worthy of.<eos> You want to take it for a spin?<eos> Sorry.<eos> If my destiny is to not hold the sword, perhaps it is to teach you how to properly wield it.
I shouldn't have...<eos> So your dad told you to go, and then...<eos> And then I jumped in and I swam.<eos> I made it to the dock.<eos> And I hid under it.
I think it's electric. It's on the way?<eos> Shit. We gotta go that way.<eos> You serious?<eos> This fence goes all the way to the right and all the way to the left.<eos> We gotta find a way under it.
I tell you he wasn't human.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - That all of it?<eos> - Yeah. This is all in front of the room.<eos> Just in front of it.
That's the path we're on.<eos> That's what we're looking for.<eos> That's what we're following.<eos> We're not here to reach enlightenment, to find nirvana.<eos> We're here to try to save this place by becoming one with it.
Your head was turned in the wrong direction.<eos> Can you move all your fingers?<eos> Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.<eos> (Nancy) You never really wanted to be totally inside our marriage.<eos> Nor outside it, either.
Believe me when I tell you that not even a robotics expert could tell the difference.<eos> In every way.<eos> In "every" way.<eos> I'm not gonna get into details on the phone.<eos> I will just tell you that I have the footage and I will share it with you sometime.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Dorothy.<eos> What's your first name?<eos> Uh, I guess we'll just stick to Fontaine if it's all right with you.<eos> I'm not calling you Fontaine like one of your locker room buddies.<eos> My given name ain't much if you ask me, which of course nobody ever did before seeing fit that it stuck to me.
She sang with the band and knew everyone and didn't owe anyone anything.<eos> And couldn't pay up, even if she did.<eos> Her beauty was that rare kind... that made you want to look more like yourself and not like her.<eos> Being around Meadow was like being in New York City.<eos> It made you want to find life, not hide from it.
Don't be silly, it's a small case.<eos> Too small for you, sir.<eos> Let me handle it, okay?<eos> Do you understand Chinese?<eos> The investigation into the school - I will take care of it because I am in charge.
I was just a monk.<eos> I did not notice such things at the time.<eos> Well, what do you say now? Now?<eos> I would say this city is impregnable.<eos> There will be something wrong with it.
(Shaky breath) Elena, we need to talk.<eos> Look, Jeremy, I-I didn't know how to bring it up, but it's Clay.<eos> He's not himself.<eos> And look, this is the book that Clay found in Baton Rouge, right?<eos> And this section talks about how a... a dark witch can enter someone else's body and control it.
Jason took the ice drill. He stole it.<eos> Why the hell would he do that?<eos> He's off his head;<eos> he's stolen the drill.<eos> He's driven it away. He's not here.
Disguise it as you might try, Sir Malcolm recognized your picture.<eos> Perhaps he's just a fan from my theatrical days.<eos> Do you know the medical neurosis called the phantom limb?<eos> It's not uncommon when people lose an arm or a leg or such.<eos> When I lost my arm, I was constantly reaching for things with it.
My man and I had an ailing child, born healthy, but it turned puny and weak.<eos> We knew it was a fairy changeling.<eos> We placed it in the fairy's seat in the hill and kept watch through the nicht, sirs, so as to recover our beloved bairn after the wee folk returned it.<eos> But... but just before morning, we saw her.<eos> She took the child in her vile embrace... and... and spoke strange spells over it.
Feliz navidad.<eos> I know you probably can't tell me what you're doing about Sam's sister.<eos> You're right, so don't ask.<eos> But I was also thinking about Connor's car.<eos> What about it?
It was fun. LIV: In the six months I've been eating brains,<eos> I've inherited things like a fear of pigeons, kleptomania...<eos> A couple scoops of Javier's brain in a microwave pizza roll and I find myself feeling passionate, inspired.<eos> I'm not just drawn to beauty,<eos> I want to possess it, make love to it.
- Not me. So the pool's mine?<eos> Fuck that.<eos> The pool buys us all a round at the Alibi.<eos> Get some bleach on that phone.<eos> He had it in the port-a-john for an hour.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do this thing.<eos> Nash, where are we on the Lindsay McConnell murder?<eos> Uh, I've been working it all night with Gail and Detective Anderson.
No, no, this place is good for me.<eos> - Good for you?<eos> - Yeah, they have excellent treatment here.<eos> Excellent.<eos> They're just a little stingy with it.
Well, if I don't have a brother, my father's son is me.<eos> And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son.<eos> The answer's "son." - Ooh!<eos> There's a picture of the sun.<eos> - Bet the key's behind it.
Now, tell Sascha I'm not coming in today. I'll... I'll keep my head down.<eos> - What was he? A Hindu?<eos> - I don't know. Probably. Why?<eos> Is that bad for Hindus, suicide?<eos> No, it's great. They love it.
Now it's gone.<eos> Thanks to your good work.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It ain't too hard to put together.<eos> You got what you wanted, the whole damn thing starts over again and so does your skimming off of it.
Interesting. I congratulate you,<eos> A230385.<eos> I congratulate you greatly.<eos> Enjoy this victory.<eos> Savour it.
Vanished.<eos> The week for vanishing ships.<eos> You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.
Technically... it's my body. I got every right.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> We're in full agreement, you and me.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> A beautiful body, and you can do what you want with it. But right now I need you to tell me.
Your... your child? Oh.<eos> Yes, I suppose it is difficult keeping up on current events whilst rotting inside a tomb.<eos> Very well.<eos> The short version.<eos> My child is alive, Dahlia is on her way, but now the previous tenant of Rebekah's body has seized control and isn't keen on giving it up.
We take hope and the pack, and we leave town tonight.<eos> This body is still linked to davina and those children.<eos> If i leave it and it dies,<eos> Then davina and the others die with it.
I hate to see you cry.<eos> I just keep wondering How I'm gonna tell javi about this.<eos> Well, maybe you don't.<eos> Your baby still needs a father.<eos> Why can't it be javier?
I was under the spell of Ben Simon.<eos> But Sia's rejection made me feel impure.<eos> I looked for water to clean myself.<eos> But all I found was mud.<eos> I streaked my skin with it as I had seen the nomad women do.
But you told me he was on his way to Chester's Mill.<eos> We need the egg!<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> You saw what happened to me when it was taken from Chester's Mill.<eos> I'm connected to it somehow.
- The town needs you.<eos> Gotham needs a lawman now, not a criminal like me.<eos> A strong lawman.<eos> You looking at me?<eos> Someone needs to grab this city by the neck and shake it hard.
Maybe Jake 2.0 is possible.<eos> Sounds pretty sketch, but I'm listening.<eos> In the light of full disclosure, I gotta get something off my chest.<eos> I don't know how or why, but Tyler and Nina had a video of your dad doing things he should not have been doing.<eos> Now, I have not seen this video, but I know they were blackmailing him with it.
- He wants to fund our work.<eos> - Abraham, please reconsider.<eos> The tongue has begun to bifurcate.<eos> Vestibular enlargement is palpable, but, as yet, no stinger has developed.<eos> Still, we will soon have to implement precautions against it.
Nothing we have done has worked so far.<eos> Well, maybe we should try to do something else.<eos> Maybe there's a way to take Erica out of the equation.<eos> It is about fate. You do not mess with it.<eos> If it is fated, yes. Otherwise...
I guess she's been sending letters to her parents, trying to make amends, but they keep returning them, unopened.<eos> Do you remember, them?<eos> Your grandparents?<eos> No, I don't... I don't think we ever met them.<eos> Well, I was thinking, since moms aren't taking the baby, that if her parents knew that Ana was pregnant, maybe they would take it?
It would be a big loss for your crime lab.<eos> Not with you there.<eos> John, we've talked about this. I've already got a job.<eos> I'm not asking you to just join the team.<eos> I'm asking you to run it.
You wanna taste death without swallowing it.<eos> Can I just say... You are ruining this steak for me.<eos> You and I, we are insatiable.<eos> We... We thrive on the hunt.<eos> It feeds us!
Of course, I thought it was my fault, that somehow, I was bad, that maybe, if I tried harder, he would love me. If I just tried harder, maybe none of the bad stuff would happen.<eos> I-I do understand.<eos> And I hope you know that whatever you did, it wouldn't have made any difference.<eos> I know that now.<eos> And I know... that I have love to give and that I have a kind heart and I was meant to share it.
And you... passed me around... to all those... men.<eos> Like I wasn't even... human.<eos> Don't you worry, darling.<eos> This boring town is awful without you.<eos> - I can't believe I actually miss it.
- Will you tie me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I never placed much value in wondering about an afterlife.<eos> My concern was always this life, what would I do with it?
Find Fornell and Emily, wherever they are.<eos> Gibbs, I'm so sorry.<eos> Ducky and Jimmy are bringing the body in.<eos> What about the sniper nest?<eos> Tony's on it.
I'll bring it to you as soon as it gets here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [ Pills rattling ] I have a bad heart.<eos> They say that I need a new one, but I don't want a new heart.<eos> [ Sighs ] What... what would I do with it?
Who are you, cops?<eos> You guys are "X-Files."<eos> Sure. Yeah. You could say that.<eos> Cain still has the mark, right?<eos> So he's lived with it for years.
People, give thanks to that woman, standing up for all of us, even though she's a lighty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Although, I think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group.<eos> I'll handle this.<eos> What is the point of a long life if it's not enjoyed?
But we can talk about all that later.<eos> Right now I want to talk about you.<eos> Is there a lady in your life, maybe somebody you have your eye on?<eos> Uh... no, not at the moment.<eos> Well, get on that, bubeleh, 'cause life isn't worth the price of admission if you don't have someone to enjoy it with.
Okay, okay, so maybe the name isn't step one.<eos> Maybe we need another step or two before it becomes helpful.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The Hag of Shady Lane.<eos> We figured that she must have been the girl who took the baby that night and tried to take care of it.
No!<eos> Oh, come on, I need this!<eos> If you expect me to take our relationship to the next level by taking you home to the Hamptons for Thanksgiving, you're going to have to prove to me you can meet my needs.<eos> Ugh, fine!<eos> I'll show you the body, but not so you can have sex with it.
- Will you tie me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I never placed much value in wondering about an afterlife.<eos> My concern was always this life, what would I do with it?
And then I met your mother and, well, everything's really changed for me.<eos> You know, Sun Life Stadium would be a good place to spread Roddney.<eos> Since you guys both played for the U - and then the Fins. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Lot of good times on that field.<eos> And off it.
Qualities, sir... qualities.<eos> Well, I like this part of the country a whole lot.<eos> I like the air around here.<eos> I like... I do.<eos> I like breathing it in, and then, I like sleeping under the stars as well.
You know, I think it's such a positive thing for women.<eos> It may be weird that women our age live together, but I really like it.<eos> - Me too. - Me too. When you really looked at these women in the first year, they were all about Botox and making sure that they had the highest heels.<eos> Malick: You know, what we've all come to realize is, as important as all of this is, it's how you feel about yourself and how much you accept who you are and don't get too freaked out about the little imperfections.<eos> There's something kind of wonderful about accepting the age you are and not fighting it all the time.
What on earth were you thinking?<eos> Well, I wasn't.<eos> Thinking, that is.<eos> But tell me... How did it feel to be completely in another's control over your very life, your very soul?<eos> I know such a feeling, and this was not it.
And I got a new life in the process.<eos> What would you be running to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I just have to figure out what the next chapter is in my life and then...<eos> Well, and then start living it.
Fine, just for tonight.<eos> But hurry back, for I have had fair warning, but they shall have none.<eos> You'll damn your soul to hell, my child. No, no.<eos> You did that.<eos> And as long as I must dwell in hell, I might as well rule it.
Or Bay, or anyone.<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> I'm 24 years old.<eos> I've just started my career.<eos> I don't know how to support this baby or take care of it.
As we all set out into virgin territory, so shall I.<eos> How dare you speak so of a lady... any lady, let alone one you claim to love.<eos> Love?<eos> Who said anything about love?<eos> I talk of marriage, sir, and the property what comes with it.
Yeah, well, I would have done it sooner, but I kind of thought you'd taken care of that.<eos> You didn't have to, you know.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But isn't confession the first step toward absolution?<eos> I know he sometimes acts like it, but my father is not God.
In return, all the world would be yours.<eos> And so it is.<eos> And so it will be if you could just learn to harden your heart.<eos> What if I never wanted the world?<eos> What if a heart, a real heart, and the love that goes with it, is all I ever wanted?
I've been thinking about this a lot.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I firmly believe in a woman's right to her own body.<eos> - We're the ones who have to carry the baby, take care of it, turn our entire lives upside down.
We got to figure out a way to keep you safe.<eos> Good, he's still in range.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm worried about the murder investigation.<eos> What about it?
Ooh. There is one funny thing.<eos> Turns out my mitochondrial DNA is 10% to 14% Ashkenazi, which means...<eos> Jewish?<eos> Paige Collins Lawson is a member of my tribe?<eos> Was I not in it before?
Rene needs my full attention.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> We'll all help you.<eos> What if...<eos> What if there's something wrong with it?
Not very familiar, then, eh?<eos> You are right to be sceptical. I...<eos> I was fortunate to be born into wealth.<eos> Tutto bene?<eos> Why not share it round?
What are you saying?<eos> Turn off the camera, hoodie!<eos> Buzz, will you take over, please?<eos> Mr. Olin, I'd like you to listen to this and see if it sounds familiar.<eos> You paid Dr. Fluke cash to create a program to let you hack into the Cochrans' car and drive it off a cliff with them inside of it!
I'll never stop fighting for us.<eos> All you have to do is trust me.<eos> This'll work.<eos> Finally a blade that can stand up to Granny's meatloaf.<eos> So, now what do we do with it?
I know. Can't we just leave her?<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We got to find a safe place for her and your baby.<eos> Anything happens to you, that kid is Plan B.<eos> Plan B? What exactly are you planning on doing with it?
Think, Niklaus.<eos> All these threats, this needless escalation of violence, we play into the worst possible outcome of this prophecy.<eos> There's a better solution.<eos> What might that be?<eos> We cannot prevent fate, but we can take control of it.
Terrible things.<eos> But I got to believe that we are not beyond redemption.<eos> And I got to believe that this city can still be saved.<eos> 'Cause once we stop believing, that's when this city really dies.<eos> And us, us, right along with it.
That thing can take down an original?<eos> You'll take this, go into the Mikaelsons' home under the guise of friendship, and then you will drive this stake into Elijah's heart.<eos> We will free Tristan and imprison the head of our sire line, all in a single evening.<eos> Do this, and you will have proven your loyalty to The Strix.<eos> Fail, and we will revoke your membership and your life along with it.
And we will.<eos> Your revenge is not your happy ending.<eos> I am.<eos> You told me that.<eos> If you destroy this heart, you will destroy your happy ending along with it.
Rahm is dead and deservedly so.<eos> Yeah? Why aren't you?<eos> Ah! Because a tiger is unable to change his stripes. Oh!<eos> But remains a tiger nonetheless.<eos> How about I tear off that robot arm and beat you with it?
And there, he saw a ladder ascending to Heaven, where the angels were going up and coming down.<eos> This was always known to have been a vortex, a portal.<eos> NARRATOR: A ladder descending from Heaven?<eos> A visitation site for otherworldly beings?<eos> Could it really be that the significance of Temple Mount is not what's under it but the location itself?
- Sorry, boss.<eos> Still think I don't want to be here? I wish you weren't,<eos> - looking like that.<eos> - Looks like Tony got poison oak from the crime scene.<eos> Sniper's nest was covered in it.
Let's take a break.<eos> Geez... you're way too intense.<eos> You can't push yourself too hard.<eos> Your shoulder isn't completely healed yet.<eos> It's holding up fine.
I hope he's right. Essay?<eos> You may begin.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me, about the Latin paper...<eos> - What is it?
Die for a King whose time has passed... OI' ChOOSG t0 SGFVG a HEW one.<eos> Leave us. Out!<eos> All of you.<eos> Remember this blade, Father?<eos> Your mother... once saved my life with it.
And yet he has no such reservations when it comes to protesting what he calls my...<eos> "barbaric" methods.<eos> How ironic to be called cruel by a man such as this, a man accused of such atrocities.<eos> No! No!<eos> When you have found the thing a man fears most, you will have discovered the key to his madness and the means to control it.
I got no friends, no food This whistle has nothing to do with food<eos> Oh, I've got the no food blues<eos> For heaven's sakes!<eos> You found food, didn't you?<eos> And this thing has something to do with it.
What lies behind every controversy about Shakespeare is rage.<eos> Rage over the nature and unequal distribution of talent.<eos> The rage that genius appears where it appears for no material reason at all.<eos> Desiring a thing cannot make you have it.<eos> Now, the trouble with writing, if I may bring it up here in the English Department... is we all do a little of it from time to time, writing.
You look better.<eos> Kelly, this is my lawyer.<eos> Kelly, hi.<eos> - Hi. - I wanna talk about your confession.<eos> What about it?
So, sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating.<eos> This whole generation of kids, they're doing their best.<eos> They're torturing themselves to do the cure that we tell them, and it's the wrong cure.<eos> And we're blaming the willpower, the moral fortitude of these kids, and it's a crime.<eos> There is a solution to obesity. It's energy balance.
So if you're done with cuddle therapy, or whatever it is you do, maybe you could actually do your job and come down here and give us some backup.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Well, don't inconvenience yourself.<eos> You broke up with me, remember?<eos> Okay, Marshall, because we couldn't get a decent image of your spinal column there, unfortunately, we don't truly know what's going on with it.
- ...and he's giving you his wish.<eos> Well, we're sharing the wish.<eos> We're...<eos> I mean, he... He...<eos> Yeah. We're sharing it.
Money, guns-- America is gonna get you whatever you need, Salar.<eos> [ Speaking native language ] It's good to have the same enemy.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> This blade is my gift to you.<eos> I killed a Russian soldier with it.
All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined with a Bonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the Ohio.<eos> At what point then, is the approach of danger to be expected?<eos> I answer that if it ever reach us, it must spring up from amongst us.<eos> It cannot come from abroad.<eos> If destruction be our lot, then we ourselves must be the author and finisher of it.
Life was given to us a billion years ago.<eos> What have we done with it?
A stern warning?<eos> It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.<eos> Let the priests argue over good and evil.<eos> Slavery is real.<eos> I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
Oh, things never work the way they do on the box.<eos> Okay, let's get this garbage out of the street.<eos> Oh, dear, I was using that car as pants.<eos> Oh, my God, Dad, it's our car!<eos> That confused old guy must have been driving it by mistake.
I love you, man.<eos> He didn't tell you either, huh? DVD.<eos> Yeah, I guess he sent one to everybody.<eos> What am I supposed to do with this place?<eos> I'm sure somebody'll figure out what to do with it.
And I will admit that possibility, but of course, that is quite a different thing from saying she receives our encouragement.<eos> What is it?<eos> I admire Prince Lichnowsky and I think he's sincere.<eos> I know that sentence.<eos> It's always followed by its opposite.
Precious cargo. Love, Scott."<eos> What?<eos> Wait, wait, he bought... he bought you this car?<eos> Where's my car?<eos> Your fiancé drove it back home. Savi:
and this is Padraic.<eos> of...just outside the Boyle.<eos> I'm a beaver.<eos> This was a beaver once.<eos> - What happened to it?
Thea told me.<eos> She said that you were very brave.<eos> I did what anyone would have done.<eos> Not anyone.<eos> It takes a lot to run towards danger, not away from it.
What kind of killer holds onto a murder weapon two months after they commit a crime?<eos> Anybody could have planted it.<eos> You think about anybody in particular?<eos> They're testing it.<eos> Yeah? We'll know soon if it was used to kill your father.
- It wasn't safe.<eos> It was safer than bringing along two bickering little bitches.<eos> What do you want, Huck?<eos> What did you do with the body?<eos> I took care of it.
What do you want, Huck?<eos> What did you do with the body?<eos> I took care of it.<eos> - How?<eos> By taking care of it.
There's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> I know, but I just love not like places like this.<eos> You know that.<eos> Look at that old bed?<eos> What is it?
I enjoy it.<eos> I drink out of it.<eos> But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over and it shatters,<eos> I say, 'Of course.'<eos> When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious."
I already looked, waste of time.<eos> Everything on there supports her cover as an event planner.<eos> Shipping orders, receipts, that kind of thing.<eos> If she ditched it, it's worthless.<eos> Maybe it's not about what's on the device, but rather where it's been.
I just needed someone to talk to.<eos> You could have talked to me.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> It's just different.<eos> You know, when you're sick and you find someone else who's sick, you can have these conversations about life and death and what it all means.
Watch.<eos> The key is volume. I see that.<eos> (jake) so be honest.<eos> Were you really gonna destroy my car?<eos> No. I was gonna drive it.
Judge Moss is almost ready for us.<eos> I read your brief.<eos> It's a good argument.<eos> I read yours, too.<eos> I threw it across the room.
Wait.<eos> McCann's car.<eos> It wasn't in the driveway.<eos> Or in the garage.<eos> He probably drove it to that building before he was killed.
Little winter gardening? - What do you want, mr.<eos> Taylor? - Ok, I am officially fed up with this noise.<eos> Either you let the dog out so she shuts up, Or, I don't know, maybe train her to behave<eos> While she's locked in the shed.<eos> This isn't rocket science. It's shameful to own a pet and not discipline it.
That liquor store was supposed to be a quick piss stop, not a goddamn Lee Marvin moment.<eos> And we're heading straight for the border.<eos> We got to get to El Rey before the cops get organized.<eos> You keep talking about that place like it's the shit.<eos> Well, that's 'cause it is.
Suit yourself.<eos> We're at some place called Bob's Brisket off 83.<eos> You on your way?<eos> I'll take this seat.<eos> There's some woods behind it.
No, I am ordering you...<eos> Oh, come on, Artie.<eos> They're practically related.<eos> So does that mean we're going...<eos> I'm not the first grumpy old fart to run this place, and I won't be the last, but I'm the grumpy old fart running it today, so you'll do as you're told.
If the Sith Lord wanted to attack the Jedi Order from within, Master Yoda would be the perfect choice.<eos> I fear we are more vulnerable than we think.<eos> I would like to suggest something:<eos> a deprivation ritual.<eos> It is a dangerous procedure but one that will without question allow Yoda to go to the source of this voice... whatever, whoever it may be.
"My heart is getting naughty." "Come flirt with me."<eos> "I want to be naughty."<eos> "I won't stop you."<eos> "My heart is spoiled."<eos> "What do I do with it now?" "Come closer, don't torment me."
Russell?<eos> I checked with Partell Manufacturing HR, any chance they have an employee who also is a known artist.<eos> Turns out they just commissioned a mural in their cafeteria.<eos> Artist's name is Keith Garner.<eos> He worked on it late at night, because he's also got a day job.
So I kill what I can't trust, even if killing it might kill me?<eos> The thing about a sword is, a man has to know which end to grab it.<eos> Take it by the hilt, it's a friend you can trust.<eos> Take it by the edge... bites your fingers.<eos> Every tool is a weapon, Charlie, depending on how skillfully it's handled.
There she is.<eos> Mommy.<eos> I told you she would come.<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> And you're eating spaghetti... And you're wearing it too.
In fact, it has.<eos> Numerous times.<eos> Fine. So, it was not a knife.<eos> Ah, wrong again.<eos> It was a knife, but "stabbed" implies the blade was thrust into the victim, whereas this wound was produced by it being hurled into her chest.
Well, it's gonna be a little while.<eos> You were shot in the stomach.<eos> Did we at least get the damn shooter?<eos> He's on lockdown.<eos> Russell's on it.
There's just... like this cirlce of trust.<eos> And you're way on the outside of it.
That's classy.<eos> So I hear you turned down the new Border Task Force in Detroit.<eos> - Guess you'll be sticking around?<eos> - Rolla's murder is a new lead.<eos> Sure, but we have no money to follow it.
"you have driven here so shut up."<eos> "Work on the bridge starts at 0500." What?<eos> !<eos> "0500 and you can't go home<eos> "until all three lorries have driven over it."
Dollie?<eos> Damn. If you don't learn to control your damn cat, I'll skin it myself.<eos> This is but a dream.<eos> Life itself might be but a dream.<eos> Why not enjoy it?
Not good.<eos> I did my research on Exvium Chemical.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter anymore.<eos> I can't hold them accountable.<eos> Oh, good, because I combed through every database. I went through boxes, I googled, I did everything Teri taught me to do, except order a steak dinner and charge it to the firm.
You let Voight run me out of town with nothing.<eos> Nothing!<eos> You were headed for the bottom of the lake.<eos> I begged for your life.<eos> Do something with it, for once.
We all know.<eos> Disappearing into the murky waters below.<eos> And the waters of the east end of Loch Garve never freeze over, because the heat from the waterhorse's chimney melts the ice.<eos> See that fallen tree?<eos> When I say, go to it and don't move.
I never knew whisper-talking was so smart.<eos> And how will you be paying for your rental, sir?<eos> I will pay you with stories of my abusive father set to dissonant flute.<eos> I was seven when he first came home drunk.<eos> A child should sleep on his bed, not under it.
- It is.<eos> I'll stay here with you.<eos> Nothing to worry about ever again.<eos> Just one last thing.<eos> If the people in town find my body, I'm worried about what they'll d... do with it.
I am alone and my child struggles to join this world.<eos> I release you from your promise, from the protection our secret gave me.<eos> For Julien has died. And I'm afraid I may soon join him.<eos> Please, bring help.<eos> But if I die and the child survives, care for my baby as if it were your own.
See, Hannah's pregnant, ain't she? So she's going to be off soon.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> That's how much she cares for this job.<eos> She's going to be off having a baby.<eos> Who's going to look after it?
It's tomorrow.<eos> If there's still planning to do, I've horribly miscalculated.<eos> You need to rest.<eos> It's a special day.<eos> You should enjoy it.
He's so thirsty.<eos> And he makes it look like it's his beer.<eos> He takes a sip.<eos> It's his beer.<eos> See, he walks around with it, makes sure that everyone knows it's his beer.
Let's go!<eos> No!<eos> No. This makes no sense at all.<eos> We go back for the body, and then what?<eos> We do what with it? Have any of you thought about that?
Mm-hmm, okay.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> No no no. Excuse me. Sir, I really think you're gonna want to change your mind when you hear how guilty this man feels about selling you the car that my mother gave me, and how he'll do anything to get it back,<eos> so just name your price, he's a millionaire.<eos> Look, I understand you've got a little situation going on and I'm no crook, so I'll let you drive it off the lot for 10,000.
You know, you should have more than one chair.<eos> What do you do when people come round?<eos> Sit on the bed.<eos> Why aren't you sitting on it, then?<eos> Do you think that there's something underneath it?
Haven't a clue.<eos> NY whose... what?<eos> It's a peer-to-peer apartment rental website.<eos> If you're going out of town, you post some photos of your residence<eos> - and a stranger will rent it from you.
Not everyone gets that.<eos> Not everyone's been in love.<eos> Do you want to protect it with me from now on?<eos> I know a place where we can keep it safe.<eos> What did you do with it?
But what makes you think that he's here?<eos> Uh, well, the warden of the penitentiary where Paul Collier was incarcerated gave us a list of his known associates, and we have one...<eos> Jared Temple, who lives directly across the street from where we found the body of Chris Jackson in the trunk of his BMW.<eos> Temple's apartment is down the corner on the right.<eos> And we've been sitting on top of it all afternoon.
What are you talking about?<eos> Who's hunting me? It's probably more of a "what," or possibly an "it."<eos> Stay away!<eos> S... Back away, stop.<eos> - Stay away. - It's easier to deny danger than to face it, but make no mistake, if you don't listen to me, you'll be dead by morning.
I grow weary of this conversation.<eos> See you on the other side, Sammy.<eos> I read about a tribe in Borneo.<eos> I can't remember what they were called. But they had this ritual, something that they would do every year.<eos> They'd put all their elderly, their infirm, up into a tree, and they would shake it.
Is she dead?<eos> No, she has a pulse, but it's incredibly weak.<eos> What's happening to her?<eos> It-it must be the egg.<eos> Melanie's connected to it. Whatever happens to it, happens to her.
No, she has a pulse, but it's incredibly weak.<eos> What's happening to her?<eos> It-it must be the egg.<eos> Melanie's connected to it. Whatever happens to it, happens to her.<eos> Someone must be doing something to it.
Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> Something I just never understood.<eos> The egg is the power source of the dome, right?<eos> Yeah, as far as we know.<eos> Yeah, but when you moved it, the dome didn't move with it.
- Almost nothing.<eos> A bottle of Melatonin, a picture of Fletcher and some girl.<eos> Weinstock was mostly interested in that.<eos> He was trying to protect Fletcher's marriage for some reason.<eos> This card was under it.
I mean, gay is "happy and lighthearted."<eos> It doesn't mean that anymore.<eos> As you well know, Pop, come on.<eos> Well, it was a good word.<eos> It still is just with a different connotation.
Michael, calm down!<eos> You don't have to believe me, but my feelings for you were real.<eos> Protecting the people of this city is more important to me than anything, and I'm sorry if you can't understand that.<eos> You kept Furiad's blade the entire time.<eos> What were you going to do, kill me with it?
Great idea.<eos> Hey there.<eos> So...<eos> About that staff meeting.<eos> - What about it?
He was a friend of my father's.<eos> My father was dying.<eos> He thought Henry would take care of me, of the estate.<eos> This place was so dear to him.<eos> It didn't occur to anyone that I could run it.
Would've saved us this little detour.<eos> You would've said no.<eos> You think you're that charming in person?<eos> When I died, my body...<eos> What did you do with it?
Stop yelling at me.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You're doing this for yourself.<eos> If my marriage ends, Jane won't give the baby to Rafael, and then you'll end up with it.
- Thank you, mistress.<eos> Let's check your posture.<eos> It's my cock. It's my scrotum.<eos> My slave's body belongs to me.<eos> I have total control over it.
It was taken by a tourist near the Vietnam Memorial.<eos> Unfortunately, it only shows the back of his head.<eos> I'd get it to NCIS.<eos> We got a forensic scientist there that works miracles.<eos> Doubt there's much he can do with it.
Don't forget, when you're down there, it's separate rooms.<eos> Don't think I won't be ringing the hotel to make sure there's been no hanky-panky, cos I will.<eos> No, Mr White.<eos> There's just one more thing, your religion.<eos> What about it?
- Just be careful.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> There's treasure in here.<eos> Whitney found the gold.<eos> Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.
Captain, flag on the play.<eos> Fire department says we may have a gang-related arson/homicide on our hands.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, after fire put out the car, patrol ran the plates.<eos> It's registered to Luis, the rims look right, and he drove it home yesterday.
Catching knew Fred Drake who had moved out of Los Angeles to kind of get away.<eos> Fred ran a studio called Dominion Way.<eos> It was in Hollywood...<eos> He was the engineer, and we all became really good friends with him 'cause he was such a great guy and he was an amazing engineer and musician.<eos> And he really wanted to come out here and just have a little studio that he could write his own music and enjoy life a little more than he was enjoying it in L.A.
[Groans] Please, don't make me laugh.<eos> All right, sorry.<eos> Enough with the funny business, right?<eos> Hey, Lieutenant, we located the rotor.<eos> We got a victim pinned under it.
- Let's go.<eos> So, uh, I was thinking about keeping the secret to myself, but, um, fuck it.<eos> I need the hive brain.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I say you buy an apartment and flip it.
Oh, my God.<eos> I didn't get anywhere with the earrings.<eos> They're too common, but that got me focused on her ear.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about it?
'We all needs a mate...' Hiya!<eos> '..it's natural.'<eos> And it might take you a while to find the right one, but you will.<eos> And you might lose 'em, but it was good that you found them in the first place.<eos> Everyone here has had a mate and lost 'em, but life's only interesting if you shares it.
What I didn't give him to smell was this other chemical - cyanide.<eos> Both benzaldehyde and cyanide have the same smell, they both smell of almonds, but these molecules are both very different shapes, so the lock and key mechanism, as an explanation for how we smell, can't be the whole story.<eos> So why would two molecules with different shapes smell the same?<eos> Quantum biology has a head-spinning explanation.<eos> It says our noses aren't smelling chemical molecules they're listening to them.
Actually, I'm drunk right now, but again, that's part of who I am.<eos> My personal ad? "Loves to have a good time."<eos> That's what I mean. I eat life out of the big box.<eos> I'm not hiding out here in the sticks or wherever it is you're going to next.<eos> Doesn't it seem strange that someone who eats life like you do, who has it all, is trying to escape it?
She has a lovely face.<eos> I know.<eos> May I take your photograph?<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Go for it.
Did I ask your help?<eos> Friends, bloody friends!<eos> First learn to see humans as humans.<eos> Life is very strange!<eos> We'll go as far as it throws us!
They're shutting us down.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Cogentiva is folding.<eos> If there ever was an evil empire, Abaddon's it, and that CEO is, like, a classic Darth Vader.
I was alone with a man.<eos> He saw my head uncovered.<eos> You took off your sheytil?<eos> Yes.<eos> And your body. Did he see it uncovered?
Cha-ching. I just wish I'd given you more to go on.<eos> So as I lay here writing my final words, a name comes to mind that I feel may be worth looking into.<eos> It's a former client by the name of Curtis Stanzen.<eos> Got it.<eos> Got it. What's his deal?
- Amazing!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> The ironic thing is that I've been working up a story on Abaddon for two years.<eos> If there ever was an evil empire, Abaddon's it, and that CEO Charles Szidon is, like, a classic Darth Vader.
No.<eos> It just means you get the benefit of the doubt.<eos> You'll have to keep the B-Plus.<eos> You were late turning in the assignment.<eos> But I worked so hard on it.
Thank you, and the Men of McKinley thank you.<eos> Finn... about that.<eos> I'm not sure I want to pose for the calendar.<eos> My body is sort of... broken.<eos> And I'm not really eager to start showing it off.
Foot patrol's canvassing the neighbourhood.<eos> I'll get someone to inform the victim's next of kin.<eos> Do I have to worry about you?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I'm suddenly working side by side with my ex, the woman who took my heart, tore it in half, and fed it to a pack of wolverines?
Did you hear about the crazed fan that attacked one of the stars of Cult last week?<eos> Did you know that Detective Sakelik was there at the party where it happened?<eos> What Detective Sakelik does in her off-duty time is her business.<eos> - What about Burt Quinn's murder?<eos> - What about it?
Look, it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do...<eos> Okay, we're gonna take all the bed linens from every motel room, and we're gonna use it to soak this all up.<eos> We're gonna wrap the body in one of the comforters, and we'll put it in a-- in one of the tubs in one of the motel rooms just-- just until I can figure out what to do with it tomorrow.
- It is. You should be really proud.<eos> In fact, I have a friend who has a small literary publication, and I'd like to send it to him.<eos> I think you might be able to get it published.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you need to do a little work on it,
Yet I would also break needed words.<eos> Well, shatter them quickly, or see them to ground I once stood upon.<eos> Is it true I am to serve Tiberius in Sinuessa?<eos> By his tongue did news fall upon ear?<eos> The boy carries my word yet spills it absent consideration.
I'm sorry, can we go back to the part about you owning a music label?<eos> Are you saying you could make me a star?<eos> I have to say, I'm happy someone finally decided to rent this space.<eos> It's been empty for a long time.<eos> So, what are you going to do with it?
And I can give it to who I want.<eos> Little girl, don't make me go mental on you.<eos> Boo, you don't run me no more.<eos> I know you miss my ass.<eos> But Tricia's been taking real good care of it, and soon it's walkin' out of here.
Alright.<eos> We could go away together, just you and I, just before I start showing.<eos> Europe, maybe.<eos> You could say you're studying or painting or something and that you need the company.<eos> We'd stay away long enough until I've... had the baby and found someone to take care of it.
I'm the only one who knows that.<eos> And it will go with me to the grave.<eos> Even he doesn't know. About the baby?<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened to it?
The air was stale, even the wood was twisted and strange.<eos> Wood?<eos> Wait, I thought it was underground, rock and stone. Why would there be wood?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the room he had Mother and me chained to was covered with it.
This is nuts.<eos> Why don't we just order a pizza and adopt?<eos> There are a lot of children out there in need of a good home.<eos> No, no, we must remain strong.<eos> Just go downstairs, cut up an apple and we'll share it.
We're here on behalf of Portland, Oregon.<eos> Have you guys heard of the chore wheel?<eos> See, you put your name in here.<eos> Your name there.<eos> And then you just turn it every day and then your name goes to whatever--
And I don't know what to do or how to feel.<eos> Your father's gone, and I know that's hard.<eos> But... you're still here.<eos> You have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> You just need to decide what you're gonna do with it.
I'm okay.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm so glad. 'Cause, you know, life can be scary.<eos> Life has much intense and you kind of just have to, like, ride it like a pony or you'll get a haircut, so...
Winter's coming.<eos> I'm gonna store you in my cheek, girl.<eos> Please leave.<eos> You and I not being together does not make sense to me.<eos> I miss your body and the things I used to do to it.
I love Marilyn.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> I spent two years behind bars just pissed off that life screwed me over.<eos> And then I met Penny, and she made me realize that you only get one life.<eos> And you better live it.
I had 2 years We did not realize that the snow falls.<eos> I had a face like that I saw mutt.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's because I'm a sailor, not you?<eos> For a moment I remembered ... if we had a child, then ... it would be a lot of things you would not be able to do with it.
Never mind...<eos> Give my love, my hugs to everyone.<eos> Take it.<eos> You can keep it.<eos> What can I do with it?
Innocent.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Guys, listen up.<eos> I think I just caught a whiff of our encryption on the local cell network.<eos> You should be right on top of it.
Agreed.<eos> jeff,it's a shame because i'm playing right now to beat the favorites.<eos> And now you're holding this massive target.<eos> Yeah,these things are pockets full of kryptonite.<eos> I mean,i'm going to play it tonight and then be done with it.
Don't you dare smoke that with my pretty pink lungs.<eos> I like holding the smoke in my lungs until it's completely absorbed into the cells.<eos> Stop that right now. I forbid you to damage my body.<eos> It's not your body anymore.<eos> It's mine. And I'll do what I want with it.
But you could kill yourself.<eos> In my body. And what a way to go!<eos> The speed, the wind in your face, and the flying.<eos> Oh, the flying.<eos> There's nothing else like it in the world.
I have sent for the magistrate and his men.<eos> We must wait for the law to take its course.<eos> Wait for the law?<eos> Yes, because without the law, we're just barbarians.<eos> And with it, what are you?
You made a mistake.<eos> That doesn't mean you deserve to die.<eos> You're right. I need to talk to Boyd.<eos> Mr. Reese, I believe I've located the origin of the poisoning.<eos> It came from water placed on the podium at his ceremony.
I'm not one of them.<eos> I'm not an Archangel.<eos> I'm really more run-of-the-mill.<eos> I worked in the secretarial pool before God chose me to take down the Word.<eos> Anyway, he seemed very worried about his work, what would happen to it when he left, so he had me write down instructions.
"The source of the Nile is still disputed.<eos> "The Victorians thought it was Lake Victoria,<eos> "but today we know this huge body of water is fed by many rivers.<eos> "One of them is the true source, and even today, in 2012,<eos> "experts have not been able to determine which it is.
What is this?<eos> This is my boyfriend Dominic Quinlan.<eos> Do you know Dominic drove your car last night, April?<eos> He borrows it all the time.<eos> I think he's driving it now.
But I thought you was workin' on your garbage sculpture.<eos> There was someone I had to see first.<eos> Sorry, Amanda.<eos> By the law of '80s movies, a newly transformed tomboy supersedes your long-standing hotness.<eos> Let's face it- there's only one drinking spot for us, and it's the Clam.
But I bailed at the last minute.<eos> And why didn't you go?<eos> There's something about that place, man.<eos> Creeps me out.<eos> What about it?
Please tell me you're not gonna ask me for one of my eggs.<eos> Heavens, no.<eos> Your eggs are almost as ossified as mine.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I was about to spit out this pesto and throw it at you.
It's "a romantic weekend without equal."<eos> I'm quoting the brochure.<eos> Well, I can't stay in Chicago.<eos> Eventually, I'm gonna run into Christina and she'll be holding a baby.<eos> Hey, as long as she's not thrusting it at you saying, "It's your problem now, Daddy."
Cooking for five at home is oddly more stressful than cooking for 30 in juvie.<eos> Danny, can we talk?<eos> It's about this investigation.<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> What about it?
You will not have to.<eos> I have his assurance we can skirt their territories and move on.<eos> Well, as Socrates said: "True wisdom is knowing that you know nothing."<eos> I will carve you out an empire, Father.<eos> But who will rule it after we are gone, huh?
The kids-- they, they think the egg is the source.<eos> Source of what?<eos> The dome.<eos> It's the generator of the dome.<eos> We can sort of talk to it.
No, no, no. I won't say a word.<eos> I've actually been asked to help out with college essays, so when you're ready to think of other schools, I'm here for you.<eos> It's really important to have a second choice, even if you had your heart set on something else.<eos> If I were you, I would actually apply to other schools right away.<eos> And you can email me the essay and maybe we can work on it over the weekend.
Adrian, I told you we...<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> Just, I don't feel so good.<eos> My advice is this...<eos> The trick to getting away with murder is not to let people think it was murder in the first place.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.<eos> What?<eos> How did you-<eos> I may not be good with facial expressions, but I know an evil doppelganger when I see one.<eos> Plus your arm makes a noise every time you move it.
He is in no condition to be held on your premises let alone being questioned.<eos> He's our only lead with TT.<eos> We just need five minutes with him.<eos> please?<eos> You're not above the law, detective, and my patient is not beneath it.
They're Bonnie and Clyde redux, young love on the run.<eos> - It tracks.<eos> - It still doesn't change anything.<eos> She has bipolar disorder, on medication.<eos> Even if she's going along with it, she's not capable.
The blood on it's gonna match the laceration on Phil's neck.<eos> - Was he killed with a knife?<eos> - No.<eos> He was shot. Well, there you go.<eos> I'm not accusing you of killing him with the knife. But you did cut him with it. So, maybe it didn't stop there.
Turns out you're in pretty deep to the Caterpillar.<eos> Okay, look. I made a horrible mistake.<eos> The thing is, you were right about everything.<eos> I felt bloody awful after what happened between us.<eos> If you ever had a heart, I don't know what happened to it.
Get out of this room now!<eos> Where the fuck did you come from?<eos> When I thought about it, properly... I didn't really trust you not to fuck it up.<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> I get a feeling and I go with it.
But this case is like nothing I've seen<eos> What are parasites?<eos> parasites are very tiny insects<eos> Almost invisible to the eye<eos> If they penetrate your body they'll take control of it
Excuse me.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The victim's car is at the print shed.<eos> They're going over it now.
What are you lookin' at? You gonna throw up?<eos> Where did you get those eyes?<eos> I'm surprised to see you packing. I thought you didn't live in fear.<eos> I said "we".<eos> Ethan's gone and his dream with it.
To address his guests.<eos> It's time they realize what kind of a man their host is.<eos> You're just going to crucify him in the media again?<eos> Crucifixion has such... A bad reputation.<eos> The Romans used it to punish people who acted against the public good.
I love it, man, I love, yeah.<eos> So, what you gonna do with that spot over there?<eos> - Uh, second-floor lounge.<eos> - Yeah, about that...<eos> I got a few ideas about what we could do with it.
You know, they're naked except for leather pants, and they pour olive oil all over their bodies and then wrestle in a grassy field until the first man is pinned.<eos> Sir, it's Bisset you're upset about losing, right?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Well, it's perfectly legal to fly a domestic drone.<eos> Pindar wasn't recording pictures, let alone intending to sell any, and it was over public airspace when he lost control of it.
A tree grew strong and tall.<eos> Its top touched the sky, and it was visible to the ends of the earth.<eos> Its leaves, they were beautiful.<eos> Its fruit was abundant.<eos> The beasts of the field took shelter under it, and the birds of the air lived in its branches, and from it every creature was fed.
You know, I've been thinking. You can make a lot of extra bank by keeping this place open after hours.<eos> All right, let's get one thing straight.<eos> This is my bar, my schedule.<eos> Well, now that I'm staying here, I was kind of thinking that, you know, this was our bar.<eos> I did care of it for six months.
And there is something you can do for me.<eos> Prove he's innocent.<eos> I appreciate you coming back to my office.<eos> Well, we assume you're purchasing the photograph.<eos> Actually, no, but the A.D.A. is interested in it.
But I'm gonna need your help.<eos> - With what?<eos> - Taking care of the baby.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> I'll take good care of it like you take good care of me.
- And that's when...<eos> - My leg.<eos> You're wrong about the ditch.<eos> - I remember this tree.<eos> We took cover behind it.
He would never have risen at dawn to feed the bull.<eos> Then how did he come to be lying dead in a bull pen?<eos> Cyrus was always kind to me.<eos> When we were taken as slaves... we were only given meagre rations as we journeyed to Atlantis.<eos> Cyrus would steal food from the guards and share it with me.
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I... I was so certain I had him figured out.<eos> Welcome to my life.<eos> How did you make it work for so long?
You know what I mean.<eos> All right, well, if you don't want it, I'll just have to return it.<eos> I still want it.<eos> See?<eos> I shouldn't have said that because now you're probably gonna have sex with it, aren't ya?
Do you really want me to describe everything in the bags?<eos> Well, why don't you just skip to the good bit?<eos> Nothing unusual with the liver.<eos> Her heart... pretty much just a bunch of muscle fiber.<eos> The killer must have put the shotgun barrel right over it.
That is the source of the Nile.<eos> "This is not the source of the Nile."<eos> It is.<eos> "The source of the Nile is still disputed.<eos> "The Victorians thought it was Lake Victoria," "but today we know this huge body of water is fed by many rivers."
Sure. I'll tell her when she's done dancing.<eos> -You are aware that the logo is a...?<eos> -A dick in a butt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All of our friends are, like, rocking it.
Well, they were up to something, and we didn't know what.<eos> Can you teach me to do that thing?<eos> You know, that you do with your arms and you put your head up in the sun.<eos> Well, first, find the light, all right?<eos> Okay. Just absorb it. Just soak it in.
Stop!<eos> I beg you, seriously!<eos> Alright, stop...<eos> Aaa, the picture, watch out!<eos> - If something happened to it, I will kill you!
Yeah, um... the social workers would give me this test every time I got a new foster family. Travis, how dare you make a mockery of this exercise.<eos> Where's your tree, Wes?<eos> Now, that is a perfect representation of Wes-- blank and white.<eos> Wrong. My tree is imaginary.<eos> It's a thousand feet tall. And there's a unicorn underneath it.
H.E.R.B.I.E.?<eos> Were all the good robots name taken?<eos> Very inappropriate.<eos> Bad Robot!<eos> Spider-Man, Are you playing with that thing or fighting it?
"Ehh." And this is you catching.<eos> "Ahh!" That's wonderful mime work!<eos> I guess you're just good at everything!<eos> Now that the truth is out, we need to discuss ways for you and Hayley to regain intimacy!<eos> Yeah, Jeff, come back. I came out of your favorite place. Maybe you can still smell it on me!
- Open the door!<eos> - The door is open!<eos> - Good riddance to you! - Freak!<eos> Good riddance!<eos> You must love that beer, you've been holding it all night.
You're in here.<eos> I thought we'd be sharing an office.<eos> It's the Met's crime archive.<eos> It was being digitised, page by page, but then the budget was cut and the project was shelved.<eos> It was going into storage, so I volunteered to take it.
There's something down there.<eos> They set us up!<eos> Evidence doesn't lie.<eos> We've known all along what the murder weapon was.<eos> Tonight we caught you with it.
I hooked up with someone when I was away.<eos> You said it was over, right?<eos> It looks like he won't take no for an answer.<eos> Training a horse is an art.<eos> You have to work with the animal, taking all the fight out if it until it truly is broken.
I'm sorry. I was the time it lost.<eos> It is best to wait, because they sit on comfortable chairs.<eos> Dad, I think I know what I must do. I feel it.<eos> But I...<eos> It is hard. If you feel the calling to serve, you should follow it.
It's doing my head in.<eos> Anyway, life's too short, as we've just found out.<eos> Uh... your mum's getting a bit anxious.<eos> We'd better get in.<eos> 'Catherine's life might have been cut short, ' but she had lived it to the full.
If this heiress thing ever goes south, you got yourself a big future in clam baking.<eos> How are things with Amanda?<eos> They're good. Sometimes I can see all that pain and anger fighting to take over.<eos> I don't know that happiness is ever really gonna come that easy to her.<eos> Not like it used to.
I'm sorry for what we had to do.<eos> What was it like in there?<eos> Um... (Sighing)<eos> It seemed good at first.<eos> But I figure if I have to shack up with a monster, I'd rather it be you guys.
Fine.<eos> I admit it. I want to earn what I have.<eos> I want to build something that is lasting and meaningful.<eos> And not just so Marla's death means something, but so my life means something, too.<eos> Well, I happen to believe life means something if you enjoy it.
O God of battles!<eos> Steel my soldiers' hearts. Possess them not with fear.<eos> Take from them now the sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.<eos> Not today, O Lord, O, not today, think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown!<eos> I Richard's body have interred anew, and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood.
He may as well be holding my heart.<eos> And I was too shy to say anything.<eos> And then when we became friends, I didn't want to jeopardize the friendship.<eos> And I know that if I never said anything, then we'd always just be friends, and I don't want to be that shy girl always wishing that her life would turn out the way that I want it to.<eos> I have to make it turn out the way that I want it to.
I'm not giving him back.<eos> I'm keeping him.<eos> He's mine now.<eos> You can't keep somebody else's baby.<eos> What, you don't think I can look after it?
Consult the damn protocol for running quarantine.<eos> What did you put in the public announcement?<eos> What's the matter with you people?<eos> How is the remedy coming along?<eos> Still working on it, sir.
You've got to stop it before...<eos> Now what?<eos> The Pym particles of your prison are unstable at this size.<eos> The place is shrinking uncontrollably.<eos> But we're not shrinking with it.
Believe me, we feel horrible about this, and we'll pay to have it fixed and if you want to take back your house key while you're at it, we totally understand.<eos> Just please don't hate us.<eos> Why would I ever hate you?<eos> I hate myself for not telling you to drive it in the first place.<eos> Seriously, what is the point of having a brand-new car if you can't share it with your neighbors?
I'm taking Emily to Paris.<eos> We'll get married and stay there until we choose the life we want to lead, one that doesn't involve Grayson Manor, Grayson Global, or anything Grayson.<eos> What does Emily have to say about this?<eos> Hmm?<eos> What makes you think that she'll give up the Grayson name and everything that comes with it so easily?
He stole it!<eos> He said, if you used the black light...<eos> If you subject Styteline to a 15-nanosecond blast of black light, it temporarily changes the refractive index.<eos> And if you believe that load of old cobblers, you'll believe anything.<eos> We saw him leave the room with it.

Oh, I-- I want to adopt a baby, but apparently nobody wants to give a kid to the cancer lady.<eos> No, they hear the word "cancer" and people think you're the Boogeyman.<eos> Hmm. Can't say I blame them.<eos> I know this sounds stupid, but I just--<eos> I just thought if maybe I got a baby it would somehow magically guarantee I'd be around to take care of it.
Why you go?<eos> You have new girl.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm going to the baby store with Lou.<eos> We're buying a crib, and then he asked me to take it home and build it.
At the same time you were meeting with this judge, your wife had a suit in front of him, and the subject never came up?<eos> - That's correct.<eos> - This grand jury investigation into Will Gardner's supposed bribing of three judges, including Judge Wynters...<eos> Objection.<eos> We are not referring to the content of that investigation, just to Mr. Florrick's supervision of it.
No can do. I tweaked my back.<eos> You'll just have to drive it.<eos> I'm not driving this.<eos> Look, Mr. B., I saw the way you looked at this thing, and I know you can start it.<eos> I'm not gonna drive it.
Let's just say Don and I enjoy each other's company.<eos> - Oh. - Great job, Lorna.<eos> Although that lift was a little stiff.<eos> Thanks, Don.<eos> But we can work on it in my studio Monday morning.
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't...<eos> I'd locate the fistula endoscopically, then inject fibrin glue.<eos> What about an abscess?<eos> What about it?
Patrol found a car matching the description of one fleeing the scene where Ecklie was shot.<eos> This was in the backseat.<eos> Where's the car now?<eos> It's in the garage.<eos> Mandy's on it.
The armada will make it through before we can stop them.<eos> The beam that creates the force tunnel.<eos> - What if we flew into it?<eos> - Well, how's that?<eos> What if we flew inside the beam and followed it all the way to the Lighthouse?
And this summer you're at Joffrey, so that's really two years minus a summer.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> You've just got to suck it up.<eos> Be tougher.<eos> Life is unfair, deal with it.
The kid was on a dirt bike.<eos> He could've just...<eos> He could've gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink.<eos> We never would've caught him.<eos> I thought on my feet. I saw a threat... - ...and I took care of it.
What is he talking about?<eos> Scott's dead.<eos> He was shredded, and his heart's gone.<eos> That doesn't mean that Michael --<eos> What do you think happened to it?
Yo, wasteland. Your raise - instated retroactively.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The car is used, all right?<eos> It's not as expensive as it looks.<eos> But I shouldn't have brought it here.
No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Keep it safe.
You did nothing wrong.<eos> Let me eat this heart, then we can pick azaleas together.<eos> Jing!<eos> It's my treacherous eyes that brought you to this hell!<eos> Even if I see this skin 1000 times I'd Still be charmed by it.
Getting there, that's up to you.<eos> Camp: This is the address?<eos> Gray: It's about five blocks away.<eos> It flattens out at the top.<eos> This place wasn't exactly accessible, but we'd work on it.
And it doesn't matter that she's fast or that you won't see her again after she's gone home?<eos> She made me feel good about myself for the first time here.<eos> Alfred!<eos> Hurry up, I need you to take around the claret.<eos> Won't they spill it on the floor?
And what's he saying?<eos> Yeah, okay, thanks.<eos> That was highway patrol.<eos> They said Granger beat a guy up and stole his pickup.<eos> They put an apb out on it.
Oh, I also got a call from some reporter about some kind of voting irregularities in Ohio,<eos> - but it's nothing I can't handle.<eos> - What was their name?<eos> Oh, Richard something.<eos> I'll take care of it.
I've got to get something for Valerie.<eos> Can you just please watch the baby for a couple of minutes?<eos> We're watching it right now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know-- by watching, I don't mean just physically watching it.
[Snickers] Are you laughing at the word "gynecologist"?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What if you guys had a baby?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sophia could take care of it, yeah?
Well, that's about time.<eos> That bar gave dives a bad name.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You loved that place.<eos> Well, yeah, you're right, I did love it, right up until the moment that they kicked me out for life.
I don't want to improve anything.<eos> Can I take it I'm finished?<eos> Yes... and you can boast of having the best skin in the world.<eos> And now what?<eos> Now I'm going to light this opium pipe... and smoke it.
What do you see?<eos> I don't know, man. I don't see shit.<eos> How do we get out of here?<eos> - Lieutenant, where's the exit?<eos> - I'm working on it!
Hello, Thadeous.<eos> The time for pleasantries is through.<eos> Do you feel that tiny prick in your back?<eos> Is that your cock?<eos> No, 'tis a knife, but I'll gladly penetrate you with it.
Last one there's a rotten egg.<eos> Once the coast is clear, we use the key to get into the back room.<eos> I guard while you kill the power.<eos> While everyone's trying to turn the power on you and I will get the tree.<eos> We take it to your place, and when Maria's dad comes home and sees this beautiful tree in your living room, he'll jizz all over it.
We're trying to have a baby.<eos> What?<eos> I just can't imagine it, Lucy holding a baby.<eos> Why?<eos> She wouldn't know what to do with it.
If this is not the case, be angry and go your way; for if you don't you will not be worthy to see the beautiful sign<eos> you carry inside you.<eos> Know that you are not aware of the great wisdom this book contains.<eos> Neither what the point is, nor how it concerns us."<eos> I say this with respect and sadness, for your task is not an easy one, it's not only finishing the syllabus, I assure you.
Feel free to snoop around.<eos> See you tonight?<eos> Pain under the ribs.<eos> Under the heart.<eos> The struggle between it and the brain, to gain the upper hand.
So he can find Prateek<eos> Meaning?<eos> If we destroy his HART he'd still chase us<eos> We'd be running forever<eos> If we don't destroy it we must fight him
It's getting to him.<eos> Yeah, it's a shame about them.<eos> See, I can't help but notice that every time Yuson grabs his cell you get this strange look on your face like you've done something you shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I just feel sorry for him.<eos> See, the look I saw looks more like the mouse who hid the last piece of cheese and she don't wanna share it.
Go back to Stockholm.<eos> When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist we know who to call.<eos> All right. Thanks.<eos> This way, miss.<eos> If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.
- No one home? - No.<eos> His wife works in the city.<eos> We meet about twenty.<eos> The fence in Gothenburg would get fifty percent.<eos> Ove Kjikerud would get 20% for disabling the alarm, get the art and run to Sweden with it.
I have to find her.<eos> Well, I'll come with you.<eos> The question of whether we can fight fate will always remain a mystery.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> But the bigger question is what happens when we stop fighting it?
They're casting a wide net.<eos> We're gonna track him down.<eos> He tried to kill me, and now he could be anywhere?<eos> Marge, would you please give that horrible baby back to Rhonda?<eos> How? She isn't taking care of it.
You never know.<eos> Me and the kids, together; have had our down times and I haven't tried to hide anything from them.<eos> You know, we've done our crying together And then, "OK, what are we gonna do now?"<eos> Get over it, move on.<eos> I think the point of life is to enjoy it.
I.A.'s sniffing around.<eos> I wouldn't worry so much about her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The lab get back to you about that video?<eos> There's nothing that they could, uh, do with it.
We won, Mick.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Victory is sweet.<eos> Got to savor it, right?
I have so many unanswered questions, questions I feel but can't even begin to speak... because there are no words to express them.<eos> Something is missing.<eos> Why, God, do I feel... do I feel unwanted?<eos> Why do I feel I have no r/jght to exist?<eos> Why do I spend more time wanting to end my life than live it?".
Wait, wait, wait, where are you going? Relax, corporal.<eos> How does it look?<eos> Not good.<eos> That thing is still down there.<eos> It's guarding its lair, and you're in no condition to make a run for it.
No, the fire.<eos> It recognizes intelligence.<eos> Didn't stop it from trying to kill us.<eos> That's because you were a threat to it and its family.<eos> It recognizes a threat and goes after it.
So what's up with you guys, huh?<eos> Nothing's up with these guys.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They've been frozen like Ted Williams waiting for the return of their life.<eos> And now that it has returned, let's get back to it.
Yeah, and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over 900 years of memory and experience.<eos> We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool.<eos> - Because bow ties are...<eos> - And always will be.<eos> But how did the Flesh read you? Because you weren't linked up to it.
Here you go.<eos> Lars Lowery's number.<eos> 614?<eos> That doesn't sound like Holland. Columbus, Ohio.<eos> You know, psychologists talk about confirmation bias... you tell yourself a lie, and then you ignore all of the facts that contradict it.
Did I mention that I was really, really sorry?<eos> Well, I appreciate the lessons and the bruises, but the world has changed, cap.<eos> Life moves faster now than ever, and it's only gonna get faster still.<eos> I'm wired in to a worldwide network of computers and satellites.<eos> The goal is to see danger before it gets here.
- Yeah, I realize that now.<eos> I think what you did was more like a ground rule double or something.<eos> I'm aware of the judge's ruling.<eos> Shouldn't be talking about this stuff.<eos> That life, it's gone and everyone in it.
Immortality is an easy thing to take for granted.<eos> You've got forever. What's a little mistake here and there?<eos> But that's the thing about forever.<eos> The choices you make, the people you lose, your mistakes are indelible, with no sweet death to erase your own memory.<eos> You may think the greatest reward of eternal life is the power it gives you.
Coming up at 11:30, a live interview with Oswald Danes.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That food is for everyone.<eos> The food is for guests.<eos> Right, but it's meant to be shared.
It looks no more than one of God's creatures, same as you or I.<eos> I never thought I'd hear Thomas Brown compare himself to a snake.<eos> We were here, Sydney.<eos> We found it.<eos> What we going to do with it?
- Can we get by with more children?<eos> - If our relationship gets by.<eos> Can we get by?<eos> We should publish that photo.<eos> Let's paste it on every wall.
Grant us access to the tower, And I promise an end to your suffering.<eos> Continue to refuse, and<eos> Shush, teekl!<eos> I'm watching the show.<eos> Enjoy it... While you can.
You sought to take the helmet before it claimed a host, But you are too late.<eos> Shut it, you old fart!<eos> What gives?<eos> -Well, it is your body.<eos> Then let me control it.
Mainly that things will get better.<eos> Even if it doesn't seem that way.<eos> The Egu's engine seizes up a couple of days before leaving.<eos> Life has a strange sense of humour.<eos> What am I going to do with it here.
You will certainly be punished.<eos> From tomorrow, you will hold your classes... together with mine.<eos> Tearing walls down breaking new ground<eos> is this light leaving behind shackles that held it tight the darkness will surround you make it your ink pot<eos> and script a brand new day smash the locks, let the sun shine hold the light in your hands, make it thine break the wells, the river will flow inhale it, share it, let it glow
Do what you can.<eos> May there be paths for everyone lined with hope on either side and the light shines along through the ride may there be paths for everyone lined with hope on either side and the light shines along through the ride there was a void, but now it's filled<eos> there was a barrier, but now it's gone the sun and the sky<eos> are right here<eos> smash the locks, let the sun shine hold the light in your hands, make it thine break the wells, the river will flow inhale it, share it, let it glow it's the light it belongs to everyone
I led you to those victories.<eos> They were my victories.<eos> There is no way you could have pulled that off.<eos> I built this place.<eos> I've kept it running for years.
I'll come with you. Zee, hold this.<eos> But we'd have to carry Drake.<eos> And Dad...<eos> He can't run right now.<eos> I'll go get the car. I'll bring it right up to the front door.
Modoc and AIM have created a device that can change reality itself.<eos> The cosmic cube was designed to take one's deepest desires, their greatest wishes, and make them reality.<eos> For instance, a reality where Hydra won the Second World War.<eos> But if Modoc had such a device--<eos> He would have used it by now. That is exactly why we must capture it before it is complete.
Unbelievable.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> So, Amy, we've talked to your co-workers and Doug, and... We've assessed the situation...<eos> Yeah, I'm sure...<eos> And it does seem Doug's behavior in the office... And outside of it, has been an issue, not just with you.
All right, the lab just sent this over.<eos> They found traces of jet fuel on our vic's shoes, clothing and skin.<eos> Jet fuel.<eos> Okay, he could have come into contact with that when his body was dumped.<eos> Yeah, but, uh, the skin absorption rate suggests that Leung came into contact with it hours before his death.
He's breathing down my neck.<eos> He's messing with your head. That's what suits do.<eos> So, there's nothing from the heist that could be tied back to me?<eos> You know that art studio where you keep all the paintings you've done?<eos> What about it?
My God, da Vinci is your ancestor!<eos> But why would Bertram go back this far to get rid of you?<eos> Ah, you're forgetting I initially encountered Bertram as a sperm in one of the fat man's balls, so he couldn't get rid of the fat man or any recent ancestor on my father's side.<eos> Bertram had to go back enough generations to make sure he was snuffing out the ancestral source of my genius without affecting his own.<eos> And apparently, it's Leonardo da Vinci.
Did you have Braxton Hicks contractions with Adam? - Hey, Adam.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> Hi, Sean, how are you?<eos> I feel like my blood is carbonated.<eos> I usually don't get this excited about the female body when I'm on the outside of it.

I don't even know what the appeal of something like this is.<eos> I dated a guy who was into SM and his safe word was "more."<eos> It was very confusing.<eos> Medical science needs to come up with a baby bjorn-type item that allows you to wear your fetus on the outside of your body.<eos> That way you could walk around with it all day and undock when you wanna put on a sexy dress or spend half an hour on a spin bike.
I didn't for a while.<eos> I'm starting to live again, but basically I just shut down.<eos> Montgomery County has a victims assistance program, but when you- when your whole family's ripped from you, you- you know, you're kind of like, what's the point?<eos> What's the point of living anymore?<eos> I don't have a family to share it with.
'As it turned out, the baby Range Rover coped well on the sand.'<eos> What happens if I try and go up there?<eos> Crikey, that's a big climb.<eos> You've got to be bloody careful.<eos> 'There was, however, a weak link, 'and, as ever, it was my internal sat nav.'
But how many spirits you meet in their right mind?<eos> Some hunter's gonna cut you down.<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> You've helped.<eos> You got handed a small, unremarkable life, and you did something with it.
When Alison DiLaurentis was murdered, she was hit so hard, it made an indentation to her skull.<eos> I've given you guys so many chances to just be honest with me.<eos> Evidence doesn't lie.<eos> We've known all along what the murder weapon was.<eos> Tonight we caught you with it.
I-I just... Actually...<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to your horse.<eos> Yeah, that's okay.<eos> You know, training a horse is an art.<eos> You have to work with the animal, bending its will until it knows you're its master, taking all the fight out of it until it truly is broken.
I-Important?<eos> Helen was right.<eos> It's all linked.<eos> You, the Fades, the murders, them touching.<eos> The shit has hit the fan and you're standing right in front of it.
- I would've thought you'd come to me on your knees.<eos> Please.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> What about tomorrow?<eos> What about it?
They fend off loneliness with casual conversation.<eos> They share old treasures with a young friend.<eos> They help a neighbor make a difficult move.<eos> But for Carlos and Gaby Solis, the only connection that mattered was the romantic one.<eos> And when it came to maintaining it,
- This is the real thing!<eos> - Give me some!<eos> - Wait for the go!<eos> That booze... It was bribery.<eos> Buried with it was a thick envelope.
Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> No one claimed the body?<eos> That's so sad.<eos> You'd think they'd have done something with it.
You think it's noble and enlightened to lay down and die?<eos> I saw a guy who could have been my brother dead on the street last night.<eos> There was nothing noble about it. It was just fucking sad.<eos> I'm not trying to be noble. I'm trying to live my life, and for some reason, you won't let me.<eos> 'Cause you're not living it.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> Is this a finding?<eos> I haven't completed my testimony.<eos> We have your statement.<eos> Is it deficient in some way?
May we please get back to the topic at hand?<eos> Which was me.<eos> Here's to the newest spokesmodel for Très Jolie Cosmetics.<eos> Finally my lifelong dream has come true.<eos> Spokesmodeling is your dream? Yes, because it tells the world
Hi.<eos> I'll be treating you now.<eos> I work with the Agency.<eos> Think of a radioactive isotope like a habanero pepper.<eos> You can be around it. It won't hurt you.
Must've been days away from running.<eos> After the car was stolen, he didn't have time to get new documents.<eos> That's why he was desperate to get 'em back.<eos> The uncatchable Dominik Janos brought down by a family of car thieves.<eos> I always tell my kids the only reason evil exists in the world is so that good can triumph over it.
Honey, I gotta go be a mom now.<eos> I know it's just a manic Monday, but I can't be up burning the eternal flame.<eos> Don't try to talk to me in bangles titles.<eos> My life's just evolving, okay?<eos> We just gotta evolve with it.
What are you doing?<eos> You always use up all the hot water. I'll be quick.<eos> Okay, I don't want to use the soap after you've put it all over your business.
I was instantly in another place.<eos> I no longer had a body.<eos> I was now a point of light.<eos> After a while, as I'm experiencing this and being this, a light appeared.<eos> And I pulled into the light like a tractor beam and merged into it.
B-minus version of herself.<eos> I get it.<eos> Fifth year is competitive.<eos> Your whole career depends on it, but if you're not careful, you're gonna wake up one day and realize that you're no longer the badass, hard-core, spontaneous, take-charge, crazy, fun person you thought you were,<eos> but instead, some sad, sorry wife who stays in every night and talks about food like it's an orgasm when it's clearly not.
It's just the way it has to be.<eos> Arthur... don't let anyone tell you what to do.<eos> You said you are your own man.<eos> You've a good heart.<eos> Be true to it.
So, it was the king of writing who was stinking of shit.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> I know a great way to get rid of shit smell.<eos> Of course, shit stinks because it's shit.<eos> If it doesn't smell, it's not shit.
A Chinese alchemist in search of an elixir for long life, instead stumbles upon chemistry that can bring sudden death.<eos> He combines carbon and sulfur with saltpeter, a compound made of potassium, nitrogen, and oxygen.<eos> Forged in the stars, these elements now come together to make gunpowder.<eos> The recipe for gunpowder eventually moves west across the Silk Roads to the Islamic world,<eos> where Muslim warriors use it to fire cannon balls at Christian crusaders.
Wish I could help you.<eos> Joan.<eos> Call in your team.<eos> Langford doesn't just know something about this murder...<eos> He's behind it.
And yes, I know<eos> I drove one in last year's program<eos> I also drove one on Top Gear<eos> And I reviewed one in the Sunday Times<eos> So why then, am I now driving it again?
That the integrity of his behavior would protect him against misfortune.<eos> And his friends thought, mistakenly, that the Lord could only have punished him because, secretly, he'd done something wrong.<eos> But no.<eos> Misfortune befalls the good as well.<eos> We can't protect ourselves against it.
Tell her you can't marry her.<eos> I love you. I've always loved you.<eos> And I should've told you a long time ago, but I'm telling you now before it's too late, before it's really too late.<eos> You're not the only one who hasn't been living his life.<eos> I haven't either, but I wanna live it now. And I wanna live it with you.
- Go ahead and...<eos> - Are you married or not?<eos> No. Go ahead and...<eos> Jill, go ahead and spin the wheel.<eos> No, because I know once I spin it, I don't get to be near you any more.
Sam?<eos> Hello?<eos> Sam, it's me.<eos> I want you to keep the line open.<eos> If you get ugly, the line goes dead, your wife goes dead with it, you understand? Yeah.
That view cost me three times what the house did.<eos> See that strip mall down there?<eos> You own that too?<eos> No.<eos> I own everything above it.
See that strip mall down there?<eos> You own that too?<eos> No.<eos> I own everything above it.<eos> - There is nothing above it.
The station is guarded at all times.<eos> And the stairs to the platform are sealed off.<eos> Our train driver makes an unscheduled stop under the bridge.<eos> The last two carriages will be around here. They will be empty.<eos> Once the train is stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence, or anything that happens beyond it.
So the deal was sealed.<eos> H20 would have his story.<eos> But never again... would they use anything resembling reason... in their discussion of the art of angling.<eos> Never again would they go fishing together... and never would their marriage vows waver or weaken.<eos> Fly tying is for certain a tedious task... but there's no need to let it get to you like that, my love.
There's just something so primal about swimming, so purifying.<eos> You're really good at this, aren't you?<eos> At what?<eos> You know how to live.<eos> Well, I figure you better enjoy it while you got it.
I saw this city in the deep deep distance, it was dark green and there were many lights flickering and clouds flowing over it.
Do you know what people call him?<eos> Actually, superstar... - ma'am, one last question.<eos> You're everyone's dream girl.<eos> But who is your dream man?<eos> It's neither a superstar nor a jubilee star.
- Man... - You coming with me!<eos> I'm not going any... Okay, okay!<eos> I gotta get dressed.<eos> No disrespect, but I really think it's time you get a new whip.<eos> It just needs a little work, that's all.
You.<eos> Jessica is good soccer, swimming, skiing. And a very good student.<eos> Weslyan early decision next year.<eos> Late at night she read "Gettysburg Civil Trash 'advanced history.<eos> She learned it from her mind, and found it better than anyone.
If not, we're fucked, Costa.<eos> Make the bastard give his word!<eos> What the fuck are you playing at, Daniel?<eos> Can you not think of the time and effort that have gone into this film?<eos> The hundreds of people working on it, the money we're spending?
- Shut up!<eos> YASMIN NOOR<eos> Nothing lasts here...<eos> The sea claims everything<eos> I can share everything with it, tell it all my secrets,
If I turn my back on the Shogun and find fault with his lineage, then his rule will spiral into chaos an destroy years of peace.<eos> As the Shogun's senior advisor, I cannot do it.<eos> Are you asking if I can do something?<eos> Since Mamiya's harakiri protest three days ago... I've searched my soul for a solution.<eos> I have decided it's you.
You've travelled all the way to cast your vote, Father?<eos> You can't do this, Ethan. lt's a serious matter.<eos> You can't decide on it through a radio poll.<eos> Via SMS, then?<eos> Life is God's gift to us and we have no right to play with it.
Ah-Sheng, this is tortoise powder<eos> Within a few hours, your heart and breath will stop, and you will appear to be dead<eos> When the Wheel King sees you, he will think you're dead<eos> I will make sure your father's death is avenged<eos> I changed all of my money into gold and paved it on the floor of our house
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> Arlo's at CTU, running the surveillance video through facial recognition software.<eos> - Still no sign of Jack.<eos> - Look, I've been thinking. Let's say we do get this recording from Jack.<eos> What are we supposed to do with it?
Lovely.<eos> 'They say you can take the boy out of rural Lincolnshire, but you can't take the rural Lincolnshire out of the boy.'<eos> (BOTH BLEAT) I can't send that.<eos> 'We want to know about desire.<eos> How it works. What's underneath it.'
Dispatching the thracian brings me relief.<eos> You descending into the pits does not.<eos> It stains the name, and threatens the body.<eos> My body will be well protected.<eos> Barca looms over it, ready to break bone at the slightest provocation.
It didn't explode!<eos> Damage report!<eos> Sir!<eos> The wave gun!<eos> What about it?
You know what I mean?<eos> I've never really been happy, not even when I was a little girl.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I kind of think happiness is... overrated.<eos> People spend their whole lives chasing it, like it's the most important thing in the world.
The cure, there's still testing to be done, and it could take all night to find the correct dosage.<eos> Well, I can pack a bag.<eos> No.<eos> No, you haven't slept in weeks.<eos> If it works, there could be many days and weeks of recuperation.
- 15 minutes. - Uh-huh.<eos> Dude, I wanna tell you something.<eos> Will you look at me, please?<eos> I just had a drunken revelation out there, okay?<eos> It wasn't mine, it was my dad's, But at this point, I'll take it.
Aah, I worked till 4:00.<eos> No, working is teaching Western civ to hormonal teenagers.<eos> You drunk dialed me from your job.<eos> Well, that's a perk of the career path, baby.<eos> I don't think that opening up a bar and living above it was what your dad had in mind when he gave you the building.
I can take care of this.<eos> I can.<eos> Whenever the adversary tries to convince you that you can't change, he's lying. He's the father of lies.<eos> Bishop Soferman, I've been going to Alignment for six years and it's only gotten worse.<eos> No temptation is so strong that you can't resist it unless you've given away your free agency to complete addiction.
Father must have buried it there a long time ago.<eos> Father.<eos> Was it Shadow Water?<eos> You knew about it?<eos> There was a rumor, when I was training to be a Wizard, that Father had found the source and was experimenting with it.
- Whoa, hold on.<eos> They're not just yours to throw away.<eos> They're mine too.<eos> - What about the meeting tonight?<eos> - What about it?
This is exactly what we need.<eos> You heard the crowd.<eos> This will save us.<eos> This place is dying.<eos> You don't need to die with it.
No, why?<eos> What would be different?<eos> Come on, admit it, it was bothering you that I left the crib in the middle of the living room.<eos> No, I thought it was delightful.<eos> Okay. Well, I took care of it.
The garage.<eos> I'm having the turbo changed on my bike.<eos> Right, the show must go on, eh?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> But most of all I miss it.
So, I chew gum.<eos> Renata and I work together on that car all the time.<eos> - That doesn't prove anything.<eos> - The morning that Trevor died, he couldn't find his car keys, but he said found them later inside his car.<eos> So I think that you got your BFF Cindy to steal the car and bring it out the desert so you could race it.
We'll do whatever it takes.<eos> Is there any way you can get me info on a european cell phone if I don't have the number?<eos> You okay?<eos> I should never have left him alone at that crime scene.<eos> We didn't know it was a crime scene.
Help me get him out.<eos> He's cold.<eos> Shouldn't we lift his legs?<eos> Not with a chest wound.<eos> I need to open it up, see how bad it is.
I want you to take this and give it to my son.<eos> - Stop talking like that.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> It's my lucky charm.<eos> Whenever life has him down And he needs a boost or just a little good luck, He'll take that out of the box and have sex with it.
- I am.<eos> - What with?<eos> Overconfidence, this and a small screw driver.<eos> I'm sorted.<eos> Just have to find the right crosactic setting, and stun him with it.
- Nobody.<eos> I worked for him for years, and I didn't even know.<eos> It's why I was willing to die so that he could live.<eos> It's your heart?<eos> I was born with it.
It is his fate<eos> He can't come back<eos> It is his fate<eos> Kafka, your heart is missing!<eos> Chase after it or you can't come back
She's an actress, a professional liar.<eos> She's paid to cry on cue.<eos> No.<eos> I've never seen this picture before. Really?<eos> You sure you didn't use it to blackmail Bobby Mann?
Here's some free advice.<eos> Kindergarten's over.<eos> Training wheels are off.<eos> Nobody's gonna catch you if you fall.<eos> If you don't like your life, you do something about it.
That is my pride and joy.<eos> Where's your husband?<eos> He passed away a few years back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh don't be, he had a good life and I was lucky enough to share it with him.
They'll call.<eos> You'll get in.<eos> My first week in Tree Hill, I told Haley I was gonna close this place.<eos> Couldn't wait to get out of here.<eos> And now I'm gonna miss it.
'The sun has a final invisible force that reaches out much further.<eos> 'Our star is, by far, the largest wonder in the solar system.<eos> 'In fact, it alone is 99% of the solar system's mass.<eos> 'It's this immensity that gives the sun its furthest reaching influence... ..gravity.<eos> So its gravitational field dominates and all the planets are bound gravitationally to it.
All right, then.<eos> Uh, would you please join me back in the electronics room?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and, gentlemen, if we are dealing with a mastermind here, I seriously doubt it's the guy who has safes in his house.
You knew?<eos> His car is 30 years old and doesn't have a muffler.<eos> And he honked.<eos> I loved that car.<eos> I rode in it to the guitar store. I felt like I was flying.
Where were you?<eos> You know, if I were you, I'd plead "'roid rage."<eos> I got an alibi.<eos> You can't just have an alibi.<eos> You got to share it with the world.
Find a bug and tell me time of death.<eos> No can do.<eos> Carrion-feeding insects have less access to bodies underground.<eos> But... there could be some evidence in the growth patterns of the tree that could tell us when she was buried here.<eos> You mean, when it might have been buried fertilized?
When I go too fast, he's gonna be afraid of dying and he's gonna hug me so tight.<eos> - Poor Trav. - I know, he's screwed.<eos> Hey, do you want me to teach you how to use that bad boy?<eos> Please.<eos> I've mostly been using it like a magazine. You know, hitting flies with it, using it to scratch my engine room.
They're fine.<eos> Can we go back to the part where you died?<eos> It was more of a near-death experience.<eos> Jor-El told me that a greater evil was coming.<eos> He sent me back to fight it.
So, tell it!<eos> Ask the woman.<eos> She saw it.<eos> I'm never gonna tell you.<eos> Then you're gonna have to say what was on it.
My parents loved silly names, like Eurus... or Mycroft... or Sherlock.<eos> Oh, look at him.<eos> Didn't it ever occur to you, not even once, that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister?<eos> He's making a funny face.<eos> I think I'll put a hole in it.
Let us toast to the future of the High Table, and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.<eos> Wick is here.<eos> You, and you with me.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> Within this exhibition, the interplay of light and the nature of self-images coalesce to provide an experience which will highlight the fragility of our perception of space and our place within it.
Like it did to that one kid back in '96.<eos> Now, she had to chew through her intestines<eos> - just to get free.<eos> - When I see the drain,<eos> I'm not gonna go try and sit on it.
And alive.<eos> But luckily.. There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get more..<eos> Hands on.<eos> I'm sitting there wondering this whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fact.<eos> No one is getting hands on it.
- When?<eos> It's already written.<eos> Did it last night.<eos> Needs a little flesh on the bone, but basically it's written.<eos> All right, what's it say?
Back to work.<eos> Well, to work on my case?<eos> 'Cause I'm officially giving you the night off.<eos> It's not about your case.<eos> But you're not gonna tell me about it because...
You put me in your little zine?<eos> Remember?<eos> "Best ass."<eos> That list was already going around.<eos> Everyone was talking about it.
And the pool table and all the pool cues and chalk.<eos> And I want it now or Sasha dies, and then all of you.<eos> Probably.<eos> C'mon, Rick.<eos> Just because I brought her in a casket doesn't mean she has to leave in it.
- She just, um...<eos> - Where's the book?<eos> Can we just take a moment here?<eos> You don't even know what it is you're asking for.<eos> Am I in it?
Ever since she moved into that castle, she hasn't spoken to us in the village.<eos> My wife's right.<eos> I'm ashamed to ask you this, but... being as she seems to like you, maybe you could ask her for us.<eos> Well, she only lent me the horse.<eos> She never let anyone else ride it.
I know.<eos> You sure you wanna buy it?<eos> You don't think I should?<eos> Well, I don't know, I mean, it's just an old boat.<eos> Hope it doesn't have termites.
And now you would start another... that no man can hope to finish?<eos> Then leave.<eos> But what's happening here is going to happen.<eos> This war is going to begin.<eos> This camp is going to fight it, with or without you.
- Oh, yeah. Never better.<eos> - Is that the victim's skull?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Angela just finished scanning it so she could do a facial reconstruction.<eos> What's all that schmutz that's on it?
I guess you don't have a lot of practice with that.<eos> Not really.<eos> People don't like the truth.<eos> The truth is slippery.<eos> Can't depend on it.
That boy's affected your naturally optimistic disposition, Miller.<eos> I am never in the mood for swaggery young shits.<eos> Let's get to Jim Atwood's, get the invite list.<eos> This is the list.<eos> It's got er... all Cath's added scribbles on it.
You go down that footpath and it leads to this road here which means...<eos> Got it!<eos> - Go on.<eos> - This field links to that road.<eos> It has a parking lay-by and a newly-installed traffic camera.
Watch your boys grow up.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I like my job.<eos> I'm good at it.
Calm down, soldier.<eos> Don't tell me to calm down.<eos> Okay? I-I'm telling you there was something in the mist.<eos> Do you not understand that?<eos> There was something in it.
He left him to die in an abandoned building on South Kimbark.<eos> Jealousy, money, or revenge?<eos> Danny was Muslim.<eos> Byron must have wiped the tire iron.<eos> There were no prints on it.
What are you drawing?<eos> Is it a sketch of me?<eos> I am making a well.<eos> Why?<eos> - So you can drown in it.
I don't know why they bother with the stuff. Never did anything for me.<eos> You've smoked pot? When?<eos> Up the desert.<eos> They called it kif out there.<eos> Some of the lads were silly with it.
More than that.<eos> I fought in Korea, thanks to National Service.<eos> My father never recovered from the things he saw in battle.<eos> He suffered terrible shellshock all of his life.<eos> Warfare's bad enough when you're in the middle of it. To have to keep replaying it in your mind...
When Abby said you wouldn't want to pursue the death penalty for Cyrus, it hit me that you are the friend this time.<eos> His guidance and support has meant a lot to you over the years.<eos> Wait.<eos> Abby said I didn't want the death penalty?<eos> She told David Rosen to take it off the table. President's orders.
Signed by Patrick Pierce?<eos> Do this for me, and it's yours.<eos> Hey. Hey, my name's Taylor.<eos> You... you guys got a camera out front, right?<eos> You know if it covers Bruno's?
I mean, I wanna get eyes and ears on you.<eos> Cool.<eos> What... what song do you think it should be?<eos> I think "all of me." I mean, that song's so beautiful.<eos> It's so passionate.
Really?<eos> You don't like it?<eos> N-no, I like it.<eos> I just...<eos> You think it's passionate?
He's gone.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> So because he's gone, that means nothing's gonna happen now, right?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> This whole thing's been really confusing for me, and whatever it was about, it's over. Really.
I'll check on you first thing in the morning.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Hey, did Deacon tell you about the song we're gonna write?<eos> The song?<eos> - I'll tell you about it later.
I'd only just managed to get out of debt.<eos> Me and Jim have a little put aside.<eos> Peggy, Peggy, please, don't be silly.<eos> You can stay in my basement.<eos> It's a bit damp, mind.
Nor thee, young Cap'n!<eos> Well, I shan't be joining any more.<eos> Never say that, son!<eos> See this little pouch?<eos> In it I carry the bones o' my hand.
- So anyway, I said to Louis, "i don't care "if most of the associates start in the bullpen. I'm not giving up my office."<eos> - That's great, Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay, and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.<eos> You're right.<eos> I called you over here to tell you that... I put my foot down with Mike.<eos> - You finally told him to pick a hairstyle and stick with it?
I'm lost right now.<eos> Now I think we're making a wrong move here.<eos> I have a publicity campaign designed strictly for this woman right here.<eos> You have a publicity campaign? Well, I mean, we're...<eos> The family's all here. We would love to hear about it. What is it?
It's got water, and a yellow sun, it's got everything we need to survive.<eos> My parents wouldn't find us there.<eos> We'd be together, we'd be safe.<eos> I think of this because I'm reading this play right now, Romeo and Juliet?<eos> Yeah, I've heard of it.
Fucking shit. Oh, yeah.<eos> Do your vitamins usually have an identification number on them?<eos> It's pharmaceutical-grade speed.<eos> The bottle says vitamins. Who am I to question?<eos> So if I just take a shit in a can and I label it "chili," you gonna eat that?
- More than I'd like.<eos> Enough to cover for him?<eos> He has nothing to do with this!<eos> Harlee, did you lift my shell casing?<eos> My fingerprints are on it.
We're bargaining with a life.<eos> That doesn't bother you?<eos> If someone's dying tonight, at least it's someone who's earned it.<eos> Might want to check that list.<eos> I think we're all on it.
You were right about that thing on Ganymede, ma'am.<eos> It was a weapons test.<eos> Me and my team and your marines too, we were caught in the middle.<eos> That test nearly triggered a system-wide war.<eos> The weapon's up for sale and Mars wants it. Badly.
Dark Rider of the Apocalypse.<eos> This is the creature we face.<eos> The Horseman cannot be reasoned with.<eos> He is a single-minded engine of destruction, and woe to all those who cross his path.<eos> Something tells me you're about to say we're gonna cross it anyway.
My chancellor needs to be at that meeting, roan.<eos> Your chancellor's lucky he still has his head.<eos> Besides, if anyone can convince mortal enemies to move in together, it's you.<eos> I'll call for the summit.<eos> All I can think about is there's a war going on and I'm not in it.
Hey, do you know what the Friedman Method is?<eos> The Friedman Method?<eos> Yeah, it's a way to interrogate a suspect... why?<eos> It's a case I'm on.<eos> How do I find out more about it?
Lara?<eos> There's something else, Crane.<eos> Another reason why you can't let this bastard win.<eos> It's this bond between us.<eos> I tried to forget it, but it's part of who I am.
God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?<eos> You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.<eos> Which, apparently, my book does not have.<eos> Nick, everyone loves it.<eos> Robby wrote fan fiction for it.
They were both held in especially high esteem by their peers.<eos> One thing was kind of strange.<eos> Findley's body was found 10 miles outside of town in an abandoned construction site, nowhere near any of his usual haunts.<eos> Lab results on the heroin syringe.<eos> George Findley's prints and DNA were found on it and nobody else's.
- They're not very healthy.<eos> - Fucking blood boy.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Uh, yeah. I was walking around your 'hood, and I thought I'd swing by, and we could talk about tech, you know, 'cause we both know so much about it.
Makes my hands feel like a puppy's ear.<eos> I wish John Elway was your dad, too.<eos> Aw, remember Rooster's macaroni painting from the fourth grade?<eos> When I was in the fourth grade, I helped my father dig a well.<eos> Then he left me in it and said, "Learn how to swim."
- I'm not a kid.<eos> - You said we'd be together.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> The contract is everything.<eos> We need total concentration for it.
Yes.<eos> Why didn't you just say that ten minutes ago?<eos> I thought I did.<eos> Alice, what can you tell us about Paul's job?<eos> He didn't talk about it much... or maybe I didn't ask.
That's ridiculous.<eos> Wallace asked me why you pushed me to take this case.<eos> I thought he was being paranoid.<eos> Whatever your agenda... it's been satisfied.<eos> CIU took the case, now the media knows about it.
I went to lunch with people from work, and I saw him outside.<eos> He was obsessed.<eos> When you moved out, did you take the gun?<eos> No.<eos> I had forgotten about it by then.
Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order.<eos> Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it.<eos> And... sorry about the suitcase.<eos> Yeah, well, you should be.<eos> Your socks were still in it.
The 45 foot Super Sport.<eos> Someone was using it illegally.<eos> Oh.<eos> She's a beauty. I'm guessin' there's more to the story than just some joyridin' to bring NCIS out here.<eos> Navy lieutenant was murdered on it.
But I wanted to talk to you about your dad.<eos> You know he didn't kill himself, right?<eos> That's what I was told.<eos> We know he had a memory card in his ssession when he died.<eos> There's incriminating footage of some powerful people on it.
And what else do you remember about him?<eos> How sure are we this is our guy?<eos> Mrs. Durning said that's who she saw when she left the house right before her husband's heart attack.<eos> She also remembered he was carrying a briefcase.<eos> Good bet it contained a hypodermic needle and whatever tools he needed to break into the Durning home.
I liked seeing this side of you;<eos> She should come out more often. I'll check her schedule.<eos> You were right.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, I was intrigued about this case because you were on it and I wasn't.
I can't find an excuse not to come.<eos> - Well, I'm glad you are.<eos> - Me too.<eos> One small problem.<eos> There's a closed guest list, and I'm not on it.
Lois, I already told you. I don't want to eat your garbage food.<eos> All right? Now can you go inside and get me some pop rocks?<eos> I'm making a paella.<eos> You know what? Enough of this nonsense.<eos> You love this truck so much, stay in it, 'cause I don't want you or your food in the house.
Together we have struggled, and together, we will rise.<eos> In 6 days, anyone who is not in this bunker will be dead.<eos> There is room for 1,200 people in here.<eos> We could share it equally.<eos> All I can think about is there's a war going on, and I'm not in it.
Interference?<eos> Gravitational forces are increasing.<eos> Getting stress warnings all along the hull.<eos> Sir, the gravity from Jupiter is too strong; we're going to lose the probe.<eos> It's gone.
What if the test was off?<eos> What if something's really wrong?<eos> Carol, you're fine.<eos> But you don't really know that for sure, do you?<eos> So the homeowner then opens the door, he sees the bag burning, he stomps on it, and his foot gets just covered in dog poop.
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.<eos> No, it is.<eos> Leonard pointed out to me that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here's some quality luggage.<eos> Thank you. The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...<eos> Perhaps you should fly inside it.
Not according to our database.<eos> The way this guy evaded us, it's clear to me he's had training, but since he's not in the system, that means he's been scrubbed from it; he's a ghost.<eos> We may have just caught a break.<eos> Crime lab just unlocked that burner phone bought with Khalid's credit card.<eos> It came up with these pictures on it.
I will find him.<eos> I must find him.<eos> High priestess:<eos> Aku, our lord and master, is one with the darkness.<eos> He was born from it.
High priestess:<eos> Aku, our lord and master, is one with the darkness.<eos> He was born from it.<eos> It fills him with infinite power.<eos> We, too, must become one with it.
I think it best you stay away from Franky altogether.<eos> Told me it wasn't your gun.<eos> Yeah, it isn't.<eos> It's Ferguson's.<eos> Then why is your DNA all over it?
I get it.<eos> So you didn't think someone as skilled as Razr would've fumbled the slug he was hiding.<eos> I was right to be suspicious.<eos> Mr. Rysher died from organophosphate poisoning.<eos> All indications are that the bullet was soaked in it.
But enough blather.<eos> What's in the case?<eos> Seriously, Waverly. Poker face.<eos> Sing, little birdy.<eos> If you don't even know what's in it, why steal it?
It must be someone who needed the list.<eos> Someone must've needed the blood like me.<eos> Or maybe even an organ.<eos> An organ?<eos> If the list has to do with Min-woo, the culprit must be on it too.
No problem, sir.<eos> Just a long day.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> It was him. 10 minutes late.<eos> So every time he's on the news or doing an interview, I've had to watch him embellish that battle and his role in it more and more.
- Yes!<eos> - No, wait a minute.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Dude, where'd you get this from?<eos> Well, I sleep in it most nights, but it's clean now, totally good.
Great.<eos> Bring him.<eos> -See, we already got a DJ.<eos> -Yep. So let me get this straight.<eos> Now we're having this great party and we're getting our bonuses at it.
The point is, you sent the testing team home before they could do their job, maybe give y'all some news y'all did wrong here.<eos> What would it've cost ya to run that test, 125 grand?<eos> You're a 180 billion dollar company and you cheat.<eos> That's why we're 186 billion dollar company, we worry about those bills.<eos> I worry about my rig, my crew lives on it.
Tanning complacent?<eos> For him, yes.<eos> I stay on the right side, you stay on the left.<eos> Oh God, I love this book.<eos> There are so many good stories in it. That it is essential to have read.
Only my hatred will be against them.<eos> Hatred that won't hurt anybody, except perhaps me myself.<eos> We disturb you, don't we?<eos> You do.<eos> I try not to worry about loneliness but to be happy with it, despite all the sadness and bitterness.
Having a goldfish won't bring my mom back.<eos> It did help me learn, though, that going on a date could make me feel more lonely than ever.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you're the one who needs a list.<eos> And it should have things on it like,
And then just a hundred more to reach two billion.<eos> And only 50 years to double again to four billion people in 1970.<eos> We're nearly at eight billion now.<eos> Bartlett gives the example of a beaker.<eos> With a single bacterium in it, one that divides and doubles every minute.
None of us were very interested in returning it,<eos> So here you have it.<eos> Shit, that's an infinity.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you have a cojonal of money in it. We can use it in stores.
We all know that she was upset about Alison and Elliot being together.<eos> Maybe Ali had to defend herself.<eos> I don't care why she did it, okay?<eos> I just, I wanna find a way to prove that she did it so that we can get Hanna back.<eos> Okay, well, if the person who murdered Charlotte was wearing the red jacket it'll have Charlotte's blood on it.
Yes.<eos> They must have known something.<eos> I assumed that the substance found in Barkov's blood is similar to phencyclidine in its operation.<eos> I also checked the blood sample of Stepanov, the mental hospital convoy.<eos> It also has traces of this substance.
Go. Go!<eos> I mean, at least hit me with some facts. Use my numbers against me. But perception?<eos> What the fuck do I do with that?<eos> You haven't told me the details about that deal.<eos> You didn't discuss it at the board meeting?
Well, scopes are clear, chief.<eos> No more patrols between here and Eros station.<eos> According to Fred's coordinates, the last known residence of Lionel Polanski is a charted Belt Asteroid Bravo Alpha 834024112.<eos> We got ourselves a rock.<eos> Hopefully one with some answers on it. Yep.
Who will take home the top prize?<eos> Local free spirit Dave Drisko or fierce new competitor Dennis Reynolds?<eos> The stakes are high because the loser today is walking off the mountain for 30 years.<eos> Do you realize how important this race is, Dennis?<eos> Well, yeah, 'cause he just said how important it is.
Now.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's more interesting and Romanian than the Ceausescu Palace.<eos> It's Europe's largest mall and no one has money to buy anything.
She's the victim.<eos> What, Naz isn't, too?<eos> If I was still his lawyer, I'd at least pretend I thought so.<eos> It's like having a nuclear arsenal.<eos> You don't want to use it, but if the other side knows you got it, they tend to come to the table sooner.
I should be out there doing my job.<eos> Your job is out there waiting for you, Detective.<eos> The question is, how badly do you want it?
What is that?<eos> Satellite debris from the first flare.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> We'd better get you to the clock tower.<eos> My grandmother's vision was of me under the clock tower, not hiding inside it.
I should have turned that down.<eos> NO, I-I like it.<eos> I... I was imagining Charlie dancing in her dress.<eos> Do you dance, Mr. Church?<eos> There are those who play music... and there are those who dance to it.
Do you have kids of your own?<eos> Because if you do, you'll understand why I flew all this way without an appointment.<eos> Is Dr. Nurko available?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, but he's got a nine-month waiting list.<eos> I know. We're on it.
- Only to back her up, not on my own.<eos> - She said you did great.<eos> I know you originally took the assignment in BRIC because you wanted to stay off the streets.<eos> - And because I like the work.<eos> - You're very good at it.
- Well, let's find her fast.<eos> - Will do.<eos> This spoils my experience of nature.<eos> - You hate nature.<eos> - Well, I would like it a lot more if there were fewer dead people in it.
I knew he'd bring trouble with him.<eos> Please don't say such things, Mrs. ebrahimi.<eos> I don't think you get it.<eos> That thing didn't crash here by accident.<eos> I think it brought something with it...
Here's O.J.'s house.<eos> Okay.<eos> Furhman made up his mind at Bundy that Simpson did it.<eos> Even though he had no idea if O.J. had an iron-clad alibi that would then ruin Furhman's career and land him in jail.<eos> Fuhrman takes the glove at Bundy, makes sure it has Goldman and Nicole's DNA on it, jumps in the car with the other detectives, heads to Rockingham with it, where he gets into the Bronco, somehow, getting all that evidence in it, including Simpson's blood.
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.<eos> Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.<eos> I do hope you accept, my friends.<eos> You will not receive a better offer.<eos> Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it.
You think so, monsieur?<eos> - Shall we go to that table over there?<eos> - No, no, I must say this.<eos> Yes, of course Napoleon's a great man!<eos> He stood above the revolution, he put an end to its abuses and kept all that was good about it!
I see you went to UNM Law.<eos> Are you from New Mexico?<eos> Not originally.<eos> I'm from the Midwest, just a tiny, little town barely on the map... you know, that Kansas-Nebraska border.<eos> You've never heard of it.
That's a good idea.<eos> We shouldn't die holding things in about ourselves.<eos> Go ahead, Dee.<eos> Mac owns a Cowboys jersey.<eos> I saw him wearing it in the back office. What? Uh...
I thought it'd be great to get back to work.<eos> But is this really how I want to spend the rest of my days?<eos> Chasing after monsters?<eos> We've been given another case, Mulder.<eos> It has a monster in it.
Yeah, you got me, Officer Bishop.<eos> You can have it.<eos> I also want you to have this Jesus wig.<eos> - You know, wigs aren't illegal.<eos> - I know. But I think it would look awesome on you. - So do I.
Like a gate.<eos> -But again, this is all--<eos> -Theoretical.<eos> But... but what if this gate already existed?<eos> Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.
It's a popular drug. It makes the user feel mellow and horny.<eos> Like, just... You know what "horny" means? You know...?<eos> Um...<eos> But this song don't make me feel like that.<eos> - Well, how...? How does it make you feel?
I would never let anyone hurt your beautiful record, Mylene.<eos> -You really liked it?<eos> -More than liked it.<eos> I need another copy so I can play it again and again and again.<eos> No, you need another copy so you scratch it all over.
Pardon us, Mr. green.<eos> More men coming down every day.<eos> We're gonna end this thing soon.<eos> "Cowards do not count in battle.<eos> They are there, but are not in it."
And Dad's favorite dinner-- pancakes and milkshakes.<eos> That's my favorite, too!<eos> You got it!<eos> Come on, Dad. You're gonna love the new couch.<eos> I'll sit on it, but don't ask me to love it.
-What this is?<eos> Are you curious?<eos> Who do you think it's for?<eos> Me.<eos> -What do you think it is?
You can stay at mine<eos> It's fine, I'll manage<eos> I've been looking into Guðni<eos> I found a company called Drengur.<eos> Heard of it?
I found a company called Drengur.<eos> Heard of it?<eos> - No<eos> - It belongs to Leifur<eos> Guðni has shares in it and Hrafn had a 5% share
Go out, win a race with a Jesus-loving homophobic homosexual or a racist billionaire.<eos> Then we can talk about a career in TV.<eos> - How's Zitzilla looking?<eos> - Angry.<eos> You been picking at it?
The cameras we have on our helmets...<eos> It would be nice if you gave back the one you stole.<eos> Did you steal a camera?<eos> This is a bold statement from Hals. He's a soldier, I'm a journalist.<eos> My job is to reveal the truth so that it can be discussed.
Jesus.<eos> Did you just... throw up in our fuckin' water?<eos> I need water.<eos> No drinking water right now.<eos> We're using it to wash up.
It's the first place our spirits go on their way to Reinga.<eos> Yeah, when my time comes, that's where I'll go too.<eos> Man, you guys got a lot of dead stuff round here.<eos> Saw a dead sheep the other day.<eos> Had maggots in it.
- Trying to do the right thing. - It's my briefcase.<eos> - Okay, okay, okay. - Thank you, Officer.<eos> Can you identify it?<eos> Can I... yes, it's a briefcase.<eos> What's in it?
No.<eos> A dollar barely used to be enough for the jukebox in here.<eos> I could get used to these prices.<eos> I know how they got to Justin and the armory so quickly.<eos> They have this huge database of information, and, more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to manipulate it.
- Fun. That Dolores Umbridge sure is a bitch.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> She wrote a book?<eos> - Yes, she did. - Am I in it?
There's a woman running a unit.<eos> I've seen her type before when I was deployed.<eos> Ex-CIA, if I had to guess.<eos> Tell Katie her intel needs to outweigh the damage that her husband is doing to us.<eos> They have this huge database of information and more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to manipulate it.
The man makes a good point, Peg.<eos> Why don't you whip up a new containment unit? We can capture some of the Zero Matter and safely study it in Stark Labs.<eos> That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard in my life.<eos> I'm only trying to help.<eos> Yourself get custody of the Zero Matter so you can make a profit on it.
They serve coffee.<eos> Really?<eos> It's a coffeehouse?<eos> Yes, it's a coffeehouse.<eos> Hmm. I told you I'd tell you all about it When we go shopping tomorrow, right?
It's an open and shut case.<eos> After looking at the wall in his house" "there is no room for any doubt.<eos> He's just pretending, we'll break him.<eos> The yellow wall?<eos> What is so unique about it?
All right, so tell me what happened with my catfight and the parka.<eos> I don't know.<eos> My girl was ready to go, and then Ruby just didn't take the bait.<eos> Or Jay told her not to.<eos> Look, this job is so important to me, and I just... I really want to be good at it, and basically be like you.
I guess we'll never find out, will we?<eos> - I like Darius... - Mm-hmm. And I intend to win.<eos> And if that doesn't make you happy, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.<eos> Yael, hey. So, there's a flag on the play.<eos> The costume assistant was steaming your blue dress, and she burned a hole in it.
- If...<eos> - If what?<eos> If you let me interview you for my podcast.<eos> You're the only one of the Lakewood Six<eos> - who hasn't been on it yet.
I should wake up every morning and feel like this, remembering every drop of blood I spilled.<eos> Do you still have the memory machine?<eos> You used it on that Strucker kid.<eos> - Daisy, stop.<eos> - Put me in it.
Everybody is wondering who Sister Mary is to you, what she's doing here.<eos> What else?<eos> Everybody is also wondering: is the Pope thinking about his first homily?<eos> I ask myself the same thing all the time.<eos> Of course I'm thinking about it.
I grew up in the shadow of that hill.<eos> So it's like a part of me.<eos> I mean, all of us.<eos> The Cherokee said it's evil.<eos> They called it "blood mountain" or some such thing, that it had dark powers.
Our school is getting trashed in every news outlet, every landing page in Indiana.<eos> It was a couple of gay boys off at a basketball party.<eos> Those e-mails... That's just deviant.<eos> This is more than just an embarrassment.<eos> This party was not sanctioned by the school, but it was advertised at the school.
One more word, I'll cut your fucking tongue out.<eos> I thought you people were supposed to be smart.<eos> In what universe you think I give a shit who runs this fucking company?<eos> I got a chop shop by Yankee Stadium.<eos> Use it to crush stolen cars.
What was that?<eos> Sounded like Yankee Stadium.<eos> Stolen cars?<eos> I got a chop shop by Yankee Stadium.<eos> Use it to crush stolen cars.
And this phone.<eos> You planted it, too.<eos> And that's important why?<eos> Because someone used it to call both Tamika and Emile right before they were murdered.<eos> A-and did you find my fingerprints on it?
The only way for me to stop is if I tell Coach, and then I'm ratting out on everyone and the guys on the team are gonna destroy me.<eos> Well, so I guess he's going back to Anchor Beach, huh?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> There's a waiting list.<eos> And he's not on it.
50/50 in my book.<eos> Problem is, you think it was the wrong call and then you overcompensated.<eos> Sir, we'd been tracking that vessel.<eos> At the time, it was our only lead.<eos> And then you chased it into shallow waters, leaving you out of position for the rescue, forcing me to fire on that boat when we still didn't know if our people were on it.
The crate is yours.<eos> I called the navy shipyard.<eos> Your office signed off on its delivery.<eos> Our office?<eos> What was in it?
Well, that was fucking art.<eos> This is really great, isn't it?<eos> Way better than my beige-on-beige-on-beige hotel room.<eos> I loved doing this when you boys were little.<eos> You mean the four nights a year when you and Mom would let us run the AC and we'd all sleep huddled around it?
What's gonna happen to the couch?<eos> The couch? It was the fanciest one in the store.<eos> He died on the fancy couch?<eos> Does that mean it's gonna be on sale?<eos> We don't have to tell anyone somebody died on it.
I just want to hold her one more time...<eos> Wow, you could be in a lifetime movie.<eos> Thanks. We gonna do this the easy way.<eos> You want the couch?<eos> Whoever sits on it the longest gets it.
Didn't take you for a stoner.<eos> No, this is state-sanctioned pain relief.<eos> So what's so important you have to discuss?<eos> Okay, we booked the coffin.<eos> Time to talk about the day people see you in it.
That is great news, babe!<eos> So I... Dude, you can stop playing now.<eos> We don't need background music.<eos> Sorry, man. I'll pack it up.<eos> So, uh... I think I might take the next six months and... and, like, really give this music thing a shot, like, focus on it.
- Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes! Yes!<eos> Previously on "Mistresses"...<eos> I think I might give this music thing a shot, like, focus on it.
Well, lucky them!<eos> If only all relations were that much fun.<eos> - I thought you hated bicycles? - Oh...<eos> I was so desperate to escape.<eos> I would've saddled up a goat and ridden it.
The note had been in that envelope!<eos> That's not what was in the envelope!<eos> Item reference MRC-1.<eos> Item reference MRC-1 is the envelope recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.<eos> And for the tape, Mr Arnott is quite correct -- it does bear his name.
It's easy for the prosecution to paint someone like Charles Mahoney as a greedy, money-hungry monster out to protect his fortune.<eos> It's a cliche that the prosecutor is counting on you to believe.<eos> But it's a story he's made up, a piece of bad fiction with no merit and not a single piece of physical evidence against my client, Charles.<eos> Here is the witness list.<eos> Is she on it?
She's dark, perhaps your height.<eos> She left this.<eos> Recognise it?<eos> There is a handkerchief.<eos> - It's embroidered with a swan. - Um...
The sick and the weak. You're just a burden, ain't you, left to rot or better yet, they give you the old black potion.<eos> What is the black potion?<eos> Poison.<eos> This old black potion it is folklore.<eos> You ask at any workhouse, you'll hear them talk of it.
I don't bite.<eos> I'm a RN at D.C. General.<eos> That's how I met your cousin.<eos> You got to start cleaning your wounds and doing hand exercises so your skin don't tighten.<eos> You don't want to lose use of it.
I'll tell you what I do remember of this burial.<eos> When I'm laying his tiny body in the ground, he's wearing a red jacket with a hood.<eos> It slipped off his shoulder.<eos> And as I pull it up, I see a name-tag. On the inside, there.<eos> It says "Mark Wells".
- Are we clear?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Yes, we're clear.<eos> A package is being delivered to your apartment.<eos> It contains an envelope.
Cry me a DNA sample.<eos> Works every time.<eos> When was the last time you spoke to Peter?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> He had locked his bag in his apartment and it had everything in it that he needed.
We need to speak privately.<eos> I pulled every item of magical importance from Ragnor's belongings.<eos> But I can't determine which will lead to the Book of the White.<eos> Wait, this bookmark. I've seen it before.<eos> In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it.
Previously on Shadowhunters...<eos> Jonathan Christopher. "JC." Jace.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> There's darkness in me.<eos> In the alternate dimension you showed me a book of spells, and this was in it.
Fetch me a warm coat, I wish to go out.<eos> I don't think you understand my predicament.<eos> I should, you find it necessary to remind me of it often enough.
How could they shoot themselves if guns are banned?<eos> If you owned the gun prior to 1971, you were allowed to keep them.<eos> Looks like an old Nambu pistol from World War II... Probably belonged to Daichan's father.<eos> So Yukio is most likely armed.<eos> I found Yukio's hit list, and there's two extra names on it...
Turns out, Mr. Matthews was pretty accommodating, given the right kind of motivation.<eos> He called the Midtown branch manager and told him a very special client needed access to his safety deposit box right away.<eos> In no time, I was opening the safety deposit box, and there it was...<eos> Huston's burn book.<eos> Now we just have to hope Tanner's in it.
Some of the others who maybe aren't so beautiful...<eos> It's human trafficking for the purpose of sexual slavery.<eos> That's why she's so happy to be watching TV.<eos> All right, now... how about you tell me what's bothering you.<eos> Well, there is a situation, but I can't really talk about it.
- I want to talk to them.<eos> - Aren't the police doing that?<eos> People clam up with them.<eos> They know me.<eos> This school - everyone in it - it's my responsibility.
Where's my truck?<eos> It's about a quarter mile from your cabin.<eos> The keys are still in it.<eos> What about my rifle?<eos> No. No sign of it.
This is the same woman that abandoned you.<eos> She did not abandon me.<eos> Uhh! I'm starting to think maybe mother was right about you.<eos> We know how the second and third victim are connected, But how does claire westchester fit into the puzzle?<eos> Well, let's go through it again.
Me, too.<eos> I'm...<eos> Hey...<eos> It's no...<eos> You just take that nutty energy of yours and put it to good use at the office, and we'll be waiting for you when you get home.
You learn to live in the dark, because you've got no choice.<eos> They should use the time they can see to get out of the cave.<eos> No, can't get out of the cave.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you're in it every time you close your eyes. That's why.
Yep.<eos> Luckily, you're with a pro.<eos> Now, here's what you're gonna want to do...<eos> Cry.<eos> But not into your pillow, 'cause you're gonna have to sleep on it later.
About us. All the true stories.<eos> It's called Back in the Day.<eos> It's coming out in the fall.<eos> You guys are gonna love it.<eos> Am I in it?
I worked another Sandy construction case in Brooklyn.<eos> And it never made it to the grand jury either.<eos> What happened?<eos> They told me the same thing that they told you.<eos> And I never heard about it again.
Five feet by two by one.<eos> Not ringing' any bells.<eos> I saw you receive it.<eos> Where's it at?<eos> What's in it?
Back during the first curse, I tore my story out of Henry's book so he wouldn't know I was the Evil Queen.<eos> Well, if Hades has done the same, we don't stand much chance of finding it.<eos> What do you think, Liam?<eos> You found the book.<eos> Was there any evidence it had been tampered with?
Yes, thanks to Gavin, Endframe, a middle-out compression platform, is objectively worth 250 million dollars.<eos> Wait, okay. We are a middle-out compression platform company.<eos> Are we worth 250 million dollars?<eos> There's no way the box makes us worth a fraction of that.<eos> Laurie couldn't vote for the platform because she couldn't assign a dollar value to it.
You read the whole thing?<eos> It's like a horror film.<eos> Bioterror weaponry, diseases that jump from animals to humans, accelerated climate change, demon robots who will take over the world.<eos> Well, a demon robot is welcome to take over my world as long as he cleans my bathroom and organizes my stuff.<eos> You know, I'm gonna get a 3-D printer, use it to make another 3-D printer, then return the first one.
And...?<eos> There's a social thing.<eos> This girl's getting bullied online.<eos> They suspended the kids who put up the Web site, but they're notifying the parents of everybody<eos> - who posted on it. - She didn't.
Hey, guys, I'd... I'd appreciate it if you didn't say anything to my mother about me getting attacked.<eos> I don't want her to get freaked out.<eos> Okay, but we're gonna need your shirt.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Some of the blood on it might not be yours.
While that might be true, we're trying to be nice.<eos> I'll just pick up some stuff from the party store.<eos> And, Axl, you're in charge of ordering the sub.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do we get on it?
I saw her face when she called home.<eos> Things are hard right now.<eos> You're still lucky.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know what it's like to do this job and not have anybody to talk to about it, except a series of handlers who don't give a shit.
Why would I waste it on that?<eos> I made this fine table covering.<eos> For fancy company.<eos> Well, with what you got left, you should make yourself a dress,<eos> I bet you'd look real pretty in it.
Is everything okay?<eos> You know, with us?<eos> You on that app too? What?<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing on it?
- It's show property.<eos> - Well, you know the saying...<eos> "Show property is yo' property."<eos> That's not a saying.<eos> Okay, I look good in it, so I stole it.
Do you remember what she was wearing?<eos> Some kind of uniform, but it wasn't from a hotel.<eos> It was different.<eos> She had a name tag.<eos> What did it say?
I'm sorry for erasing the message.<eos> Like I said, a day hasn't passed when I haven't...<eos> What did it say?<eos> - What?<eos> - The voice mail... what did it say?
- The voice mail... what did it say?<eos> What I told you before.<eos> I want to know... everything he said, word for word.<eos> Alicia, it's been six years, I'm not sure...<eos> And a day hasn't passed that you haven't thought about it, so... what did it say?
I would pay lots of money for the original video.<eos> Wait, wait, I'm serious. I really want to see Sadako.<eos> But - 2 days.<eos> If you ask why; well, I'm obsessed with that video. Please read the reason, everything is in this book.<eos> I wrote it.
Well, I didn't see him.<eos> Those were taken from far away.<eos> I didn't know I was being photographed. Okay.<eos> Explain the swing.<eos> Nolan used to sit on it with our parents.
- Sir?<eos> - George Lyon.<eos> Your new pal.<eos> He's the one with motive.<eos> He stands to lose his commission if a policy is canceled before the company can earn it back.
It just... doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. Well, she left her handbag at the scene.<eos> What kind of crim does that?<eos> It's got everything in it - phone, keys.
- The Foil is the stolen tablet,<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> The known offenders list...<eos> why was Mr. Howell on it?
Listen, big guy, I-I've been feeling bad about the whole boat thing.<eos> Oh, hey, look, don't worry about it, okay?<eos> I got carried away.<eos> It's over.<eos> I know, but I like the time we spent together on it.
It's not like we were hiding.<eos> What?<eos> That's how I know she wasn't here.<eos> I get an email every day with a list of all the visitors my patients see.<eos> - She wasn't on it.
One month after that...<eos> Aguirre gave you a job.<eos> You're fucking brushing me back.<eos> And let me tell you something, that story, it's out there.<eos> People want me to use that to win an election. I haven't touched it.
Don't worry.<eos> It wasn't either of them.<eos> This may be Idaho, but we're not that twisted.<eos> Well, don't dwell on the past, Kerry.<eos> Let's not even discuss it.
At my reading matter.<eos> I think he would approve of both.<eos> Trevithick makes bold claims for this engine.<eos> 50 fathoms - can it really drain so deep?<eos> I hope so. We've just sunk the last of our capital into it.
- Why should I?<eos> This gun was found amongst the dancers' costumes at the Star Room.<eos> No one's gonna say that's mine.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> - Your fingermarks are on it.
My treat.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's not impossible. Do not touch me.<eos> Wait a minute, are you trying to bribe us<eos> With illegal cosmetic procedures?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I just like it when people who have obviously Never considered plastic surgery think about it.
You know, she may have fallen, but I can't be sure until I...<eos> All: Until you perform the autopsy.<eos> Very funny, but true.<eos> What's with the white rose? Was she carrying that?<eos> No one I interviewed mentioned it.
Good.<eos> Because I got you a job in the kitchen.<eos> Thank you. Don't thank me.<eos> Thank yourself.<eos> If you hadn't come in to see me, I never would have told you about it.
Yeah, I know, but, like, what if they knew my uncle Felix had it?<eos> If they knew my uncle Felix had it, then they would know he gave it to me, and if they knew he gave it to me...<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Let them find the chest.<eos> If they know about it, they'll think we took the book someplace else.
I'm-I'm here for you. Thank you.<eos> I wouldn't even know how to begin.<eos> Baby steps, I guess.<eos> I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.<eos> I will always have the dent to remember it by.
Who's here?<eos> - The one who killed mom, the red-eyed wolf.<eos> What in God's name did you do?<eos> This is my list.<eos> You are on it.
I know the feeling.<eos> So you were the first responder at the Richard Locke crime scene.<eos> I was.<eos> Bad case.<eos> Did you think that Peter Florrick micromanaged it?
I'm a partner.<eos> If you were Spencer, what would you want in a care package?<eos> Like, don't think about it.<eos> Just, you get the package, you open it up.<eos> - What's in it?
At least long enough to finish the book.<eos> I was in such a rush to get it over with that I broke up with him before he told me that he was back on the book.<eos> I really complicated the situation.<eos> All due respect, things have been complicated for quite some time.<eos> This book means as much to Liam as it does to us and that's why he wants to work on it.
In reality, he gave up.<eos> Perhaps the operation would have helped, but ... he didn't want them to cut him open.<eos> And then, one night. He put a stop to it all.<eos> He sent me home, telling me he was tired, and then he went to the Upper Town and shot himself in the mouth.<eos> You probably know that bench, it was in the newspapers.
- - My contact lost him.<eos> He had the tape with him... - - Yes.<eos> What's he going to do with it?<eos> - - Extortion.<eos> He doesn't know what's in it.
I got the jewelry from the bedroom, but it's crap.<eos> It won't even cover the cost of gas.<eos> Yeah, who gives a shit?<eos> I got the briefcase.<eos> What's in it?
Even the wharfinger, Croker, who raised them, Dove slaughtered for his brother's sake.<eos> Wherever he is put, he will show himself again.<eos> You could have warned us about the bounty, Thatcher.<eos> Shine don't confide in me his stratagems, Captain.<eos> The first I heard of it was this.
- Sara... Look, I cannot let you go out there tomorrow, knowing that you could get killed.<eos> I have enough deaths on my conscience as it is.<eos> Look, I know you don't think I can add anything to this team, but out there?<eos> Out there is history.<eos> And nobody knows more about it than me.
It's a trap!<eos> Supergirl, do something!<eos> I didn't think about it, Oliver.<eos> I didn't think about the future.<eos> I was so focused on the past, I didn't think about it until now.
The cost is a life.<eos> His or hers.<eos> No.<eos> To hell with your power.<eos> I'm not here for it.
Oh. Ahh, I should've warned you about that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, just got to get rid of this dust, you know, get past that broken door, move some stuff around.<eos> I won that stupid monkey at Navy Pier, and I'll be damned if it wasn't every one of my kids' favorite toy.<eos> There's something about it.
Carol, Tandy, come look at this.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hey, what's going on out there?<eos> There's a boat!<eos> Is anybody on it?
Finally, sleeping beauty stirs.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You got dosed, buttercup.<eos> Welcome to your hallucination.<eos> - What are you doing in it?
I know that every bad guy we've ever had has pretended to be our best friend, while really being an evil, murderous bastard, but...<eos> I think if he's lying, he sure believes the hell out of his own lie.<eos> Okay, well what do we think about this box? It's creepy.<eos> Like, "Indiana Jones" melt your face creepy.<eos> Have you guys figured out anything about it yet?
How did she go from big bad wolf to little lost lamb?<eos> Well, maybe she's a wolf in sheep's clothing, but right now she needs to return to the flock.<eos> Yeah, I worked on that case. I work on every case that comes through here.<eos> Okay, but the Perez case was sensitive.<eos> You were the only one here besides Charlotte who knew about it.
I found this up in the attic last week.<eos> It's your mother's old diary.<eos> But before we get to that, let's get something else out of the way.<eos> Because I know you all saw the bag.<eos> You all know what's in it and you all know what it will do.
Right. Say, this, is the fabric of space-time.<eos> Now, if you get a powerful enough gravitational field, you could actually bend it back on itself, creating a kind of loop that would allow you to cross over to an earlier point.<eos> An... an earlier point in time, you mean?<eos> What he means is, Mr. Mason invented a time machine.<eos> And chose not to tell the government about it until it was stolen by terrorists.
I'm shutting down The Morgue.<eos> We can't give up, Noah.<eos> Why not?<eos> He wins every game.<eos> I told my mom you guys would go over and take down the murderboard and pack up everything that goes with it.
Okay, kids, if everyone's done washing their hands from the snakes, we have some fun music for y...<eos> No climbing on the boat!<eos> Okay, now please welcome Red Shirt Blue Shirt.<eos> All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt, and here's a song we call "Mommy and Daddy's Room."<eos> And we think it's one you can all relate to.
I didn't notice 'till this morning.<eos> The old keepsake box my mom gave me for graduation?<eos> It's gone.<eos> Why steal just that?<eos> - What else do you keep in it?
What are you talking about?<eos> The dress you had made to celebrate the 25th year of father's rule.<eos> I have a hard time believing you've forgotten.<eos> You loved that dress.<eos> The last time I saw you wearing it was the night I was sent away from the palace the night father died.
How?<eos> That federal census worker you found in my freezer... I killed him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can tell you exactly where to find the gun.<eos> It'll have my DNA on it, for sure.
[Sighs] What if Daisy was right and they're not dead?<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> I have a feeling... Can't explain.<eos> I know you're hurting, but Coulson was clear... Do not open that book.<eos> - He didn't know what was inside it.
- Yes, this is Dr. Redmond Layton from Hallorann pharmaceuticals.<eos> I need you to send someone to our research facility.<eos> It seems as if we've lost contact with them.<eos> Yes I'm well aware of the storm.<eos> In fact I'm stuck in it right now which is why I've called you.
It's as credible as the theory that Freddie Pink is the killer.<eos> Although both theories raise many questions.<eos> Such as?<eos> If Freddie is not the killer, then why did she not think of this theory before now?<eos> And if she did think of it before now, why not bring it to me earlier?
Or the poison is in the lip rouge.<eos> These men would've effectively been killed with a kiss.<eos> - Is that possible?<eos> - I don't know, but I'm going to start by analysing this rouge.<eos> If there's cyanide in it, we'll have our murder weapon.
So what do we do?<eos> We learn their habits, lexicon, everything about them.<eos> And then we connect with them, with the help of our mirror jurors.<eos> One juror at a time.<eos> It is tragic that the lone survivor of this crash is the only one here to speak of it.
R-Right.<eos> Right, right. Well,<eos> I like this music.<eos> I've been listening to it all afternoon.<eos> I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary about it.
No wonder you're as equipped in spirit to fight as well as you do.<eos> War is in your blood.<eos> I study the art of war, work to perfect it.<eos> But you...<eos> You were forged by it.
Let's just go with running.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> That bomb couldn't have been Bruno's.<eos> He wouldn't do something like that.<eos> His fingerprints were all over it.
I don't care how many stars he gives Oxfam Whitby, I'm not going there.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I went on Trip Advisor, OK, and there was a review of Whitby.<eos> And it said, and I'm quoting here,
But we have to give the press another story, because the real truth is...<eos> Erased by his secretary. Lost forever.<eos> It's one of the great mysteries.<eos> There's a concern that Flynn has gone back to 1972 in order to steal that tape before it gets erased.<eos> What do we think's on it?
There's a list. Guess where I am.<eos> That's it?<eos> I have a patient with a possible spinal fracture.<eos> You paged me "911" to look at a list?<eos> At least you're on it.
Wound-vac, please.<eos> She still taught music classes every day, yelled at us about our homework, fixed us dinner.<eos> We grew up listing to that damn cello all day, every day.<eos> [Cello plays]<eos> She played it for hours...
High in the government of our most important oil provider, arms customer, and ally in the Gulf.<eos> Technically, Amjad is not a member of the government, but the minister does not make a move without him.<eos> Apart from his nationality, which makes Majeed Amjad untouchable, the fact that his cousin is the foreign minister makes him uranium.<eos> How solid it this information?<eos> You could chip a tooth on it.
Oh, my.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> You look stunning in that dress.<eos> It's what I wore when you and I danced at that art fund-raiser two years ago.<eos> I never forgot how you looked in it.
Please don't.<eos> Please don't hurt him.<eos> All right. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and say that none of that actually happened.<eos> I will have you know that my old man got the story directly from the desk sergeant who was working that night.<eos> And it was in the papers the next day, so...
Please don't hurt him.<eos> All right. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and say that none of that actually happened.<eos> I will have you know that my old man got the story directly from the desk sergeant who was working that night.<eos> And it was in the papers the next day, so...<eos> It was in the papers in 1940.
- I chose to stay.<eos> - I'm just worried because... sometimes I have a hard time... choosing between my personal life and my work, and I always choose work.<eos> Well, who said it needs to be a choice?<eos> Look, I love that you love your job.<eos> You should. You're amazing at it.
He brought me here.<eos> I was cold.<eos> He gave me his jacket.<eos> Mr. Fleck ordered a hot chocolate.<eos> He said it would make me feel better, and it did.
I-I just found a wobble.<eos> Oh, do I need a mop?<eos> It's a gravitational wobble.<eos> It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.<eos> Oh... well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?
I'm sorry, this doesn't feel right.<eos> You're not even really police.<eos> True, but I'm not asking as a police consultant.<eos> I'm asking because I am Dr. Joan Watson.<eos> Which means I either wrote the prescription, in which case I know everything that's on it, or I didn't write it, in which case the DEA could decide to penalize you for filling it.
I saw the plane hit the building.<eos> It changed everything.<eos> [George W. Bush] From this day forward... any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.<eos> The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it where it grows.<eos> Our war on terror... - begins with al-Qaeda... - [speaking indistinctly] but it does not end there.
I'm so anxious to tell him about all of our adventures.<eos> Thank you, Master Jim.<eos> Today was a day I will never forget.<eos> But if I am to be honest, I have to wonder how many days this will last.<eos> And this skin... I am still uncomfortable in it.
What the fuck did you all get from that that you're high-fiving and shit?<eos> Cube.<eos> Man, if Lonzo think it ain't gonna be shit, we know we got a motherfucking hit!<eos> - Exactly. - For real. 'Cause he don't know shit about music.<eos> He don't know good music when he hears it.
Mend it?<eos> No, no. I'll turn it into something new.<eos> Oh, no, please don't.<eos> This was my mother's.<eos> And I'd like to wear it when I go to the palace.
Look!<eos> Help me.<eos> I could not face a child bleeding to death in my lap. I only...<eos> I only construct death in the cinema.<eos> I don't make it, cause it.
It's changed you.<eos> You're not the same girl.<eos> You're... you're not our Jan.<eos> Your sister was doing your washing the other day. She came across a T-shirt.<eos> You know what it said?
Which is why I won't condone a mass suicide.<eos> If we don't take District 2, we won't get into The Capitol.<eos> Would it be enough to disable the fortress... instead of taking it?<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> You think of it like a wolf den.
I did leave a note.<eos> But anyway we tore it apart when I, uh... when I got out of the hospital.<eos> You and Marianne?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did it say?
One of the best jazz improvisationalists.<eos> - So it's trumpet or nothing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So maybe I should kill myself too, because I don't look like Vivien Leigh.<eos> You should find one thing and be better at it.
It's an earthy Bordeaux, and it pairs wonderfully with I'm going to rape you.<eos> Look, over there!<eos> It appears the better man has won!<eos> -Don't worry, you'll still get a chance to be with her.<eos> -I will? I'm going to go to walgreens and buy a shitty devil mask and fuck her silly while I wear it.
You know, I think that your hands were the first thing I loved about you.<eos> I'm gonna miss them.<eos> I think, at first, I held on so tight to the kids, because of all that we went through and how much I loved them.<eos> But now... I think I'm holding on because... I don't know who I am, if I don't.<eos> My love for them... it's so huge. I kinda got lost in it, you know?
If you're talking about magazines, I agree with you... they're trash.<eos> - No, I'm writing a book.<eos> - He's writing a book.<eos> Traitor.<eos> Look, and everybody that matters is going to be in it, okay?
What is it? Is it a whole album?<eos> Is it any good?<eos> I mean, there's a song.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's, like, one song. At least one, or part of one, but she definitely knew nothing about it.
What did you think of the song?<eos> Um, I don't... what are you talking about?<eos> You forgot to rewind.<eos> It's all right.<eos> What did you think of it?
Welcome home.<eos> - To Randy and Maria.<eos> We did our best... and that's what matters.<eos> We did everything we could.<eos> The past is the past, and now we must let it go.
Some of us.<eos> Others look different.<eos> BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.<eos> He has to get back to your base.<eos> Apparently, he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker... and everyone's after it.
And two pregnant females who are blind cripples.<eos> Alright.<eos> Do you still have that whisky flask?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's got tincture in it.
We just smoked a cigarette together and talked about it... and decided to keep going.<eos> After seven days of climbing, we were just getting to the hard part.<eos> The wall got super steep and overhanging.<eos> This is pitch 20.<eos> Jimmy's getting after it.
Four weeks ago.<eos> I'll ask again next time we're in town.<eos> Dad, my SAT's are on Thursday!<eos> I need to study.<eos> Ah, there is an ancient technology, you may have heard of it.
The history of man is defined by war.<eos> And war by the men who fight it.
Scholarship?<eos> Pretty fancy.<eos> I kind of knew that tips from my dad's diner weren't really going to cut it.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I love art. I love... everything about it.
Pretty fancy.<eos> I kind of knew that tips from my dad's diner weren't really going to cut it.<eos> You know, I just...<eos> I love art. I love... everything about it.<eos> I love studying it. I love the culture that it brings and the whole human experience... just all wrapped up into one, you know.
I want 100% commitment and laser focus, right?<eos> Great, I will see you Monday.<eos> Beca out.<eos> Hey, Ladies, wanna come to a party?<eos> It's a tootsie party, you guys don't even have to wear shoes.
Man, that sounds awesome right now, what are you talking about?<eos> Naw, It's not... it's not you, it's a tech thing.<eos> So, just go ahead and take five.<eos> It better be a tech thing. 'cause... the way I sound in my ear drums...<eos> This song, there's nothing... nothing special about it yet, you know what I mean?
- Any ideas, because...<eos> - Hear me out ...<eos> - We can remove the sleigh bells and put in kalimba.<eos> Ya know, the finger thing.<eos> I know what the kalimba does, I know how it's operated, okay?
John.<eos> Sorry, I wasn't expecting... anyone.<eos> There is a problem.<eos> With your urine specimen.<eos> It has tested positive for testosterone.
Mother, ask, and I'll tell you how to make it.<eos> My dear, we are not going to ask you anything.<eos> You are very smart and very pretty.<eos> Mother, where is the rope?<eos> Everyone's expecting me to get on it.
Don't underestimate me.<eos> I already am.<eos> Game on.<eos> I'm a long-time customer of that dry cleaner and that was a Gucci blouse.<eos> I would know if there was a stain on it before I brought it in.
Go ahead. Thanks.<eos> It goes right there. Yeah, I know.<eos> That's, um--<eos> Actually, can I-- Can I use your bathroom for a second?<eos> I believe it's unoccupied.
David thought books existed to stop you from feeling lonely.<eos> If I could, I'd say to David that living those days with him... reminded me of what life is like, instead of being a relief from it.<eos> And I'd tell him it made me feel much less alone."<eos> I need to use your bathroom for a second.<eos> I believe it's unoccupied.
I sent him a text message that was meant for you.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> I know ifs stupid.<eos> What did it say?
He's back in already?<eos> Yep, he came in about an hour ago while you were in with knife guy.<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> He tore open the foot.<eos> Some kind of work accident, although, how he was even standing on it, I have no idea.
- What's that?<eos> My life story.<eos> - You're writing your life story?<eos> - You bet I am.<eos> Am I in it?
Look at this!<eos> Holy cow.<eos> "You are cordially invited to join me at my vineyard in Napa."<eos> "A place that is near and dear to my heart."<eos> "This vineyard is my vision for the future, and I want to envision my future wife in it."
So he can be served a woman's tongue as an appetizer.<eos> You think I'm gonna get another date after that?<eos> And you saw nothing?<eos> The police asked me all this.<eos> The point of the restaurant is that it's dark, as in pitch black.
On the train.<eos> Now, isn't that odd?<eos> Did you really?<eos> She left her book in the carriage.<eos> And in it, this.
Cappuccino flying in.<eos> We'll just keep on practicing.<eos> Mrs. Raymond, it's a pleasure, always, to see you.<eos> I was wondering if you listened to my demo yet.<eos> I was just thinking about it.
I-It's an awful lot to take in. I think we'll need some time.<eos> We'd want to bring Mrs Mills in quickly.<eos> Am I dying, sir?<eos> ~ Without surgery, yes.<eos> A-And with it, am I still dying?
E-exactly.<eos> I feel it's always good to keep a finger on the suburban pulse.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> Anyway, as it turns out, they loved it.<eos> They raved about it on Goodreads, and then other suburban book clubs started to read it, and now there's actually a campaign to get us to publish it.
Oh, I see you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm getting jiggy with it.<eos> I'm gonna get that Philip Roth book back to you.<eos> I haven't forgotten about it.
That's it. I'm throwing the debate.<eos> You win, pretend opponent.<eos> Wait a second, Kent had a list who Jonah and Richard were seeing and you had a list who Dan and Amy were seeing?<eos> Did you not think to compare the lists?<eos> I have another list and you're right at the top of it, Gary, so don't you dare try to question my fucking methods.
Look, who knows anything, all right?<eos> All I'm saying is, they did some kind of voodoo spell on Vee, and, boom, bitch was gone.<eos> Vee is fine.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Yo, okay. I cannot go through this again.<eos> Suzanne... you throw that tray, or anything on it, we dog-pilin' on you till you're flat.
Public school.<eos> Which, more accurately, is what you Americans call private school.<eos> But you didn't go to public school.<eos> No.<eos> But I read about it.
What are you up to these days?<eos> Are you still over in London?<eos> Yeah, yeah - I'm an entrepreneur now.<eos> It's a French word.<eos> I own my own business, you've probably heard of it, actually -
How do you write 'skating rink'?<eos> Two t's or two n's?<eos> His two-bit philosophical phrase stuck in my head.<eos> Often, in the morning, when I look in the mirror...<eos> I can't help thinking of it.
I know all about you and your track record on this Lobos case.<eos> Corners cut, a botched raid.<eos> First a dead primera and now a dead CI who you jerry-rigged into the WITSEC program in the first place.<eos> Nomar Arcielo should still be alive and we both know it.<eos> You're not only no longer leading the Lobos task force, you're not on it at all.
Right over here.<eos> How'd you know those were there?<eos> Come on.<eos> The fight's over.<eos> You've got to let it go.
The fight's over.<eos> You've got to let it go.<eos> I know it's hard. After it's kept you... warm and fed and... alive.<eos> But the fight... it turns on you.<eos> You've got to let it go.
But, you of all people know that we have to move carefully.<eos> The other board members have neither the progressive mind nor the courage to... make the sort of change that you and I want.<eos> The world may not be moving fast enough for us but its likely moving much to quickly for them.<eos> These are not the kind of men who like to make history.<eos> They'd rather tout there ancestors place in it.
Jill and Sophia are always insisting on something chocolate.<eos> No, chocolate's too obvious.<eos> - [laughs] Cheers to that.<eos> So... have you ever seen the "Ashes and Snow" exhibit?<eos> - No, I've never heard of it. - Oh!
You guys want to have lunch? - You got Frank's card?<eos> - I got the card.<eos> - I'm annoyed, but I could eat.<eos> - All right, let's go. - Yeah, to be honest with you, my taste for fish is returning.<eos> - Yeah, I've been thinking about it all day.
No, you saw me reading about the play.<eos> Well, no, how do you appreciate a thing and google it at the same time?<eos> That's no way to live a life.<eos> That's an insult to the actors to do that.<eos> Because it was a great play and I wanted to know more about it while I was watching it.
She sent it back all torn up into pieces.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> I just keep tryin' to fix it and then I keep tryin' to fix all those years, you know?<eos> It's just every time I've looked in my future, you've always been in it.
Thanks.<eos> #willcolorall mydreams #andlightthe dawn# my mom loved that song.<eos> Maybe even more than the movie.<eos> Well, that's what Charlie was singing, and he was playing the guitar.<eos> And when he was done, he looked at me and said if I really wanted to, I could just pick it up and play it. Even if I didn't know how.
Oh, God, this story is not helping at all, is it? No.<eos> Thanks.<eos> don't waste my time.<eos> -Tell me now. -Tell you what?<eos> Tell me if there's something in it.
- Was it a happy home?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> I thought you brought me here because we were gonna cut through the bullshit.<eos> This book is supposed to be about America Works.<eos> There is no book without you at the center of it.
And higher and plastered in dreams.<eos> You're going to get that part.<eos> And you're going back to New York.<eos> And you're taking that wall with you.<eos> If I'm real lucky, then I'll always be on it somewhere, wearing incredibly tight, sparkly gold shorts.
- I need a favor.<eos> Somewhere to interview these two for a couple of hours.<eos> It's for a book I'm writing.<eos> - Life after the war.<eos> - Will I be in it?
Well, a deal's a deal.<eos> Password's inside.<eos> You didn't have to blackmail me.<eos> I trust your judgment.<eos> In fact, I pretty much depend on it.
Previously, on "Arrow"...<eos> When I'm with you, I don't think about the mission, or... I trust your judgment.<eos> In fact, I depend on it.
And what about this city?<eos> The work you and Oliver do, it's good work.<eos> Not like what I've been doing for far too long.<eos> Which is why... I resigned.<eos> Lyla! No, you love your job, and you're damn good at it.
That wasn't me.<eos> Okay, the day... that Sarah died was was the first time<eos> I'd been back to Thrill Country since I'd been fired.<eos> I want to talk about the ride for a minute.<eos> You weren't on it when it crashed. You were on the platform.
It is the most advanced chemical analyzer in the world.<eos> Ultrahigh resolution.<eos> - Recombinant glycoprotein characterizations.<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> Remember when you girls got that new D.N.A. splicer and you talked about it for weeks?
I can't be with you if you're heading for trouble.<eos> No, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> Our contact tells us Lowry's next shipment is headed here in the next 48 hours.<eos> Know where they're touching down?<eos> No, but we're fairly certain Quintana will lay hands on it.
No.<eos> The ... the music was so loud.<eos> Can you think of anything that might help us?<eos> There was a note.<eos> - What did it say?
Linda told us.<eos> Did you meet Nina?<eos> She's in charge of incriminating evidence.<eos> There was a note.<eos> What did it say?
What's that?<eos> It's a gathering of the most powerful<eos> Consilium hasn't been called in over 1,200 years.<eos> In Trick's lair, in the fireplace, there's a censer.<eos> I want you to burn these in it.
Her room is right there, but...<eos> Mr. Lawrence, how could my daughter's room...<eos> The entity uses children, sir.<eos> That doll was in your car yesterday afternoon.<eos> If... if... if there's a tracking device inside it...
This is so cute. (chuckles)<eos> (grunts) You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My leg went to sleep.<eos> Oh. It's 'cause you've been standing on it all day.
Hell, I think you'll remember it.<eos> You know you like that.<eos> Uh-uh. You didn't know your mama could move like that, did you?<eos> (giggles) Ma, no offense, but this song is... is really old school.<eos> I know it is, but there's something there.
Like the one I use to talk to you.<eos> It was buzzing. Did someone leave a message?<eos> Um...<eos> No, a text.<eos> What's it say?
And then you tell me what you think.<eos> Mm, that's too easy.<eos> Get me drunk, and I'll buy anything.<eos> I prefer to be drawn in. Seduced, if you will.<eos> Describe how it tastes, how it makes you feel.
Constable Crabtree found this syringe in your bag,<eos> - in your room.<eos> - That's not possible.<eos> We believe this to be the syringe that killed Mr. Henderson.<eos> It has traces of morphine in it.
He's back in already?<eos> Yep, he came in about an hour ago while you were in with knife guy.<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> He tore open the foot.<eos> Some kind of work accident, although, how he was even standing on it, I have no idea.
- You didn't draw a freak.<eos> You drew a man with a freak on his back.<eos> There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> I know there's nothing wrong with me.<eos> In making friends, I try to be wary of people who foster dependency and feed on it.
I couldn't figure out the cause.<eos> Okay, what about the psychotic behavior?<eos> Comes and goes.<eos> Two minutes ago, he was a Navy S.E.A.L.<eos> But it's weird 'cause he keeps telling the same rodeo story, but it's got different people in it each time.
Now, the board won't allocate any more promotion money because of the IPO.<eos> What is this mysterious board I keep hearing about every time we're talking about lots of money?<eos> It's a private board.<eos> Some of our trusted advisors, that kind of thing.<eos> - Is Lucious on it?
Give over, Loll.<eos> Doth, pass us Jack's old jumper. Oi, that's mine!<eos> It's more holes than jumper anyway.<eos> Marge, he's here again.<eos> I knew all about war. My ears from birth had been full of the talk of it.
You're wrong. That guard, he was 20 feet away from me!<eos> Not one shot got close. Luck!<eos> He looked re... real nervous.<eos> It's the hood! It's good luck, I'm telling ya!<eos> I feel like a totally different person with it on.
Not the way he does it, from what I hear.<eos> So it's personal, this attack?<eos> It's all the same with Howard, as long as he's amused and making money.<eos> He attempted to purchase that refinery as recently as January, but I refused.<eos> Now it's a smoking crater... Not to mention a federal crime scene.
Well, I'm sorry.<eos> You asked me to be honest.<eos> You said it was important.<eos> Ye... no. Yeah, yeah.<eos> It is, but what did you not like about it exactly?
No. We're not.<eos> Look, I am so, so sorry that I left you like that.<eos> I'm... I'm not that kind of guy.<eos> Well, let me tell you what kind of girl I am.<eos> I work in a hard business, and I work hard in it.
Why is that?<eos> The same reason you keep running after guys like me.<eos> The adrenaline.<eos> The thrill of the chase.<eos> I love this game. And I'm very good at it.
Meg called.<eos> Danny showed up at her house.<eos> - Is he still there?<eos> - No, he left.<eos> I just found Dad's pickup, and he ain't in it.
I am so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I'm just gonna run to my locker and hide in it.
D.B., Shaw took the bullet for me.<eos> I'm sorry, Jules.<eos> Were you able to confirm that... that Winthrop was the shooter?<eos> Uh, Nick, uh, just processed the gun.<eos> His prints are on it.
Please.<eos> You need to get out of here.<eos> Stay off main roads.<eos> Do not try to leave the country.<eos> Find a hole and disappear into it.
- Trish Talk?<eos> The highest rated talk show in the city?<eos> How about...<eos> There's a list.<eos> You're not on it.
A little while back... Mr. Connaughton had me look through his safe for a business card.<eos> When I was in the safe, I saw a bunch of papers with the name of the business you asked him about on them.<eos> Purgatorium, Incorporated.<eos> I found the business card.<eos> It-it didn't have any names on it, just a phone number.
And what if we refuse?<eos> Then, we'll see no option but to drag it through the courts.<eos> It's a long and tedious process... but you and your family will be served an eviction notice.<eos> And you'll be forced to vacate the property within the next 48 hours.<eos> This land and all your assets on it will be sold at auction to the highest bidder.
Rosemary's got... two lovely matching cots for these new twins.<eos> On the never-never, probably!<eos> But, aw, they do look smart.<eos> I'm glad now I never offered her Lorna's cradle.<eos> I'd have liked it to have had a new home. A little life inside.
I don't need his validation anymore.<eos> I'm gonna write a book.<eos> I dropped the dress off at Goodwill this morning.<eos> And they took it?<eos> Well, I suppose it'll win someone the uh... tackiest Halloween costume contest prize.
I mean, I haven't done anything, Richard...<eos> I mean, less than nothing.<eos> Well, yeah. But look at me now.<eos> We're sitting on my boat, Richard, and that's because of you.<eos> Soon we can sail it to fucking Hawaii or Sausalito.
Although it's been so busy around here lately, I'm sure no one would notice.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> He's good.<eos> Can I get my money? Once the paperwork's done, you'll be out of here.<eos> At the convent, Sister Pat had a pickup truck, but it never did anything like this.
No!<eos> I can't! You might be able to eat it just once, But I'm not strong enough in moral character.<eos> Just-- you know that scene in Aladdin, Where aladdin gives the orphan kid some bread?<eos> He shares his bread with him?<eos> Well, that scene makes me furious, reflecting back on it!
And they make things we buy.<eos> Like, we directly fund it all the time.<eos> -Yeah, I know.<eos> -Do you care? -Yeah! I buy fair trade chocolate.<eos> I like that it tastes less like poor people's tears.
No, I-I-I didn't.<eos> But I'm sure he must have a way to remove it.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> This book.<eos> It's got all your stories in it.
Hey, what's wrong?<eos> This book.<eos> It's got all your stories in it.<eos> It started all this.<eos> And my mom... lots of bad things happen to her in it.
You said that you wanted to be sure it had nothing to do with personal relationships.<eos> So there wouldn't be anything or anyone that Alison might think was her.<eos> Well, I was joking.<eos> Kind of. No, I started off writing a war story, and well, it still is that, essentially.<eos> Can you tell me a little bit about it?
First, you lose Chopper, now Hera.<eos> What's in here?<eos> Sophisticated mining equipment.<eos> Sounds like your sophisticated mining equipment is snoring.<eos> Just don't open the box. And whatever you do, keep it calm.
Not your purse, is it?<eos> It's not even Arthur Radcliffe's.<eos> It's Ana's.<eos> You were after the USB drive the whole time.<eos> Why? What's on it?
To the bathroom.<eos> Can I have the chicken wings without the bones.<eos> No, I'll have the chicken cheeseburger without cheese.<eos> What exactly don't you like about this sandwich?<eos> There is chicken on it.
That's gonna be... you know, a fascinating transition.<eos> I am so glad you're here, Kimmy.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I can't wait to send the Reverend down the river.<eos> We paved the river. You're standing on it.
Oh, I got to get to the bus station, sorry.<eos> I got a car in the divorce.<eos> Maybe a road trip is exactly what I need right now.<eos> I'm turning over a new leaf.<eos> Uh-oh, last time I did that, I found a finger under it.
I mean, what did Vera do with all this trash?<eos> It used to just disappear.<eos> Did she eat it?<eos> I've been in this dress for two days. [laughs heartily] 'Cause there's no one here to unzip it.<eos> I took a shower in it, and now it's rusted shut.
I want this on record that I warned you.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - Where's the camera?<eos> - Best if you don't know.<eos> If you mess with it, they might notice.
And, look, I'm sure you don't want to spend the rest of your life chasing after my idiot brother, right?<eos> I mean, you must have bigger plans than that.<eos> Do you know my dad wrote a book?<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> You're in it.
"Abc news" has repeatedly requested interviews with Mr. Hubbard.<eos> We have been told that he is unavailable.<eos> It was very exciting.<eos> It was that heady mix of emotion and belief, and it's...<eos> You get stuck to it.
Okay, great.<eos> And who are we?<eos> I don't know, you're just two sluts with me.<eos> Hey, there's a lifeboat.<eos> Uh, yeah, but it's got one of those funny Southwest lifeboat attendants.
The question is why?<eos> I take it you can't locate the Grimoire.<eos> No, but I sensed something else.<eos> It's not whole.<eos> John Dee bound the book with a spell so that no one could access any part of it unless the book was whole, to make sure the magic within it could not spread widely.
Well, someone had to die at the savior's hands.<eos> Did they?<eos> We won't have what we need to rewrite the book, to secure our happy endings, until Ms. Swan has completed her journey.<eos> The savior has taken the first step down a dark path.<eos> And we have to make sure she stays on it... for both our sakes.
Who?<eos> The man who gave him his power...<eos> The Apprentice.<eos> I met him once when I was living in Phuket.<eos> He was the one who told me about the story book and that I should learn everything about it.
Guard: What the devil did you sail in?<eos> Well, the inventor, he called it an Infernal.<eos> And by God, was he right.<eos> I sent a man for rope.<eos> Perhaps we'll hang you with it.
His name's Townsend.<eos> He owns a boardinghouse in the Bowery.<eos> I left my bag there before I was arrested.<eos> - All right, slow down.<eos> - Hidden in the bottom of it is a vial of invisible ink.
- Come on, Mar.<eos> You don't believe anything good could come from something that evil, do you?<eos> But I do now.<eos> Look, it's this book.<eos> The sign of the angel is in it.
I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.<eos> - It was raining, but...<eos> - There was a nice old lady.<eos> - And she gave me her umbrella.<eos> - It had a hole in it.
Mr. and Mrs. R. Doinit?<eos> Um, I like to go by my maiden name-- Gettin' Some.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> I just walked across the floor without stepping on a Lego.<eos> Look, there's chocolate on the pillows, and it's not even in the shape of a handprint.
Welcome home, Daddy.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> - I think I'm home.<eos> - There's the kitchen.<eos> Did you put milk in it?
Back off!<eos> Back up! Back up!<eos> Give me your gun! Tell you what I'll do.<eos> I'll put this right on the floor.<eos> I'll lay on top of it, arms and hands where you can see them so I can't grab it or do nothing.
That's a question between him and his maker.<eos> Perhaps we should follow our own advice and let him go.<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> The machine's got to know the truth.<eos> It may, and the truth will likely remain with it.
Don't leave me.<eos> Listen, you've got your plate full today, and this whole Sharon having a baby thing is honestly beneath you.<eos> But I know a lot about childbirth.<eos> My ex-boyfriend, Frederick was an OB/GYN and we would often talk about his work.<eos> Before he started talking about it with... Dave.
Sandals.<eos> That party island that's in all the TV commercials.<eos> I'd buy that, and then work there as a security guard.<eos> Wait.<eos> You'd buy an island and then work on it?
Thank you.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> - unless there's anything else...<eos> - Oh, stop it.<eos> Clearly, you know what this thing is, and you're not surprised I'm inside it.
Trust me, it's fire you.<eos> But if you want to save your job, how about putting this red-headed cutie on your show?<eos> I know trying to pay your rent with a baby in a wig seems like a good idea, but maybe you should get a real job. (Laughs)<eos> I have a real job.<eos> I'm just not doing real good at it.
Try selling off your game items.<eos> Wouldn't that keep you afloat for a couple of months?<eos> The increase in actual income affects the demand.<eos> If you look at the graph below... Ah, they say that love is an unwelcome visitor.<eos> Can't even drive it away.
Are you sure that was my father?<eos> He had this book.<eos> "All Creatures Great And Small"?<eos> It's how he met my mom.<eos> She was reading that book in the park and they had a chat about it.
120 pounds.<eos> 120 pounds.<eos> I can't lift 120 pounds.<eos> I'm on disability.<eos> What was in it?
My followers record my sermons.<eos> They are provided to the devotees via DVDs.<eos> The devotees can make bookings. They can pick them up from the ashram, within 2 weeks.<eos> I have seen the booking list tor the sermon on the 2nd.<eos> But, Vijay Salgaonkafs name doesn't feature in it.
I want to see this town.<eos> Do you mind riding' a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?<eos> I don't.<eos> To the scooter store.<eos> And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put "kerns" in it.
There's a woman downstairs asking after Toussaint.<eos> Think it's his wife.<eos> All right, tell her I'll be right down.<eos> Track down the V.I.P. list.<eos> Whoever Toussaint was fighting with is on it.
It seems to me I was seduced... .. practised upon... .. perhaps with charms? With spells?<eos> Women do such things.<eos> And if that were so... .. the marriage would be null, wouldn't it?<eos> 'He sent her a purse - the King.<eos> 'Christ knows how much was in it.'
It's a magical nexus.<eos> Both victims, no connection to each other, both accidents completely unrelated.<eos> And yet, both of them occurred within a few blocks of a club they both visited.<eos> I know this neighborhood.<eos> What about it?
Even more?<eos> All right.<eos> From Jay's line. And... action.<eos> Closet?<eos> You'll love it!
I can finally breathe.<eos> I can't hear myself think!<eos> Nice preview of our sunset years.<eos> She literally pulled the plug on us.<eos> I wasn't gonna mention the other job offer to my dad, but I didn't want him just hearing about it, so after wrestling with it all day, I decided to tell him.
I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way, I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore.<eos> Fine!<eos> I don't care! I don't care!<eos> I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?
I'm... I'm really sorry.<eos> We're back to telluric currents?<eos> If the Dread Doctors didn't like coming into Eichen House because of them, maybe we can use them to protect Hayden.<eos> Okay, so, besides Eichen, where's the strongest convergence?<eos> We're standing on it.
We're bigger than break-ups, you and I.<eos> Bigger than flings.<eos> Bigger than love.<eos> So you go ahead, go sort out whatever's in that mind of yours right now.<eos> Come back with your head on straight because before too long, there'll be a crown on it.
- All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, this is a very hard thing for me to say.<eos> I've hit a wall.<eos> Can we hang the portrait on it?
You've always had the heart of a hero, Kara, way before you put on that "S." What are you doing?<eos> You need to rest.<eos> There's something that I need to show you. Something I've been working on.<eos> Your cousin has a base, it's a fortress, I guess, in the Arctic.<eos> Now, we don't know much about it, but we do know it's a place that he's been able to commune with his Kryptonian ancestors.
What?<eos> Son, I am fucked up on this shit they call God's Tongue, so I really hope this is real.<eos> You get the flowers I sent?<eos> Yeah, the card was blank.<eos> It didn't say get to the well?
This man was an undercover Mexican D.E.A. agent.<eos> Old news.<eos> Agent Fernandez had found very something important, and I'm looking for it.<eos> A ledger.<eos> What do you know about it?
The more the boy knows, the safer he'll be.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - I didn't see the harm, Trav.<eos> You know how I feel about guns.<eos> The gun doesn't care how you feel about it.
If you really cared about me why did you keep playing the game?<eos> When your friends thought they killed A in New York it was the perfect time to end it.<eos> I left the country thinking it was over.<eos> But the game it's like a drug.<eos> And I was really good at playing it.
Mama's been here.<eos> Don't you remember I brought you your cushion?<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're sitting on it.
We can't make a game about that.<eos> Why not?<eos> We are British.<eos> We know nothing about it.<eos> Hey, look, we're good at making games about American culture because we grew up absorbed in it.
Mama's talking to your brother.<eos> Hey, Jesus, where are those headphones that you borrowed before you left?<eos> Well, you're gonna have to mail them back.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You get a padded envelope and then you just write our address on it.
Claire. What the fuck are you doing in a place like this?<eos> What the fuck are you?<eos> ! Seriously?<eos> I'm on a case.<eos> You'll have heard about it on TV.
You wanted to blame him.<eos> Do you have the files on that?<eos> Check the files I sent you.<eos> The interview with Daniel should be in there.<eos> Yeah, someone recorded over it.
There are some who say that you knew about Jason's escape, even abetted it.
What?<eos> - You know what?<eos> You guys disgust me.<eos> Where's my jacket?<eos> I think I'm sitting on it.
You don't.<eos> It finds you.<eos> Is it here now?<eos> It was, till you just asked.<eos> Now it's gone again, till you forget about it.
I know. I know.<eos> His is a rough magic, indeed.<eos> But he proves that what does not kill us, makes us stronger.<eos> Like it or not, you are in this war.<eos> And you are now an even more powerful soldier in it.
What are you doing?<eos> It's beautiful out here.<eos> Scary, too.<eos> You know, on land... ..we're connected to the planet.<eos> We can change it, mould it, make our mark on it.
He said he saw me in that.<eos> So get rid of it.<eos> Just burn it then everything's fine.<eos> What? It's gone. It was here.<eos> I was wearing it when I arrived, last week.
But his purpose is not yet clear.<eos> He has a book, a journal.<eos> Tyler told me.<eos> Full of bat-shit crazy stuff.<eos> You must go to the church, find what it says.
Yeah, but she makes a point.<eos> We should at least hear her out. Right?<eos> Even if I wanted to help, how are we supposed to find him?<eos> Not a problem.<eos> See, when I rebuilt the cold gun, I didn't have time to place a tracker on it, so I devised a method of locating it by borrowing some military technology.
Couple of nice pens, a high-school graduation ring, child's baseball glove, compass, some books.<eos> That all?<eos> Well, the apartment came furnished, and his landlord sold everything else because Harrison was behind on rent, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, well, it might have looked like the victim left town.<eos> This baseball glove is too small for Harrison, it's too new to be something from his childhood, and the name on it says "Stinger."
Few spend time here but me.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Please.<eos> I wouldn't think one of your trade would complicate things with prayer.<eos> Perhaps it takes you in deeper.
You guys got the wrong jet.<eos> We need to talk about what you said to that reporter.<eos> Oh, do we?<eos> You're his image consultant, not mine.<eos> She's also a consultant for my label, and you're on it.
That's how thrilled we are to have you in our stable of songwriters.<eos> One song at the Bluebird could land me a publishing deal.<eos> It's a hell of a song.<eos> In fact, we took the liberty of sending it out to a few select artists.<eos> One of them's already put a hold on it.
Things move even quicker here, man.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Let's talk about the three problems you have right now.<eos> One... you violated parole by purchasing a fake passport card.<eos> What?<eos> It's not even my name on it.
- After Hawaii.<eos> Daisy's mom kept records.<eos> I was going through them for any insight, for research.<eos> And I found a book.<eos> It had all these names of Inhumans.
The trunk.<eos> An antique.<eos> Wood.<eos> Leather. Steel frame. Very strong.<eos> You claim it was used to store hiking boots and other outdoor equipment in the back of his car?
Why don't we just use your portal gun?<eos> It's in the car, dip-ass.<eos> [grunts] Oh, god, it hurts.<eos> She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.<eos> It's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it.
- Really, I don't know!<eos> I thought you said you didn't wanna go back to jail.<eos> Omar has a boat.<eos> He said he'd take me out on it sometime.<eos> He lives on it, I think, in Manhattan.
Did you look at his watch?<eos> That thing ain't cheap.<eos> It's probably fake.<eos> There's gonna be a lot of attention on this one, Chloe.<eos> I wouldn't pick too hard at it.
You understand.<eos> The minute he ascended the throne, the powers that be started compiling a list of appropriate brides for him.<eos> All of them worthy, all of them attractive and well educated.<eos> "They can have their list but I've got my own list.<eos> And there's only one name on it."
No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.
This is hideous. Put it on.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> If you're gonna make a shirt with a built-in wire, why can't it be practical and stylish?<eos> This shirt just might save your life.<eos> If it doesn't, don't let me get buried in it.
If Silva has more men in the country, the best way to find out is to plug that leak.<eos> Fine.<eos> You got any suspects?<eos> I brought the case to the L.A. office a month ago.<eos> Only two people were briefed on it:
It was full of cash.<eos> Let me guess. You kept it.<eos> We split it up.<eos> We figured the dead guy wouldn't miss it.<eos> And... anybody who knew about it would assume that it had burnt up in a fire.
Yeah, I read it at work.<eos> I e-mailed you.<eos> I really liked it.<eos> I was kind of hoping for more.<eos> Well, um... there were... there were things in it that really surprised me.
Me?<eos> Um, I mean, okay, but...<eos> Yeah, no, with anyone else it's just be an assignment.<eos> With you, right now... it's some kind of calling.<eos> So bring me a list and make sure you're on it.
I command you to obey.<eos> Is the pain terrible?<eos> Whisper me our future.<eos> I can't bear to think about a future anymore, not without you.<eos> Then keep me in it.
Are you hyperventilating?<eos> That accident was hours ago.<eos> Oh, uh, no, no, I'm not.<eos> Um, see this bag?<eos> I had a meatloaf sandwich in it, which reminds me of my mom, which calms me down, 'cause she's my best friend.
We get first notice of any progress made on this case, and we hand over the evidence.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> The killer's handwritten note.<eos> His fingerprints should be on it, maybe some saliva too.
He even framed me for killing you.<eos> What?<eos> What'll you do then?<eos> Honey, a weird envelope did come in the afternoon.<eos> It had a fish drawing on it.
Yes?<eos> What does music mean to you?<eos> It's... it's my life. It's what I...<eos> It's what I think about all the time.<eos> I wake up with it. I go to sleep with it.
But...<eos> I don't think I can do what he's asking.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> There's this cage in hell, and it's where they keep Lucifer.<eos> And I've been in it, and it's...
Hey. What's going on? Hey.<eos> Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.<eos> You sure?<eos> It's a... pretty great wall.<eos> What's so great about it?
And then what?<eos> I was looking for Catherine and went into her studio.<eos> She wasn't there, but the room was freezing, so I went over to the vent to see if I could feel any heat coming out.<eos> And that's when I saw the gun.<eos> Why didn't you ask Catherine about it?
The defendant was in a dispute with the victim.<eos> Witnesses place him in the vicinity of the shooting.<eos> The gun was found in his apartment.<eos> MAN: Someone else put it there.<eos> It's not just my client's prints on it.
Does he know he's wearing it?<eos> Was he asleep, and they just put it on him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, and guess what.<eos> He's going outside in it.
So, these scary Nigerian guys, what do they do?<eos> Smuggle.<eos> You need it, they bring it.<eos> You pay, you have it.<eos> Hey, that's my Christmas list, but feel free to just write all over it.
- Do we have a choice?<eos> - BOTH:<eos> Mabeland is the ultimate paradise, and the only rule-- there are no rules!<eos> Except for one rule, which is very serious.<eos> But no one would ever break it, so it's not worth mentioning.
Do we have a signal yet?<eos> It's weak, but they're ahead of us.<eos> What are we doing here, harold?<eos> Let's forget about where we are And think about where we're going.<eos> This cabin -- tell me about it.
Detective Reegan?<eos> It's Reagan.<eos> And what do you want, Mr. Tavares?<eos> I-I've been thinking, about the night that couple got killed.<eos> Oh, I've been thinking about it, too.
- That's a shocking one. - Yeah, I know.<eos> My mother didn't really like me very much.<eos> Was like a dagger in my... gut.<eos> Death.<eos> I think about it all the time, except... except... when I know that something is dying that moment.
No, it's okay.<eos> I got it.<eos> Ken Schwinn, AR.<eos> Now, Miles, as you know, you're under contract here, and we paid for that session.<eos> So, we actually own that tape and whatever music might be on it.
Why'd you tear it up?<eos> Because as a woman I was totally offended.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> It's a normal part of growing up.<eos> Okay, but he taped a picture of our babysitter's face on it.
It smells like sausages.<eos> - He never takes it off.<eos> - Never?<eos> - No, never.<eos> - He sleeps in it?
- Yeah, we know who he is.<eos> Mr. Mayor!<eos> We need your help!<eos> There's this new disease.<eos> You must have heard about it.
That feels way better.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I drew this holy well on my map,<eos> I knew it. We're on the right track.<eos> There'd better not be any snot on it.
You're threatening me?<eos> Just sympathizing.<eos> You've been left to clean up the mess.<eos> We have a job to do, Tommy.<eos> You're going to help me do it.
- So he can destroy the galaxy?<eos> What are you, some saint all of a sudden?<eos> What has the galaxy ever done for you?<eos> Why would you wanna save it?<eos> Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!
- Bo and Lyle ?<eos> Y'know what I'm looking at right now, a cell.<eos> You tell me what's going on with them brothers... You won't even have to think about that. I'll take it...<eos> No, I mean, I'm looking at her right now.<eos> I'm in it !
oh, my God, he's dead.<eos> - God. - Oh, shit, no.<eos> Your hand.<eos> - What?<eos> - It has blood on it.
I can take the cash.<eos> Okay.<eos> Seeing as that you don't have a credit card.<eos> And if you can just wait a minute, I will write you a receipt and then I can turn on the phone.<eos> You let me know if there's any trouble with the line because we just had some work done on it.
Make him comfortable.<eos> Sit.<eos> You too.<eos> Tell me something, Jack,<eos> I always thought that the number 13 had a 1 and then a 3 right after it.
Sir, wait!<eos> I just closed.<eos> I think you have a package for me in there?<eos> Could it wait until tomorrow?<eos> It has fresh clothes and food, and batteries I need.
Any time after three is fine.<eos> I'll see you in a few hours, then. Bye.<eos> Bye, Sam.<eos> That school's a good choice.<eos> I've been doing a lot of reading about it so I think Sam will be happy there.
Man, this is ridiculous.<eos> Awesome.<eos> What is that thing?<eos> This village is only like 300 years old.<eos> But it's said to have housed some of the oldest Celtic artifacts known to man.
You're thinking,<eos> "Why does everyone always get what they want and I get nothing?"<eos> "That I'm tired of being tough all the time."<eos> Everyone thinks that.<eos> You pretend like love doesn't matter to you, when the truth is it's all you ever think about.
Yeah! They were. When are you finally gonna work up the nerve to ask her to marry you?<eos> I will, I will.<eos> When school's out and the time's right, I'll be ready. I got the ring.<eos> Finally paid it off. Ooh! Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!<eos> Oh, there it is. It looks real nice when you can see it.
So, I see.<eos> So when you're pressed, you quote a bunch of ancient scribblings and say,<eos> "Don't worry, it's all in there."<eos> Well, they may be ancient, but they're not scribblings.<eos> I mean, we believe God gave us an instruction manual, and it's where we draw our strength and it's where we find our hope.
I'm trying but everything's so far away.<eos> Just remember something.<eos> My wife.<eos> She had a pretty yellow dress.<eos> She burned a hole in it with her cigarette.
So, if you want to send me a letter, you gotta address it care of her vagina.<eos> Yep.<eos> I have that skirt. - Oh, you do?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, I wore it to the fair, like, two years ago.
How do you know her, then?<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> Does she have any other family?<eos> I used to pull the birds with this song.<eos> It never failed to turn their legs to jelly.
P.F.C,JeremyFaulkner.<eos> P.F.C. Jeremy P. Faulkner.<eos> Withsuchafamouslast name, I told him he should live up to it.<eos> He gave back to me, and no kidding, he told me, quote,<eos> "I'm gonna make history, sir, not write about it."
Her children were safe, what could she do?<eos> She showed wonderful spirit and was clapped for it.<eos> How does this dress look on me, Andre?<eos> - Andre, are you listening?<eos> - You look very well in it.
All their clothes, shoes, her toys.<eos> I haven't had the courage to go in there since.<eos> When you are strong enough, my dear, when you are strong enough.<eos> We're not allowed to speak of death at court.<eos> The king does not like it, but we speak about it amongst ourselves.
- Carter, please, please.<eos> - Come on, Mickey.<eos> Switch on son, let's go.<eos> 'Carter, Petrovic has a radioactive bomb.<eos> 'Do not shoot anywhere near it.
He's just been caught.<eos> Wouldn't you be nervous?<eos> And if we continue.<eos> Like you to take a look at this photo from the CCTV footage outside the courtroom.<eos> So we've got your bike, identified you, we've got your gun with your prints on it.
He had two fingers in my tight little box, Mom.<eos> Stop lyin'.<eos> Baby, there's nothin' tight about her box.<eos> It's fuckin' huge!<eos> I could put my whole fist in it.
Only the good stuff for my friend here.<eos> You can pay me back later, huh?<eos> When's the next boat out of here?<eos> Well, I'll, I'll answer you straight, Boat comes in two days.<eos> But your friend won't be on it.
The first one?<eos> I do kind of love it.<eos> When you find the one you love, you can search all you want and you're gonna come back to it.<eos> - To the first dress.<eos> - Damn you for looking so good in it.
I'm a friend of everyone here.<eos> So, who are they, exactly?<eos> Entrepreneurs.<eos> They run a company called Gladstone.<eos> -You must have heard of it.
-You don't like to see women get hurt?<eos> -I don't like to see anyone get hurt.<eos> Do you know the story of St Augustine and the seashell?<eos> -Do you know, I don't.<eos> -I keep thinking of it.
The network is currently unavailable.<eos> Haley, did you find anything?<eos> Haley?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I found a map, but there's not much information on it.
I used to think it would be nice to live out in the country and have a few.<eos> Think that country air would...<eos> Mr. Shellburn?<eos> - I have a place by the water.<eos> I've had it for a very long time, and nobody knows.
I've had some time to give it a lot of thought... so excuse me, who's the new chief?<eos> That's still undetermined, Carlton.<eos> Okay. This new job is an opportunity for me to build a brand-new station from the ground up, keys to the castle...<eos> So is there a short list?<eos> And if so, am I on it?
No, uh, I haven't.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's the part?<eos> It's a really good part.<eos> It's a supporting role, but you're gonna be great in it because it's very sympathetic, and people will will love you in it, really.
I am tense<eos> No more talking<eos> - Is the tea ok?<eos> - It's different<eos> It's good. Sugar in it? Or something else?
You think you've walked on corpses.<eos> Spread them from here to the horizon and I have walked further!<eos> You weak, foul, lustful, vainglorious man.<eos> How dare you presume to speak to me of death?<eos> Then we shall speak of it together.
I'll get my revenge for Mickey.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> You could've learned a lot from him... He would've told you to walk... Cause it's the bravest thing you could do.<eos> No one ever drowned by getting in water, son.<eos> You'll only drown if you stay in it.
Do the girls know what happened here?<eos> Fragments, perhaps.<eos> I mean the Blaise-Hamilton case.<eos> The legend is as old as the school, handed down from one generation to the next.<eos> I knew it in my time, and the girls, no doubt, have learnt it in theirs.
This is number the guy in the hoodie called.<eos> Got that list of vehicles with chrome bumpers.<eos> Sorry it took a while.<eos> It's long.<eos> Cameron, Dalhousie and Belshaw, they're all on it.
So we're untabling our issues, then?<eos> I wanted to do this at dinner.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Can you chill the fuck out about dinner?<eos> Seriously, that duck tasted like a used condom and I want to forget about it.
I don't think the man upstairs would be interested in hearing from me.<eos> I've been a particularly wayward son.<eos> E*veryone says that.<eos> No, no, no. I'm a blasphemous mess.<eos> If there's a top ten most-unwanted list up there I could very well be on it.
- Hey, can I have a Pabst, please?<eos> Excuse me. What does that napkin say?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Here.<eos> So, what's it say?
What, did you flunk?<eos> No, I'm skipping 6th grade.<eos> You're skipping 6th grade.<eos> I loved 6th grade.<eos> I loved it so much, I took it twice.
But, as you can see from this map of the park, the Lazy River pretty much covers the whole place.<eos> So, basically, we get on, drift around till we see her.<eos> Simples!<eos> Is that map entirely accurate?<eos> There are pirates and crocodiles having a sword fight on it.
You never used to lie to me.<eos> Not when you were my dresser.<eos> You used to tell me what's what.<eos> Not that dress, Mae.<eos> It makes your ankles look like a dray horse's fetlocks.
This is just a little too fancy.<eos> I mean, half the time, I think they... they make dresses so that you have to take somebody home or else how are you going to reach the zipper, right?<eos> - I try to stick to pants.<eos> - I like that.<eos> But this dress, I mean, I'm probably going to have to... sleep in it.
Lizzie did not mention it?<eos> Just go back to bed.<eos> No.<eos> I gave her those exact instructions on the day the dress was destroyed.<eos> Did you or did you not conspire to destroy that dress because you knew there was blood on it?
Ryan has a girlfriend?<eos> And Heaven has angels.<eos> His gal pal will be locked in my sleep chamber with the only key tucked safe and sound in my prison purse.<eos> Your father bought it for me on our honeymoon trip to Alcatraz.<eos> I usually keep my tampons in it.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, well, I found a suitcase in the closet, and it's not there anymore.<eos> Do you know if grandma maybe moved it?<eos> Suitcase full of cassette tapes.<eos> There were tapes in it?
You... (grunts) (grunting)<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Can you please just get us out of this lousy future?<eos> Actually, of all probable futures, this is the worst.<eos> It is, 'cause my baby's not in it.
- Friends.<eos> - Friends.<eos> Jeremenko also likes to play tricks.<eos> Russian roulette.<eos> Do you know what it is?
Looks like Eljida is just a myth after all.<eos> Just like my father.<eos> Why'd you change?<eos> The dress was great.<eos> And I think that you look beautiful in it.
Christ, I said this would happen! You are putting your personal agenda<eos> - ahead of the mission.<eos> Look, if we arrest him, if we silence him and throw him in prison,<eos> Moscow will know that we're onto them.<eos> They'll retreat into the shadows, the operation will still go ahead as planned, but it'll be too late for us to know anything about it.
Come on!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Keep moving, keep running.<eos> - I left my purse in the house. - Forget the fucking purse.<eos> But my phone is in it.
You know we can pass this amendment in a heartbeat.<eos> Maybe, but no one'll comply.<eos> It'll get overturned.<eos> Big fuss for nothing.<eos> It might get overturned, but it gets ink along the way.
Stay cool, Everett.<eos> Just do what you can do and continue to press on.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Now I'm gonna remove the tubing.<eos> You close the hole behind it.
It can actually be quite dangerous when met with rejection.<eos> Yeah, but what does this have to do with the pregnancy?<eos> Maybe nothing.<eos> I don't know<eos> Janine might not have even known about it.
Did you tell AnnaBeth and Joel Stevens to fake a relationship to distract us?<eos> What did you know and when did you know it?<eos> Let the man speak!<eos> Look, I know we're all upset.<eos> And-and I should've told you about the merger when I first heard about it.
All right. Got it.<eos> That our guy? Yeah.<eos> That's Kilgallen.<eos> The techs and M.E. are finishing up at the crime scene.<eos> The gun that Kilgallen was shot with appears to have been taken from the club's trapshooting range, but there's no prints on it.
There are prisoners running free in the city.<eos> A CIA agent has been murdered.<eos> Where are you on the case?<eos> We've got the plane's manifest.<eos> Unfortunately, our P.O.I.'s not on it.
Well, I can't because there's no page numbers.<eos> Ah! Well, that would be a problem.<eos> You know, "Class, turn to page..."<eos> There is no page...<eos> Oh, well, if there's no page number, you can't turn to it.
Yeah, but if this wedding's for real, nobody's gonna give a shit.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I saw the kill list after 9/11.<eos> Do you know how many names were on it?
That night,<eos> I, uh... I was with Bella, back then, and she got in this huge fight...<eos> With you?<eos> Melanie, seriously, give me back the jacket.<eos> It's mine. I can't even believe you had the nerve to show up wearing it.
- He bought it for me.<eos> - What are you talking about. Stop being so dramatic.<eos> Neither of you get the jacket.<eos> I was so sick of it, I grabbed it...<eos> There were a lot of people at that party that night, I figured someone, took off with it, later.
Unh-unh, Dimitri.<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Now, Dimitri, tell Ivan that Marie Wallace sends her condolences for his loss and she looks forward to meeting with him soon.<eos> You have something?<eos> When I took the Daniel Douglas file from your safe, it showed signs of tampering.
I know you've got Birch in your pocket.<eos> Womack's not an option. We're too close.<eos> But Jacqueline...<eos> This is about my future, pure and simple.<eos> She's not a part of it.
I mean, it's like Travis going on that roller coaster to help Bobby.<eos> Travis is going on a roller coaster?<eos> ♪♪<eos> Okay, you can do this. It's just a roller coaster.<eos> Nobody's ever died on it.
I'm sure of it.<eos> In your bedroom there's a dresser with a blue lamp.<eos> Open the top drawer.<eos> In the back of the drawer, there's a bottle with pills in it.<eos> It says, "Take all pills with water."
Make sure that you're alone and go to your bedroom.<eos> In your bedroom, there's a dresser with a blue lamp.<eos> Open the top drawer.<eos> In the back of the drawer, there's a bottle with pills in it.<eos> It says, "Take all pills with water."

I'm totally in love with you.<eos> Rico.<eos> It's confirmed.<eos> Traces of blood and hair on the pipe match the victim.<eos> And Danny Desai's fingerprints are all over it.
What if they kill us both?<eos> I haven't accomplished anything.<eos> What do you got, like, a bucket list or something?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What's on it?
And I'm not gonna take you to court.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I trust you.<eos> And I don't care about this money.<eos> Just think of it as your own, all right?
The yokel sheriff of East Bumblesquat can't read an NYPD badge.<eos> Better get comfortable.<eos> This is the place.<eos> Our friend has a safe deposit box.<eos> The drives are in it.
Hmm. Did Lucas find the bottle that Max threw out?<eos> He did.<eos> 'Cause I've been thinking.<eos> Max said that it really screwed him up and knocked him on his ass, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. I wanna know if there's something in it that gave it that extra kick.
It's a cute rabbit, just say that.<eos> Here, what do you think about this bag?<eos> Are we worried she's gonna think I bought her a condolence gift?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, it quite clearly says, "Happy Birthday" on it.
What, like when you started dressing like Eminem?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or that shirt.<eos> Do you remember that shirt you made and then you wore it.<eos> It said, "Some people think that we only use 10% of our brains but I think we only use 10% of our hearts."
♪ I got the job...<eos> Huh.<eos> What?<eos> Okay. I see water.<eos> Is he in it?
- Why?<eos> Because it wouldn't change anything.<eos> He died over 160 years ago.<eos> It's already happened, remember?<eos> We can't change the past even when we're standing in it.
You maybe had a little advantage because your mom's principal.<eos> - Well, she's not yet.<eos> - Well, she's gonna be.<eos> And with all the programs and clubs they've been cutting, we just thought that...<eos> She'd never cut the dance team if her daughter was on it.
Try to coax it out.<eos> It'll feel safe, but it's not safe because I'm gonna pull it.<eos> No! Slowly!<eos> Slowly! Slowly! Then, slap it down.<eos> Slap it down. Kill it.
What doesn't make sense... is there are no monasteries anywhere near where contact with the plane was lost.<eos> And Order of the Crane Mother... doesn't exist.<eos> Unless Kyle is an idiot who doesn't know how to do simple research.<eos> No.<eos> Sir, there's no mention of it anywhere.
Luke Hobbs behind bars.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> The band cop got it's day.<eos> You know, that color looks good on you.<eos> Yeah. Look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Trust him?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> I've got an idea.<eos> It may not be better.<eos> But at least it's not him.
My government doesn't like its citizens being tortured.<eos> I'm afraid they will never know, my dear.<eos> But if you answer my questions, we won't have to engage one another in such... horrors.<eos> Why did you burn the piece of film at your house?<eos> What images did it contain?
Between the blades.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ooh, higher.<eos> I'm gonna miss this cast.<eos> Yet you never asked to sign it.
Grace, honey, focus on me, okay?<eos> Look at me.<eos> There you go.<eos> I like that tattoo.<eos> Tell me about it.
I may be able to help you get back inside.<eos> Back on the council?<eos> Go on.<eos> I found a journal Eleanor kept.<eos> In it, she mentioned that when Nassau last threatened to descend into chaos... you were the one to whom she turned to help prevent it.
No, but you are.<eos> Because denying it is the tragedy.<eos> This is a pattern. Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,<eos> -continues to operate in the shadows.<eos> I understand you believe in the importance of your article. And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
- Hey, can I have her jacket?<eos> - Give her your jacket.<eos> No, it... It goes with my dress.<eos> It's an outfit.<eos> It makes you look boxy, so give it up.
"It's true, H.G., don't be daft."<eos> Believe it.<eos> I wrote this, but...<eos> This symbol, what does it mean?<eos> I've researched it, but there's no record of it.
And you... gyrating in front of the television.<eos> Sister Ursula, I admit that the vases await my effort, but I firmly refute all charges of gyration!<eos> Flowers, dear.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Rest assured, Nurse Busby, if Matron makes a beeline for this bun today, it shall not be found wanting.
You're offering me a deal?<eos> One you cannot dismiss.<eos> Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.<eos> Now they loathe you.<eos> Creatures such as they respect only one language, and I speak it fluently.
And can I have your phone, please?<eos> Do you have any other electronic devices?<eos> iPad?<eos> My iPad doesn't even have wireless.<eos> I just use it to draw.
And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, Mom.<eos> Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
Look at this number... Where it came from.<eos> Brookline, Mass.<eos> Hannah Keating called the police at 10:30 that night.<eos> It was after the fire started.<eos> I don't know how she could have found out about it so soon unless she knew it was going to happen.
- It rains like one day out of the year!<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'm just sayin'<eos> I think maybe we should get the show on the road.<eos> Already on it.
What?<eos> My producer called me out on the carpet.<eos> Apparently, they received an anonymous tip that I have been plagiarizing my stories for the past two years, and my laptop is filled with incriminating evidence.<eos> Your laptop?<eos> It has all the fingerprints of a hatchet job.
See you later.<eos> Pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.<eos> Others will embrace it, even revel in it, like you.
We haven't heard anything, Detective.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> I mean a noise like that, it'd wake the boy and then we'd know about it, that's for sure.
That sounds like a threat.<eos> You need me.<eos> You need my government's resources and my protection.<eos> I need a patron who understands the historic importance of what's happening, and can adjust his world view accordingly.<eos> But you're just trying to save your job. So I'll let you get back to it.
We will be finished with the problem called Mary Sibley.<eos> First bring me the rest of her blood.<eos> Be very careful.<eos> The instrument is filled with Red Mercury.<eos> You must forge a dagger with that in it and kill him with the dagger.
Mario.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was having the worst dream.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me about it.
I miss you too, Leah.<eos> Listen, I was wondering - um, if I popped over, maybe in the next half-hour, would that be alright?<eos> I just need to borrow the old laptop.<eos> What for?<eos> Well, it's got some files on it I need for school.
I'd rather take my chances on the streets than stay here any longer.<eos> Who knows what would happen to us on the street?<eos> At least here we have a roof over our head.<eos> I wish our parents' money could be used now, instead of when you come of age.<eos> Then we could buy a castle and live in it with armed guards patrolling outside to keep out Count Olaf and his troupe.
Rise and shine.<eos> Mr. Lang is insured.<eos> His insurance broker has authorized me to pay you a small fortune to get them back.<eos> I know how the KR business works.<eos> I've made a large fortune off it.
That's why you and Betty, you gotta stick with him. No matter what.<eos> He's got some darkness in him.<eos> Betty's babysitting Polly, mind if I join you?<eos> Are you sure you want to sit at the social pariah table?<eos> I've been sitting at it for months, why should today be any different?
Yeah.<eos> It should be right here.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> He's right.<eos> We should be standing on it.
-No.<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> Mm-mm. - I know I do.<eos> Where'd you put the goddamn remote?<eos> You probably sat on it.
Is... is it near us?<eos> It's far enough.<eos> Okay, mother, get up.<eos> We are going to that car.<eos> Why, so you could be seen in the vicinity of it. And get caught?
There's just one bed.<eos> It's big enough for the two of us. One blanket too.<eos> We can easily fit in it.<eos> "My problem is a bit private."<eos> "Okay, I hope you don't have a problem discussing it publicly."
Are you leaving us, Mr Greenwood? Yes.<eos> Shame Dr Turner isn't back yet.<eos> He'll receive a copy of my report, of course.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> Would it be completely inappropriate if one were to inquire as to any possible conclusions it may contain?
I can't even believe they're taking this case seriously.<eos> The guy threatened me, he attacked my car,<eos> - and he knew I was a cop.<eos> - Look, I told you they were able to get the surveillance camera.<eos> Yeah. After I located it.
- Yes, you did.<eos> - It's not really the point though, is it?<eos> - Well, actually, if you want to read the transcript, what I said was the interview topic was being left behind.<eos> You never said anything was off the record.<eos> Well, then why didn't you tell everybody that you were the one who actually had the affair with Damien and got all messed up over it?
- You're swearing a lot tonight.<eos> - Yeah, I've noticed that too.<eos> Well, obviously, sweetie, I didn't know we'd be burying the container.<eos> What did you think, honeybunch?<eos> We'd take it home with us and clean it out and use it to store our taxes, which we can't do because it doesn't have a fucking lid.
There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that's bothering me.<eos> It was completely cracked up, as if it had been put back together by a lot of different pieces, and not one of all of these texts references anything like that.<eos> Yeah, something bothers me about it too.<eos> I mean, if it's as all-powerful as it's supposed to be and belonged to all the people it supposedly belonged to...<eos> Then how did this Zerstoerer guy get his grubby mitts on it?
Ross! What can be done for these people?<eos> So that's my proposal.<eos> We cannot feed all of Cornwall, so we must keep this plan to ourselves.<eos> I admit it's risky.<eos> It requires each and every one of us to play our part and it may fall at the first hurdle.
No, not your laptop.<eos> They walked away with it.<eos> Now... who would have done that, Dean?<eos> Did you take the laptop home with you after the murder?<eos> Are you sure that you got rid of all the blood that was on it?
And what about the safe?<eos> What about the safe?<eos> How do you know you have the right safe?<eos> We got the right safe!<eos> It had 3 grand in it!
He couldn't... no, he wouldn't even look at me.<eos> It is though my sex rendered me invisible.<eos> Maxford is a blowhard.<eos> But his support will protect your throne.<eos> He will never protect my throne as long as a woman sits on it.
I see you with bacon over the sink, I see you fall asleep in my chair, watching my Cinemax.<eos> And I see your godless friends in my pool!<eos> No, no, listen, Firuz. Here's what happened.<eos> There was an earthquake in Los Angeles.<eos> So we just went in the pool 'cause it's the safest place to be.
No, I didn't say that.<eos> I just... I just want to sit with it a little longer.<eos> Okay.<eos> That gallbladder's really inflamed.<eos> It's full of stones.
But, most of the time, police work requires a more delicate touch.<eos> - "Delicate"? - Yeah.<eos> You broke a guy's arm and you gave another one a concussion.<eos> And that was after you knocked in the roof of a National City landmark.<eos> And now it just has a big, Supergirl-sized hole in it.
You sure you want to listen to this?<eos> I don't have to.<eos> Being with Kyle was amazing.<eos> I mean, come on, he's Kyle West.<eos> But Kyle's world is really big... and it's just easy to get lost in it.
Coffee?<eos> You got to be hungry.<eos> I have Charlotte's FBI profile here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Says she bought the Philadelphia Project textbook and swallowed it whole.
Good. Whatever it costs.<eos> Well, that's generous.<eos> This beacon must be pretty important.<eos> To the Hullen, it's priceless.<eos> So we better move before they find out about it.
It's just frustrating. I was finally about to learn something useful from my past.<eos> You did learn something.<eos> You know she's out there.<eos> And, you know, one day, you're gonna find her.<eos> Well... The Android thinks the Ishida scientist tampered with it while trying to figure it out.
Will you make me governor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My friends will become your friends, and your enemies will become mine, as some already have.<eos> About that clerkship, you can put that - out of your mind. - Well, thank you.<eos> I'm sure my granddaughter has put it out of hers.
I don't remember.<eos> I gave you the photo, now buzz off! Agh!<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> Mia wasn't taken from that train.<eos> We think she hid on it and snuck off later.
If this doesn't work, how much longer can Kirsten last?<eos> She's not eating, but she's getting fluids.<eos> She could last a few weeks.<eos> Yes, what about her mind?<eos> How long can she stay lost inside of it?
They're the most carefree of all the birds, don't you think?<eos> Look.<eos> Wild roses!<eos> Isn't pink just the most bewitching colour?<eos> I love it, but I can't wear it.
Dr. Grey is unavailable to perform your surgery, Lynne, so, uh, Dr. Kepner will be performing it with Dr. Pierce.<eos> She's gonna take out my cancer?<eos> Ms. Gagliano, I have successfully operated on several esophageal cancer... listen, Dr. notGrey, I don't care what you've done.<eos> Dr. Grey found my cancer.<eos> She told me about it. She held my hand while I bawled about it.
- Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gosh..<eos> I love this, by the way.<eos> It would look great on you. Do you want to buy it?
Are you saying that my notes from our meeting are incorrect?<eos> Your notes on our meeting are bizarrely incorrect.<eos> Well, would you be kind enough to show me where I was mistaken?<eos> Well, you came into my office, you explained the nature of your task force, we spoke about your son, and that was it.<eos> I don't know where you got this quote, but there's not a single word of it that is accurate.
Sooner or later, we'll be seeing each other again.<eos> Of course we will.<eos> Lara has gone.<eos> She's traveling the world she helped to save.<eos> And find her place within it.
Problem is, the chip's implanted in his hand.<eos> So? Shoot him.<eos> Or, ooh, cut off his hand.<eos> There's a microprocessor in the chip tied to his heart rate.<eos> If he dies, so does the chip and everything on it.
And the lock screen is a picture of Margaret and me.<eos> I-It reminds me of the last time I saw her.<eos> You realize that you have been withholding evidence... from your lawyer? !<eos> I know this looks bad, but it's not what it seems.<eos> There's just incredibly incriminating information on it that would be devastating if it was uncovered.
The pronunciation?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's very bad.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's hard to learn new language when don't speak it all time.
I don't see another move on the board.<eos> The police's hands would be tied.<eos> Lock up for us, would you?<eos> Vacant house for sale to the north of him, a couple of hippies on the other side with matching "Co-Exist" bumper stickers.<eos> I doubt they'd be as tolerant of their neighbor's lifestyle if they got a look at it.
That was my bust.<eos> Why won't she come to me?<eos> I don't know. 'Cause you weren't here?<eos> - Hard copy's on the desk.<eos> - Oh, what does it say?
But, actually, you seem like a pretty good guy, so... I'm happy you and Heather met.<eos> Hey, I'll tell you what, next time I come down here, how about you and me, we do a little bit of wrestling, huh? Ow.<eos> I wasn't ready.<eos> Okay, Charlene, get the TV remote.<eos> Yes, it... it says right on it, "TV remote."
- Keep your voice down.<eos> No one's supposed to know.<eos> A woman's cycle is a shameful thing.<eos> Why?<eos> It's "unmentionable", that's why.
No, it's not.<eos> It's not, I'm going to get it for you.<eos> Nothing's too much for you, is it?<eos> 'I'm going to read you a poem about a hawk.<eos> 'You will take it home and you will write about it.
Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.<eos> Okay. Space A-3, here we go.<eos> It's squeaking.<eos> Mark it. It's nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter's going to as well.<eos> Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did.
What are... what are you doing here?<eos> All Alex wants is a career in music.<eos> You can give that to her, so why won't you?<eos> Because I don't want her in this business.<eos> You're in it.
Yeah, it's too late.<eos> Erm...<eos> - Does that mean he's not coming on, then?<eos> Well, James, he's been liquidised and now he's all over the window, so, no, he's not.<eos> Yeah, he's not in the tent so much as on it.
Just as soon as Dwayne regains bladder control, we're gonna celebrate this one.<eos> - It's never gonna stop.<eos> - Let's grab some more towels.<eos> I'm devastated about Margaret's affair.<eos> The worse thing is, Margaret never told me about it.
You can't blame a guy for thinking about his future, and yours.<eos> You could be the one who brought down Chloe Jackson.<eos> Find anything on her phone?<eos> It's a burner.<eos> There's nothing on it.
Vin fired him.<eos> Well, how do we know that jace didn't throw the game?<eos> But vin hasn't provided. Any evidence to back up his accusation.<eos> Is there actually $20 million in the whole sport?<eos> There's billions in it.
No classified information, no Ranger unit.<eos> GlobeSpill filled in the blanks, got those Rangers killed.<eos> - It was GlobeSpill.<eos> - Mr. Colon, stop.<eos> The members will disregard Mr. Colon's outburst and the allegations in it.
Jordan's very smart.<eos> His math scores are in the top ten percent.<eos> Impressive.<eos> But I don't see his individualized home instruction plan.<eos> I made some changes to it this morning.
Well, we have been waiting for almost two hours.<eos> Well, I'm in the middle of a very busy afternoon.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Ben is no longer allowed to ride the bus.<eos> He's been urinating on it.
What kind of example is it you attacking them?<eos> I didn't attack anyone.<eos> He hit me.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Because somebody set his house on fire with him in it.
Looks more like a boiler room than a bank.<eos> Brannigan Trust has been around since J.P. Morgan.<eos> Why would they get involved in a boiler room?<eos> I'm telling you, it was them.<eos> That's where the sign was; It said:
Hey, computer forensics is done with the video.<eos> You guys wanna see some high tech work?<eos> You guys take it. I'll hang back.<eos> Your drive wasn't used much.<eos> The past three months, it only ever had two files on it.
The past three months, it only ever had two files on it.<eos> - Two?<eos> - Yep.<eos> There was a second file, someone removed it manually two days ago at 9:54 p.m.<eos> Can't tell you much about it, though.
Yes, of course.<eos> We clearly need a new surface for under the jungle gym.<eos> My plan is to return to sand.<eos> It's inexpensive, natural.<eos> It's what we grew up with.
But then I-I looked out the window and...<eos> I saw him... walking.<eos> Not running, walking.<eos> And he stopped to throw something in a garbage can, and then he just... walked away.<eos> And I-I don't know why, but I-I-I... I ran outside and, um, I went to the garbage can and I put my hand in it and then I-I reached around and... and that's when I found it.
So you're sterile.<eos> See, now we're getting somewhere?<eos> Laughter is the best medicine.<eos> No, I was just thinking about your tiny penis.<eos> Carol told me all about it.
So, the killer sits here.<eos> Directly across from the victim.<eos> You're the dirty rat, Diane.<eos> - Relax, Donny.<eos> All right, now, the turntable was scrubbed of DNA, so was the record that was on it.
What's next, father?<eos> We regroup and plan to fight another day.<eos> We'll amass a bigger army.<eos> We'll find Jack, and finally defeat that big baby!<eos> Aku is the creator of this world and everything in it.
Fine.<eos> Let's go.<eos> As soon as we hit the road, we'll find a way to the jet.<eos> The jet is sitting on one of Werner's air strips.<eos> No doubt his men are on it right now drinking my scotch and seeing who fits in my suits.
I didn't mean to come in here and just blubber.<eos> I just can't handle the fact that she's not coming back.<eos> I know the sadness feels like it'll last forever, but it will get easier.<eos> And don't... block it out.<eos> You know, let yourself feel it.
The only thing I'm scared of is to see how many people that's here for me right now, in this moment, after I lost, disappear."<eos> The only thing I could do is go back to the gym, reassess myself with my team and try our best in the next go round.<eos> Two years in the life of American boxing will teach you a lot about the sport's issues and problems... but mostly about its champions.<eos> Boxing has never been a perfect sport and it never will be.<eos> But it is about people who can rise to the best of themselves when they put on the gloves.
I had a lot of help.<eos> But you've also had a lot of adversity.<eos> You've had issues with management, conflicts of interest...<eos> Yeah, well, the boxing world looks shiny from the outside.<eos> It's filled with promises that...
The silence.<eos> Purity.<eos> 30 years ago I discovered a new world.<eos> I wanted to show. I wanted to find him.<eos> I wanted to tell about it.
Rose thought if she could fix a propeller in a film, she could learn to mend an engine in real life.<eos> They're both mechanics now.<eos> Baker's planning a new film.<eos> Air-raid wardens.<eos> Wants me in it.
- We need it to kill the queen.<eos> Once she is dead, The Tao Tei can not function.<eos> Without her signal, their whole army will freeze.<eos> There is an underground canal here.<eos> Has it been breached?
Mantis ?<eos> Your chi is strong just like your friend, the bug.<eos> Mantis<eos> Don't worry, little birdie. I'll put your chi to good use.<eos> Destroying the Jade palace and everyone in it.
I'm just here to ask you if you would be amenable to omitting the casino issue from your sermons and in exchange we're gonna bring a business here.<eos> Business will create jobs which will reduce the sinfulness that comes with poverty and idle hands.<eos> We'd be willing to contribute to the church.<eos> Hell, we'd be willing to build a few churches.<eos> If god rewrites the Bible to cast gambling as virtuous I will refrain from speaking against it.
She doesn't need advice.<eos> She needs friends.<eos> There's a gravestone out back.<eos> It's probably an old dog's, but it scares Lucas.<eos> Would you dig it up and make sure it's nothing?
But I can't disappear.<eos> But I don't want to leave you.<eos> Honey, look.<eos> No one ever saw that dragon again.<eos> And I never told another tale about it.
Wait.<eos> Are they...<eos> Titties, yep.<eos> - What now, A.J.?<eos> - Plug in that flash drive and open the file on it.
Then what?<eos> Mice, maybe?<eos> Big bloody mouse.<eos> Well, there's nothing we can do about that.<eos> We can file an incident report and we'll stand by it if anyone asks.
I'm lost in the woods with a strange man who's been lying to me, and I do not give a shit if it makes you feel uncomfortable.<eos> - Now, give me your phone!<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> I'll give you the phone.<eos> - Don't mess with it first.
We hired you to clean up this mess.<eos> You're right.<eos> He touched this phone, didn't he?<eos> So?<eos> That means his prints are on it.
What did you press?<eos> You really put a fucking gun in my face, and you don't even know how to use it?<eos> I know how to use it.<eos> I didn't know how to press the release.<eos> There's nothing in it.
I was in love once.<eos> Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate. Remember that.<eos> I'm here with a representative of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr. Bergen Paulsen.<eos> And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here. I understand that you're in town for the big show.<eos> Tell us a little bit about it.
I'm not gonna ride in it.<eos> My mom will just give me a new one.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - I cleaned it, it's fine.<eos> - Why don't you sleep in it?
It's good for him to grow, you know?<eos> And, also, I played him a bunch of my beats, and he was like, "No."<eos> What's up, y'all?<eos> Got a hot new single coming.<eos> And it addresses some social issues that I think are being ignored. So keep your eyes peeled for that.
The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and my father, and the way he phrased it made me feel like it was something big, maybe something terrible.<eos> Definitely something he didn't want to spell out on paper.<eos> It scared me for some reason. I put the letter back in the box, locked it, and never looked at it again.<eos> My father kept a journal.<eos> He wrote in it every night after supper.
Okay. I'm listening.<eos> You know that memory crypt that we took out of that stiff?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - All right.<eos> Go 3D. It had an unregistered flight path for a ship called the Anubis, Anubis.
Everything going on out there, all this shit storm that we're in, it's all got to do with her, Julie Mao.<eos> You know that memory crypt that we took out of that stiff? Yeah?<eos> All right.<eos> Go 3-D.<eos> It had an unregistered flight path for a ship called the Anubis.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Tell us, Madame Fraser, what do English ladies call a male member?<eos> Ah, well, I've... heard it referred to as "peter."
What a lovely surprise.<eos> New suit, Arthur?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> No, no, no. It's...<eos> You can wear it for what's left of your dinner.
What happened to him?<eos> I decided to take a closer look at a musket ball.<eos> Here, Fergus.<eos> Take out the whiskey and the bowl.<eos> Clear the altar and get him on it.
Your accent, Bohemia?<eos> No, Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia.<eos> So you must know the railway station at Vladislav?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's so special about it?
It's called Mandingo Plumbing... 'cause I lay pipe.<eos> - Carl.<eos> Carl, stop.<eos> - I'd like to lay some on your fat ass.<eos> - And I come right after it.
Though the ending was puzzling and more than a little infuriating.<eos> Barack!<eos> - Avery!<eos> - Wow! Having a Sidley Austin reunion here.<eos> We just came from a community meeting that we attended as colleagues and friends, and just thought it might be a good idea to stop and see the movie since it's something everybody was talking about.
I know what you're thinking.<eos> "What the heck do I need a five spindle for, when I barely sell enough milkshakes to justify my single spindle?" Right?<eos> Wrong.<eos> Are you familiar with the notion of the chicken or the egg, Mr. Griffith?<eos> I mention it because, well, I think it applies here.
The war is over, ser.<eos> Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?<eos> As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.<eos> This is my home.<eos> I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.
Guys, he's rhyming.<eos> He's telling Gina to sing.<eos> Captain Holt is on a vacation high!<eos> He will say yes to anything right now.<eos> I would like a police horse, and I'd like Terry to be riding it almost constantly.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, her cat.<eos> We'll have to take her.<eos> Norah was very excited about the project that she was working on.<eos> She couldn't say anything about it, but she told us that it was the opportunity of a lifetime.
- Really?<eos> Because I found a stone just like... Just like the one on your bracelet in her room.<eos> I was in there looking for her notebook, where she wrote down her ideas, and I thought that if I could just read it, then maybe I could get an advantage.<eos> Why?<eos> What was in it?
We do know that.<eos> It was the following day.<eos> But the phone was not activated until the day of online registration.<eos> Which is er...six days later.<eos> Time to tamper with it, perhaps?
Well, why not just take the second list and push 'em over the side right now?<eos> Wouldn't that save us all a lot of trouble? Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Those men out there hear the two of you arguing, and they might just lose whatever faith they've got left that we have any idea what we're doing in here.<eos> I will challenge you with the men and resist this plan.<eos> If you challenge me in any way while we exist in this state, I will be forced to make an issue of how we entered into it in the first place.
Mr. De Groot, depth at 14 fathoms.<eos> Hang the starboard and stern anchors. Hang the starboard and the stern anchors.<eos> He thinks we've lost our minds.<eos> Always a possibility.<eos> Well, he's carrying out the order, so have to hope he sees some credibility in it.
Nothing.<eos> Two hours of silence after we tested it at your house.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> I wore it the whole time.<eos> It makes sense... if you tampered with it.
No.<eos> This is 23 Kingsbury Green.<eos> This is 23 Kingsbury Green, not Grove.<eos> Look, on the table behind you, there's a utility bill.<eos> It says 23 Kingsbury Green on it.
I make the system run.<eos> I have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and philanthropy.<eos> I am employ hundreds of people directly, thousands indirectly.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Nothing... besides suck from the municipality, feed off of it.
It's true.<eos> I'll tell you a little secret.<eos> Fear?<eos> Fear's your friend.<eos> You take this internship, you excel with it. You're gonna be out there looking out for me.
Yeah. I'm an on-set teacher.<eos> Oh, you're a... you're a tutor?<eos> Yeah. On-set teacher.<eos> - For the show, um... - Witchita.<eos> - Have you heard of it?
I just thought you should know why I requested the two of you.<eos> For this assignment, I need my best.<eos> Outside of Malajat last month, the Taliban intercepted a shipment of Stinger missiles, which was subsequently used in a Taliban offensive.<eos> The transport was a classified op.<eos> Our job is to find out how the Taliban knew about it.
A ghost.<eos> Hope you're going to put everything back when you're done.<eos> Yeah, after I find the money.<eos> What makes you think I had anything to do with that stolen shipment?<eos> You're one in a small circle who knew about it.
Maybe you have me confused with the last guy you held at gunpoint.<eos> If you don't tell me where Reese is, I'm gonna do more than just point.<eos> Don't know, don't care, but I can't let you leave with that hard drive.<eos> Why?<eos> What's on it?
- What?<eos> A futon.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna use it?<eos> You remember my playable mattress?<eos> It... has a hole in it or something, I don't know, it's plated.
Look at you, a young woman now.<eos> It's a mistake, Khatun.<eos> If you stay, there is no more suffering.<eos> All the pain of life, gone.<eos> Soon, you won't remember any of it.
Me too.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why don't you come with me to New York?<eos> I mean, I'm taking your jet.<eos> You might as well be on it.
Aldus was carrying this when he was killed.<eos> It's a newspaper article about an Egyptian dagger.<eos> The one Savage used to kill us.<eos> In Central City, we learned that objects associated with the night of our deaths can also be used to kill Savage.<eos> According to Aldus's notes, the dagger needs to be wielded in conjunction with an incantation inscribed on it.
Oh, grandpa.<eos> I'm going to borrow your car, okay?<eos> - My car?<eos> Thanks, Grandpa.<eos> There better not be a scratch on it.
It ain't as easy as saying no.<eos> Massa wants to be liked, appreciated.<eos> You got to be grateful.<eos> Eat everything on your plate.<eos> And that drink, when you sip it, ask what's in it.
Didn't say why.<eos> They were offering up a chunk of change, So we didn't ask.<eos> - Must have been a nice chunk of change For you to partner up with your ex-wife's other ex-husband.<eos> - Ha, yeah, yeah, it was.<eos> - So after the car was recovered, Did you find anything special in it?
What motivates him.<eos> Fears.<eos> Goals.<eos> Scars.<eos> He has a weak point, and we need to twist a knife in it.
And Bobby Axelrod is the one who is sewing the legs.<eos> Every dollar that he takes through fraud, insider information, market manipulation, is a dollar taken away from one of those folks who earned it.<eos> And Axe will do everything to keep it all going.<eos> And that's why you need me, because I am willing to stare into the abyss beyond conventional morality and do what needs to be done to even that fucking table back up.<eos> - Sit in it.
did you do it?<eos> Erased every single one of the hacked files, including yours.<eos> Adios, gonzo, sayonara! Okay, so, you're sure Dominic's people cannot find out about me?<eos> Positive. Once I knew it was him, I traced his downloads to his IP address and wiped his hard drive clean.<eos> I mean, not that he's gonna need anything on it anymore anyway.
Where are you?<eos> Two! Today, I would like to show you how to make the color known as vermillion.<eos> Prudentius, you are a Frank.<eos> Tell me what you know about the recent attack on Paris by the Northmen.<eos> You have heard about it, I assume?
I tried to convince myself that it was just superstition talking.<eos> But you knew there was some truth to it.<eos> So you studied everything you could on the supernatural.<eos> My whole life I've been looking for proof that there is another world out there.<eos> And you... you've been living in it.
Hey, Charleston, wait up.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yo.<eos> Think you could take my backpack into school for me? Why?<eos> What's in it?
Vacation.<eos> All right, here's what we know so far.<eos> This facility was a storage site for the ATCU.<eos> But somehow, the Watchdogs found out. Hey!<eos> Uh, the residue from the bombs, it's got nitramene in it.
I think he was taking those poor buggers to wherever it was you wanted them left.<eos> You can think whatever you like.<eos> We found the van yesterday, by the way.<eos> Up at Blythe Point.<eos> It's got Tommy's blood on it.
Holy shit, someone's willing to give us 100 grand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't we do this years ago?<eos> The bank doesn't just give you money.<eos> They actually buy the house and let you live in it till you pay back the loan with interest.
I've tried everything else.<eos> Not everything.<eos> You're still here.<eos> Yeah, it seems like you got some kind of a plan.<eos> So why don't you tell us about it?
God only knows who'd want it now.<eos> Maybe somebody dumped it there?<eos> Is there any way to trace the history of the jeep after it was stolen?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe there's fingerprints in it.
Well, you don't need to give me a speech.<eos> I called you here because you've been a friend, and I figured you wouldn't be judgey no matter what I choose.<eos> No way. I'm the last person to be judgey.<eos> My life is messed up as it is, but, uh, I will say this.<eos> As crazy as this world is with the monsters and the lunatics running around, it's still a better place with you in it.
No. No, you're not leaving.<eos> Please, just go in there and tell my mother the truth.<eos> Spencer, she's two weeks out.<eos> This is the truth she needs to win.<eos> If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me. - Not you.
I picked up a candlestick...<eos> And I stabbed her in the back of the neck with the end of it.<eos> And then I took her to the bell tower and I threw her off.<eos> I went to the hotel and pretended like I was only gone for a minute to get ice.<eos> Stealing that security drive wasn't because Aria was on it.

You wanted to believe that the army had straightened me out.<eos> Look. I'm your brother, but I'm not built like you.<eos> I didn't take to the military like you did.<eos> You saw the world as something to be fixed.<eos> I only saw it as broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
No one ever does.<eos> I think what Mr. armitage is too polite to say is that phase 5 now rests on your wife's questionable political acumen.<eos> Tomas, how is Madrid this time of year?<eos> I remember taking a siesta in your office once.<eos> I can practically picture the room right now as if I'm actually in it.
That urban legend, still around.<eos> It will be nice if for once, the story was just a story.<eos> And yet, we must face the truth.<eos> The Jersey Devil has come to Sleepy Hollow.<eos> You know the best thing about Sunday brunch is what follows it.
We must proceed.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm going to stay.<eos> So long as he stays within the mystic circle, I can channel the energy I need to shatter the barrier.<eos> But he must stay within it, for his safety, and ours.
If you're going to end my life, do it now.<eos> I never wanted to harm you.<eos> Things would have gone a lot easier for me if I had.<eos> A ship leaves for the Farlands on the next tide.<eos> Give me what I want and you will sail with it.
I got accessory, I got conspiracy,<eos> I got inciting a riot, but I think I'm gonna go with unlawful possession of a narcotic.<eos> What in the hell are you talking about?<eos> You dropped me off a little gift basket a little while ago?<eos> Had some oxycontin in it.
Fine.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> So, what? So, it's not... it's not an exposé anymore, it's what? - It's a... profile?
But he also started a mutiny.<eos> Yes, obviously out of madness.<eos> But he was gaining support with some of the crew members.<eos> Perhaps that's why his journal went missing.<eos> It had details of the mutiny which you wanted to keep a secret.
What?<eos> Your cellphone.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it may have digital information on it that could support your alibi.
-I didn't know you were back.<eos> -I'm back.<eos> And look!<eos> I've got a new wagon.<eos> -What's in it?
This. I found it hidden in the back about an hour ago.<eos> It's about 100 grand.<eos> - Give or take.<eos> - Did you go through Darryl's phone?<eos> Mm-hmm. The guy who attacked him, Gary Nolan, was he on it?
-No, I'm fine.<eos> This is not about me, Grace. This is about Coyote.<eos> Well, the good news is you found your neti pot.<eos> -Where?<eos> -You're serving nuts in it.
- She's creating friction, and at that vibration and speed...<eos> - What?<eos> - Complete chaos.<eos> She could destroy that whole bridge.<eos> - And everyone on it.
I'm sorry.<eos> The truth is I didn't want to get your hopes up.<eos> About what?<eos> About your movie being back in production.<eos> I thought it was dead. It was.
So, basically... yeah.<eos> Did you tell Nancy I'm a philandering bastard?<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - It's not even true.<eos> I may talk about sex all the time, and think about it and write about it, brilliantly, but I don't do it.
It's like I was born with suction cups for feet.<eos> I hated being a kid.<eos> I'm holding you to one positive memory.<eos> I liked helping my dad build stuff.<eos> I liked the rain, even though I wasn't allowed to play in it.
You just... concentrate on something, and... no, Jesus, don't do it to me.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Let's... let's do this.<eos> So, look at the vent.<eos> Okay, pick a spot and focus on it, and see if you can melt it.
Well, what about Robert's will?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Danny is not in it.
- What about it?<eos> - You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Danny is not in it.<eos> Yeah, I know, but Robert said Nolan would be in it.
Where's the body?<eos> Inside. On a cross.<eos> Like a crucifixion? Looks like.<eos> Well, this is a bad way to start the day.<eos> Somebody dragged a cross into a barn and hung a body on it.
Let it out, you mean.<eos> Whatever fits.<eos> Oh, did I step on your moment?<eos> Get off my roof.<eos> Not on it.
I've got you, careful now, careful.<eos> Just stay here, okay?<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> It must have been the cake.<eos> There was something in it.
He scented a rabbit and...<eos> Garrick!<eos> Garrick, come to!<eos> Is Ross recovered from the trial?<eos> He rarely speaks of it.
Asking the questions?<eos> Doesn't matter who it is.<eos> What matters is that they're smart.<eos> And it's only a matter of time before they think of some way to test their theory.<eos> The coat Senator Morra wore that day is in an FBI evidence locker with his blood on it.
Supposed to meet him tonight.<eos> How about you?<eos> How's the whole chain of custody thing going?<eos> We were able to follow Morra's coat all the way from the crime scene to the evidence control unit.<eos> So no one tampered with it.
What do you want?<eos> Naz needs you right now.<eos> Washington maintains a master list of every agent working under nonofficial cover.<eos> Two hours ago, unknown persons stole the hard drive from Deputy Director Rovick's home in Dupont Circle.<eos> The list was on it.
And the information I have says that it's too late for Piper.<eos> And NZT can't change that.<eos> It's not a magic bullet.<eos> Dad was only trying to help, but he was wrong.<eos> NZT is a magic bullet, and the entire Legion of Whom is on it.
Not a Power?<eos> Just a vet with skills.<eos> You know, we guys got to stick together.<eos> How's the hard drive?<eos> I'm still churning it.
You know, they'd take it from me and beat the crap out of me.<eos> And one time, I fought back, but I...<eos> I really fought back. Good.<eos> They... they were bigger than me, but I had this rock.<eos> I hit them with it.
Killers make mistakes.<eos> That's how we catch them.<eos> No.<eos> That... That vent system is the very heart of that lab.<eos> Anything goes wrong with it, someone notices.
Okay.<eos> If you're ever in deep shit, all right, you take this notebook, and you take it to Don Epifanio, and you trade it for your life, all right?<eos> Don't trust Batman.<eos> Go to Don Epifanio.<eos> What's in it?
He went to find food and never came back.<eos> The guests took him to draw me out.<eos> I... I don't understand.<eos> I have keys to every hall, every building.<eos> This place is a maze and I know how to run it.
God damn you, Chris!<eos> What are the chances?<eos> Of?<eos> Two days, I'm walking trying to find my way to the ocean.<eos> And when I do finally see the water... I see the hotel lit up like a goddamn beacon and it's you.
Just need to, uh, build a...<eos> a listening device then.<eos> The sonography machine that they use to test ice samples.<eos> The electrodes on this machine emit ultrasound waves that help scientists see through the ice.<eos> But Happy and Toby aren't under the ice, they're on it.
You're lying again.<eos> - Out with it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I pulled up your code again.<eos> I told you there was someone that had been accessing it.
One to be fought, taken, won.<eos> I thought you were different.<eos> You're just like all the rest.<eos> I'm nothing like the others.<eos> I own this world, and I know every trick in it except for one last thing, the same thing you were looking for when we first came here.
My parents are in there.<eos> I came as quick as I could.<eos> - How'd you get here?<eos> - My bike.<eos> I rode it from school.
I do it only because I care about you as I have always cared about you.<eos> I'm still the same Matthew.<eos> You once called me your North Star the one you trusted above all others.<eos> Trust me now.<eos> So, what will you do with the Havisham fortune once you get your grubby little hands on it?
However it happened, it's not normal.<eos> Well, the last thing that happened was, I grabbed you.<eos> With the stick in your hand. So we're thinking this is some kind of healing stick-magic wand thing?<eos> What about the cloth it was wrapped in?<eos> It had some kind of writing on it.
Dad?<eos> Even if you stop them, I could just make it again.<eos> I'm too dangerous alive.<eos> You need to get out of here.<eos> Find a hole and disappear into it.
Got what?<eos> The autopsy report.<eos> Wait. You have the autopsy report?<eos> Wait.<eos> Why? Because I want to know what it said.
Ma, we just didn't come over for food.<eos> We, uh, we have some news.<eos> Oh, no, did my doctor call you?<eos> What?<eos> He said my stool sample was fine, but I know there was something fishy about it.
Um... I was trying to surprise you.<eos> I was trying to find Lizzie.<eos> I think it's gonna be pretty hard to track her down.<eos> Because you're Lizzie.<eos> I, um, I founds this video and in it, you were telling the same story.
Gun it!<eos> I had no idea Destiny was going to hit her. I swear.<eos> Why should we believe you?<eos> I know where the tire iron is.<eos> That'll have her fingerprints all over it, won't it?
I ran forensics on it.<eos> A lot of stuff we got to cover.<eos> We need coffees.<eos> A man's belt?<eos> The prints on it match one of the victims of the Silver Bells Killer.
They're all I have!<eos> Take one more step, and I will shoot!<eos> Stand down, Elijah.<eos> We confiscated his computer.<eos> He's talking about the recordings he had saved on it.
The environment will be so wired that your experience will be brought to you.<eos> Your calls will be brought to you, your advertising, your content, your work... all of it will come with you. That's an internet of me.<eos> It is going to take a leap of thought, a leap of courage... societally for us to accept a generation that's always had an egotistical world.<eos> We tell children very often you have to play with others, you have to share, your worldview isn't unique.<eos> But when the world, the objects in it start to tell them that they are, that they're different, that's egotistical.
Oh, it's fine, love. It's just a storm.<eos> I've survived worse.<eos> No, I should not have brought you here.<eos> My dream... it wasn't just a dream.<eos> This is exactly how it happened.
Like sex things.<eos> Which is great because they're straight in real life, so we have to fantasize.<eos> You wanna maybe help me with one of these bags?<eos> Oh, sorry, my phone's kinda heavy.<eos> I got a MoFi on it.
- It's awesome.<eos> - Is it? Is it great?<eos> Is it brand-new?<eos> Brand-new.<eos> - Tell me about it.
But, apparently, the feeling wasn't mutual.<eos> They were just acting on my orders.<eos> I see. Because your wife told me something this morning that stuck with me.<eos> I'm starting a working group, and making Russell its point man.<eos> I want the circle to be tight and close, and I want you to be on it.
Dad, leave him.<eos> Joe? Joe?<eos> You've got a really cool birthday cake. I think he's just a bit tired, you know.<eos> Joe, you want to see your cake, don't ya?<eos> It's got an octopus and fishes and seaweed on it.
I hope you're not trying to get back in with them now you've put the restaurant on the market.<eos> What's that got to do with you?<eos> I think the rebranding should be more radical.<eos> Take a leaf out of BrewDog's book.<eos> Hey, that's my speech therapy notebook. I don't want your scribble on it.
I knew it! Yeah, but, you know, we still have a pretty big hurdle to get over, actually.<eos> Three of 'em.<eos> Yeah, what Mol is saying is that there are some other aspects of the house that we have to make more presentable.<eos> Are you talking about the dust bunnies under my bed?<eos> More like the weed bunny that sleeps on top of it.
Anyway, um, Raf and I have this glider.<eos> We love it because it is so comfortable, especially if you're gonna be up long nights, feeding the baby...<eos> I'm not worried about late nights.<eos> I have a night nurse.<eos> Oh, well, maybe she wants to sit in it.
This girl's husband... Her name was Sadie.<eos> Right.<eos> Should I, uh, proceed to the part where you have no identity at all prior to 1960?<eos> Should I proceed to the part where your superior's gonna come in here and tell you to burn that letter that Oswald wrote to you two days ago?<eos> And what did it say?
I only saw a bit of it before Deedee moved on.<eos> Sir, please make sure your watch is on airplane mode.<eos> I'm just setting it for Los Angeles time.<eos> There's a man in 7C. He has a smartwatch.<eos> He's setting it for LA time.
What is it?<eos> It's a bullet.<eos> That one's lucky.<eos> Want to know why?<eos> Because it doesn't have your name on it.
- Were they close?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> His name was Massimo.<eos> The whole city went to his funeral.<eos> He never talks about it, so I bet they were really close.
75 will be the new 20.<eos> I'm gonna have to show you how everything works.<eos> They'll have a program that'll download everything I need to know right into my brain.<eos> Well, you always wanted to learn how to play saxophone.<eos> Next time I see you, I'll play it for you.
After I'm finished.<eos> So, let's talk about this mistrial of Lloyd Garber's son.<eos> - You are aware of it?<eos> - I am.<eos> And how did you become aware of it?
♪ Died on Saturday ♪<eos> ♪ Buried on Sunday ♪<eos> If looks could burn, I do believe that house would be on fire.<eos> My father always said stay away from the big houses.<eos> The bigger the house, the smaller the hearts that live in it.
I am de-Kaminski-ing our apartment.<eos> Anything Josh has given me, I am throwing away.<eos> Oh, like this electric fork that automatically twirls your spaghetti up.<eos> I love that fork.<eos> Well, get over it! It's gone!
But did you know that sapphires are just rubies without chromium?<eos> No.<eos> But did you know that sapphire tent is the best one?<eos> No, why's that?<eos> Because you're in it.
But not my dad.<eos> He was happy.<eos> So I've been going through his stuff, trying to find something.<eos> And... he kept a diary.<eos> And you're in it.
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.<eos> Is something wrong, honey?<eos> No. I'm just thinking about the movie.<eos> About you and the movie.<eos> And what was it you loved so much? When you first saw it, I mean.
They received instructions by text from an untraceable phone.<eos> Never had direct contact with Zed.<eos> Yeah, that's what bothers me.<eos> Phone we confiscated from his prison cell was smuggled in a couple days ago.<eos> Yeah, and all we found was a single photo on it.
You know I'm the one who...<eos> Taking a human life is not insignificant, no matter what horrific things that person has done.<eos> Of course...<eos> And Felix, he rebuilt his life and now it's ruined, because I did a brilliant job winning him over, which got us nowhere.<eos> On top of that, the SCC has taken my phone, trawling through it looking for God knows what...
The field hockey stick may possibly be the murder weapon.<eos> - Possibly?<eos> - ‭Well, I can't match the shape of the stick to the wound pattern because the cranial damage was so severe.<eos> But the blood on the stick matches the victim's.<eos> Are his prints on it?
- Possibly?<eos> - ‭Well, I can't match the shape of the stick to the wound pattern because the cranial damage was so severe.<eos> But the blood on the stick matches the victim's.<eos> Are his prints on it?<eos> There are a lot of prints on it, but they all belong to Clair.
Penny only had two. - For a nationally recognized talent?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Something's off.<eos> Well, have you mentioned this girl's suicide - to Special Agent Davies?<eos> - He knew about it.
This will be great for your book.<eos> - You're writing a book?<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> - I've just written one chapter. - Oh.<eos> And am I in it?
I've known it for a long time, possibly longer than you.<eos> But promise me one thing.<eos> If you propose to her, or even when, don't give her that ring that you once gave me.<eos> That ring was your granny's before it was mine and Barbara's had so many second-hand things over the years... ..that atrocious swimsuit being merely the tip of a very dismal iceberg.<eos> I think she looks lovely in it.
- Okay, I think I've got the picture.<eos> - Okay. - We-we got this, right?<eos> - We got this.<eos> - Okay, bye.<eos> Hey, Mike, hope you're not allergic to poison oak, 'cause you're about to be sleeping in it.
Well, you look the part. Thank you.<eos> You know, a couple of meth heads knocked over a watch store in Long Beach.<eos> You heard about that? - No.<eos> These guys were so high, they drove the car straight through the window.<eos> Must have been living in this car, too, because it smelled like piss and vomit.
They're probably having breakfast on the Carl Vinson as we speak.<eos> I doubt it very much.<eos> What makes you think something's wrong?<eos> My gut.<eos> You don't last as long as I have without listening to it.
It's been radio silence!<eos> Yes, Tim, we're both fine, thank you for a...<eos> You promised.<eos> But the Pentagon is going to need a new relay server.<eos> And a new building to put it in.
What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.<eos> Well then, it's a good thing for me I found this little contraption in my satchel... forgot I brought it.
- You don't look like an idiot.<eos> - You don't either.<eos> You want to dance?<eos> No, I want a drink.<eos> Exploding head syndrome is very real and very common, but it's not about an actual exploding head.
You thinking the same thing I am, some kind of telepathy maybe?<eos> Not telepathy, Sebastian; Loretta called me.<eos> Oh, okay. Well, that would have been my second guess. But hey, look.<eos> Um, I've been analyzing the seal on that torch.<eos> Some kind of knife was used to tamper with it.
The other four we're working on identifying off their IP addresses.<eos> What we need from you is the name of the person you are sending information to.<eos> The person that wanted to hire these people to commit crimes.<eos> Right now, all we have is an anonymous e-mail account.<eos> What can you tell us about it?
"Aunt Jemima bitch"...<eos> That was the last thing that Sheila ever heard, and that, that is the rest of the world.<eos> It is all the same.<eos> It feeds on lies and hate, but here there is not that world.<eos> Here there is only this world, and I want you in it with me.
What's going on?<eos> My husband killed himself.<eos> I know.<eos> She gave me his journal...<eos> It was full of madness.
I don't think so.<eos> It was hard for her, obviously, but she would always regret not doing it.<eos> So, how long were you in the system?<eos> That obvious?<eos> To someone who spends 80 hours a week working in it, yeah.
Seems like our time together is less and less.<eos> I'm working 6 days a week, 10 hours a day since my husband passed.<eos> I never thought I'd have to give up so much just to keep my daughter close.<eos> You know, I don't always like to think of my time apart from Riley as "given up."<eos> I like to think of it as an opportunity to inspire.
Outside of the usual drama, she read your journal.<eos> - My journal?<eos> - No.<eos> Yours.<eos> Jesus: And what you said in it about Mama.
I-If I still feared your father, yeah.<eos> Your name is on the poster. We announced you.<eos> Check out this house that's for sale.<eos> I drive by it every day on my way to the office.<eos> It is the most normal, unremarkable house I've ever seen in my life, and I desperately want to live in it with you.
No. A drink maybe.<eos> So I saw the Senate torture report today.<eos> Somebody gave it to me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Think you're in it.
Yo. Jerk.<eos> Felt good seeing your kid, thanks to me?<eos> You grateful or what?<eos> Why is your ringtone so tacky?<eos> What's wrong with it?
I'd say the odds are against that.<eos> He said it was like she was having a seizure.<eos> Maybe there was something in the cake.<eos> - The cake? - It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.<eos> - Could've been something in it.
Have you found someone to rent Tom's room yet?<eos> Oh, God, they're so far from moving out.<eos> They're not good at doing "things".<eos> You'd better bloody get onto it.<eos> Yes, it's just that Tom's still in it.
And here comes May in the Ferrari LaFerrari.<eos> Concentrating.<eos> Concentrating.<eos> Oh-oh!<eos> That bloody car is trying to kill me, and I'm not even in it.
- Let me get this right.<eos> At our track, there's trees, animals, moisture, electricity, a house, and an unexploded bomb?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like I said, it's the most dangerous track in the world.<eos> Honestly, it makes Imola look like a duvet. Honestly.
The jig?<eos> That's right. It's up.<eos> You almost got away with it, too.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This house and everything in it, and how it's all for your benefit.
On May 22, the U.S. military is conducting a massive so-called "training exercise," code name "Jade Helm," that involves ferrying all the government elite into deep, underground bunkers as "a drill."<eos> So?<eos> So that's exactly what you do when there's a nuclear annihilation on the horizon.<eos> And mark my words, I'm gonna fight my way up into that bunker...<eos> I'm gonna be all up in it.
Will you let me?<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> What is it?<eos> Her power mechanism seemed loose when I turned her off.<eos> Like someone's tampered with it.
He´s all right.<eos> How was the lecture?<eos> It was good.<eos> That´s it? That´s all you got?<eos> Tell us about it.
Nothing will penetrate it.<eos> No electronics, no GPS, no telemetry of any kind in the 21st or the future.<eos> So we're invisible to the faction right now.<eos> And to the director.<eos> It won't be able to send a messenger or consciousness here, let alone itself.
What do you mean "the next guy"?<eos> We both know I'll be back.<eos> Oh, come on, Walt.<eos> I just washed my car.<eos> Now you're putting your big ol' greasy fingerprints all over it.
Thanks.<eos> SRB-54.<eos> What is that?<eos> A room in the basement.<eos> Okay. Why are we talking about it?
I hate the name Jackie.<eos> The only person who calls me that is him.<eos> The patient states that Jackie is daring and extroverted.<eos> How was the lecture?<eos> Tell us about it.
Ebony?<eos> Don't even get me started on ebony.<eos> When I see ebony, all I want to do is put my hands all over it.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - I want to live in it. I want to smack it and hit it, rub it down. I just want to eat it.
By whoever did this.<eos> After that accident...<eos> My life changed, Al.<eos> That tunnel they talk about?<eos> I was in it.
Ishmael, Cain, Lot-- they all got to be in the story.<eos> How do you know about the show?<eos> We're part of the United States. We get TV.<eos> They're making a new show.<eos> I'm gonna be on it.
I don't think he's gonna answer.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Sebastian's phone.<eos> There's blood on it.
If you were Sally, you would have never met Harry.<eos> If he wants me to meet him at the airport, he's gonna have to come out and ask me.<eos> He wants you to meet him.<eos> He's just speaking in the language of romance.<eos> Which you don't understand 'cause it doesn't have any burps in it.
2024 budget window.<eos> Defer for later pay.<eos> Oh, here, I've got it.<eos> Good.<eos> Good. - What does it say?
We're both grown adults-- we've been far more intimate than this.<eos> If you don't want to snuggle, fine-- but we're not building a pillow wall.<eos> Okay, well, I am sorry.<eos> I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night.<eos> And no offense, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.
So I'm looking for a kid named Chris, okay?<eos> He's got dark hair, from Milwaukee...<eos> Guys, I'm not a cop.<eos> I'm a firefighter.<eos> I-I've recovered his backpack, and it's got meds in it...
Then you have the power from the engine, which feels, well, old-fashioned.<eos> Proper.<eos> I'm surprised it doesn't have carburettors.<eos> I love this thing very much.<eos> And what I love most of all is that it's not a test bed.
I haven't got a face on it.<eos> It's just the bones.<eos> So as Granny gets older, does the family sit around planning a new little hatchback?<eos> Now, I hadn't thought of people.<eos> There's not a lot of dignity in it, is there?
Shit! Now I've got cramp!<eos> That was...<eos> That was a brilliant idea, but never mind, because erm...<eos> I have a perfect Christmas present here.<eos> You control this with your mobile phone and your face comes on it.
Oh, dear.<eos> Did you modify the battery as well?<eos> Oh... - It's obviously not charging up.<eos> - No.<eos> Because I didn't modify it.
Agh!<eos> What is this Star Trek special effect we've arrived in?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I am swimming through dust.<eos> I'm actually swimming in it.
I'm getting some funny feedback over the comm in here, MacGyver.<eos> Are you getting the same thing out there?<eos> Damn.<eos> Just stepped on a pressure plate detonator here.<eos> I'm gonna... have to disarm it while I'm on it.
I have sifted through much trash in my tenure, but I have never sifted through these babies.<eos> Birthed from a plastic processor.<eos> All plastic is separated, compacted and transported to the base for recycling.<eos> Yep.<eos> Except one disk had more than plastic in it.
I'm going stir crazy.<eos> Well, too bad.<eos> Now take your pill.<eos> I don't like methylprednisolone.<eos> Uh, it makes me jumpy.
I have what?<eos> My god, our kid is so freaking cute, I can't stand it.<eos> Kara Whitney's funeral is tomorrow, the woman from the fire.<eos> I was thinking about driving by there.<eos> Not to be a part of it or anything, just to...
The hack, the drone, the arrest, none of it makes sense.<eos> So, why don't you start and tell us about the coordinates you wanted us to bomb?<eos> Who is the new girl?<eos> They point to a silo in Kansas.<eos> - What's in it?
What's gonna go wrong now?<eos> HONDO: Stop kissing my treasure!<eos> HONDO: It's mine because I saw it first!<eos> No!<eos> I saw this ship first, so I get first claim on anything in it!
Really?<eos> And she left anyway?<eos> Very funny. Come on.<eos> Ezra's wrist com?<eos> I need you to put a tracker on it without him knowing.
And it almost killed you.<eos> Are you really willing to let the same thing happen to those astronauts?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> You know I built the time machine, more than Mason ever did.<eos> So if Rittenhouse gets her hands on it, with what they're planning to do with it, that's on me.
What is your name?<eos> Hamish Stegner.<eos> You did it!<eos> - All you got to do is, uh...<eos> - _ think about something calm, like, um... like light rain, or the infinite size of the universe, and your tiny little miniscule part in it.
So, make yourself an alternate breakfast.<eos> We should have Joaquin Pereya's murder solved by the time you get dressed.<eos> We get that you never expected anyone to connect you to these murders, but... it still would have been a good idea not to keep so much evidence in your apartment.<eos> Our search turned up building plans, travel receipts and this coded log book that Mr. Holmes here cracked in no time.<eos> I mean, it's really quite easy to break a cipher if you know what it's going to say.
What the...?<eos> Her face!<eos> Did you...?<eos> And that bridge!<eos> There were troll markings on it.
In a world such as this, the most precious thing a man can find is loyalty.<eos> I know how loyal you are to your friend and how loyal he is to you.<eos> I admire that kind of loyalty.<eos> What do you think about this club, Felix?<eos> What do I think of it?
Lucky you had a plan B to fall back on.<eos> There's nothing wrong with a suit and tie.<eos> I keep telling my son, it pays the rent.<eos> It's a good thing I have a suit and a tie then.<eos> I can put it on Monday morning if you like.
I like to make money.<eos> Alright...<eos> Let me put it this way....<eos> I'm standing in front of a burning house,<eos> And I'm offering you fire insurance on it
But... it'll never leave you.<eos> Why were you okay with taking the chapel down?<eos> I know why John was. I mean...<eos> - he's not religious, but...<eos> - That church... it was only holy because of what you brought to it.
And he really is a vulgar, fat little chap.<eos> Any opportunity to pass on obscenity, he will fart it through.<eos> Sublimated sexual frustration.<eos> He can be very crude about women.<eos> He can't do the sex, so he'll talk it.
Oh god.<eos> Is that glutinous?<eos> Glutinous aren't liquid, so.<eos> Soya sauce is a liquid.<eos> And it has gluten in it.
Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.<eos> The Scouts are a huge success.<eos> Ma'am, look, it won't cost you anything.<eos> A droid downstairs was written off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.<eos> Let me install this on it.
Holy shit!<eos> No freaking way.<eos> KIDS.<eos> Stay away from this house at 276 Pelton Street.<eos> And stay away from the men who live inside it.
It's pretty decent.<eos> There are a few things in life I don't compromise on.<eos> No, I don't get the impression you compromise on much ever.<eos> Try not to.<eos> But the world's a pretty messed-up place, and I still gotta live in it.
When can he?<eos> We'll announce the ship date in the next eight to 10 weeks.<eos> Alsop's not talking about the ship date.<eos> He wants to know when he can get one to play with.<eos> We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop, and we want to get a machine into his hands so he can tell his subscribers about it.
All right, just a few more blocks.<eos> We're almost to our new house!<eos> Step on it, daddy!<eos> Why don't we just live in this smelly car?<eos> We've already been in it forever.
150 jumps yesterday.<eos> Give it up, no breaks.<eos> Wait, I thought you said pogo sticks are for pussies.<eos> -You said what about a pogo stick?<eos> -Um... You said the pogo stick was a dick, and only a pussy would need to jump up and down on it over and over.
You lose your sense of who you are.<eos> You can't find a way out.<eos> That's because there is no way out anymore.<eos> You come across the old church...<eos> You know it was built in the thirties to ward off evil, so maybe it will keep you safe.
Daddy!<eos> Plankton?<eos> Plankton!<eos> I just had the craziest dream!<eos> And you were in it!
You didn't take a look for yourself?<eos> Of course I did. But the file was encrypted.<eos> And why would I lie to you?<eos> So that I would lie to Hunt.<eos> But he wouldn't have stolen it if he knew what it was. And you wouldn't have helped him.
For a while.<eos> - His first cowboy hat.<eos> - That is so cute!<eos> Never took it off.<eos> He ate in it. He slept in it.
You're too good for me, and I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're not going to.<eos> Now, the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I'm wearing a funny costume today.<eos> But the thing is that's out of respect for the uniform.<eos> You don't go shopping in it. You don't go down to the pub in it, even though you think you might pull in it.
Whenever there's a tragedy...<eos> It's always so hard on the survivors.<eos> And I don't just mean the families.<eos> I mean the people who were involved... who could've just as easily not made it.<eos> Not only do you have this pain and loss, but... but you can get a... guilt that comes with it.

If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.<eos> If anyone tried to sell it, they'd be arrested on the spot.<eos> Yes, well, that is where the story gets interesting, you see.<eos> The Duchess pops up again in France in 1943, looted from some sealed room in an unpronounceable chateau by the jerrys.<eos> Hermann Goering was said to have been obsessed with the painting, and there are rumors that he inscribed on it the codes to his numbered Swiss bank account.
Show him.<eos> Well, that's very pretty. All it needs is a giant, golden key ring.<eos> It's the Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You told me about it as a child.
I am.<eos> I'm going to play with Aaron now, he's my friend.<eos> Ok.<eos> When I was four I didn't even know about the world.<eos> And now me and Ma are going to live in it forever and ever.
You can't control something like that.<eos> I don't care who you are, how many weapons you have.<eos> All those things that went on... you don't get to play games with the Devil.<eos> And if you do, you damn sure don't get to make the rules.<eos> That type of evil... just thinking about it, talking about it.
- Henry.<eos> Have you ever heard... of a Glyptapanteles?<eos> What the fuck does this have to do with anything that--<eos> A horrifyingly... disingenuous wasp... that lays its eggs... into an unsuspecting caterpillar.<eos> And with the help of a poly-DNA virus, it can not only disable... the caterpillar's immune system, but it can control its motor skills... while its larvae feed on it.
I said get up, Mathis.<eos> I'm arresting you for the murder of Dickie Prince.<eos> How'd he die, Freddy?<eos> Knife.<eos> Had your prints on it.
One day, Malwade visited Kanheri caves to check on Riyaz.<eos> But instead, he saw that Parvez and I had tracked down this hideout by trailing Sudhakar Mishra.<eos> So, he attacked me...<eos> Since we'd seen Sudhakar Mishra coming there you killed him off too.<eos> You picked up the tiffin box from the tracks since it had Riyaz's fingerprints.
Carmen, this doesn't involve you, okay?<eos> Are you gonna waste time on an argument you'll lose or are you gonna get on that bike?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold there. You can't have my bike, B.<eos> Because I'm gonna be riding it.
Everything's about you and your career.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just do it.<eos> Write your stupid expose.<eos> Put me in it.
Okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> I promise.<eos> You must know by now this forest, it is very powerful.<eos> Uh-huh. I know it's very cold.
The glacier hotel is a shit. A piece of shit.<eos> It will never happen!<eos> It is not possible!<eos> The glacier... moves!<eos> You cannot build a hotel on it!
I haven't got any stamps.<eos> Would you do this for me?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Here is a dollar.<eos> Put the letter in your hat, don't let anybody see it, and don't tell anybody.
This guy's dick is off the charts.<eos> Yo, it's your man C-Rob coming at you live from outside the homeless shelter.<eos> We delivering turkeys to homeless people... because it's the giving season and they do be gobbling, you know what I mean?<eos> So if you're in the season of giving, hit me up @Chrisrob11, hashtag "selfless giving."<eos> And remember, it's not a good deed if no one knows about it.
She doesn't know Miss Guthrie.<eos> She did know me once.<eos> There's a good chance she might even recognize me.<eos> I would assume your plan would work best if she were cooperative in it, if she felt safe.<eos> There's no better way to ensure that than having me be a part of it.
If you were to get close to finding Jane Finn, then your lives would certainly be in danger.<eos> Now, I understand you were sent a fob watch, which I will pass on to my technicians on the third floor.<eos> Yes, Albert sent it to me.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's hope there are some fingerprints left on it.
If we're to stop any more men from joining his side, isn't it a prerequisite that we try and understand the thinking of the men who have already joined him?<eos> Sorry, are you asking my opinion?<eos> Oh. Well, uh...<eos> I suppose one could argue that it's simple fear.<eos> Their fear of losing the fort being greater than their fear of Vane remaining in it.
Can you please link that to my Etsy account?<eos> Yeah, what's your login?<eos> J, don't worry.<eos> The video's public, but my account's private.<eos> So, nobody knows who uploaded it, or who's in it.
We need to shut the story down.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> Thank you, Sue.<eos> Well, why haven't you shut it down?<eos> If you see a fire, do you look at the fire and put it out or do you just say, "I'm aware of it"?
We constantly come back to the same point.<eos> Argentina was the invader.<eos> The Argentine...<eos> I like the new vehicle.<eos> Not a mark on it.
Madame Wallenberg has been... more than generous.<eos> What about NARVIK-C?<eos> Narvik-C?<eos> Please, tell me you haven't discovered a new strain.<eos> But you and the board told me about it.
Two Mutts were killed in the attack on Stonehaven.<eos> Elena was almost killed protecting our Pack and everything down here.<eos> There is also the stench of bleach, as if you're trying to cover something up.<eos> Elena: There was a lot of carnage.<eos> We take pride in our home and everything in it.
Think of something your coven would never teach you.<eos> Maybe you could tell me something.<eos> I had a strange dream last night.<eos> A dream?<eos> Tell me about it.
The glacier hotel is a shit. A piece of shit.<eos> It will Never happen!<eos> It is not possible!<eos> The glacier... Moves!<eos> You cannot build a hotel on it!
And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.<eos> Wait, this says they only pay you a hundred bucks a week?<eos> Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day.<eos> Write, produce, and direct a TV show.<eos> Plus, I act in it, and I do sets, props, wardrobe.
And then we can celebrate by watching the movie.<eos> - There's a movie? - Yes.<eos> Travis has it on DVD.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It stars Gregory Peck.
This is the last straw!<eos> Zip your lips and go to bed<eos> Good heavens! I take a detour when I see a canal back home<eos> How will I cross this stream?<eos> This looks like it leads to hell
Put a Chennai's simcard in a cellphone... and keep it ready for use.<eos> The same number should be mentioned... in the verification mail as well.<eos> - Tap the Chennai Hospital landlines.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And if there's any call from Saudi... then it should be diverted to you first.
Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.<eos> He was a bad man.<eos> And you?<eos> I pushed my father's wheelchair down an elevator shaft, with him still in it.
I'm done with the public pool for the rest of the summer.<eos> Sure, no problem. Can you watch Amy and Gemma?<eos> - Swim sounds nice.<eos> Why you done with public pool?<eos> Someone shit in it?
Which is why what?<eos> What?<eos> Which is why I use a hammer to pound on the end of the knife.<eos> She was... she was... she was carrying the hammer.<eos> That's why her prints are all over it.
How did you get on this side of the fence? Through the tunnel.<eos> We crawled all the way.<eos> It's a straight tunnel. Tunnel?<eos> Where?<eos> He is standing on it.
- Yeah. We don't do low key very well.<eos> You'd better learn quick.<eos> We're on a tight leash here.<eos> So, we know all Li-Na was after was a notebook.<eos> And my little friend here wants to tell you all about it.
We're on a tight leash here.<eos> So, we know all Li-Na was after was a notebook.<eos> And my little friend here wants to tell you all about it.<eos> Don't you, Ivan?<eos> It was just symbols in it.
Where are you?<eos> I need you to give me some kind of marker so I can orient you on the map.<eos> Ground floor. I'm in a wide hallway.<eos> I see a blue tank up ahead.<eos> Okay, is it labeled with anything?
You need never see the house.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why on earth not?<eos> Because...<eos> I intend to live in it with another woman.
The only reason they would do something like that is if they felt threatened.<eos> That means we're getting close.<eos> It also means that if they have no problem killing their own people, then they'll have no problem killing us.<eos> Did you find anything on Metzger's hard drive?<eos> So you know about the hard drive, but you don't know what's on it?
Oh, it's okay.<eos> Uh, I've been up since 4:00.<eos> [Chuckles] Sleeping in one of these interview rooms<eos> - isn't all that relaxing. - [Chuckles]<eos> Uh, you know, I don't believe in past lives or ghosts or astrology, but this room... it, um, has a weird energy in it.
Then you'll be disappointed.<eos> When the storm passes, I'll return to Nanda Parbat.<eos> If Ra's finds out that you saved me, betrayed him...<eos> He's going to kill you. Don't waste your breath for worries on me.<eos> Your concern should be for your home, and what has become of it in your absence.
This rocking chair's amazing.<eos> Isn't it wonderful?<eos> It was my Great Grandma Maggie's.<eos> Every woman in my family has had it.<eos> I was rocked in it, my mother was rocked in it.
- Well, everyone's are ... kind of.<eos> The tendons connecting the foot to the leg are thin, so they dissolve and break away in the seawater.<eos> Another reason I hate the ocean.<eos> - What are the other reasons?<eos> - It's full of drunk guys peeing in it ...
Where's the knife?<eos> Is it in there?<eos> Wait. So the knife you and Caleb found was covered in blood?<eos> What, Mona's blood?<eos> Yeah, and any of our prints could have been on it.
He just got out of hospital an hour ago.<eos> He's one tough son of a bitch, I'll give you that.<eos> The triggerman did get away, but the Lieutenant was able to convince our Bulgarian friends here to give us access to all the cellular towers in the country.<eos> Drew?<eos> Yeah, I got a signal on the broker's phone, as long as he keeps the battery in it, I can track him anywhere.
Well let's say... let's say that there was no beatings.<eos> But you didn't have any friends either.<eos> Friends are fickle.<eos> So little Henry created his imaginary world.<eos> And when he grew up, he was able to trap people in it.
I have a license.<eos> It's my legal right.<eos> Forget it. I'm sorry. It's just...<eos> Someone threw a brick at my car...<eos> While I was in it.
Her name is Diana White.<eos> Alive last night and then... our existence is truly fleeting.<eos> All the more reason to follow one's true passions while you can.<eos> Emily, I picked up someone else's coat last night.<eos> And you won't believe what I found in it.
Yeah.<eos> This is getting weird.<eos> His buddy said that his chute didn't open.<eos> He's lucky he hit that tree before he hit the bus.<eos> Was there anybody in it?
So if I can help you for a change, I'm gonna want to be there for you.<eos> Just like you've been there for me all these years.<eos> Yep.<eos> You said Marcus had a big heist coming up?<eos> Do you know anything else about it?
Marge, he's not here.<eos> Oh, he's gone a-wanderin'.<eos> There you are.<eos> The world was a miracle to me.<eos> And one day I would record what I'd seen so that others could see it too. Before it was lost and gone forever.
Uh, for booze, pills?<eos> It's for people suffering from phobias.<eos> - You're joking.<eos> - Fear can be debilitating.<eos> It helps to talk to someone about it.
I-I don't know what you're talking ...<eos> No, I know you're keeping something from me.<eos> I don't know what it is, but here's what I do know.<eos> I know about the flash drive.<eos> I know Coulson doesn't know about it, but I bet he'd like to.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> You're on their side.<eos> It's not about sides... it's about the truth.<eos> Coulson left us with a mountain of lies, and the only way to understand his reasoning was inside that box.<eos> Honestly, I don't care what's in it.
And then, suddenly...<eos> it was like an ocean,<eos> - waves crashing against the shore.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> This stone... were there deep cavities carved into it?
I am not okay with you officiating his wedding.<eos> I hate hoagies.<eos> I hate all sandwiches made of mystery meat.<eos> And I hate golf.<eos> I hate everything about it.
They told me about the MRI as soon as I got back to your room.<eos> - I know how claustrophobic you are.<eos> - Where did you go?<eos> I went to the cafeteria to get pudding.<eos> Oh, my God, everyone was talking about it.
I hope you are.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're both excellent mothers.<eos> But perhaps we should get back to some--<eos> Congresswoman Sharp raised the issue of sexism earlier.<eos> Now, it is an important point, and we need to address it.
So now you understand why I didn't want you and Jamie together?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I totally get it now.<eos> So tell me about this kiss with Andy.<eos> What was so great about it?
~ Aunt Lucy said I had to.<eos> How's school?<eos> Tell me about the trial.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you think we're not going to mention it?
You've seen what he's capable of.<eos> Okay, but maybe going primal is the only way to stop him.<eos> All right, Alton's tumor allows him to overload brain waves, right?<eos> But a primal brain is much simpler.<eos> It has hardly any brain waves.
-l had no choice.<eos> You shouldn't have looked for me.<eos> You didn't want me to?<eos> ls my room empty?<eos> -No, it's still like it was.
Moloch used mirrors as portals between this world and purgatory.<eos> That painting could also act as such a doorway.<eos> Grant also had paint on his hands.<eos> Perhaps he disturbed the picture whilst restoring it.<eos> Somehow activating the cursed energy lying dormant within it.
After the pressure reaches 700, how long do we have until it explodes?<eos> Anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds, but there's no way to know for sure.<eos> You're better off walking away now.<eos> _<eos> Look, Red, you know that after Delhi, I'd do anything for you, but the truth is, you'd be lucky to get off this rig, and whatever your plan is, I'm not a part of it.
What if he's producing it, like, in his skin or glands?<eos> - Phosphorus.<eos> - Phosphorus, really?<eos> White phosphorus makes up 1% of the human body.<eos> It's in every cell, and it only needs 86 degrees before it ignites and burns like hell once it's exposed to oxygen, like... like a match.
- Yes?<eos> You've been served. What is this?<eos> That is my petition for divorce.<eos> Like I said, I'm starting a new chapter.<eos> And you're not in it.
I'm fairly certain this author's in Storybrooke.<eos> And if we want to enlist his help, we have to get there before the heroes do.<eos> How do you feel about kale salad?<eos> Like someone found someplace other than granny's for takeout.<eos> I'm fine with her grilled cheese, but I know it gets to you.
Not if it means being a goddamn snitch.<eos> Jesus Christ, don't be so self-righteous.<eos> At some point in our line of work, if you want to survive, this is what you do.<eos> Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
I helped you out once before.<eos> Maybe there is a way I can help you out again.<eos> At some point in our line of work, If you want to survive, - this is what you do.<eos> - Not me.<eos> I got a code, and it does not include turning on my people.
Kanan is on Governor Tarkin's Destroyer, the Sovereign.<eos> It's still here above Lothal, but it's scheduled to leave soon.<eos> - Where to?<eos> - The Mustafar system?<eos> I've never heard of it. Hera?
Looks like we've got blood on the hood ornament.<eos> That would confirm your theory that Ava had a run-in with the car.<eos> Got something else.<eos> She broke a heel.<eos> I think there's some residue on it.
Annie is going to reach down her shirt and pull out a laser bomb.<eos> I didn't write that, we didn't plan that.<eos> God made that happen.<eos> God made this movie, and it's dumb.<eos> And we're dumb for being in it.
Do you remember... oh, no, perhaps it was before your time... first Canadian tour, Toronto.<eos> What happened after he took off his coat?<eos> He started on the hat.<eos> Dunn's hat, Piccadilly, over a year ago.<eos> Down on the coat it went, and he jumped on it. He stomped on his hat.
Wherever it is, on the field, or on the scaffolding.<eos> Now, it is time for France to give you something in return.<eos> A home.<eos> It shall be known as "Les Invalides".<eos> It will host the finest medical facilities. Refectories, dormitories, church.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Go to the beginning of that incident.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Tell me about it.
To remove these blasphemers so completely that not even the stain of their memory is left behind.<eos> I just can't stop thinking about Stephen.<eos> Stop being such a man.<eos> What? You see the women at the funeral.<eos> They weep and they wail and they scream out their pain so the whole world knows about it.
Ah, Kenna.<eos> With death comes wisdom.<eos> What did I ever see in her?<eos> Well, it was her ass.<eos> You mentioned it many times.
Which is why I've decided to give her my name. Just my name-- no "MD" after it-- and put it together with hers on the next book.<eos> Kind of a renewal of our vows.<eos> And you think that's gonna make a difference?<eos> It's a little too late. You've pushed her too far, no?<eos> Well, in my experience, when the train is pulling out of the station and you're not on it, you run twice as fast and twice as hard to make sure it doesn't leave without you.
You know, I thought we had something special!<eos> Is that the file? Yeah, and it looks like your 2:00 a.m. hunch paid off.<eos> What were you doing up so late anyway?<eos> I was working on the case.<eos> Huh. Well, I don't know what Shana was looking to find in that report, but it refers to witness statements taken at the party where Shana's boyfriend, Jeff Whalen, died.
Even when I didn't think he could deceive me anymore...<eos> He found a way.<eos> Banishment was too good for that demon.<eos> We should have driven that dagger through his heart when we had the chance.<eos> Then your name would be written across it.

No, it is too dangerous for you.<eos> It would be impossible for you to get there on your own.<eos> Only the most privileged Mitanni know how to get there.<eos> What, a secret passage through the high desert?<eos> It's a myth, and I've heard it before.
You know, I could use one, but it can wait.<eos> I want to see the note.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Don't get too excited.<eos> It's pretty underwritten.
AUBREY: We know that you were gonna rob the check-cashing place with Connor.<eos> No.<eos> I've got no record.<eos> Check it out. I never helped with a robbery.<eos> Then maybe you killed him so you wouldn't have to go through with it.
Over the last 24 hours, your friend, Dr. Pryce, went on a Google rampage.<eos> Some videos of this drummer named Gene Krupa, but mostly about this place called Plum Island.<eos> Apparently, it's a government germ laboratory in the '40s.<eos> He found an old medical film and he watched it a bunch.<eos> What's on it?
I'm gonna need you Saturday night again.<eos> Babysitter?<eos> I think so.<eos> A date? My friend Kate's parents went through a divorce.<eos> She said her father only started to come out of it once he was dating again.
You've seen what he's capable of.<eos> Okay, but maybe going primal is the only way to stop him.<eos> All right, Alton's tumor allows him to overload brain waves, right?<eos> But a primal brain is much simpler.<eos> It has hardly any brain waves.
The document.<eos> I'm sick of KIM Il-sung's face!<eos> Damn cunning commies!<eos> What?<eos> What's it say?
They both met at a club.<eos> He used to study in America.<eos> He has his nose pierced. He wore a nose ring.<eos> How did he look?<eos> Look into Siya's computer, it's filled with his pictures.
He would say how grateful he was to all of us - for another good year.<eos> - Apparently, he finished your present just before he died and never told anyone.<eos> He was gonna give it to you today.<eos> A thumb drive?<eos> Yeah. And this is what is on it.
What's this?<eos> A diamond glass-cutter.<eos> You can see into theirs?<eos> Seen their pool?<eos> They let you use it?
I'm going to leave you two alone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Since the drug bust, we're broke... so broke that we had to rent out our house to Felix's family.<eos> So we're basically homeless, only we own a home.<eos> We just can't afford to live in it.
I mean, I've been on that cream for like a month.<eos> Max, what is the ninth rule of the Lamborghini Club?<eos> No red drinks in the car.<eos> Here's my number one rule:<eos> If you're going to make me sleep in it, I am going to drink in it.
I don't see why we have to just sit here.<eos> We can't drive it.<eos> My dad said if anything happens to it, we'll be responsible.<eos> What could possibly happen on a weed run to deep Tijuana?<eos> You know, I wish this car never came, and I wish I never sat in it.
Yes, that's for sure!<eos> You're lying to me.<eos> So you don't believe me anymore?<eos> I just want to make sense of it.<eos> You said you've never touched the knife and yet we find your fingerprints on it.
I just wanted to get out of the room.<eos> She was really bumming me out.<eos> Ah, geez.<eos> I thought writing another hit song would be easier.<eos> Well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it.
It's gonna be okay.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> I found this necklace.<eos> It was Lucy's.<eos> I remember asking her about it, 'cause it's got this thumbprint on it.
would equate to an explosion powerful enough to vaporize the entire ship.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> Dead bodies, hacked stasis pods, now this.<eos> It's a whole lotta things going wrong in this ship.<eos> Almost like someone's been tampering with it, isn't that right, tech monkey?
We pray that all our new believers receive the Holy Spirit.<eos> We enter God's kingdom by repentance and faith by accepting him in our lives.<eos> When you return to Rome this document says you'll be considered for the position of praetor to the treasury.<eos> Considered?<eos> And my seal on it says you will get the job.
They have a sex room and a love pond, a whole bunch of nasty skanks roaming the halls.<eos> Just disgusting.<eos> I kicked one of his housemates in the dick if that makes you feel any better.<eos> You knew about this Funhouse?<eos> I heard about it a couple times.
Just disgusting.<eos> I kicked one of his housemates in the dick if that makes you feel any better.<eos> You knew about this Funhouse?<eos> I heard about it a couple times.<eos> - The girls, they talk about it.
Don't run from him no more.<eos> Fight him like Comanches.<eos> You stay close... so close he can feel your breath.<eos> You let him know you're always there and he can't touch you.<eos> Sooner or later, he's gonna show you his tender underbelly, and when he does, you take that sword of yours and you sink it to the hilt.
We're the law in Texas.<eos> All I see is a bunch of damn gun thugs.<eos> I once got a little loose with the surveys in an Arkansas land scheme myself.<eos> It's silver.<eos> My horse belonged to a man in Veracruz, but I look better on it than he did.
They don't know, but it's spreading.<eos> - You need to...<eos> - No, people are killing.<eos> You need to spend less time online, okay?<eos> If... if there's a problem, we're gonna know about it.
And it's gathering steam with more and more people jumping aboard every day.<eos> I use my computer right now for mostly word processing.<eos> I use it for solar evaluation programs.<eos> We put our entire accounting system on it.<eos> The wife can use it to store recipes.
Faces fascinate me.<eos> The mask we show to the world.<eos> I find that clients invariably hope a procedure won't just change their looks, but change who they are in some deeper way.<eos> Never does.<eos> Any more than painting a house can change the things that happen inside of it.
~ It's nought for dead, one for alive.<eos> I was the only one of the three of us who got a patient to a hospital alive, and that matters!<eos> Yes, and that's why you got that point.<eos> So you're saying that because I only get one point,<eos> That means I now lose to you, even though your van was slow, expensive, its brakes caught fire every time you tried to slow down, and it killed everybody who got into the back of it.
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me.<eos> What about this?<eos> It's backpack-y, kind of like something Delia would have.<eos> That was found on the bus that, uh, crashed into you yesterday.<eos> Your friend's body was found inside it.
- Mom! I won't spare you!<eos> Mom can't save you. - Mom! Come here.<eos> - Mom! No!<eos> Come here.<eos> - Anju. We spent so much to send you on a nature camp. You didn't tell us about it.
Thank you, everybody, thank you!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you, and welcome.<eos> Welcome to what is, for the first time in many years, an actual car show.<eos> We've packed it with many facts and a lot of informations.
You know, you make a difference, too.<eos> Yeah, not like her.<eos> Okay. What?<eos> She's got a second phone.<eos> Anything on it?
Where is it?<eos> [ringing] Baby, why is my phone in your bra?<eos> Shh, please!<eos> It's your secret phone!<eos> I know all about it.
Or perhaps the sailor was merely a thief.<eos> - I don't think so, Father.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He was wearing the coat with the diamonds and the coins sewn in it.<eos> He took the coat, but we don't know if he knew there was anything in it.
Come on.<eos> Next page.<eos> I brought you some more fuel.<eos> Oh, well, thank you.<eos> Been working on this secret project for a while now, which... Wouldn't be so secret if you shared it with someone.
Stay in the car.<eos> Al, I got to make a phone call.<eos> Jay, hey, listen.<eos> I got this poker chip here.<eos> It's got what I think is a sketch of the original Arabian Kingdom Casino on it.
Now let's just see what we got here for a second.<eos> - [groans]<eos> - Goddamn it. Were you trying to use this to --<eos> Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this?<eos> How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies?
You know what, Tom?<eos> Try to think of a place that is nice and calm and relaxing.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> Oh, god. Oh, god. - Listen to my voice.<eos> Why don't you describe it to me?
I knew we should've poured the Tequila in your bellybutton.<eos> That's why they have these systems in place.<eos> Whoa!<eos> I heard an expensive car pull out.<eos> I figured you were in it.
Come on.<eos> Well, it's over.<eos> As soon as they cut that ribbon, Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses.<eos> There's only one way out of this.<eos> And you called it earlier.
People do enough damage without help from the afterlife.<eos> Put it on her tab.<eos> That was his office.<eos> The room you're staying in, 64.<eos> If this building has a heart, it's black as the ace of spades, and you're sleeping in it.
He has children.<eos> The boy is very beautiful.<eos> Like I said, he just needs a little push.<eos> A nudge into the darkest places of his heart.<eos> He needs to hate the whole world and everything in it.
We're gonna need to move quickly on this.<eos> What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Why do you even need this notebook?<eos> - What's in it?
I'm done waiting.<eos> I want to make him suffer.<eos> Let's just take a beat and be smart about this.<eos> Someone has my laptop.<eos> They're using it to watch Max.
Come on!<eos> - I love his face!<eos> - Come on, Woody!<eos> - You have to touch the table.<eos> - Don't put your head on it.
At least 800 sold every year.<eos> Impossible to trace.<eos> Hands are stopped at 5:37.<eos> Ticking clock without the ticking.<eos> Has it been dusted for prints? ERIC: That's happening now.
I guess.<eos> Which ones?<eos> Lasers, rail guns.<eos> Was she ever alone with your laptop?<eos> Maybe, but there's nothing on it. The...
Anyone interested in bikes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Um...<eos> Erm... do you ride it?
I'm ever so sorry to interrupt, but we're dealing with a bit of an emergency.<eos> I've got a willing bloke downstairs and no place to, um... ply my trade.<eos> - What about your room?<eos> - Well, I gave that to Gigi.<eos> She's been at it for hours with that handsome fellow in from the coast.
- When I get time.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Yeah, it's our car.<eos> - Who drove it?
~ I told you already. I'm not an investigator.<eos> ~ All right.<eos> Let's not abandon hope quite so fast, Woodie.<eos> The next problem is the coat.<eos> The police examined it at the vicarage and said they were hairs on it and the vicar's wife said there were none.
I want full immunity in exchange for the information I'm about to give you.<eos> I can't guarantee anything till I know what we're talking about.<eos> But now she's won in the court of public opinion.<eos> Amanda Clarke has dug a grave for me tonight.<eos> But I won't let her put you in it.
Scarf looks good.<eos> You noticed.<eos> Respect.<eos> This is Tandy Land, and he knows it.<eos> He smells the spray, he's trying to tip-toe through it.
- In fact, I didn't publish books.<eos> - No?<eos> I made brochures, leaflets for promotional campaigns.<eos> I see.<eos> I made a book for the Orthodox Church, but it didn't earn us much.
Hello.<eos> You're drunk.<eos> I sense judgment, which is odd.<eos> You're the one that wanted me to own a bar.<eos> I wanted you to own it, Damon, not pass out on it every night.
I love you, Dad!<eos> I love you, too, sweetheart!<eos> None of the past matters!<eos> Oh, yeah, I seen that pudding billboard.<eos> It's that one that says "CBS Outdoor Advertising" on it.
Ishu, it's got a serious issue.<eos> - Really?<eos> So now?<eos> - Do one thing Give me your address.<eos> I'll fix your scooter and enter your house to deliver it Huh!
So go talk to her...and our stuff.<eos> Dude... where'smycar.<eos> There...<eos> Where's my car?<eos> Patrick, it had drugs worth millions.
- Sit down with me, buddy.<eos> - I'm sitting down, man.<eos> What's going on? What's all this stuff?<eos> Well, I'm supposed to be doing a live TV show. - Okay. - Live Christmas special.<eos> - Are you in it?
I don't have the slightest idea where the Machine's located.<eos> Not in your brain. In your head.<eos> Your direct line to the Machine.<eos> The cochlear implant.<eos> Your little girlfriend told us all about it.
I'm trying to keep these people alive, okay?<eos> There's a 30-foot trench in the middle of Vega.<eos> There... the ruptured water mains.<eos> The power's out.<eos> I mean, lucky for us the nuclear reactor's on our side and there's not a scratch on it.
That's okay.<eos> So how you been?<eos> Uh, yeah, okay.<eos> Did you hear anything about this new film?<eos> What do you know about it?
I'd like some volunteers to clean Mrs Cobb's cottage for the Carsons.<eos> His Lordship wants it done before they get back.<eos> I don't mind. I could go up with the maids in the morning.<eos> It's a shame they can't live in their own home.<eos> The builders are still in it.
She must have colleagues.<eos> Other scientists who are familiar with her research.<eos> I'll get on that.<eos> Meanwhile, research the virus.<eos> Find out everything you can about it.
It's him!<eos> Then why did you give me Boyce?<eos> Guilt.<eos> She's received the report on my misconduct case.<eos> I don't know what it says yet, but for once she's backing me on this.
Good. So use it.<eos> I can't, which is why I need your help.<eos> - I need you...<eos> - Why can't you use it?<eos> I just need you to come forward with what you know, testify, and then they can subpoena SOC, find out what I've got and use it in court.
Why can't I go out and play?<eos> Just because you have to remain inside doesn't mean we can't play, okay?<eos> The perfect way to cultivate your imagination, perhaps even your talent.<eos> At your age, the world is a blank slate.<eos> We must find the best way for you to inscribe your truth on it.
Five murders, that's a lot of years in the pokey.<eos> Do what you gotta do.<eos> Major, we are doing our civic duty here.<eos> We played a big part in creating this problem.<eos> And we are gonna be very aggressive in cleaning it up.
A man with nothing to lose.<eos> Okay, listen, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.<eos> I've already lost a friend, and it may sound strange, but to get her back, I need to understand the properties of an ancient monolith.<eos> Now, I've learned it was buried in the Yucatan after being dragged around the earth for a few hundred years.<eos> And originally found with it, were artifacts...
We're downloading what the Game Vex captured at Scott Barrett's house.<eos> We know he was playing an instructional golf video game on his Game Vex before he was attacked.<eos> Okay, there's our killer.<eos> The two are struggling over what looks like a golf club.<eos> In the struggle it looks like the golf club struck Scott's phone after it collided with his head.
Miss Cartazzo.<eos> Told you your car wouldn't be ready until next week.<eos> I have a check.<eos> Figured I'd pay in advance. Oh.<eos> Has my phone number on it, if you need me.
Local Knowledge...<eos> Forget the way you usually look at the world.<eos> This street's going to be hiding in plain sight. - 22, 23...<eos> - If you see something unusual or notable, dismiss it. Just keep walking.<eos> But if there's a bit of London so unremarkable that you don't even think about it... stop.
Well, the only reason I'm putting up with any of this is because I know how much this album means to you.<eos> Well, it's exciting.<eos> It's the first thing I've ever produced.<eos> - Hi, Markus.<eos> - I love the idea of you having a song on it.
My teeth feel funny.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Well?<eos> They look fine. Phew!<eos> Now, as you all know, next week is our competition night, but remember, it's a celebration of all your hard work and not a competition. Then, maybe change the name?
Remember when we used to talk structure?<eos> Back when we were gonna be the Powell brothers?<eos> Now, I'm still a terrible driver, so better buckle up.<eos> We always said the perfect ending had to be both surprising and inevitable.<eos> I want you to be both shocked by the horror but anticipating it, too.
What was the emergency?<eos> Did one of you suddenly get ill or injured?<eos> Uh, I-I don't know.<eos> I'm... I'm not sure.<eos> You had an emergency healthcare crisis two months ago and you don't remember it?
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.<eos> - Third floor.<eos> Would you like to go to dinner with--<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it.
- I'll meet...<eos> - Juliana... I'll meet you there, Frank.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll meet you there.<eos> That bus leaves in less than an hour.<eos> And I'll be on it.
Valerie: Oscar and his stupid pranks.<eos> So lily's still carrying a torch for some moldy, old corpse, hmm?<eos> Lily is determined to reunite Julian's body with his lost soul, but in order to do that, she needs the Phoenix stone.<eos> Phoenix stone, huh?<eos> Never heard of it.
If it could keep you alive, that's what we do.<eos> We have to.<eos> Do we?<eos> Being here, I've realized what my final chapter is.<eos> We're in it.
I asked: "What happened?"<eos> She said she dreamed... that a woman had come and cut her hair.<eos> Marina, I left my job to hear about Anja's dream?<eos> And yesterday, there was the teapot.<eos> She said she saw the reflection of a woman on it.
I mention people like Gloria Estefan,<eos> Alejandro Fernández and Oprah Winfrey because they happen to be... dear friends of mine.<eos> Then how'd you and Britney meet? It was years ago.<eos> I went to an awards show wearing a look Britney liked.<eos> She expressed her admiration for the outfit, and I generously went home to change, allowing her to debut it in a video!
Anybody need anything?<eos> Oh, I-I got a chain saw in my shed.<eos> Yeah! Yeah, chain saw!<eos> And, uh, is it okay with you if Tim uses your shower?<eos> 'Cause he's already in it, so... just... thank you.
Oh, yes.<eos> Uh, well, a commercial fishing boat, uh, discovered our victim. floating in the ocean.<eos> A GSW to the chest.<eos> His kayak was recovered by the coast guard.<eos> But unfortunately none of his salvage items were in it.
Cap, this doesn't fall on you.<eos> His dad may seem like Mr. Generosity when he's building hospitals and buying congressmen, but you know what happened to that guy on the zoning board who tried to block his last skyscraper?<eos> Neither does anybody else.<eos> You read the M.E. report?<eos> Yeah. It doesn't even come close to adding up.
I swear, it wasn't damaged when we returned it.<eos> Are they saying that it was damaged?<eos> A student was murdered at a Pac West frat party.<eos> We have reason to believe the killer wore a Captain Wozzles costume.<eos> Wow, I didn't see any blood on it or anything.
I'm sorry, I thought you said that you loved the show. Oh, I did not.<eos> - Are you kidding me, Lacoste?<eos> - Where is this even coming from?<eos> Guys, it's okay. She didn't like the show.<eos> But out of curiosity, Ms. Lacoste, what exactly didn't you like about it?
I've sent Irisa and Datak back to the pods.<eos> You need to follow them once you've closed the vents.<eos> Walk over to the panel.<eos> Uh... Oh! Yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, I got it. I'm here.
How 'bout you're not safe? From me.<eos> Yeah, you better run. 'Cause Phil Miller's on his way to Malibu, and you can't stop him.<eos> I told you not to step foot in Malibu.<eos> Carol, I just had a bad dream.<eos> Tell me all about it.
Now you're talking to me?<eos> Because I'm kinda busy.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> And, yes, they're new.<eos> The color is called "Sorry, Beyonce" and I might be in love with it.
Seti digs 40 feet beneath the temple and finds the tomb of Osiris.<eos> For hundreds of years, no such tomb was known to exist in Abydos.<eos> But at the turn of the 20th century, archaeologists digging behind the temple of Seti I unearthed a massive underground structure consisting of granite and sandstone blocks, some weighing nearly 60 tons.<eos> The Osirion, as it is now known, was found buried under 40 feet of silt.<eos> And ancient astronaut theorists are convinced that further excavations would reveal something much more profound hidden within it.
-He said he was going home.<eos> -Home?<eos> He's been living alone a long time.<eos> By the way, how did he receive the letter?<eos> There was no postmark on it.
It's started.<eos> Brannigan.<eos> Sir, we've had the call.<eos> Dance is going into his end game.<eos> This jar Dance has, do we know what it is yet?
Hall director?<eos> I'm sorry. I'll go to bed.<eos> Had a nightmare?<eos> Yes...<eos> What was it about?
The same address as all the shelf babies, Freeside Street.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> Something's not adding up.<eos> Python murdered two people to get this chip.<eos> What was on it that was so important he'd be willing to kill?
Why are you all smiles?<eos> - Is the deal done? - Of course.<eos> You got paid 15 million just to deliver a car from Chennai?<eos> Yes.<eos> So it's not just the car There must have been something in it?
We figured that was the end of it until Cooley wound up dead.<eos> Did... did you just say "quantum"?<eos> It's in the basement of the comp sci building.<eos> Top secret.<eos> Only Professor Cooley and maybe two other school officials knew about it.
So, you're gonna need to lose the hat.<eos> He, uh, won't take it off.<eos> I tried.<eos> Look, my late wife gave me this hat.<eos> You know, I caught 22 prize-winning bluegills in it!
He won't daily.<eos> There's a good chance his meeting with Ali is taking place right now.<eos> Walter, what are you doing?<eos> Hacking into Madaky's laptop.<eos> The odds are the software that programs his door lock is on it.
How does it all work exactly?<eos> I am provided the tickets to fly here.<eos> I am given a small package.<eos> A balloon.<eos> It has uncut stones in it.
Something's wrong.<eos> There's nothing anyone could have done.<eos> It just... the baby never had a chance.<eos> In my mind, we were gonna be this family.<eos> We would find a house together, fix it up together, grow old in it together, and we would... but that's not the way that it worked out.
So I tried.<eos> Seemed to work once they helped me.<eos> Was that help a chat button?<eos> I suppose.<eos> I typed my words in a box, the customer service person typed back, told me how to click, where to click, even took over the mouse and controlled it for me.
Whoa, Erica!<eos> A chair!<eos> I love it!<eos> It's just what I wanted!<eos> Look at this... I can sit in it! And I can put things on it or in it!
I'm behind the townhouses down the block.<eos> You guys should get over here.<eos> You found the dig site?<eos> Not just that.<eos> There's someone digging in it right now.
I do.<eos> I left that phone... in my jacket pocket.<eos> When I took my jacket from the cloakroom at the end of the evening, it wasn't there.<eos> It was gone.<eos> There were no-one else's fingerprints on it.
Just like Danny's hoodie.<eos> Sebastian got a hit on the fingerprint on the backpack.<eos> It's not good.<eos> Danny explain something to me.<eos> You didn't know the backpack was in your car how are your prints on it?
But they came up and represented that the only DNA found on that key was Steven Avery's.<eos> That is patently ridiculous.<eos> Any crevices, anything else in that key would have retained her DNA.<eos> And for them to be able to say "only Steven's DNA is on this"<eos> indicates to me that that key was scrubbed clean and his DNA was placed on it.
So in other words, if you don't know where Culhane's DNA came from, you might not know where Halbach's DNA came from.<eos> [Buting] That's right.<eos> Remember now, this bullet wasn't even found in November.<eos> This bullet was found under suspicious circumstances to begin with.<eos> So she's testing it four months after all the other... after she does all these other tests.
Did that just happen?<eos> A decade of my life in this office in search of the truth.<eos> And all the time, I was being led by my nose through a dark alley to a dead end, exactly as they planned.<eos> The poster has become so iconic, it's really the heart of the show.<eos> Because it doesn't say, "I believe." It says, "I want to believe."
I what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, I remember.<eos> We were fooling in the kitchen, and he was wearing his grandmother's apron.<eos> You know, little boys, playing around. He just looked so pretty in it.
They say to us, to all of us, all colors and creeds, that we must do this.<eos> They say to us that it is unacceptable for more than 50% of Selma to be Negro and yet less than 2% of Negroes here being able to vote and determine their own destiny as human beings.<eos> They say to us that the local white leadership use their power to keep us away from the ballot box and keep us voiceless.<eos> As long as I am unable to exercise my constitutional right to vote, I do not have command of my own life.<eos> I cannot determine my own destiny for it is determined for me by people who would rather see me suffer than succeed.
But hey, what do you expect from a bunch of boys with low AGCT scores?<eos> We've got a panzer dug in, it's about two kilometers up this road.<eos> They've got at least a dozen foot soldiers with them.<eos> Simms, get the CP on the horn.<eos> On it.
I own it.<eos> The directions in the will had the house in town on this road.<eos> There's no sign a town was ever here.<eos> This baby is sailing, man.<eos> You did a lot of work on it.
But if this is about eminent domain or any of that state bullshit...<eos> It's a geodesic survey.<eos> We don't care about this house.<eos> Make no mistake.<eos> I've been swinging a hammer in it since before you were born.
- Of course.<eos> - And? It's well-crafted.<eos> But?<eos> It was a little dry, as though you were holding back.<eos> - I couldn't find you in it.
We must secure the existence of our people, and a future for white children.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm not what you see.<eos> That fire's been dyin' a long time.<eos> There's no life in it any more.
This was a mistake.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> I know you think I didn't reach my potential.<eos> No, son. I don't think you did.<eos> Your first film was wonderful and entertaining. We could see ourselves in it.
That should I ever be in a position of influence, I would have it in me to use it for good.<eos> Now, some of you ask, why did I leave Hollywood?<eos> Well...<eos> I left because... because I fell in love with a charming prince.<eos> A man who has inspired me to see the world with enough compassion that I may want to do something about all of the unfair things that I see in it.
It wouldn't have been necessary.<eos> No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.<eos> We were happy here.<eos> For a little while.<eos> To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You look like him.<eos> This is the main dojo floor.<eos> The only time you'll be on it is when you're cleaning it.
I don't think I ever should have qualified for that loan, and Carl talked me into that loan.<eos> Can I ask your name?<eos> - Billy.<eos> - Okay, Billy.<eos> We are in the middle of a very tight fiscal knot, and it's squeezing, and you are right in the middle of it.
He was really amazing in that one movie - Um, what is it called?<eos> He plays a Soviet defector with, like, missile codes and shit.<eos> - Um, do you know?<eos> - No, I don't know.<eos> Never heard of it. He's great in it.
Socks.<eos> She thought her feet might get cold in the stirrups.<eos> Smart.<eos> Lara's grandmother knit this blanket.<eos> She brought her mother home from the hospital in it.
Not while talking, while verbally abusing us.<eos> Tell me what did my department's bike have to do with your quarrel? My Purse!<eos> My purse!<eos> Has someone seen my purse?<eos> It contains Rs. 5000!
Isn't it obvious? I mean you read his journal.<eos> He broke the cardinal rule.<eos> Don't fuck with time.<eos> Jasper, please, take his hat off.<eos> It's my thinking cap.
This is a list of all the information our commandos in Germany have found so far.<eos> One thing is wrong, there is not a single item related to the Nazi nuclear project.<eos> The Americans haven't heard anything either.<eos> This question is becoming an obsession to you, isn't it?<eos> There's no Nazi programme, or we would've heard about it.
One of our witnesses saw that tattoo on the back of the shooter's hand.<eos> Ah, which witness is that?<eos> And we've recovered the gun you dumped about four blocks away from the court.<eos> Not me.<eos> Got your prints on it, Edward.
I'll see you later.<eos> Excuse me, Owen?<eos> You prosecuted Crown against Gianopolous, 2011.<eos> Yeah, murder case.<eos> Small-time drug dealer fired into a car, claimed he didn't know anyone was in it.
The short-haired gentleman who goes by Mr. Turk,<eos> Randall, and the man in black.<eos> They are what's left of your mutiny.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I had a long conversation with Mr. Turk about it this afternoon.
It really is.<eos> Awesome.<eos> - By the way, we got a horse.<eos> - Really?<eos> Can I ride it now?
Oh, yeah. There's rattlers, there's serpents, there's cobrinhas, which are tiny little cobras.<eos> Fuck, no! Okay, no, it's just a sign that was blowing in the wind. That was a bad example.<eos> But shit is fucking crazy out here, man. Look around. What town are you in?<eos> Shit, I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Uh... Okay, there's a sign. It says...
It's been Christmas Day for at least a week now.<eos> How can it only be two o'clock?<eos> I'm in agony.<eos> Mikey, is this your laptop?<eos> Upon which depends the security of the free world, yes, and you've got potatoes on it!
I may.<eos> Just going around casting spells on people.<eos> ♪ To end this misery ♪ Are you happy?<eos> I think I might have misunderstood happiness, you know?<eos> I dream about it and stuff, and...
Just going around casting spells on people.<eos> ♪ To end this misery ♪ Are you happy?<eos> I think I might have misunderstood happiness, you know?<eos> I dream about it and stuff, and...<eos> I sing about it sometimes, but... I don't...
We were more together than we had ever been.<eos> Danny do you remember that day on the train the man with the box?<eos> Do you remember looking inside the box?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was in it?
- on my last test.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, you know, he never lashed out at me or anything like that.<eos> No.<eos> And my desk broke because I was leaning on it.
The motion sensor has activated.<eos> If any of us move, the grenade<eos> - will detonate.<eos> - How powerful?<eos> It'll certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it.
- Even if that heart is damaged?<eos> - Especially if it's damaged.<eos> Matthew, I want to talk frankly.<eos> - Please.<eos> - This other life you led... is your heart still with it... or is your heart with the one who walked through it by your side?
Either way, I'm getting to that diverter.<eos> You of all people, Scott, should know what happens to a lone wolf.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> He's got a pack.<eos> And Theo's not in it.
Better for who?<eos> Ellipses.<eos> Don't do this, Maddy.<eos> Ellipses.<eos> Look, my life is better with you in it.
I wish you'd told me you were into model trains.<eos> I would have brought Lance Jr. with me.<eos> I am not playing with trains, Daisy.<eos> I am making a map.<eos> Since Booth couldn't track the drag marks, I customized an old Jeffersonian display so it can match the particulates found in Ian's injuries to specific locations in the woods.
Eat your chips.<eos> (Dad.)<eos> You been here all night?<eos> Oh, that footage.<eos> I thought perhaps it'd been tampered with, so I had to look at it myself,
You're telling me everything that I need to learn.<eos> I'm just not getting it. I...<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> It's... I've been... I've been letting you coast by on your raw talent, which you have a lot of, but teaching... it's a lot more than just doing something and expecting you to follow.<eos> It's about inspiring and empowering you to use your gifts to succeed on your own.
It's extraordinary, isn't it?<eos> Each you came here feeling lost and trapped by a narrative written by others.<eos> And in four days... just four days... you found the vision to design the blueprint for your better self.<eos> And this is just the beginning.<eos> From now on, when you look at your life and the people in it, things will look different.
Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.<eos> Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.<eos> I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?<eos> Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.<eos> If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.
Okay.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> This city just makes you feel alive, doesn't it?<eos> You know, I don't really have the best memories of it, but...
My wife.<eos> And when you're away, who do I defer to?<eos> Do I wait for you t' return an' fill the void you've left behind?<eos> Or do I step into it?<eos> Live my life as if you be not in it.
I'm sure we will.<eos> Hey, it's Marcel, leave a message.<eos> Marcel... you're gonna want to call me back.<eos> I saw something today and it's something that I've seen before.<eos> Look, I tell you, this city... everyone in it is in danger.
Where is this machine for the king?<eos> We've got a lot of work to do to get the ship ready for winter.<eos> Sector 4... the crack in the outer wall, we need to patch it up.<eos> Start by repairing the damaged panels.<eos> Sector 5... we need to get that tree out of the hole and seal it up.
John, fetch me a hammer.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Where's the box?<eos> - What box?<eos> There was one and a half grand in it.
Yes, you made that quite clear.<eos> Cosmogony is the study of the origins of the cosmos.<eos> And Empedocles, he was the first known person to ask the simple question, what is light?<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> He believed that Aphrodite, a woman... in case you didn't know... formed the human eye and lit a fire in it, allowing us to see.
Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> You sure?<eos> Hank Ryder.<eos> That name should mean something to you.<eos> Okay, I've never heard of it, so here's what we're gonna do.
But in the end she made a choice.<eos> And what of me, Father?<eos> Was I a soldier, too?<eos> Do you recognize this box?<eos> I spent 200 years in it.
It isn't just my brother. It's my whole family, my father.<eos> Vernon?<eos> Sit down.<eos> My dad doesn't think we're safe.<eos> He helped make this place, and he doesn't think it's safe.
To me.<eos> I look like a guy who needs a stove?<eos> You know how in baseball they say... "So-and-so's a utility player."<eos> The stove is the utility player of the modern home.<eos> You know, you can cook with it...
Listen to me, I love you.<eos> And we're going to have a baby.<eos> - Yeah, well, that's the thing.<eos> - Ma'am! How cool is that?<eos> Hmm? I get to build him a crib and a rocking horse, and a whole friggin' house to put it all in.
Being a Witness does not grant one special powers or skills.<eos> A Witness is no different from any other person.<eos> Except that they're a monster magnet.<eos> Well, d... not exactly.<eos> In the war between good and evil, the Witnesses will always be drawn to the site of conflict in order to... witness it.
That was Emily.<eos> About Reid?<eos> She got some intel on the progress on the Mexican murder investigation.<eos> They found the murder weapon.<eos> It has Reid's blood and prints on it.
Initially, I have to admit, the CIA Director, I thought, to be honest with you, that he was, um, sort of picking my brain to find out what I knew, as opposed to really not knowing.<eos> And by the time the three-hour meeting was over it was quite clear that the emperor had no clothes.<eos> He later denied the meeting. It happened for a brief...<eos> This is a wonderful thing.<eos> Now, people say, "How could he write this letter?" Basically saying that that this meeting, and what I said about it was a distortion of the truth.
It would have gone on and on.<eos> - Years and years of investigation. - I don't care.<eos> You should have talked to me, instead of making a last-minute decision like this.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.<eos> But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
Wait, are you saying he put the gun...<eos> You don't need an interrogation to prove that he's guilty.<eos> You, uh, just need a pair of these.<eos> God, we thank you for the life that you give us.<eos> It is full of work and of responsibility, of sorrow and of joy.
Why isn't it working?<eos> Why is he silent?<eos> Ugh! Get up.<eos> This spell that made the heir disappear?<eos> There are holes in it.
- Thought you didn't have service.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Just press play.<eos> - Jules, I've already seen this video.<eos> I'm still trying to forget it.
That's what most people say.<eos> She was accused of witchcraft after some of the children in town said that she'd taken blood from them.<eos> There wasn't much of a trial system back then.<eos> Townspeople took her out to these woods, tied her to a tree and left her to die of exposure.<eos> In the spring they went back to look for her body but there was no trace of it.
Three hours south of Tel Aviv.<eos> Felix seems to love it.<eos> He loves the sea.<eos> Me, I do not like it much myself.<eos> There is something idiotic about it.
You sell me out? You sell me out?<eos> No, NO, I did not give you up! I didn't say anything.<eos> It went wrong, But I busted out, but I stole a car.<eos> It was one of Hagen's cars drop cars, okay?<eos> It had lots of in it, Lots-a-money!
I hope you don't feel like I've wasted your time.<eos> Here's my number.<eos> When the gate shuts, my work and the city remain on the other side of the wall that surrounds our hidden home.<eos> Lisa and I fell in love with this house when we were first married.<eos> There's something about it surviving hundreds of years, like a secret.
- You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I think there's someone we need to talk to.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Well, she wanted that box so she must know something about it.
What are you doing?<eos> Escaping!<eos> The heart!<eos> Forget it!<eos> You'll never get it back!
The parts needed to fix this machine, they don't make it anymore.<eos> So consequently, we were unable to fix it.<eos> The other guy said it'd be ready by today.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> We tried to get it ready by today, but we couldn't even find the manufacturer's name anywhere on this machine, to even order the parts.
Shredder mutated them with the help of Baxter Stockman.<eos> That's actually who you need to go see.<eos> Funny you should mention Dr. Stockman because we just finished analyzing some security footage from TCRI that he gave us.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Guess who's on it.
I thought cleanliness was close to Godliness.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> I'd have liked to have travelled more, I suppose.<eos> But work got in the way?<eos> I love nursing, but, yes, it leaves little time for a private life.
How about a little bit of respect?<eos> What?<eos> That's from the one that blew you?<eos> In my car?<eos> How about respecting my car... by not driving around with some slut in it.
Just don't tell your mom, okay?<eos> We'll have to leave before they get back.<eos> We have to go up there for the newspapers anyway.<eos> Do Mom and Kyle still have the wagon?<eos> Yeah, but there's something wrong with it.
Who told you you'd be fine?<eos> Something happened in the tree that I didn't tell you about.<eos> As soon as I hit, everything went black.<eos> And I stepped right out of my body.<eos> But it was kind of weird because... Because I could see my body, but I wasn't in it.
Hello, Officer Pinkney.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> Your fingerprints were on it.
Go see.<eos> What do you want...<eos> No, Jake.<eos> There's a tree out there.<eos> Carve something in it.
My fourth wife, Constance... a sweet girl, bright, but she had her notions.<eos> Cricket in the house means good luck, a moth in the house, bad.<eos> And the bed...<eos> Jesus, the bed.<eos> No hats on it, no brooms near it, nor any clothes in it that were worn outdoors.
Your uncle's gonna see that as a liability.<eos> Harlee, you got anything to add?<eos> You're members of the New York City Police Department.<eos> Do right by your city.<eos> God knows the last thing it needs is another dirty cop.
Dirty cops killing a fellow officer.<eos> Are you saying they'd cover this up?<eos> The mayor and his police chief?<eos> They'll do whatever they can to impede this investigation until after the election.<eos> And then they'll make sure it goes away quietly.
I can put in the word if you want it.<eos> Is there s-- is there some reason I can't keep doing my job?<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I heard about a position, so I presented it.
And improvisation, yes.<eos> Out of repetition comes variation.<eos> And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying.<eos> They were on the verge of some kind of change.<eos> You have to know my chief concern has always been the well-being of this park and the people in it.
- President is en route.<eos> - 15 minutes.<eos> So what's your play?<eos> I thought you had an invitation.<eos> It didn't say anything about a plus one.
I'm okay. I'm okay.<eos> The house was by a mine.<eos> The cages were in a basement, in a room that... wasn't that much bigger than this.<eos> My bed was against the wall.<eos> Sometimes, I slept on top of it. Sometimes, I slept underneath it.
He wrote a spec script. He asked me to read it.<eos> It was awful.<eos> - Like, even the margins were...<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> ...four inches wide for some reason, but he had that idea in it.
It has been hard to get out here to you, Mother.<eos> You put me out here.<eos> The tree had medicine, you said.<eos> It had spirit.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to live in it.
"Gentleman"?<eos> Indians travel with the livestock.<eos> That's the goddamn law here, friend.<eos> Before you speak another word... I ask you to consider this... How valuable is your life?<eos> Do you hold it dear?
They probably studied their chances and hesitated about what to do, but with no faith in justice, what was left for them?<eos> Watch their enemy and wait.<eos> All they could do was watch you.<eos> Tomás Garrido became your shadow.<eos> He found a vacant room opposite your building and took it over anonymously.
It's terrible.<eos> prosecutor from Luleå.<eos> She's Kahina Zadi from Fench police.<eos> I'm investigating the murders.<eos> I'm sure you heard about it.
A man ought to keep a tight leash on his wife, Mr. Bennett!<eos> Word to the wise!<eos> No, trust me, I told him. If he gets that car, he has to get me a pool.<eos> We have an entire lake, 50 feet from the backyard.<eos> Yeah, but it's cold, and there's a lot of fish in it, and I'm gentle.
But you've never been my brother.<eos> And now... - now you're nothing to me.<eos> - Marcellus, just give me one last chance to prove you wrong.<eos> Come with me.<eos> The serum... there's no trace of it in her.
Clifton, I need a drink!<eos> I was clean for 30 days in that goddamn hospital.<eos> I want a drink right now.<eos> There you are, and please do my bed.<eos> You've been in it all day.
You know what?<eos> Have at it.<eos> This got anything to do with that meeting you had yesterday?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know about it.
No, the problem is she gobbling' up all my real estate like some hateful Monopoly shoe.<eos> I am always the car in Monopoly.<eos> You know...<eos> I never did shit to you except claim what was rightfully mine.<eos> They gave me a bed, I slept in it.
Then...<eos> I wouldn't... feel this.<eos> - Guess what.<eos> - What?<eos> This time, when my life flashes before my eyes... you'll be in it.
- It's true.<eos> But you need to be a monster to defeat Hitler.<eos> - Did Jock give you my box?<eos> - He did, sir.<eos> What's in it?
I-I was lucky to be able to task the rangers to accompany Dr. Vickers.<eos> Have you located him?<eos> The Phase Two animal he was chasing killed him and the rangers, too.<eos> Were you able to secure the animal?<eos> No, there was no sign of it by the time we arrived.
Hey, I need you to run some evidence for me.<eos> Okay, but you do know that the French pretty much invented forensic science, right?<eos> Yeah. Give or take a hundred years.<eos> I'm just saying that they've got a pretty good crime lab right there in Paris.<eos> So the Coroner was able to recover a piece of the murder weapon from Bianca's body, and I know that they're gonna mass-spec the you-know-what out of it. But there is this weird piece of this symbol on it.
I believe you've come to know Mr Compeyson quite well.<eos> Well enough, from the few times our paths have crossed.<eos> Why?<eos> Can I trust his interest in the brewery is genuine?<eos> He's told me... he sees it as a great opportunity.
More like the Costco region.<eos> Maria!<eos> That's me. Why are these forks not laid out correctly?<eos> Maria, forks, now.<eos> Glad you like that outfit, 'cause you're gonna be buried in it.
We are in the same row as Jay-Z and Beyoncé!<eos> And they brought Blue Ivy!<eos> I can't believe I'm seeing our royal family!<eos> I can't believe I'm touching the court with my feet!<eos> Maybe I should just drag my butt across it like a dog.
How you doing? It was nice to hear from you, too.<eos> It wasn't nice hearing from you, and I want to know why you're doing it-- the real reason.<eos> I see your new home is a work in progress.<eos> What colors are you considering?<eos> You know, I usually like people to enter my apartment after I'm in it.
- Thanks.<eos> Your wife?<eos> This is Takashi, who's replacing me.<eos> Where shall we have this photo?<eos> Can Hotaru be in it too?
We have everything we need here.<eos> You guys know the odds outside, and Denver's hundreds of miles away.<eos> You're seriously gonna stay here?<eos> Yeah, damn right.<eos> There's no way anybody would find this place unless they knew about it.
- Yeah, I guess so.<eos> See ya.<eos> - All right.<eos> Cool, man.<eos> Richard, e... even though it's the last board meeting and... and essentially meaningless, thank you for letting me be a part of it. It's an honor.
Smells kind of like burnt rubber, right?<eos> It's a little something my team came up with.<eos> We're generating a stasis field.<eos> It keeps you from shifting out of that body or using your powers.<eos> So I hope you like that body, J'onn J'onzz, because you're gonna be in it until I'm done with you.
His body was found wrapped in a blanket.<eos> Why are you telling me?<eos> Aren't you missing one?<eos> Not that I've noticed.<eos> Had your initials on it.
You say that now.<eos> But it's the losing that haunts us.<eos> This can't happen.<eos> You know why I left this place?<eos> 'Cause I hated everything about it.
I might have an idea.<eos> Uh, he got this picture from Connor.<eos> What kind of picture?<eos> Okay!<eos> Um, what, he told you about it?
92% of divorce attorneys said that their clients have used spyware on their spouse.<eos> And guess who bought Alison a fitness band for Christmas.<eos> Her husband.<eos> Just because<eos> Dylan bought her the device doesn't mean he put the spyware on it.
Emil shut off the security system so he could get proof that you and your contractor were shacking up.<eos> Why would he care about me and Rob? Because if he could proof that you two were shacking up, he wouldn't have to pay you alimony.<eos> Booth...<eos> I found the iron.<eos> It's got blood on it.
I mean, I've kind of got it all together.<eos> So, her giving Victoria the house is her way of saying that you're a better person?<eos> Hey, I didn't say that. Mom did.<eos> All right, come on, don't...<eos> Okay. I never really thought I liked karaoke, but I am really good at it.
- Thanks.<eos> You, uh... It's nice to see you.<eos> - You know, I think about you sometimes.<eos> I called you but you never called me back and I-<eos> I remember you telling me about this place and I loved hearing you talk about it.
There was only one.<eos> He was weaker and hungrier than me.<eos> No, I remember it well.<eos> ♪ Alden swung it off his back ♪ ♪ But as he slew the mighty beast ♪<eos> ♪ Three more leapt from out the night to rend his flesh ♪ ♪ And on it feast
You know, a man on the cutting edge of science deserved better than that.<eos> You were right, Duane.<eos> I do have promise. In fact, I kick ass.<eos> - Hey. Checking to see if you're okay, and I know I'm not supposed to ask today, but... is that Duane?<eos> Uh-huh. Alex, you... You can't steal a body and practice procedures on it.
Now, in the two days he was in town, he went to the same house five times.<eos> Including the night he died.<eos> Now, we went over there ourselves.<eos> The owner wasn't there, but we noticed a spiked metal fence.<eos> And we found dried blood on it.
Chris's wife must be so relieved.<eos> Yeah, she was.<eos> Selfishly, I'm kind of glad the doctors have an ace up their sleeve, even if there are only a few doses.<eos> Did you watch the Boko Haram video?<eos> Weird that Bangote's not in it.
- around Columbia Road.<eos> - Focus on sections of the system that were built in the early 20th century.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - I had an appointment.<eos> I will tell you about it later, because the mass spectrometer indicates that the clothes you brought me from the drug runner were dusted with clay, shale, iron... all by-products of the soft mud process, which is how bricks were made before steam machinery.
Visit was personal in nature.<eos> CPO Dodd was on leave.<eos> According to your report, the incident happened several days ago.<eos> As an estimate, yes.<eos> But news of it didn't reach us until yesterday.
- Yes, well...<eos> At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.<eos> _<eos> We just stole a box.<eos> I don't even know what was inside of it.
- And miss this?<eos> I'm still a member of this distinguished club, Mellie.<eos> Just a non-voting one.<eos> You know, there is one way out of this.<eos> Nobody's mentioned it yet, but I'm sure we're all thinking it.
Dead.<eos> Was it poisonous?<eos> I can't tell. But it's crushed to a pulp - I can tell that.<eos> I'd give your shoe a rinse.<eos> It may have some venom on it... or some backbone.
- Yes, really.<eos> We're not gonna send Lucifer into battle inside Cass.<eos> What if he doesn't make it?<eos> Dean, it's a strong vessel.<eos> It's held Cass for years, and we know what he's been through.
I went and got this file to make sure you weren't lying.<eos> Well, what happened in here?<eos> It looks like there was a fight.<eos> Oh, it was me.<eos> I was done with this place the minute you all stepped foot in it.
I mean, where the fuck is it?<eos> Right? Hey, excuse me!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi. We're looking for High Trail Lake.<eos> Oh, you're... you're standing in it.
The lock was found broken later...<eos> We don't know where he is at this point.<eos> Usually the murder locations are either slums or streets...<eos> But this murder happened in a low income neighborhood.<eos> Victim's family picture has him in it.
That place you mentioned.<eos> The, uh, Man... Man-something.<eos> Manzinar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about it?
Are you a part of this thing?<eos> You should know. It's your party.<eos> Can I offer you a mask?<eos> No, you can give me an explanation.<eos> Uh, who sent out that invite and why was my name on it?
There's definitely... there's just definitely oak.<eos> - Dan?<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Um, is there oak in this?<eos> No, this one's made entirely in steel, but it does get a really nice sense of structure from the terroir of McLaren Vale.
I get to sing in my church.<eos> Really?<eos> Wow. You like church?<eos> Yeah, you're supposed to love church.<eos> Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.
- What does that even mean?<eos> Let's hear what the children have to say.<eos> - I'm gonna wet the bed to get their attention.<eos> - Not listening...<eos> You're the one sleeping in it.
Good.<eos> It'snotyourrighttoplayin this league, it's your privilege.<eos> I'll tell you right now, there's a ton of guys out there who are bigger, faster, stronger than all of you, and they're working retail right now.<eos> It's actually not hard to succeed in this league, guys.<eos> All you gotta really do... don't screw up off the field and outwork everybody else on it. I talked about privilege earlier.
Are there more sustainable materials that could be used instead?<eos> Well, to find out, each of us bought a Land Rover Discovery.<eos> We then removed its metal body and replaced it with whatever we thought was the best solution for the future of the planet.<eos> The meeting point was in Wales, and I was the first to arrive, in a car made from mud.<eos> But, sadly, before I had the chance to tell you anything about it, Hammond arrived.
-No!<eos> -Why not?<eos> -Because it's going green!<eos> It's just a bit of door.<eos> You can see where the flies have been on it.
It's got a working ATM.<eos> - I'll take it.<eos> - Hey, that's the spirit!<eos> Okay, now who wants the third floor?<eos> It's got some issues with exposed wires and cubicles and office chairs, but it does look out over a Chili's.
Okay, let's break it down, so we can score it.<eos> One, how long have they been annoying?<eos> The first light was installed 150 years ago in London, and it was gas-powered.<eos> I mean, how annoying could it be if there was only one?<eos> Well, a month later it exploded, injuring the policemen operating it. So, I'd say pretty annoying.
Friday you thought it was Saturday.<eos> Monday you forgot to put your clock forward. Oh, everybody does that.<eos> Week last Wednesday it seems you had an appointment with the Dalai Lama.<eos> Yeah, I showed you the picture.<eos> That had Michael Jackson in it as well.
It's pretty chilly.<eos> Best if you stay here.<eos> What's that for?<eos> -See that field?<eos> -Yeah? In it, there's a large bull whose testicles I need to examine.
Oh, I'm... unmarked, tractionless, a waking nightmare of snow blindness.<eos> - You, uh...?<eos> - Yes. No, yeah, please.<eos> That would be helpful.<eos> I mean, don't get me wrong, I find moonlight as romantic as the next guy, but kiss my ass if I'm expected to drive by it.
Well, we found it.<eos> You did?<eos> Somebody set it on fire.<eos> - Someone set her car on fire?<eos> - Was she in it?
Trust fund billionaire.<eos> Said he wanted to use it for his supercar.<eos> Now, see, this? This, I like.<eos> Billionaire, supercar...<eos> What makes it so super?
Just wanna talk to you about my job.<eos> You see your new office?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But...<eos> Well, what's it like?
- Listen, Starlight Express.<eos> I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique, 0.0 for choice of victim.<eos> I'm a lawyer.<eos> Furthermore, does this steaming pile of crap scream "payday" to you, huh?<eos> The only way that entire car is worth 500 bucks is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.
Why of course?<eos> He's basically a psychiatric nurse.<eos> He can't write his novel under those conditions.<eos> I think their marriage, like, fell apart after the second child.<eos> - And now he's trapped in it.
Yes, I've, um, heard of them.<eos> You'll find them useful friends.<eos> What's this about, Mr Payne?<eos> This is about a gambling casino in Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.<eos> - I'm not familiar with it.
What's this about, Mr Payne?<eos> This is about a gambling casino in Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.<eos> - I'm not familiar with it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, you'll be shocked to learn that you earned £24,000 from it in the last three months.
There was a place they referred to.<eos> Whittington was on the telephone.<eos> I think they thought I was knocked out.<eos> Go on.<eos> They called it the Sandcastle.
The Open Air Club?<eos> You've heard of it?<eos> You haven't heard of it?<eos> Dude, that venue's legendary.<eos> Our dad used to talk about it all the time.
Thanks.<eos> Keep it.<eos> - I won't tell no one.<eos> - This is what I reckon about Australia.<eos> If you look around you, we've got people living in Australia and coming here from all around the world and I look upon it as one of those big old camp oven stews, and in that big old stew, we've got peas, corn, carrots and celery and a few beans,
No. - I think if there are three whole flower trucks parked outside the White House, I would know about it.<eos> (WHISPERS) Go. Outside, go. Count the flower trucks.<eos> - Did you find me an office?<eos> - No, but I scouted you this chair.<eos> And if you stand on it just like so, you can get Wi-Fi.
Still doesn't taste any better. -(LAUGHS)<eos> Can I get a short stack made without cow's milk?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You don't want milk or...<eos> No, it makes me gassy.
The judge reads the paper, blocks his eye line, a quick switch.<eos> If someone sits next to you on a bench, you often turn away.<eos> I'm sure the police are way ahead of us on all this.<eos> The murder of Spangler remained a hot tabloid issue.<eos> Abe often talked about it and what a blessing it was for that woman, now that the judge was gone.
You don't have to do anything, I promise.<eos> God damn it, Abe.<eos> But I had no intention of giving myself up.<eos> A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me.<eos> I got no enjoyment out of it, no pleasure.
- Explosion in the basement.<eos> Oh God...<eos> Griff.<eos> Glove up.<eos> And get this body out of here, I don't want anyone tripping on it
What other traditions are you against, Leslie? Baseball?<eos> Hugging your children?<eos> How much did that haircut cost?<eos> None of your business. And thank you for noticing.<eos> My desk was right here. Sitting right on top of it this whole time.
Shh. Gail, I'd really like to contact your family...<eos> No. At least let them know where you are and that you're alright.<eos> No.<eos> What about your boyfriend?<eos> When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it.
I promise you I am here for you and your baby, and everything's going to be alright.<eos> Nothing happens in obstetrics and gynaecology without my say-so.<eos> Those were my exact words.<eos> It was an emergency.<eos> When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it.
I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.<eos> Go ahead, make fun.<eos> You can't embarrass . I've got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.<eos> Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon:<eos> "I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you're not in it."
But I know Lamar always trusted you to handle his more... sensitive matters.<eos> The woman who lives at that address, believes she's under surveillance.<eos> I need to know if she's right.<eos> And if there's an investigation going on,<eos> I want to know everything about it... completely off the record.
I'm psyched about the space.<eos> I don't think that you really should be.<eos> You don't want to live in our backyard.<eos> Why?<eos> Because somebody was buried in it.
Perhaps I would!<eos> I envy you.<eos> My charmed life?<eos> Is it not charmed?<eos> Has it not comfort and purpose and certainty?
You got in before.<eos> Only because it was scheduled for decontamination.<eos> That won't work again so soon.<eos> We don't need the radio.<eos> We need the wires that run into it.
Mr. Skokie, this is Chuck Palmer with the city of Modesto Robbery/Homicide Division.<eos> You're going to see a table with a body on it.
You son of a bitch!<eos> What do you have on her?<eos> A tape!<eos> There's a tape, okay?<eos> What's on it?
What about Tony?<eos> What... what about raising Tony?<eos> Oh, he was always by my side.<eos> And, uh... later on, he started to pitch in, and then we thought it would be good to have something to do together, you know, so I-I got this old car,<eos> and we worked on it all the time.
What do you mean?<eos> Horses have often been used in works of art to depict powerful forces of nature.<eos> You said were trying to break this stallion to gain its loyalty and servitude.<eos> That's what Jack's been trying to do to me.<eos> In one of her rants, Aife once said she wanted to kill her baby because someone put something evil inside it.
We'll get you kids squared away.<eos> You can call me Mr. Janson.<eos> I run this place.<eos> For us it is a sanctuary, safe from the horrors of the outside world.<eos> You all should think of it as a way station.
I'll plan conversation.<eos> Spanish, perhaps?<eos> Prince Annaba.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I will depend on it.
Even if what you are is a 16-year-old boy in a man's body.<eos> So what he was doing the night he died, that was nothing new.<eos> Well, I made a point of not knowing the details, but if he died licking coke off the tits of a groupie while her friend gave him a rim job, then, yes, that was nothing new for my husband.<eos> No, marriage is hard.<eos> Forty years of it, nearly impossible.
He saw the traveler bleeding in the road and he stopped to aid him without thinking of the circumstance or the difficulty it might bring him.<eos> The Samaritan tended to the traveler's wounds, applying oil and wine.<eos> And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he... continued on his journey.<eos> He did this simply because the traveler was his neighbor.<eos> He loved his city and all the people in it.
I don't know.<eos> Whole city's going doolally around us.<eos> I mean, there's a bloody war on the streets... and you're in here worrying about your poor old dad.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> If your father had a secret life, which I hasten to add, he didn't, I'd know about it, wouldn't I?
No, it is raw and authentic, and it is...<eos> Full of drugs.<eos> How about for tonight you forget you're a cop?<eos> Can I be a cop again?<eos> They say memories make us who we are, that the past defines us, but we can't forget to grow, evolve, because sometimes a memory can be so powerful that we get stuck in it, frozen in a moment.
I'm going back.<eos> I've left word with my men.<eos> You step one foot in that castle and everyone you love gets the ax.<eos> No more games, Galavant.<eos> Listen, Gareth, I'm moved, but I've made my bed, and for once, I should lie in it.
Millie! You bellowed, my darling?<eos> Yeah, do me a favor, would you?<eos> Would you climb up here and get my shoe box for me?<eos> What on earth for?<eos> Because it's got my Reggie Jackson baseball in it, and I want to give it to my great-grandson when he's born. Zeek.
No, it'll be totally weird.<eos> So none of these stickers or flyers actually have the name of your magazine on them?<eos> Nope.<eos> Just the question and the logo.<eos> We have to get people talking about the magazine without actually knowing anything about it.
Just a courtesy call.<eos> Your primary account is overdrawn, so I thought you might want to transfer some funds from your other account.<eos> I have another account?<eos> You do.<eos> How much is in it?
No... Nooo!<eos> - Givens.<eos> - Tell me you're on your way in.<eos> Yeah. You got a locator in my car?<eos> You'll find a kid in it I picked up.
Witches draw their magic from different sources.<eos> Katrina's power flows from nature. Others from fire, from the moon and the stars.<eos> Blood magic is one of the dark arts, a destructive form of sorcery that taps into base, evil forces.<eos> Ah. Here's the security cam footage from the auction house.<eos> I thought it proved inconclusive.
You can't know, Margaret. You can't know what it's like-- what it feels like, standing on the other side of that door...<eos> I know exactly what it feels like, far more than either of you.<eos> I spent years and years and years worried that I was going to lose the man that I loved to something going on behind some door.<eos> 30 years.<eos> My life imploded into a million messy pieces, and I tried to scrape it back together as best I could until I found Graham. I fell in love with Graham on my own.
Try not to blow your cover, Henry.<eos> Let me make some phone calls.<eos> Check his travel record.<eos> And this symposium.<eos> Make sure it was real and that he attended.
Black for me. Milk for you.<eos> You remembered how I like it!<eos> Yes, with milk.<eos> It's just one ingredient.<eos> And you remembered it.
I'm hungry.<eos> Anyone else hungry?<eos> It's me.<eos> Crazy couple of weeks, huh?<eos> You, uh... turned my world upside down, and then you gave it a good shake.
Well, It's going to take more than cleaning the floors to retain it, I'm afraid.<eos> The facility and the real estate are scheduled to go into receivership at the end of this week unless... you watch this.<eos> What is this?<eos> A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.<eos> What's on it?
I'm not leaving.<eos> I want the photo and I want to know everything you know about who she's with, cos it isn't me.<eos> Give me the photo.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's evidence in an ongoing investigation.<eos> I am not at liberty to discuss it with you.
'Cause your pants are on fire, liar, liar.<eos> You don't think Paige notices the timing?<eos> It is a business meeting.<eos> Valentine's is a scam created by the greeting card industry.<eos> The only reason why I picked that place is because Paige mentioned it.
You don't know her.<eos> I know I like her a lot more than I like you.<eos> Could this be sabotage?<eos> The coupling is located on the outer hull.<eos> If someone wanted to tamper with it, they would have had to perform an EVA.
Hey, White Mammy, you're about to get your ass handed to you.<eos> I was just in your room, where I noticed you have a sizeable shrine with evil burning candles, photos of me with my face scratched out and pairs of my stolen panties.<eos> Care to explain, chubby old Nazi?<eos> Chanel, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Now I know why all your food tastes like it's got a little bit of pee in it.
It's got a washer and dryer.<eos> And no green space for my herb garden.<eos> Do you even know me?<eos> Okay. Describe your perfect place.<eos> Uh, it's a beautiful home, it's on the beach, it has a housekeeper and it's owned by a billionaire who doesn't monitor his change jar.
~ What are you doing, by the way? ~ Claymores.<eos> They're mines.<eos> I brought them from Britain.<eos> Ring our campsite with claymores.<eos> Then any animal that comes... .. they will... it will become a veneer.
How could my memory have been so off?<eos> All these years, I remembered her dumping me when I was the one who ended it, and since Nikki and I broke up,<eos> I've either dated the wrong women or screwed up the right ones. Maybe the reason I can't find the right person is because of me.<eos> And maybe you're being too hard on yourself.<eos> Like you said, it's hard to get perspective on your life when you're the one who's living it.
And then I got to thinking that that $3,000 would come in handy for my medical bills.<eos> But that was kind of stupid.<eos> So you never forgave him.<eos> I'm not so sure forgiveness exists.<eos> People talk about it a lot.
Isn't that right, Danielle? When Gabi called me,<eos> - I jumped at the chance. - And you wanna know why she never sent you any cards?<eos> Well, you tell her.<eos> - She really needed her independence, you know, but now she realizes that... you tell her.<eos> My life is nowhere near as good without you in it.
Mom, dad, my younger sister Anu and me.<eos> When did you get back?<eos> - The next day, the 3rd.<eos> Did the sermon last for 2 days'?<eos> Yes, but, we attended it only on the 2nd.
~ It wasn't ANY car, but, yeah.<eos> ~ So you're a fan of the 911 Porsches?<eos> ~ Yes, very much, yeah.<eos> What is it that you like about 911s?<eos> Um, I liked about that particular car, I liked how much you could feel the road in it.
All of what?<eos> The righteous wrath of the Votanis Collective.<eos> If humans had been better about sharing their planet, then we wouldn't hate them.<eos> That's Rahm Tak's whole message.<eos> There's more to it than that.
That's genius. All right.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> Oh, let... let me.<eos> The operating systems on all computers have Bash software.<eos> There's a security bug in it that nobody's been able to make a complete patch for. Yet.
I forgot about that.<eos> Well, you just said that you went up the elevator with Grey, which is odd because your parking spot is on the ground floor.<eos> That's right.<eos> It is.<eos> But someone else had parked in it...
This is all my fault...<eos> - Spencer..<eos> - Just let me talk to Tanner.<eos> She needs to know that I sent you to the arcade and that the candy was meant for me.<eos> You had no idea what was in it.
Well, I guess I have to do it by myself.<eos> Boy, this light is taking forever!<eos> Please get out.<eos> I never drive this car.<eos> My wife died in it.
You weren't that hard to find. I mean, that is, if somebody's looking for you.<eos> So you were the one who found me?<eos> Yep.<eos> And it wasn't that hard.<eos> Of course, I could make you disappear too... wipe out that photo, any trace of it, just like that, boom, gone.
The last thing you built to end the Troubles... The Barn... was gonna kill all the troubled people...<eos> It was the only way I knew how to eradicate Troubles.<eos> I had to protect against a far greater evil, should it ever rear its head.<eos> What greater evil?<eos> We don't know much about it.
What?<eos> Get out here.<eos> I'm divvying up my stuff.<eos> That box is for you. Don't want it.<eos> You don't know what's in it.
Just don't break the circle, and the demon remains contained.<eos> Um, but reading from the book is what caused all this trouble to begin with, so...<eos> Yeah, that's true, but reading from it again can't make things any worse.<eos> It's kinda like spilling paint on a, painting.<eos> It's okay 'cause there's already paint on it.
Let me tell you something about prison, Carlitos.<eos> It's hard.<eos> And unjust.<eos> But after a while, it becomes your home.<eos> And not just because you live and breathe in it.
And I'm just fine with that.<eos> - River...<eos> - When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves.<eos> You don't expect a sunset to admire you back.<eos> And if I happen to find myself in danger, let me tell you, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find himself standing in it with me!
Come on, Ryan.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> You don't need to say anything. 'Cause I'm leaving.<eos> O'Connor told me I could go weeks ago.<eos> There's an office with a stack of cases in it waiting for me.
It's been a pretty good season for us.<eos> Where the hell'd you find all that stuff?<eos> Oh yeah, we stayed in Memphis for a bit.<eos> Happened by a little bitty place.<eos> Maybe you've heard of it.
Did you run away from home?<eos> Do some time in juvie?<eos> There are a hundred other ways to make a buck.<eos> This life sure as hell isn't easy.<eos> Maybe that's what I like about it.
This is the second dead lab tech in two weeks.<eos> - That ain't a coincidence. - Yeah, and like the other tech, he had just stolen a serum from their storage cooler. - Really?<eos> What kind of serum?<eos> - It's called Cortexin.<eos> It's used to treat encephalopathy, a blood disease in the brain.
There you two are.<eos> Sit down and join us. I can't stay, Mom.<eos> Brian's showing me all of his favorite stuff to do.<eos> Getting spooked when the furnace goes on? We're participating in an autism walk.<eos> Looks like you're doing it right now.
What are you doing here, anyway?<eos> I thought I was waiting for Lance and you were having dinner with the smoak ladies.<eos> Went that well, did it?<eos> Do you know what I miss about our old space?<eos> That trunk, with the bottle of Russian vodka in it.
Yeah, the night that you passed out On the floor of the bar.<eos> The night you pretended to pass out On the floor of the bar.<eos> Well, I snuck into maritime museum Because this was on display there.<eos> It's certainly pretty.<eos> I don't feel any magic emanating from it.
- busy.<eos> - No, it's cool.<eos> I mean, yeah, I'll go out with you.<eos> Um... No, we can go to lunch right now.<eos> I've been working on this awesome new encryption software, and I promise to only talk about it for ten minutes tops.
You're still here.<eos> It's my office.<eos> I'm talking about New York.<eos> The photograph in this paper.<eos> In it you can see
Have you planned out your route to Wembley?<eos> SHEERAN:<eos> I remember making this wish last year, thinking everyone's gonna think I'm mental for this.<eos> And then it happened.<eos> I cut a cake this year, and I did make a wish and I am not telling anyone about it.
No, th... there's no Jedi.<eos> Here. My, my old, uh, cybernetic eye must be acting up again.<eos> Sorry for wasting your time.<eos> This image was taken by one of our probe droids.<eos> It clearly shows you harboring known rebels.
Yeah, but, uh, given the amount of scrap metal I found,<eos> I think it's safe to say that Kasey had made multiple devices.<eos> Could be more than one bomb?<eos> Exactly, which is why I wanted to show you this receipt.<eos> What's on it?
I'm sorry you got fired.<eos> But... it gave me an idea.<eos> What?<eos> Look, I love you, Carter.<eos> My life is so much better with you in it.
I searched with and social media user with that handle.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> All right, this guy went through a lot of trouble to delete Shelby's confession, right?<eos> Now, at first blush, it just looks like a cryptic poem.<eos> But what about it made him go to such extremes?
Okay, so we build the DFSes.<eos> You give them to Homeland agents, who go undercover on campus.<eos> And they will get a ping when they get close to someone with a Toshoki product.<eos> And then we detain just that person and then confiscate that device.<eos> And if it's the device we're looking for, it'll have the original ransomware code on it.

You're a tourist.<eos> You're just a fucking tourist.<eos> You drive through this place.<eos> You think it's so charming.<eos> You fall in love it it, and you want a piece of it.
I turned to my wife Coretta and said the same thing I often say when one of our leaders is struck down,<eos> "Our lives are not fully lived" "if we're not willing to die for those we love" "and for what we believe."<eos> But today, Jimmie, we're doing the living and you've done the dying, dear brother.<eos> We will not let your sacrifice pass in vain, dear brother.<eos> We will not let it go!
- Thank you.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> Where you from in Kentucky?<eos> Little town called Science Hill.<eos> Heard of it?
Reasonable man.<eos> I do like you, Sheriff Vogel.<eos> Really, I do. - Have you seen the video?<eos> - Yes, sir...<eos> Joe. Does your mailman get murdered in it?
Yes, they will die.<eos> Today... tomorrow, one year hence a hundred years from... now.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> They are mortal.<eos> You think your life is worth more than theirs, while there is no love in it?
Tell me.<eos> What?<eos> Tell me again.<eos> In the south of France... in Montpellier, the historic center of town is called L'Ecusson.<eos> It's full of small squares with beautiful shops, wonderful bars and cafes, art galleries which you would suffer through for me.
Your mother's asking for you. And your cousin.<eos> Father.<eos> I will not see the morning.<eos> Listen.<eos> This place is not just our home. It is the shelter of every soul within it.
And they sacrifice their time and they sacrifice their schedule. And their plans.<eos> And parents, in particular, make a life-long occupation of sacrifice.<eos> And if they...<eos> And if they do it right, their children have no awareness of sacrifices that have been made on their behalf.<eos> But it dawned on me that if sacrifice comes easily, if sacrifice comes naturally to you, you don't know the half of it.
It's been cooked.<eos> It tastes like it was sunning in a moldy basement.<eos> Talk about your "Grapes of Wrath."<eos> I bought it before I went shopping the other day.<eos> I locked it in the trunk and when I got home I forgot about it.
Why did you kiss me?<eos> When did I kiss you?<eos> I kissed my mirror. This mirror belongs to me.<eos> I can do anything I want to do with it.<eos> The mirror might be yours but the face in it is mine! Just a minute.
You can't know.<eos> You know, I'll tell you a story that my father... - told me about Hank McCreedy.<eos> - Hank McCreedy?<eos> A few days after the last murder at the Stark farm, the police on the Arkansas side, they found a body... all in pieces.<eos> It'd been run over by a train.
- I took the clothes from a dead one.<eos> Look in my front pocket.<eos> There's a picture in there.<eos> Please take a look at it!<eos> - What is it?
Hello, Mickey.<eos> I can call you that.<eos> 25897, Sergeant Tomlinson, ma'am.<eos> You're in deep shit, Mickey.<eos> In fact, you're up to your neck in it.
But some of us have got to be right, statistically.<eos> Come here.<eos> Dianne's interview.<eos> This photo was taken out the front of Steve Blakely's house the night before he went missing.<eos> It shows your son's car.
Constance Bonacieux.<eos> Athos killed my father, Constance.<eos> That's why I must face him.<eos> I'm d'Artagnan.<eos> Please think kindly of my name... if you think of it at all.
Reagan had called the Soviet Union, you remember, an evil empire.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And the Soviet Union has dissolved.<eos> So, who's the new evil empire?<eos> Well, you're sitting in it.
That's the beauty of a claim such as yours staked up In the hill there.<eos> Only one of it's kind so far.<eos> Might be anything.<eos> Folks around here they're hungry for gold.<eos> They dream about it in their sleep.
Maybe it fell when one of the houses collapsed.<eos> You gotta be kidding.<eos> When I was a kid, we had a piano that looked exactly like this.<eos> Really?<eos> Danny and I used to play it all the time.
Down day for investors on Wall Street.<eos> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell one and a half percent.<eos> Hey!<eos> I was gonna take that spot.<eos> I didn't see the name "Bitch" written on it.
Are you OK?<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> That pen belongs to Jack Rizzoli.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> He talked about it being a murder weapon.
Conjecture.<eos> Based on extensive experience on the battlefield.<eos> Hardly a clinical observation.<eos> Well, killing is not an exact science, Monsieur, but a messy business.<eos> And, as soldiers, it is our business.
No, it's not like that.<eos> _<eos> I don't even really care about that.<eos> Let me see the footage.<eos> If what I need is on it, that's all I'll take.
Brave as shit.<eos> I've seen things... things your generation just wouldn't understand.<eos> Hey, what's that thing?<eos> My motion activated thermal cameras picked this one up last week.<eos> What is it?
Of. You?<eos> S felt all this heat in the body?<eos> No it. J? I told you, I hate my body.<eos> - And I love. - Yes I know.<eos> But do not? you? those who live in it.
Then you are no longer unique.<eos> Nor are you alone.<eos> Do you know the word "vampire"?<eos> No.<eos> It is not familiar to you in some way?
I felt sorry for her.<eos> She'd taken not winning the competition quite hard.<eos> There was more to it than that.<eos> She'd remembered your name from the letter you'd written, offering your condolences upon the death of her father.<eos> When did she bring it up?
Germany?<eos> Yes, Germany.<eos> Henri, I have no intention of enquiring into your private life.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I have no intention of telling you about it.
You're being taken for a fool, Miss Mardle.<eos> An old fool.<eos> If you've quite finished, then I'll reply.<eos> My life is my own, Mr Grove.<eos> How I choose to live it is my business.
We used this gift for recognizing patterns in nature to read the calendar in the sky.<eos> The messages written in the stars told our forefathers and mothers when to camp and when to move on when the migratory herds and when the rains and the cold would come and when they would cease for a time.<eos> When they observed the connection between the motions of the stars and the seasonal cycles of life on Earth they concluded, naturally, that what happens up there must be directed at us down here.<eos> It makes sense, right?<eos> If the sky was a calendar and somebody stuck a Post-it note on top of it what else could it be but a message?
Ah, surveillance, data mining.<eos> Oh, cryptanalysis. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> Guys, who cares when you could fly... a quadcopter?<eos> And what are the practical applications of your quadcopter?<eos> Think of it like a tuxedo.
He was in the video I saw at the CIA.<eos> You're sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> He was one of the soldiers we took out of the Pakistani embassy.<eos> If this kidnapping is about the CIA, we don't talk on the phone about it, we don't e-mail about it, we don't speak of it at FBI headquarters.
During one of these polite conversations, do you recall Mr. Lanagin ever mentioning Xander Feng?<eos> I do not.<eos> Does that name mean anything to you?<eos> Other than being plastered all over the news?<eos> In that regard, it means as much as Kim Kardashian.
Let's go before Blue shoot me.<eos> That old curmudgeon.<eos> It's not cranky.<eos> He was there.<eos> He knows more about it than he would like.
Well, when I was little, I was in a spelling bee at school and I really wanted to win.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> There was no prize.<eos> No one cared.<eos> My parents didn't even know I was in it.
When I first got to New York, wanna know what I did first?<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I went straight to West 4th to watch basketball.<eos> That's how famous this place is.<eos> The whole world is talking about it.
I come here with my mommy.<eos> I used to spend the summer with my mommy too.<eos> You did?<eos> Mm-hmm. In a place called Montana.<eos> Have you ever heard of it?
Dash, this is terrible.<eos> These spells are dark... and dangerous and they are to be avoided at all costs.<eos> There's an old saying:<eos> "Words written in blood draw only blood."<eos> The evil intention of a spell is hardwired into it.
Please, take a seat.<eos> As you know, there's been a lawsuit filed against the police department by one of your former coworkers, Lee Anne Marcus.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware of it.<eos> Well, the internal affairs investigation yielded a file of recorded footage, and it's... a party of several officers taking turns having sex with Lee Anne on the hood of a squad car, and I'm interviewing all the men in that footage.<eos> I'm not in it.
You're welcome.<eos> Where's Catherine and Tori?<eos> There doesn't seem to be much here except dust.<eos> Doesn't seem like the place has been open in a while.<eos> Then why'd they want it so badly?
I wonder why you would say that seeing as you hold it in your hand.<eos> This?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no. This isn't the real chronometer.<eos> You see here, this tiny cogwheel?<eos> I had it engraved with my initials so tiny that the human eye would never have perceived it, not without knowing it was already there, even if someone took the time to disassemble the device.
She doesn't tell us where she's going.<eos> Forget I said anything!<eos> It's not about what you said. It's that you're lying to us and hiding things.<eos> I'm allowed to have my own life!<eos> And we are allowed to know about it.
- Previously on The Americans...<eos> - Paige, what is this?<eos> I'm allowed to have my own life!<eos> And we are allowed to know about it.
Oh, that's so cool.<eos> No.<eos> No, it isn't. We're already seeded, Richard.<eos> Why would we enter a start-up competition at a tech conference?<eos> I sent in the application a few months ago and I totally forgot about it.
And as far as "unhealthy interest," I get a letter a week from some crackpot.<eos> Really?<eos> Have you, uh, received any recently?<eos> You know, I did receive an odd missive when I first arrived at the hotel.<eos> I didn't think twice about it.
Too bad.<eos> I had something special in mind as a reward...<eos> Hey, I'm feeling a lot better now!<eos> My blood pressure and heart rate are almost normal!<eos> It looks like a regular smartphone, but there's some pretty sophisticated software installed on it.
Done with what, exactly?<eos> He doesn't belong here... not anymore.<eos> He belongs in the real world, in New York, and the life that he remembers.<eos> It was good.<eos> And it didn't involve vile villains.
I'd love to be a pawn in your game of thrones,<eos> Ben, but I think I got to pass.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Corporate law doesn't get me wet.<eos> There's no passion in it.
I don't understand why I can't stop.<eos> I've never had a problem controlling myself.<eos> Do you know I love milk?<eos> Mm, no.<eos> Well, I do, but it hurts my stomach.
[ door slams ] None of us want to be here, Karev.<eos> Then why are we?<eos> You're having a relationship with a subordinate, and that is against policy.<eos> Can we not talk about my personal life?<eos> I'd love to not talk about it, Alex, but you are making me.
I'm... Tomorrow, if you'd like.<eos> Good. Uh, come on back in, and I'll assign you a desk.<eos> It doesn't officially show till Wednesday.<eos> How much?<eos> Well, I warned you you'd fall in love with it.
Ms. Tascioni, don't take this the wrong way, but you have an awful voice.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, but this city... it inspires me.<eos> Really?<eos> I find it makes me sweat.
Emilia, for as long as it is possible, for as long as it requires me to, find a story for the world. This is our secret, is it not?<eos> I do not wait my turn.<eos> Not ever. And most certainly not here.<eos> Caitlin, darlin'.<eos> What use is this place if it cannot provide so little as a fucking remedy for the fucking heartburn?
I know. But you can't be.<eos> Take the rest of the day off, Detective.<eos> That's an order.<eos> This car is the key.<eos> If that's where Vulcan killed Marks, then we'll find the forensic evidence in it.
Oh, my God.<eos> My heart just threw up.<eos> Look, they're saying this assignment will last about six months, so while I'm gone,<eos> Boyle, I want you to have my desk.<eos> I'll sit at it always.

She never should have become a mother in the first place.<eos> Did you know that she sends herself flowers from you, and that she talks about you constantly?<eos> I know all about the scar on your elbow from the time that you climbed on the counter trying to get the box of Frosted Flakes, nd your fear of balloons, and that you aced the SAT.<eos> Wow. Did she also tell you that she missed my high school graduation?<eos> She had a dream, and she got lost in it.
Perhaps you can.<eos> Ever been married?<eos> I'm sure that file of yours can tell you the answer's no.<eos> Married to your career then?<eos> I'm simply trying to get a sense of your life and the people in it.
Ally and the others picked on me as soon as I arrived.<eos> Really? How so?<eos> If I sat at their table, Ally would get up, and the rest of the squad would follow.<eos> They made fun of my makeup, my clothes.<eos> Ally even told me the wrong time for the annual picture so I'd miss it.
This is unbelievable, okay?<eos> I alienate your doctor, and I almost kill you in one weekend.<eos> What kind of father is that?<eos> My life is flashing before my eyes.<eos> - You're in it a lot.
How are you sir?<eos> Its going on.<eos> Everything is fine sir.<eos> Sir you have discussed about the Mira Road flat.<eos> I didn't get any calls about it!
And maybe I should check out some of these "rides" that people keep talking about.<eos> Hey, if Brick's going on his first ride, I got to see that.<eos> I'll do Peter Pan with you, and then I'll hit Splash Mountain after.<eos> You know, if we all go on Splash Mountain together, we could do a funny group picture on the way down.<eos> Hey, if you're gonna be in it, it's definitely gonna be funny.
Nice room.<eos> You know, you should have more than one chair.<eos> What do you do when people come round?<eos> Sit on the bed.<eos> Why aren't you sitting on it, then?
Hey.<eos> You guys super psyched for our senior ski trip?<eos> This air is oppressive.<eos> So clean.<eos> How are we supposed to breathe air without toxins in it?
Miss Livingstone.<eos> Erm... we found this in your aunt's house.<eos> Nothing else appears to have been taken, just the photograph.<eos> The photo.<eos> Do you remember what it was?
Well, I'm about halfway through my "Ride Easy" tour, but this weekend, I'm actually going home, going back to Nashville to see my family and my fiancé, and I'm real excited about that.<eos> All right, well, look, let's not keep your fans or your fiancé waiting any longer.<eos> With the world premiere of her bonus track,<eos> "Lies of the Lonely," also available for download now, give it up for the queen of country, Rayna Jaymes!<eos> ♪ This bed feels better ♪ ♪ with nobody in it ♪
Hey, aren't you show-offs gonna break for lunch?<eos> If that's Tommy's chili, I'll pass.<eos> His cooking is probably what made us all sick.<eos> Hey, that chili's been in my family since the 1800s.<eos> Yeah. It explains the crust on it.
Hey!<eos> My bag!<eos> Hey, get off me!<eos> You remember this place?<eos> I can never forget it.
I think if they did, they probably have a pretty good reason.<eos> Do you know what they're hiding in the bag under Scott's bed?<eos> What?<eos> No, I've never been under Scott's bed.<eos> Or in it.
There will never be an us.<eos> And no matter what happens between me and Mike, this is the last time that you and I are ever gonna have a conversation again.<eos> - You're my lawyer.<eos> - Not anymore, Logan.<eos> So whatever real or fake meeting you have with Harvey, you can go to it now, but I won't be in it or any other meeting you have here in the future because we're done.
Well, he's not to be accessed, sir.<eos> He's not to be accessed, sir!<eos> I hear you need a ship.<eos> All these years heard about the Halo ring.<eos> Never thought we'd actually step foot on it.
Alrighty, so, we'll just have a listen to your heart, see what it sounds like.<eos> You know what it's saying, Damon.<eos> Don't do this crazy thing?<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's exactly what I heard it saying.
- Working a case.<eos> Suspicious homicide in the styling where the murder weapon is a boomerang.<eos> Cool.<eos> I mean, awful.<eos> I found traces of iron oxide on it.
Give me a chance to guide you.<eos> The only way we can end this war and bring Father back is through your markings.<eos> It's never gonna happen.<eos> Yes, it will.<eos> Otherwise I'll burn this city and everyone in it to the ground.
He didn't recognise us.<eos> He did come here, but he didn't recognise us and he went on his way.<eos> You left the village 12 years ago?<eos> Your name is above that door.<eos> It's not a name he would easily forget.
- Is that what it was called?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Skank ho?<eos> No, I didn't set up that account.<eos> - Did you post on it? - No, I didn't.
If that virus gets in the water supply, we could be facing a huge epidemic.<eos> We got a ballistics match on Hughes's gun.<eos> The same gun that shot Sam.<eos> - We found Hughes's car in the faculty parking lot.<eos> - Let me guess, it had traces of Sam's blood.
One morning, an envelope was dropped at my office.<eos> Inside was a key to a locker in the Penn Station and a note that read,<eos> "Destroy anything you find."<eos> This box was in the locker.<eos> What's in it?
Our victim suffered from an orbitozygomatic fracture.<eos> That's the right cheekbone and eye socket.<eos> From the fall? Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> This is an old injury.<eos> At least ten years. But there's no record of it in her medical history.
What brings you to Arendelle?<eos> I'm on a diplomatic mission, part of a semi-permanent envoy.<eos> I shall be staying for quite some time.<eos> Welcome to my Kingdom.<eos> Do you find it to your liking?
- You're so welcome.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're gonna fix this, okay?<eos> Okay, so I come across this matchbox.<eos> It's got a picture of a thorny rose on it.
This is the first time we were really tested.<eos> And I really needed him.<eos> And he was weak.<eos> ♪ now you are gone ♪ You know what marriage is, sweetie?<eos> You know what it's about?
- With you on the guest list?<eos> - I heard that.<eos> 'Course you did.<eos> Well, the copy is good, but I'd like to use the photo of the Grayson Global retreat in Hawaii.<eos> It's a better shot of David.
I want to talk about music.<eos> But I want to get to this.<eos> I want this to be the exclamation point.<eos> Music is life.<eos> I don't think your life is remotely complete without music of some kind in it.
Uh, we can tell you more back at the station.<eos> Detectives!<eos> What's going on? We found the murder weapon.<eos> What? A gold-tipped lanier pen.<eos> There's a print on it.
- Even as she explained how she was being raped, she didn't cry?<eos> No, and I found that strange.<eos> I asked that this panel hear testimony from my counselor, Owen Cavanaugh.<eos> So it is your opinion that this tape, this recording, was selectively edited?<eos> Yes. It plays the middle of the conversation
Oh, unfortunately, people have been killed for less.<eos> But he promised to make her co-editor, so she knew that was coming eventually.<eos> Yeah, but some people can get very impatient.<eos> The impressions from the pen were still on the cast.<eos> That's how I was able to recreate what was written on it.
Night, Marjorie. Night.<eos> You know, I'm sorry things didn't work out at your new house, but I got to admit, I'm happy you're back...<eos> I missed you.<eos> We missed you, too.<eos> And, Bonnie, I know we give each other a hard time, but... my life is better with you in it.
No. I do, but I'm clumsy.<eos> 'I likes babies.<eos> But they're fragile, ain't they? '<eos> And if I drops a vase or something or sits in some apple crumble and custard, I goes, "Whoops, sorry," and people goes, "Oh, don't worry about it, Derek.<eos> Accident". But if I drops a baby, or sits on it, whoops, sorry, isn't enough, is it? So,
I don't understand.<eos> Mo, listen.<eos> I was standing alone in my apartment.<eos> And I realized... why wasn't it finished?<eos> It wasn't finished because you weren't in it.
Guys, please.<eos> You only liked her after you found out I liked her!<eos> That's right, because you did the school play.<eos> Cabaret. Cabaret.<eos> Because she was in it.
And they say from the neurological damage, there's no way I live past 55! (LAUGHING)<eos> You got three years left, my friend.<eos> You're gonna die!<eos> Hey, hey, remember? I was by myself and I had that dream about the orange tree.<eos> But instead of oranges, it had babies on it.
Let's not muddle the facts.<eos> You asked me to walk and locked the door behind me.<eos> Besides, I was smarter than Adam here.<eos> And I didn't spend all my time kissing your ass. How is Ethion?<eos> We've heard remarkably little about it.
- Yeah!<eos> I thought this could be our meeting room.<eos> Woah! This is so cool!<eos> Now this little renovation was totally clandestine.<eos> Which means nobody knew about it.
Oscar Wilde used to make whoopsie with altar boys.<eos> That's true.<eos> Forget what I just said.<eos> This place, I miss it.<eos> It's like... It's like home.
No, you're not<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Doesn't have a name.<eos> Just like you.<eos> What's in it?
Our personality or this thing we think of as ourself...<eos> Is a tiny fraction of what the brain is doing.<eos> Most of it is automated body functions. What is it we're ceding?<eos> No, if this notion of self is such a small percentage of you, sweetie...<eos> How come I always hear so much about it?
I want to be there for you guys so badly...<eos> But your career's more important than your friends.<eos> Got it.<eos> I'm still part of the show.<eos> I just can't be in it right now.
I am just adding to the stuff you are already cooking up... I am not cooking up anything.<eos> You are not cut out for this painting stuff?<eos> Neither are you Raja, nor Ravi Varma.<eos> You carry that blank canvas everywhere.<eos> But you never put any paint on it.
No.<eos> I have a girlfriend.<eos> You mean your little office romance.<eos> What do you know about that?<eos> When it comes to your life, Peter, and what I know about it, you should assume that there's no such thing as a secret.
These're your prints.<eos> The prints on the bill are also yours.<eos> Yeah, that's the guy.<eos> He gave me 50 bucks to move the box.<eos> If I had known what was in it, I never would have given him a hand.
Well well well!<eos> Hmm, good morning.<eos> - Good morning. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You know, I gotta admit, I saw that your bed was made, and I thought maybe...<eos> I never slept in it, and you were going to catch me trying to sneak back in?
I don't need your permission.<eos> You don't seem to need permission from anybody.<eos> If you did, I'm sure somebody along the line would've asked you what the hell you think you're doing.<eos> I saw the scars on that animal.<eos> You did surgery on it.
So, how are you and Andy doing?<eos> I just try to keep him distracted.<eos> Not that I know what I'm doing taking care of a kid.<eos> He remembers the kidnapping.<eos> Has nightmares about it.
Nothing personal.<eos> When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way that it is, your life is just to live your life inside the world and try not to bash into the walls too much. But that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact.<eos> And that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that are no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it.<eos> It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is just there, and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it.<eos> Change it' Improve it. Make your mark upon it. And once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
Sorry, but why do you always answer?<eos> Why not let Sister Maria talk?<eos> Madam...<eos> I took a vow of poverty.<eos> And you can't talk about poverty... you have to live it.
But if you're living in a little place and you have no money and you got a little bit saved and they say,<eos> "You gotta risk all of that and you still might be working McDonald's tomorrow,"<eos> I think you gotta be absolutely crazy to go after it like that, yeah.<eos> It was just...<eos> I came to a fork in the road and music wasn't on it.
It's rare that she kicks.<eos> I'm from Glossops.<eos> It's about your milk.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, there's garlic in it.
Ask her to spritz you tonight.<eos> My dad wants to take us to a nice dinner.<eos> Caleb, he does not have to do that.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, not only are you the person that brought him back into my life, but you're the reason he gets to stay in it.
So I'd like to give the floor to David.<eos> This is my class.<eos> This is also Jochem's class.<eos> This photo was taken a few Weeks ago.<eos> But Jochem is not in it.
Do you recognize this man?<eos> No. He...he doesn't look familiar.<eos> We found a Scarsdale address on her.<eos> Does the name R. Garrison sound familiar?<eos> No. No, I-I never heard her mention it.
I've good reason to be grateful to your trained eye.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You didn't leave my side.<eos> I've grown to love nursing more and more.<eos> I find myself feeling quite passionate about it - what I can learn, what I can achieve.
hen was small had a desk.<eos> t was weird because wrote on it "hen grow up wanna be a singer. "
The remains of heart's flame, cooled by the bringer of rain, who brought death to my city and tore me from the life I knew.<eos> Smothered by Crassus, who cast me off in chains for the pleasure of a savage.<eos> You have known pain.<eos> A misfortune shared by many among us.<eos> How do you move past it?
You and Mark are gonna run a few errands for me.<eos> Execute your tasks in a timely manner and you will remain intact.<eos> So what's this really about?<eos> This is about three dead little spies in a brave new world.<eos> It's about the afterlife, John, and us negotiating our places in it.
You took a job from somebody who deserved it more.<eos> I went to resubmit my motion to dismiss.<eos> Turns out judge McIntyre already received it... from me.<eos> The client needed it, and you wrote it.<eos> For me to put my signature on it would just be wrong.
The bed floats!<eos> This is awesome!<eos> Usually, you gotta bring the ropes to the bed.<eos> This way, you get to eliminate a whole step!<eos> The bed's sculptural beauty is actually surpassed by the joy of resting in it.
Amy.<eos> Howard.<eos> And Liz.<eos> So Kathryn, what do you call this dish?<eos> Just what it is... pork chops, black beans
Yeah, he's no Cartier-Bresson, but he's okay.<eos> ...Drove by it on a family trip once, got a picture.<eos> You've got a picture of Tommy Lee Jones's ranch? I blew it up into an 8 x 10.<eos> It's hanging over my bed.<eos> I've seen the architectural digest piece on it, but I've never seen it in person. Is it cool?
We're here.<eos> So your sacred cause is pilfering a dwarf's pickaxe?<eos> Regina... had this in her pocket when you turned her over to us.<eos> It's a trigger, and this axe, according to our people, is what activates it.<eos> You're going to destroy an entire town and kill everyone in it...
Uh...<eos> What's in the box, Donnie?<eos> It's private.<eos> No, it isn't!<eos> What... what is in it?
Shh!<eos> Tell me what was really in the box, Donnie.<eos> What?<eos> Your special box.<eos> What was inside of it?
It means "lame" in white people.<eos> Oh, Rex Evans is the...quarterback.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been working my ass off, and Gomer freaking Pyle will barely throw me the rock.<eos> Well, maybe you have to establish your rhythm off the field before you can find one on it.
We always figured the third man used his own gun.<eos> But the slug they found in Rizzo matches the one in Myrna Callum.<eos> Rizzo was killed with his own gun.<eos> That means we already have the murder weapon.<eos> The third man's prints got to be on it.
A terrible thing has happened.<eos> A bad thing has happened.<eos> I've got completely wedged.<eos> With the P45 untangled, I headed off to my big business meeting.<eos> First of all, I'd like to apologise for my... wet sleeves and my bloodshot eye I got soap in it.
'A long journey lay ahead. So, we decided to annoy Jeremy.'<eos> Just to let you know, my iPod's working really well in the car, how about yours?<eos> No, I don't have an iPod connector in here.<eos> I suppose, yeah, it'd be a bit much to ask for that on a £340,000 car, wouldn't it<eos> I would imagine it would be there, my simple hick car has got...
You know, we damaged souls, we really do attract one another, don't we?<eos> You're cursed with a bad picker, you are.<eos> And let's face it, why would anyone fall in love with either of us total bloody disasters?<eos> We're so much alike.<eos> Your ending, Joe, tell me about it.
My-my box?<eos> Your box.<eos> So, if you could just take it off my desk, please.<eos> Just to clarify, you're giving me your box?<eos> What's in it?
- Look how handsome you are.<eos> - Who's Tommy? I just got a video.<eos> I think it's of me doing something I shouldn't have been doing.<eos> Like what?<eos> What are you doing in it, Tommy?
Put all your weight on me.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Just take a breath.<eos> Bryan, can you get those seats down?<eos> - I - thought that's why you got this car, to put canoes and tents and things in it.
Oh. I think I'm gonna head home.<eos> I understand.<eos> What, you're not gonna try and stop me?<eos> And how would I try and stop you?<eos> I don't know, by telling me life is short, and if you ever come across a beautiful, exciting, crazy moment in it, you got to seize it while you can before that moment's gone?
I took the liberty of buying masks for you and your brother.<eos> Wouldn't miss it.<eos> Conrad, you know, with such a late surge, we are ripe for an October surprise.<eos> Victoria received a suspicious R.S.V.P. this morning.<eos> It said "Expect the unexpected,"
Well, they've staked out this territory.<eos> It's not an easy hike from the road.<eos> The strength it would take to dismember a body and carry the pieces suggests that the unsub is a physically fit male or it was a team.<eos> You say it's a known wolf den?<eos> How many people might know about it?
Wade is right.<eos> You know, BlueBell needs a sports bar, not a-a... wine saloon, with frilly tablecloths and antique sofas.<eos> It is a "salon,"<eos> not a saloon. Oh...<eos> And Lemon is just trying to elevate the place, and the people in it.
752, 752, 752, 752, 752, 752, 752,<eos> 752, 752...<eos> "well, the next thing that Alice found<eos> "was a little cake,<eos> "and it had the words 'eat me' written on it.
"Treasure... chest."<eos> Now can we clean this place up and go?<eos> Funny story.<eos> My mom and Jay were invited.<eos> Cam gave me the invitation at school, and I forgot about it.
Perhaps.<eos> But surely over the long...<eos> Therefore, any member of this organization who knowingly assists Grayson will be dealt with in the harshest of terms.<eos> So... This trick with the light bulbs that you performed with just such panache at your housewarming party...<eos> I prefer to think of it as a debutante ball.
He threw his phone out before he turned onto the cul-de-sac where we caught him.<eos> Interesting texts with mama.<eos> What's it say?<eos> He messaged her before he went inside the chop shop, and she texted back, "don't come home without..."<eos> "The car and everything in it."
And the sun, which was a question mark on the horizon.<eos> Pator saw a new horizon.<eos> He felt a wind of liberty blowing.<eos> Charlotte thought of their wild summer.<eos> She hoped to bask in it her whole life long.
Fortunately, Aunt Shirley is letting me stay in one side of her double-wide.<eos> - Mom, I don't--<eos> - You know what is so funny about this, Ben?<eos> You were my inspiration to make this move!<eos> When I saw what you did with your life when Emma came into it, I thought, "I could do that!
Thanks, guys.<eos> No. I mean, ten years is a long time, but I don't think I've ever seen her.<eos> Sorry. No.<eos> I got to ask you, though, if it's been so long, why do you think these two cases are related?<eos> Mr. Bishop, Amanda Morris' body was discovered this morning, and evidence on it indicates that she was in contact with your daughter.
Mr. Carlson?<eos> I'm Agent Moretti.<eos> You called the FBI to report a crime.<eos> A murder.<eos> Well... tell me about it.
I'm look forward to meeting the competition!<eos> Can't believe I didn't recognize you earlier. Should've known<eos> Princess Celestia would send her prized pupil here after my crown, and her little dog, too.<eos> It's my crown! Whatever. This is just a minor setback for me.<eos> You don't know the first thing about this place, and I already rule it.
I don't know about my life flashing before me.<eos> I was thinking about my white coat... and how I'm glad I have it on me now.<eos> Um, will you overhead page Richard Webber for me?<eos> It's the moment my life started.<eos> Seems fitting it should be on me when it ends.
Hey, boys. Welcome back.<eos> You are my best customers.<eos> Well, this time, we are gonna get a deer.<eos> Okay, if you scatter shots actually bag a buck, I will cook you my world-famous chicken-fried venison.<eos> It's only world-famous 'cause you won't shut up about it.
Because you're not a doctor.<eos> - Uh, listen, Todd...<eos> - No, you listen.<eos> Just because you went to medical school doesn't mean you know all about the human body.<eos> It means I know something about it.
Uh, was Oates trying?<eos> Hey, careful.<eos> We're taking a family photo after dinner, and you know how easily you get droopy drunk face.<eos> Oh. Family photo.<eos> I'm assuming I'll be in it, uh, since I'm part of the family?
I didn't abandon it.<eos> I served my time and moved on.<eos> If you had some kids, you'd understand.<eos> Right, LC, I don't think you necessarily have to live in the city to protect it.<eos> - You never lived in it, John. - Hey, you know what?
If you had some kids, you'd understand.<eos> Right, LC, I don't think you necessarily have to live in the city to protect it.<eos> - You never lived in it, John. - Hey, you know what?<eos> The way I look at it, my parents got me out, seems like disrespect to move back.<eos> You don't live in it, you don't know it.
It's Bay.<eos> I have to get back to Maui.<eos> My shift starts in an hour.<eos> Yeah, I got to get back to the motor pool.<eos> The problem is I'm not gonna get out of this bed as long as you're still in it.
You gotta be kidding me.<eos> I assure you I'm not.<eos> Call the consulate if you like.<eos> Is this car yours or hers?<eos> Hers, but as long as I'm in it, the car is considered sovereign British soil.
- Fight it.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Listen to me, you have been fighting the psychopath inside you all your life, shut up and win!<eos> That is an order, Tasha Lem.<eos> The force-field will hold for a while but it will decay and there are breaches already.
He said he thinks she's going to kill Brady Ritter.<eos> Okay. Where is Sean now?<eos> Joan Dillinger's firm owns a secret warehouse. I found it.<eos> I'll call Sean, but I need to ask you about the evidence box.<eos> It had the assassin's toxicology report in it, didn't it?
- I took your position.<eos> - This is because of Archie.<eos> - Gonna accuse my captain now?<eos> Can't you let me off the hook?<eos> Life at this school is just so much more interesting with you in it.
I'll take full blame.<eos> It's not like I'm asking you to go out with me again.<eos> I know that's not likely.<eos> But can we at least be friendly?<eos> Life at this school is just so much more interesting with you in it.
- Wow. - Right?<eos> This is amazing.<eos> (Gasps) Looks even better with some of this.<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> Alex told me about it.
I mean, really, I was in a rut until I saw that "L.A. Weekly" ad.<eos> So you did know the bar's reputation?<eos> No, no.<eos> I... I never read that article.<eos> But I had the magazine in my van because it had an advertisement for the G-shot. Okay.
I don't even want.<eos> To look at you right now.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> I'm... yup.<eos> So once you find this box, what do you think's gonna be in it?
Who?<eos> Who said those bad things?<eos> They can say whatever they want! I don't care!<eos> My...<eos> My heart... My heart feels like it's being ripped apart by a metal wire.
I'll sound the alarm when I see the arson guys.<eos> Look, I'm sorry to drag you into this.<eos> You know, the last thing I want to be in your life is some pain in the ass.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Vincent, it's not that I don't want you in my life, it's just that I don't know how to keep you in it because I don't even know what my life is anymore.
Haven't we turned that house upside-down at this point?<eos> There is one room we haven't searched yet.<eos> Hey, Sara...<eos> I found the murder weapon.<eos> Yeah, and it has Emily Bridwell's prints on it.
Now answer my questions truthfully.<eos> What is the secret society?<eos> It's called Augustine.<eos> Augustine?<eos> I've never heard of it.
It was in her room.<eos> We checked to see if there was any clues about where she'd gone.<eos> Does it mention...?<eos> It stops at exactly that point.<eos> Is it true he's put a video up and it shows the body?
- Come on in.<eos> - No, no!<eos> Not them.<eos> Anything but them.<eos> You peed in the bed, now lie in it.
Sara, I can prove it to you.<eos> Please?<eos> Please give me a chance.<eos> For Daniel's sake, please.<eos> Well, if we've owned this place for decades, why is this the first I'm hearing of it?
Think I've given our consultants a little too much sway.<eos> Some friends of mine wanted to let me know before it was too late to right the ship.<eos> And I appreciate that.<eos> We've got a mission here.<eos> It's to protect this city and the citizens that live in it.
What are you doing here?<eos> Nothing... What have you got there?<eos> His name was George.<eos> He brought art into this town.<eos> But he didn't have the strength to stay alive in it.
What?<eos> You can tell from the bones?<eos> No, no.<eos> This ring.<eos> It has my family crest. I found it here.
I don't remember.<eos> In any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected.<eos> We had to get up at 6 in the morning and plunge into a lake.<eos> It was a small lake not far from the castle.<eos> It was fed by an icy mountain stream.
I have to get this driveway clean.<eos> And then... I'm going to congratulate you on being happy. 'Cause you deserve it.<eos> You said that an hour ago.<eos> Was that tonight?<eos> Oh, I just... saw this tree, but it was a dragon. Then it was a tree again and itjust lied to me.
According to this, it was the first movie ever made by anybody ever.<eos> How cool is that?<eos> So what'd you find on the baby?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> There's no mention of it, just the photo of the family.
Nothing like a pair of blue balls to drive a man insane.<eos> Hey, don't talk to her like that.<eos> she made her own bed, John. That she did.<eos> And what's that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, honey, you dig a hole in a man's life, you can't expect not to be buried in it.
Italian food's so overrated.<eos> I love it.<eos> There's no variety.<eos> English food, on the other hand...<eos> Say what you like about it, There's nothing like a good steak and kidney pie.
Hmm, peanut butter.<eos> Yoink!<eos> Hey, I was using that!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't see your name on it.
From the perspective of the virus, the human being is irrelevant.<eos> What matters is the system that allows it to function.<eos> Skin cells, nerve cells, the right home for the right disease.<eos> Within our Afterlife capsule, the system that is Hannah Geist's body has been perpetuated, even expanded beyond what existed during her lifetime.<eos> Everything inside this housing is either part of the original body or has been grown directly from it as a result of our patented CellGarden technology.
Wait. Wait. What does that mean?<eos> We think it...<eos> We think that she...<eos> What?<eos> There was a human heart inside it.
What are you doing?<eos> We keep talking about how much everything's changed in 80 years,<eos> Boston, you.<eos> But I don't know if I've changed enough for all of this.<eos> Your life, where do I fit in it?
Breathe, breathe, breathe... (Whispering) Oh my god!<eos> Your friends need you, Sally.<eos> We need you to come back or we're all gonna die.<eos> None of that matters anymore.<eos> That other place, it's a miserable world, and you were miserable in it.
A-and you just keep ignoring me?<eos> Michael, no.<eos> I didn't want you here.<eos> I didn't want you here. I told everyone.<eos> I was ready to walk away from the show when I heard you were doing it.
- Yep.<eos> The test was incomplete.<eos> Did you have trouble attaching the device?<eos> No.<eos> But I did have trouble sleeping with it.
Uh, I'm not a real Asian, so I don't know your name.<eos> Becca.<eos> What can we do for you?<eos> Do you know anyone that can get their hands on that sanctuary footage?<eos> My friend needs to know if she's on it.
Moscow, 1934.<eos> They say happiness is like good health.<eos> You don't notice it until it's gone.
Doctor<eos> Now that is a trunk<eos> Yes<eos> Yes it is<eos> You can fit a lot of stuff in it
So...<eos> How have you been?<eos> Wisconsin was kick-ass.<eos> There's a beautiful lake there.<eos> I took 37 shits in it.
All right, then if you're ready, Chelsea, you can go ahead and hop into the stirrups and I'll have a look around.<eos> You bet.<eos> Oh, and in honor of carnival, I'm offering a brazilian theme today.<eos> How do you like my chili, Dee Dee?<eos> Oh, it's great.
Oh, damn it.<eos> He's already got Ryland tankers headed to section 18.<eos> Well, what did the lawyer say?<eos> Not only did Lobell hang me out to dry, but if I want to get Southfork back,<eos> I have to prove J.R. Was in on the fraud, or at least he knew about it.
There's one more thing.<eos> The footage you have of John Ross.<eos> I think we both know it will exonerate him.<eos> Careful, Mr. Ewing.<eos> It shows that Marta was still alive when he left. And I want it.
I lost.<eos> [ Cheers and applause ] And that settles it.<eos> Victory for me.<eos> Yeah. You're the winner.<eos> Let me get a box so you can stand on it and the people can see you and your little victory dance.
It is not.<eos> It's the opposite of depressing.<eos> There's a relief in it.<eos> Life is complex.<eos> There's nothing simple or easy about it.
I don't have any idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm not after you.<eos> I'm after Hannah McKay.<eos> She was your roommate at the time of the murder.<eos> And I know it was her idea, but you had some part in it.
The smoke of their holy fire would choke me too.<eos> You asked for reasonable terms.<eos> Well, then...<eos> You and a dozen of your household can leave tonight, bearing only what you can carry.<eos> The city, its people, and everything in it will then pass to the Host.
- I tried.<eos> - Breaking into houses?<eos> That is not trying.<eos> That is sabotaging.<eos> This place is not what they say it is.
You help me find her, and you've got a deal.<eos> I didn't realize you were going for the medal round.<eos> Well, I don't want you to settle for the silver.<eos> No way, gold all the way.<eos> Speaking of, you've got a lot of it.
Sleeping pill?<eos> For a 10-year-old?<eos> Reichman said, whenever he went away on business, the daughter became hysterical.<eos> Helping her nod off was his wife's idea.<eos> Mike tested the little girl's cocoa and found Ambien in it.
Maybe you are a different person but...<eos> I didn't know you then and I don't know you now.<eos> Get to know me.<eos> I have a life and I like it. I don't...<eos> NEED you in it. What about Libby?
When this is all over, I want you to concentrate on yourself.<eos> Find something to make you smile.<eos> You look nice.<eos> I have a life and I like it.<eos> I don't need you in it!
You know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy.<eos> So, to sum up: nicely done, we hate you, and food for thought.<eos> Simpson, wait!<eos> As it turns out, there is one job available.<eos> But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom.
So, everybody knows about Brick's football career, obviously, but no one knows much about his personal life.<eos> Was he ever married?<eos> Just to the game.<eos> He gave it everything he had.<eos> It's a difficult life.
- I'd like to hear more.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here is her card.<eos> And here is what you'll write on it.
So,kim,it's very Interesting what developed here Tonight.<eos> You have jonas who everybody Says is likable and provides.<eos> He stirs the pot and out comes The guy on the end who says "I'm The old guy,<eos> I don't really like This social part of this Game...". I didn't say I didn't like The social.<eos> I said I'm awkward in it.
Hey, I think I found the murder weapon.<eos> Kevlar, carbon fiber.<eos> It's not a baseball bat.<eos> It's a composite shaft of a hockey stick.<eos> With the logo, Las Vegas Silver Strikes on it.
I have no choice.<eos> You know very well it's not that simple.<eos> You can reach me at the hospital if my mobile's off.<eos> Leave the bed, Mariam.<eos> The settlers fucked in it.
But then I decided I was allowed to be a person, too.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I think you need to complain about your lunch order.<eos> There's a phone in it.
- Oh, that's okay.<eos> Linda double-parked the bus so I had to sweet talk us out of us getting a ticket.<eos> 'cause God knows she's not equipped to do that.<eos> So, who's ready to Zolt into our high-tech development lab?<eos> I learned all about it on the interactive thrill ride.
I wouldn't rush it if I were you.<eos> Thing comes back positive, jig's up.<eos> Your life won't belong to you anymore.<eos> No, no, no. See, that is the thing that people do not understand about parenting.<eos> It is all about setting limits.
Growing up with three older brothers has its advantages.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Yeah, I need a desk.<eos> Looks a little something like that?<eos> Yeah, what are you going to do with it?
These're your prints.<eos> The prints on the bill are also yours.<eos> Yeah, that's the guy.<eos> He gave me 50 bucks to move the box.<eos> If I had known what was in it, I never would have given him a hand.
Come on.<eos> My life is over.<eos> You didn't choose this life.<eos> It doesn't matter who chose it.<eos> I'm the one who lived it.
Hope he sleeps through the night. He hardly ate.<eos> And, you, go to sleep.<eos> All right, Torch. Let's figure out what you are.<eos> Oh, this is so exciting!<eos> Documenting a whole new species, learning all about it.
She's headed to surgery right now.<eos> I didn't think there'd be swimmers out there this time of year, you know?<eos> I guess I didn't see her, you know?<eos> My life is just so damn predictable, you know?<eos> I live right on the lake, and this morning, it dawned on me I've never even been in it, so I rented one of those mini speedboats.
Yeah, and I trust that you're gonna get in the car all by yourself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, Erin, I'm planning a new series on the city's leading lights.<eos> I'd love to include a photo of Manhattan's top ADA.<eos> Well, if I can be strangling you in it, then I'm in.
I imagine he prefers Elena the way she is.<eos> Nice try, Klaus, but I trust Damon a hell of a lot more than I trust you.<eos> And I trust no one.<eos> Which is why my sister is lying daggered in a box.<eos> The more who find out about the cure, the more will go after it.
Let me just remind you that the confidentiality agreement that you signed is punishable by termination and financial penalties.<eos> I understand.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> You... Will be getting an invitation in the mail soon.<eos> There will probably be elves on it.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I had a, uh, exceptionally bad night.<eos> And, um, mark is not answering... The phone.<eos> Yeah, you know, I get it. I get it.<eos> You know, I have a life, and I'm not focused on it.
- You want this vagina pillow?<eos> - I don't.<eos> We have so many.<eos> We have 13 vagina pillows.<eos> My entire bed looks like a bunch of women exploded on it.
By his late twenties, Siddhartha was becoming frustrated.<eos> He became sickened by his easy life, reflecting that even his comparative wealth wouldn't stop him from suffering, growing old and sick.<eos> And so he began to ask the fundamental questions.<eos> Life, what is it for?<eos> What is it about?
You asked him so many questions that at one point, he locked himself in the bathroom.<eos> A few days later, I gave you that yellow and blue toy stethoscope.<eos> And Corinne had the most well-monitored heart in the world.<eos> I didn't give you that, Sam.<eos> Every time you played with it, I wanted to tell you... where it was from.
- Sacrilege!<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't utter that word! It's God's name.<eos> We only say it to work miracles.<eos> - I only thought it.
As you say it, I will remember. He is a presomptuous ignorant!<eos> Man is the most despicable of your creatures, Lord!<eos> His only presence takes me away from Thou. No walk today?<eos> Sometimes, I'm hungry and thirsty.<eos> I forgot my body... this miserable recalled it to me. I won't eat anything before the sunset.
What am I supposed to think?<eos> That it's kinda cool in here.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> I love this place.<eos> Admit you didn't know about it.
Is that why you carry this?<eos> To survive?<eos> There's nothing illegal about wanting to protect myself, is there?<eos> Possession of a weapon with a double-edged blade over 4 inches is a felony -- two years in prison.<eos> Wonder if there's blood on it.
We're so used to the constant flood of bad news that we're desensitized.<eos> That's it.<eos> Turn on the news channel. We've got to give him more.<eos> More bad news? I can't take it!<eos> My heart already feels like it's got a fat chick sitting on it.
- Oh, Laurie.<eos> - Yeah. What if I was to tell you I had an apple in my pocket from lunch?<eos> So what?<eos> Who cares? What if I was to tell you this apple was so special you couldn't even look at it?<eos> What's so special about it?
No, it's not.<eos> But I couldn't aspire to much more...<eos> Until today.<eos> Last night I thought everything could change for me.<eos> I could even buy a huge bed and travel home on it, smiling and waving as I passed.
Come here, Sheldon.<eos> Sit here with me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like some homemade chili?<eos> Are there beans in it?
My mom just left.<eos> She's turning herself in.<eos> D.A. already called me to come down.<eos> She told me it was your mother that took the affidavit.<eos> Never should've mentioned it.
That'll cheer mom up.<eos> No, no, she's in a dark place. She has to work out her issues with "The Godfather" or "Taxi Driver."<eos> What about "Intolerance"?<eos> That pretty much sums up this situation.<eos> I was hoping to find one sympathetic pink party planner to advocate on your mom's behalf, get the party moved here from the trumps' so she could be a part of it.
Look at this thing.<eos> It's the size of la verga mía.<eos> I gotta take a picture of that.<eos> I love this town.<eos> Why didn't anybody tell me about it before?
I guess he was so excited to make the murder arrest, he just forgot.<eos> Great. Now the court's gonna throw out Albert's testimony.<eos> Gone, and now all we have is Naomi Chester.<eos> You know what sucks?<eos> A cop sees a murder and can't talk about it.
It's amazing.<eos> So is yours.<eos> It's snowing.<eos> Why is there a bed?<eos> Can we make love in it?
- it sounds pejorative?<eos> - Uh, your imagination.<eos> So now you're patronizing me?<eos> Okay, I'm not playing in this minefield.<eos> You're already in it, pal.
- Take it off!<eos> - Hey! What's going on?<eos> You think you're one of us, but you're not!<eos> - You're not even in the Greek system!<eos> - Not officially, but I live with the Greek system, and I work in it, too!
Simon, - please, don't fart in my T-shirt.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> In just 24 hours, Malia had pretty much broken me and Simon, so in a way I had to admire Jay and Neil as they rolled up the sleeves on their offensive T-shirts and dived straight back in.<eos> This place is mental.<eos> It's decadent, Neil, that's what they call it.
"The intruder yawned.<eos> "He put his gloved hand up to his face to cover his yawn.<eos> "He opened the door with the same hand using the handle."<eos> Gather up all your experience, officer.<eos> Bring it to the front of your mind and park it next to your anger and tell this jury that someone didn't wipe the handle clean before it was tested.
You lost one patient.<eos> And it wasn't your fault.<eos> What about that mom who gave her baby cancer ?<eos> If I'd figured that one out quicker, she'd still be a mom alive.<eos> She refused treatment when it was offered.
If I can't have a beer, I'll take a fancy drink with grass in it.<eos> - The mint is from our garden.<eos> - Well, good for you.<eos> You know, Kyle always used to be a big help in our yard.<eos> Except for that one time when he dumped a bunch of garbage on it.
Mr. Jordan is right.<eos> It is most important to hold onto power.<eos> The President's chair isn't comfortable.<eos> Even if it's full of pins,<eos> I still want to sit on it.
William had us followed?<eos> That's inconceivable to me.<eos> I wasn't even married to him at the time and William had Brody and me followed.<eos> So tell me, why are you giving me this photo?<eos> Well, because I think it's a good picture of you.
Lenka can sleep with me.. I do not feel comfortable with that...<eos> Honey...<eos> You do not have to feel like that..<eos> Do you know how big our bed is...<eos> 3 men can get into it..
Mr. ames is currently out of the country.<eos> This is just a courtesy visit on our end.<eos> You can direct any questions you have to me.<eos> A video has come into our possession taken the night of Rosie Larsen's murder.<eos> She's in it. So's your client.
You got your killer right there.<eos> Yeah, and you were terrified I was starting to believe him. If he was telling the truth about what time he came home that night...<eos> Then the security footage doesn't make sense.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, it's unlikely the electric company meddled with it.
♪ I won't go back ♪<eos> ♪ I love this too much ♪<eos> What is this place?<eos> Chinatown bus.<eos> Haven't you heard of it?
Lucky she got a full service.<eos> There's 10 funerals every hour these days- catching up with the backlog.<eos> Well, that's made us all feel better.<eos> You think if that blessing was so kind, it could've shown some sort of grace.<eos> Esther died right in front of it.
What this car is, is the opposite of a pop tart.<eos> Satisfied that I proved my point about the Yeti I was going to call it a day at this stage and head back to the studio.<eos> But then, I had a thought.<eos> You see, Roman Abramovich has probably been watching this and thinking.<eos> "Yes, that's a remarkable car, but could I land my helicopter on it?"
Come.<eos> Help me... do His will.<eos> We have been entrusted with the keys to His kingdom.<eos> The King of France must be aware, Ambassador, that we have placed the papal mitre in the hands of an ape.<eos> He has hopes, Cardinal, that the office brings its own grace with it, and that the grace of God can transform the worst of men.
Please maintain a distance Of at least three steps from the body.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this body is a no-Jane zone.<eos> It will not be a playground for you.<eos> You will not touch it or sniff it or place playing cards on it
Your call.<eos> You saw the news story on Hartley's body?<eos> Well, I lied.<eos> I did find the body.<eos> There is evidence on it,
Sorry.<eos> Still getting used to all this deception.<eos> What deception?<eos> You did find Hartley's body at a funeral home.<eos> Yes, but there was no blood evidence on it.
But in the universe, it's been playing out for almost 14 billion years,<eos> and it will have profound consequences.<eos> Because it means stars cannot shine forever, including the star at the centre of our solar system.<eos> At the end of its life, the sun won't simply fade away to nothing.<eos> As it begins to run out of fuel, its core will collapse, and the extra heat this generates will cause its outer layers to expand.
What's also fascinating is it's also thought that this may have been able to detect light, it may have had primitive cells that were sensitive to light and allowed it, in a very loose sense, to see.<eos> And if that's true, then this little guy may be our direct ancestor. And those little cells may be the things that evolved over hundreds of millions of years into our eyes.<eos> Without pikala, we may never have evolved and developed the ability to see how this story unfolded.<eos> Understanding the universe is like a detective story. And the evidence has been carried to us across vast expanses of space by light.<eos> We've even been able to capture the light from the beginning of time. And we've glimpsed in it the seeds of our own origins.
Are you serious?<eos> No, just until after the baby comes.<eos> Uh, it's all planned.<eos> It's, like, a month away.<eos> Honey, look, I want our wedding to be a celebration of us, but I-I want it to be a celebration that I can take part in, not just watch.
And your piece in last month's issue -- that arms dealer had corporate backing.<eos> You didn't go for the throat.<eos> Considering the geopolitics involved, your conclusion was my intention.<eos> You start now.<eos> Your job is to take care of everything in my life so that I don't have to think about living it.
No way!<eos> Unh-unh. This is America.<eos> And I am allowed to share my opinion whether you, Ms. C.E.O., like it or not.<eos> We will see you in court.<eos> I remember hearing about the murder when it happened.
Don't make me choose between you and my husband, spencer.<eos> Did she know that I was taking that class?<eos> She was there first.<eos> Why can't I just escape high school?<eos> Probably 'cause you're still in it.
- All right?<eos> - Really?<eos> So what I'm going to do is,<eos> - I'm going to say a word.<eos> And then I don't want you to think too much about it, nor say too much, except one word that you can relate to the word I am giving you.
And Holly Jackson, the first victim, was one of your subscribers?<eos> Yes, she'd been with us for about a year at the time of her death.<eos> Have you ever seen her application form?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything unusual about it?

You were being sad, weren't you?<eos> A little.<eos> No, I-I can't tell you how many hours I watched my brother playing this piano or passed out under it.<eos> One time I walked in and he was having sex on top of it.
It's real estate.<eos> We can't go wrong.<eos> The economy just keeps getting better, and better, and better!<eos> Oh, baby, I have such a good feeling about this place.<eos> I just want us to live in it together - forever and ever.
Guys, you've got no idea how much this means to me.<eos> You just made my summer.<eos> You're a pretty righteous guy, Barry.<eos> Hey, later on, we're gonna, like, build a nest in a tree...<eos> Yeah! We're gonna sit in it...
The juror in the back row, second from the right, what's she wearing?<eos> Tangerine top, almost matches her hair.<eos> How about the D.A., Miss Swatello?<eos> Gray pants, gray jacket, even her shoes -- everything is gray.<eos> The mural behind me -- what is it?
I'm not worried about that.<eos> Why wouldn't you?<eos> 'Cause I don't want to see where you're sleeping with my daughter.<eos> You've seen my apartment before.<eos> Not with the two of you in it.
I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's something called... Obsessive-compulsive disorder.<eos> Have you ever heard of it?
My God, look how old this is.<eos> You know what I like about the car?<eos> It's fun to drive.<eos> Fun to drive is what I like.<eos> I look good in it.
Not now, but I will.<eos> Really?<eos> You just keep working.<eos> You're doing excellent.<eos> You look good in it, and that's why you like this car?
His Belgian clients aren't buying the furniture.. But the heroin concealed inside.<eos> He exports a couch for 5000 Euro and.. A coffee table for 2000 Euro.<eos> Moreover, the timber that's imported..<eos> ..Is hardly used at all. Why does he even import it?<eos> He isn't buying the timber but the stuff within it.
You've heard Kelly Witsett called "bridezilla",<eos> "out of control," "crazy."<eos> But I am certain that you will feel differently after seeing what really happened.<eos> Objection!<eos> I move to exclude the video, as it is more prejudicial than probative.
It's not me, but you who are over-reacting.. ..regarding your worthless dream. -What's wrong with it?<eos> tell me. I want to hear it from you. -Let's walk under the shade..<eos> I thought you must have forgotten this rotten desire by now.<eos> It is not a rotten desire, but my dream.<eos> till it won't be fulfilled, I won't forget it.
Well, strictly speaking, mine is a pet funeral parlor.<eos> And mine is a crematorium.<eos> So we also bake and deliver delicious brick oven pizza.<eos> These three businessmen wrote a check today to fund West Side Story in completion, and are now assured full-page ads in the program for the musical.<eos> I'm a big fan of the show, just because there are so many deaths in it.
Ugh, so why the hell isn't it here?<eos> Sure this was his boat? Yeah.<eos> Last of the floating trash heaps he collected over the years.<eos> He sold it to Sal before he died.<eos> If the box was so important, how come he never mentioned it to you?
He took a photograph of Trish naked in our shower.<eos> Is that concrete enough for you?<eos> Did anyone see Fletcher take the picture?<eos> - No.<eos> - We'll have the lab test it for fingerprints and footprints outside your house.
One minute would be amazing.<eos> So, Leslie.<eos> You're a real native of Pawnee, aren't you?<eos> Yes, I was born and raised here, Joan.<eos> And I love the town so much, I literally wrote the book on it.
But you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.<eos> And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Is she safe, Mr. Reese?<eos> For now. A little shaken up.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> They're willing to kill for that recording.<eos> We need to find out what's on it.
They sacked that security guy, Frank Stevens, today.<eos> Yeah, I can't say I'm sad to see him go.<eos> The guy was pretty tightly wound.<eos> Well, he's their longest-standing employe no one's safe.<eos> Listen, I'm sure your party will be a big success, sorry I can't be there to see it.
Well, I've got some money stashed away, so we could go on that holiday.<eos> Get some sun.<eos> Should've kept the desk.<eos> Why's that?<eos> So we could shag on it.
And if you've asked anyone of my patients...<eos> They would say that you're an excellent doctor. That you're always there, always compassionate, measured, intuitive.<eos> But your patients are no replacement for your own life.<eos> I need to jump into a romantic relationship because you or Doctor Arthur say that I should?<eos> I was perfectly happy with my life before you started meddling with it. Okay?
It's really important I talk with Tom.<eos> He's not picking up his phone.<eos> Jeez, stalk much?<eos> Come on. Come on. I'm not a stalker.<eos> Seriously? My mom told me you were hiding under his bed while they were in it.
He'll be okay.<eos> Hey, breath.<eos> He'll be all right.<eos> Why was Mira so obsessed with getting her hands on this box?<eos> What's in it?
I mean, the old man is just a bureaucrat.<eos> He's not the type of person to overreach.<eos> You didn't think he was the type of guy that would ask in on a diamond deal, either, did you?<eos> Why would he blow up your car in front of my house?<eos> Because he thought I was gonna be in it.
Photoshop my face out.<eos> So now I'm a fotomat?<eos> Lydia's awake, Nolan.<eos> If she remembers this picture, she's gonna start looking for it.<eos> I need her to believe that it wasn't me.
The only dreams I ever remember are of food.<eos> One night I dreamed that my husband was made of chocolate.<eos> Then his snoring woke me up.<eos> So I ate a bag of Oreos in the bathroom.<eos> Well, you're going to love this diet, because it lets you love food, obsess over it, dream about it, even put it in your mouth.
Most of the time, the 458 is faster than the FF<eos> But, if you encounter a puddle of... wee you really do need four-wheel drive, or you could be in big trouble<eos> So, how do we sum this car up?<eos> I think on a track, it's out of its depth It's too big, and it's too soft<eos> And I think, having pounded round in it all day there is a question mark over its brakes
- Can I get $50 more?<eos> - No<eos> What about $30 more?<eos> Can I get $100 more?<eos> - It's got plenty of porn on it - l've got plenty of porn, too
Ultimately, it's about giving comfort to the living... any way we can.<eos> How'd the knife fragment get in his thigh?<eos> It was carried down the aorta and then lodged right here in the femoral artery, and voila.<eos> The murder weapon.<eos> Even better... it's got trace on it.

What are those things up there?<eos> That's a ouija board.<eos> You put the paper in through here.<eos> In this slot here you put a pen.<eos> You put your hands on it like this, see?
And you are one of the service personnel.<eos> Service personnel?<eos> You are a copywriter, aren't you?<eos> That means you are one of those who force people to gaze into the consuming fire.<eos> You must admit that, it's better to warm yourself by the fire, than to burn in it.
one-two, tickety-boo, and screw all that staring.<eos> So's they won't think... all we've done in Russia is heist the money and put up a steel door.<eos> So's they can feel the same kind of spirit like in '45 at Stalingrad, you get me?<eos> So there you go.<eos> At first the task hadn't seemed very complicated, but once I'd sat down to it I'd been horrified to realise there wasn't a single idea in my head.
No, just the one.<eos> The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!<eos> But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!<eos> Cool!<eos> What makes it so super?
- Any wallet will do? - Mm-hmm.<eos> All right. So why do you carry this picture of Mom?<eos> To remind me of her.<eos> Mm-hmm. And experience the positive affects that these memories evoke. - Yeah.<eos> Now, if this picture existed but you had no awareness of it, would you still be able to benefit from its existence?
I have a life. A job.<eos> What do you do, then?<eos> I stage apartments.<eos> Stage apartments, now that's... That's... What's that?<eos> Well, when somebody is selling an apartment or a home, I bring stuff in and make it look as beautiful as it can look.
Give it to mommy.<eos> Sorry, but it's not a big deal.<eos> I saw my first porn when I was his age.<eos> How are you, kiddo?<eos> But your dad wasn't starring in it!
No, thank you.<eos> Your first book was good, Joanna.<eos> You know I think you might just have ruined this kitchen for me.<eos> How?<eos> By being in it.
A name did come up, though.<eos> Hal Leuco.<eos> That ring any bells?<eos> No.<eos> Never heard of it?
Yeah, I'll get right on that.<eos> Ta-dah!<eos> Presenting the Watchdawg.<eos> Wow, that is awesome.<eos> This thing plays MP3s, music videos, also takes photographs, but here's the most unique thing about it...
Hell of a thing.<eos> Yep, you can say that.<eos> Listen Walter, I don't want to be stepping on your toes, so we're going to try and be in and out, okay?<eos> You know that lake pretty good?<eos> Practically born in it.
You know, if we're talking about the same things, then you were right alongside me.<eos> I'm just not ashamed of myself. All right. I never would have done those things if you weren't in my life.<eos> Heh heh! We have this joke that our offices are built over the mouth of hell.<eos> Well, if that's true, he's the devil.<eos> Do you have any idea how boring your life would be if I wasn't in it?
We've been had!<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> To lure us away.<eos> Maybe the radiation device Was just a story.<eos> There was nothing about it in that capsule I analyzed.
I won't be free of these people until the day they die.<eos> Well, I have to say I'm a little disappointed.<eos> I pegged you as a professional, but clearly, you lack the necessary artistry.<eos> Bossman, have you seen this face?<eos> It ain't nothing but art.
Oh, please, God, no.<eos> Gene, where are you?<eos> And there you go.<eos> Oh, that's just phantom pain.<eos> Your body's in way too much shock to comprehend how much pain it's actually in.
"Sucks".<eos> Are you vandalising that mirror?<eos> Er... no.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I saw you writing on it.
Is the tech You're looking for in the lab?<eos> The pineal gland!<eos> The seat of consciousness.<eos> I made it the seat of destruction.<eos> How many people do you think can sit on it before it breaks?
You're from the Ukraine?<eos> Yes.<eos> Whereabout?<eos> Small town, Pavlivka.<eos> No one's ever heard of it.
- No one cares!<eos> Why did you show up?<eos> Everything was fine before!<eos> Let's get hold of that video.<eos> They're on it too.
When Donna was killed, those things you said to me in the hospital about my life being a series of hit and runs... that my face was the only one you saw...<eos> I shouldn't have said that shit.<eos> It was the truth!<eos> I have created this very serious life for myself.<eos> And when I'm inside it, I barely know myself.
I'm assuming you didn't either.<eos> Kristin was a phony, stuck-up bitch.<eos> That's what I didn't like.<eos> Is that why you ripped the photo off her locker?<eos> We found your prints on it.
you need better role models than your mother and I have been.<eos> Uncle Bryan and Jaspar?<eos> I have nothing in common with them.<eos> Bryan is the principal of the best high school in the country.<eos> What is so best about it?
Fantastic.<eos> We had a great time.<eos> In fact, so great that we've decided to move there.<eos> We didn't plan it.<eos> We were just walking around. We saw an apartment, fell in love with it and put a deposit down before we left. But, Sarah, honey, do either of you have a job set up?
- Man, Zeke. This is a real mess.<eos> - Yeah, it's an old mess.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> I mean, this is what happens when wrongs go unrighted.<eos> They fester.
What are you doing?<eos> You can not do that because you're not wearing any clothes.<eos> Let's go... Let's go buy some clothes.<eos> What do these women wear into battle?<eos> They don't...
I haven't told that boy anything.<eos> I didn't think it safe.<eos> The sacks of saltpetre in the barn were stolen.<eos> Why burden him?<eos> They were stolen from the Honourable East India Company.
You know, there's always that one rare exception,<eos> Why are you here?<eos> - Book club.<eos> - You read?<eos> Yeah. And so do they.
Hey, Foster.<eos> Can't wait for gay sex ed at your house.<eos> - Are your moms teaching?<eos> - No.<eos> Are they gonna do a little show-and-tell?
Uh, yeah.<eos> Look around.<eos> We are in the hotbed of supernatural energy, with the artifacts and books and talismans and the God knows what else.<eos> I mean, witches literally eat that up.<eos> They siphon it without trying.
I understand.<eos> And I care about Damon.<eos> He knows you do.<eos> I don't want to fail them, but I can't fail my daughters.<eos> And they need their mother.
Oh.<eos> Nice ink.<eos> So you like high school girls, do you?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You get older, they stay the same age.
I think they're bilking us.<eos> Hasil, this is our way.<eos> We give freely and we can't afford more enemies.<eos> You know, you spent too much time down there.<eos> All I'm saying is, what if they're up to something else?
Those faces, what are they?<eos> Is that what you should be asking?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The game of faces didn't turn out so well for the last person who asked me questions.<eos> Tell me what they are!
Who's gonna lose any sleep over that?<eos> I'll call my real estate agent first thing in the morning.<eos> Well, like the man said, life is a nightmare that prevents one from sleeping, so... sleep well.<eos> You know how the Mayan calendar ended in 2012? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Well, the problem is, you can't predict specific years from the stars, because they don't actually move, but if we could map the position of the planets in our solar system, wouldn't we be able to figure it out?
Tell me, Poldark, what are your ambitions?<eos> To live as I want, to raise a family, care for the people around me, to be unencumbered of debt...<eos> I think you underestimate your talents.<eos> I am wholly aware of my capabilities.<eos> I am also aware they are not for sale.
The agreement's pretty clear on that.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna fall apart. I think we can all relax about that.<eos> Kyle, the issue is that she knows everything about you that nobody's supposed to know.<eos> I think it's smart to have boundaries in place.<eos> Okay, but I want to be the one to figure out what they are.
Two hearts?<eos> You send a rocketload of intelligent robots up ahead of you.<eos> They build you a place to live, so that, when you arrive, it's all waiting. This is brilliant!<eos> You've got two hearts?<eos> Robots, they don't breathe.
I'll bring you the results. I'll wait here this time, if you don't mind.<eos> Your mother saved my life.<eos> Twice.<eos> Once from a sword wound right here, and the other from a malady in my head.<eos> She makes me drink these foul concoctions, but they have banished my headaches.
Can't we try and find a way?<eos> He seemed appeased by my offer To give him our bottled reserves.<eos> No!<eos> We might need them. We can replenish from our wells.<eos> And when they go dry?
Well, wait a minute.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We're moving.<eos> Guys, no, we need to stay together here.<eos> Well, why the hell do we have rules, if they don't apply to everybody?
Not so allegedly anymore?<eos> Maya Zapala, one of our other rape victims...<eos> - What about her?<eos> - I was checking to see if any of the victims had ever accused anyone else of rape.<eos> But they weren't lying.
We can barely treat the patients we have.<eos> - Why would I want more?<eos> - The V.A. pays for them, which means you will have a steady flow of patients and money.<eos> And those government checks?<eos> They don't bounce.
All right, they're distracted, let's go!<eos> Quick! We just have to get rid of the queen!<eos> She's in the hive!<eos> What's that gonna do?<eos> The bees instinctively stay with the queen, so if she's gone, they'll follow her!
Now, look at us.<eos> We didn't have no roots either.<eos> Somehow... we found our way.<eos> Simone is one thing, but Star, I don't know.<eos> Yeah, but they just got here.
- And Jamie Yarsky makes way more than me, and you know why.<eos> Carol...<eos> Sexism in the workplace.<eos> And, you know, I could sue.<eos> Do you know who sends you the envelopes or where they come from?
Piss hot, blow my parole.<eos> Okay, this is what you do.<eos> You tell them that you've been sick.<eos> You take 6 Sudafed PEs.<eos> They make you piss hot, too.
One of the biggest weapons in the intelligence community's arsenal is our general belief that the US government couldn't possibly keep a secret this big from the American public.<eos> But the existence of the National Reconnaissance Office remained secret for over 30 years.<eos> The mere existence of the NSA, jokingly referred to as "No Such Agency," was kept secret, until it grew so large that it was quite conspicuous.<eos> And those working in the Manhattan Project developing the atom bomb were told that any secrets that they disclose would result in ten years in prison, or an equivalent of a $100,000 fine.<eos> Only when the weapons were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were.
You believe you are my grandson?<eos> I have memories, recollections that were never part of my life.<eos> Do you now?<eos> Do you know these faces?<eos> Were they part of your life?
And then I started thinking about my raise.<eos> 16%.<eos> That's an odd number.<eos> And then I thought it's exactly half of the difference between what you and I make.<eos> I went down to the ladies in accounting, and they never talked to Cooper.
And I'm sitting there at A red light,<eos> Just waiting, waiting.<eos> But, still, I sat there.<eos> That's when I realized It's not about technology, It's not about machines.<eos> It's about what They're doing to us.
Did you drug their drinks?<eos> It's called a kamikaze.<eos> Women dig them.<eos> So, they asked to be drugged?<eos> Look, the reason they came back with us is 'cause they wanted to party, okay?
Of looking for respect for change, of questioning things.<eos> WIND<eos> And I think that the right can be recognized...<eos> CUP 2014 ...as the opposite of that, as refusing the changes and maintaining traditions at all costs, just because they are traditions.<eos> Conservatism as formulated today admits changes as long as they are very slow.
Is Mommy really working in America?<eos> What?<eos> Of course.<eos> She sends you cards on your birthdays.<eos> Then why aren't they stamped?
Oh, gol, gol, gol. Mexico looks pretty clear.<eos> Yeah, there's only one down there, but this book was written in 1998, so who knows how many there are now?<eos> What other choice do we have?<eos> But those things are everywhere. How the hell are we gonna get down there?<eos> All we have to do is get past this little ring of nukes, and if they haven't popped their tops, I believe we're good to go.
- T.C.<eos> - Don't say a word.<eos> Look, I was just out talking with that guy and, um... after he had a grenade in his belly, he realized that life was short.<eos> And so, you should get that treatment.<eos> You're stubborn and reckless, and you don't think that the rules apply to you, but they...
Vlad Dracula?<eos> An old family.<eos> The capital?<eos> All run by the great houses.<eos> And they're not even the worst.
This is Rose and Lily's story, and you won't let them do anything.<eos> - They go to Dunkirk.<eos> - And Johnnie pilots them home.<eos> They're girls. Girls don't want to be the hero.<eos> They want to have the hero. They want to be had by him.
At the bar?<eos> Let's go over there, say hello. - Come on!<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I can't. I can't.<eos> They're working girls, Max.
- Skyping in the rest of the bachelor party!<eos> - Get off the table!<eos> I'm acting.<eos> Ben, I want you to meet my new lady friends.<eos> They love to get loose and party, but they are not prostitutes.
Oh, yeah, that's in sinai.<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Jeez, it's incredible.<eos> I love these things, they...
Praise his name. I've been praying, and I've been praying all day for the Lord to hear my troubles.<eos> I've asked him... And I know that he wants me to help those people.<eos> I know that he wants me to save those that need to be saved.<eos> Especially the women.<eos> They are ripe with sin.
Don't force us to carry out those traditional sex roles.<eos> We have the same rules set up for men that they've always lived by, that you need to protect and provide at any cost.<eos> But we've changed everything where it concerns women.<eos> They now have access to everything men have always had access to...<eos> To education, to work, to whatever they want to do, but they're not the ones drmng the semis and they're not the ones in the coal mines.
They have postulated that masculinity is a disease.<eos> Feminists aren't the only problem.<eos> The problems didn't start with feminism.<eos> So when I start criticizing feminism, 1 want you to know you're just part of the problem.<eos> They're just part of the problem.
You're looking handsome these days.<eos> I could eat you...<eos> Got any hot sauce?<eos> Santa, what I'm here for, why you have those fridges on your porch?<eos> 'Cause I eat a lot and they break.
Those women, what do they do for you?<eos> You don't talk about it.<eos> Tell me.<eos> We spend some time together.<eos> They know.
And your name?<eos> - My name is Hank Thompson.<eos> - We're here with Hank Thompson...<eos> And that's Manny.<eos> He saved my life with his amazing body, and he has these powers, and they're the only reason that I'm standing here today,
There's no surf in Michigan.<eos> Not fair.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> Some things you can't change, baby.<eos> No matter how unfair they are.
Oh! Cocoa-flavoured buttercream and a rogue splinter of chocolate button?<eos> You are slipping up, Sister.<eos> You missed a bit!<eos> I chanced upon some water biscuits.<eos> They have no lure for rats.
No matter how many times I come here, it always looks like this, which means the prophecy was wrong.<eos> We don't stop the H.E.L.E.<eos> This is only one timeline.<eos> Your father said there are many possible futures.<eos> What if they're all wrong?
And second, it was Chloe that was tipping off the Greenies about the loggers' plans.<eos> Get fingerprints to scan it.<eos> We've got a few different tire marks around the piggery, some fairly fresh that don't match Chloe's ute.<eos> Check every logger's tires, including Max Holloway.<eos> Speaking of tyre marks, where are they?
You've seen it.<eos> The twin moons, shifting time... -...the seeds have dislocated everything.<eos> Seeds?<eos> You mean the spheres?<eos> What are they doing?
Any nigger driving a Porsche who doesn't have a $300 suit on, you can always stop... Anything out of a nigger's mouth, the first five sentences is a lie. People don't want Mexicans.<eos> They don't want anybody but good people.<eos> Doesn't Ito have an impossible decision on his hands?<eos> The judge has no choice. He has to play the tapes.<eos> They exist.
Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me.<eos> You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.<eos> You did it because it felt good.<eos> I understand.<eos> I do things because they feel good.
They could be Terry's.<eos> He was fat once, you know?<eos> What the hell, Boyle?<eos> Speaking of Jeffords, maybe your daughters would like to know that their daddy throws away all their drawings?<eos> They just draw so many, and they're all so bad.
We don't feed them dried cat food or anything artificial.<eos> My therapist says I try to heal my own wounds by healing theirs.<eos> By feeding them and tending to their needs.<eos> My wounds must be so deeply rooted... they still haven't healed despite all this.<eos> I guess I'll heal when they heal.
Come on, here.<eos> Have you seen what you did to my car?<eos> - You think you're fucking hot shit, don't you?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> They definitely think they're fucking hot shit.
And where are you going in such a clumsy hurry?<eos> I have a lunch, if that's okay.<eos> That's cute.<eos> Assistants don't have lunch, Liza.<eos> They fetch lunch.
I'm okay.<eos> This weirdly feels like my wedding.<eos> All the same people are here.<eos> Except for those girls.<eos> Who are they?
Hey, Moses.<eos> Best view of the city.<eos> Great show last night.<eos> Saw you talking up them girls.<eos> Um-um, they were talking up me, my friend.
Uh, Jane, I gotta go. I have a patient, but um...<eos> We'll talk soon, ok?<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> Give me a friggin' break.<eos> If you did bad things but don't remember, are they still part of who you are?
Tinkerbell wasn't a trickster.<eos> Yeah, that's different.<eos> She wasn't real.<eos> I see. So real fairies are tricksters.<eos> Yeah, they're good.
Fuck happened here?<eos> What happened?<eos> I just asked you that.<eos> Is... where are they? Where'd the girls go?<eos> They did this?
It's like getting stabbed in the tea bag with a butter knife, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, but who knows? You know, he might still come up with something.<eos> Yeah, what if he doesn't?<eos> Well, let's just say at that point your options are...<eos> well, they're limited.
You can't take them.<eos> They-- those are my babies!<eos> We asked you to make them stop barking.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> They bark.
I don't know. I think it's sort of fun.<eos> Uh, you know what? That's fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey. We had a deal. We were getting somewhere with Darius, and now those bitches can vote me off?<eos> They hate me, Chet.
Hey, y'all, um, I'm Ledda Dobbs, and, uh, as y'all probably know, um, my husband, Breece, is a miner.<eos> And he's out of work.<eos> Look. I'm all for jobs. I am.<eos> But these mountains, they...<eos> they don't belong to us.
It's like he scraped me out of my own skull.<eos> Even when I tried killing him, he beat me.<eos> My powers are nothing compared to Hive.<eos> I don't give a damn about your powers.<eos> They're not what made you an agent.
Please?<eos> What are you writing?<eos> An idea for a short story.<eos> A young girl grows up on the shores of a lake, as you have done.<eos> She loves the lake, as the gulls do and she is as free and as happy as they are.
I understand.<eos> Stay for just one more drink?<eos> And then decide.<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> If Mom hid the clues, I don't know what they are.
So that you and her will get back together, and she'll be out of Lucifer's life.<eos> You're not from around here, are you?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You can't just smash two people together like Barbies, and think that that's gonna fix things.<eos> Relationships, they take time and effort.
Why go to all this trouble for dolls?<eos> Oh, come now, Detective.<eos> I have to keep some mysteries for myself.<eos> Enjoy your dolls.<eos> They're gone.
Yeah, that's it.<eos> Uh, jet black hair, lots of piercings and tattoos.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah, generic Satanist.<eos> What about the, uh, subdermals... she know what they mean?
Uh, I thought we agreed on "personal assistant"?<eos> And the Von Falconburgh sisters are not tarts.<eos> They are the most popular queens in all the seven realms.<eos> I remember the first time I saw them.<eos> I was just a little girl, and they passed through my village.
The reason why your dad is so attached to these ducks is they remind him of you guys.<eos> We got to get them home.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Where are they?
There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> So I told you this job had to be on my terms.<eos> Have you seen what the papers are saying after you dropped the Dolly Sisters on me?<eos> You've had some great publicity.<eos> No, no, they have and you have.
Somebody who used to be in Morra's camp?<eos> And then branched off with Sands, but this time, he made a new version of NZT, and named it after himself.<eos> Which means tracking down Apocryphon might lead us to Piper.<eos> So all we need to do...<eos> Is trace these pills back to wherever they came from.
You do know why Amaru killed the Lords.<eos> [Richie] They ate her, they kept her blood, which is how it got into Kate.<eos> Did you know that she kept the bones?<eos> Lemme guess.<eos> Venganza's the only one who knows where they are.
We're trying to catch a monster, not plan a family reunion.<eos> - But what if she's still in there?<eos> - Richard.<eos> Stop.<eos> I know a thing or two about souls and they can hang around.
You know what I just realized?<eos> We have enough doughnut holes for all of you to have one more each!<eos> Right?<eos> Dig in, everyone.<eos> Guys, they've been there for hours.
Fastest way to the roof is this express elevator.<eos> We're not going up, Dmitri.<eos> We're taking the service elevator down to the garage.<eos> Then who are the choppers for?<eos> Why aren't they landing?
Your target is Elizabeth Keen.<eos> This is about avenging what happened to Liz, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes.<eos> Nez Rowan... who let her go free?<eos> There are certain U.S. Government missions.<eos> They require the expertise of an independent organization.
What did she find out?<eos> She wouldn't tell me.<eos> Is this something to do with those implant things?<eos> The "maggot-bots"?<eos> Yes, they're part of it.
She wouldn't tell me.<eos> Is this something to do with those implant things?<eos> The "maggot-bots"?<eos> Yes, they're part of it.<eos> Yes, yes, what are they for?
More matches, Mom?<eos> No, I created a profile for your dad.<eos> Later we'll laugh about how we can never leave each other because it's really bad out there and...<eos> Oh, my God, Mike could get models.<eos> They're, like, 20 years younger with tattoos and piercings.
- What's going on with us?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ever since the girls came back, things have changed.<eos> I know, but why?<eos> It's not like they're babies.
So we pour water around the base of the poles.<eos> The water instantly freezes into a solid block of ice, and not even the wind can blow it over.<eos> Makes sense, but how do we melt ice in the Antarctic Circle?<eos> Back in the hut, there are crates of MREs from McMurdo!<eos> They come with mini heating units to warm food and drinks!
Yep. You were right about that, too.<eos> Man.<eos> I've made a real mess of this.<eos> I was told there'd be consequences.<eos> And here they are.
Uh, I need to be there.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Are you trying to give me a heart attack?<eos> I know what to look for.<eos> I mean, they may have been ground into sediment or...
Don't make any mistakes with your maids of honour.<eos> - Young girls can be so flighty.<eos> - Really?<eos> You cannot be too careful with these appointments.<eos> They set the tone for the whole court.
I can do that.<eos> I just... I think it'd be fair if you do the same with me.<eos> - Ophelia...<eos> - Look, it seems to me that these burglaries aren't just a one-off.<eos> Could really send some people into a panic if they found out that they were all related.
- Rowby, can you show us how you composed "Good Morning Magic Sunshine"?<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> - No, I'd like to see this.<eos> Uh, so this is SuperScribe.<eos> I play notes on the keyboard, and then they just populate into sheet music in real time.
Who's that?<eos> Teddy Ballard.<eos> OK, now, this is quite exciting.<eos> It would appear that Teddy Ballard had set up philanthropic schools for orphans in Africa, Ghana, for kids who had lost their parents during the civil war.<eos> Now, Amanda's dad paid for the schools, but they were run by the church, and some of the bright kids were brought back here to England to go to school.
Hey Dad?<eos> Down here.<eos> This isn't ominous or anything.<eos> All basements are ominous, honey.<eos> That's why they're underneath the house, and not in the living room.
I mean, who even cares about this stuff?<eos> Um, a nation full of people.<eos> Women and young girls.<eos> Well, I'm not their role model or their personal stylist.<eos> I just do what I do and they should, too.
Your mom, she didn't need to die like that.<eos> All that sneaking around got you nowhere.<eos> My agent's on a plane right now flying to his death.<eos> Built his whole life on secrets.<eos> They ate him up.
You lost?<eos> Where are the women?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Nice place.<eos> So where are they?
I'm in bed with two different women...<eos> literally. And we're done here.<eos> Do you know what it took for me to get that information?<eos> I need your help, Abby.<eos> Who are they?
Why hurt Melissa?<eos> She only wanted to save her marriage.<eos> They all do.<eos> Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn.<eos> I mean, a month, a year, however long later, they all come back -- same story, different man.
Your Honor, may I continue?<eos> - Go for it.<eos> - Was the leak of the Foil a marketing stunt, as Anthony Dudewitz alleges?<eos> Hmm. Anthony's currency is, um, conspiracy theories.<eos> They make for fun segments on Discovery Channel, but they don't comport with reality.
They were Nazi communications that puzzle historians to this day, and they speak of a superweapon obtained by the Ahnenerbe, said to be strong enough to win the war.<eos> Yeah? What was it?<eos> Well, uh, these memos refer to it as..<eos> "The Hand of God."<eos> I mean, that was sort of a catchall term for several objects he touched on earth in biblical times, but they're believed to contain traces of his power.
Thanks, doc.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Eh, we couldn't figure out a way to get out of it.<eos> That's why we bought chocolate and flowers.<eos> Oh, and where are they?
[Seth] Claire, you have to be careful here.<eos> This world is sensitive.<eos> -He got hit by a car!<eos> -[female #2] I said, come here!<eos> It's Dramaworld, man! Cancer, memory loss, hit and runs... they're all just furthering the story.
You don't speak the language, but you know who's in power, who's at fault, who's scared, who's amused.<eos> We can teach her, and she can teach us.<eos> Beverly, now, the last time we talked, you were having a hard time with your marigolds.<eos> I'm telling you stick with it.<eos> They keep the pests away.
And there we go.<eos> Do you know where you are, Stefan?<eos> I'm in hell.<eos> _<eos> They didn't know.
- So you drank with high school boys when you were 13 years old.<eos> - Sure.<eos> We used to jump in cars and drive out to Rockaway Beach, build a great big fire and drink gin or whatever anybody had.<eos> I was 13.<eos> I mean, the other girls were older, but I looked just as good as they did.
It's our fourth anniversary.<eos> Really?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> We got the roses from Grace.<eos> Actually, they're from both of us.
We got the roses from Grace.<eos> Actually, they're from both of us.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> No.<eos> They're not.
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> But this marriage happened after the ballistics testing you did for the SA's office?<eos> - ‭Did you give Governor Florrick a preliminary report on these bullets<eos> - before they disappeared?
Right, okay, and I thought that I'd take initiative and donate mine first.<eos> You're being the bigger man.<eos> That's great.<eos> I'm just saying, you should probably throw them away.<eos> See, socks, they're like Social Security numbers and diapers.
We don't know, do we?<eos> We've never protested about anything.<eos> Or ever cared about anything.<eos> Uh-uh. Not true. We care about hot girls.<eos> If they're protesting, so are we.
The, um, "Pink Panther" dude.<eos> Yeah. "Being There."<eos> What?<eos> Are there gonna be any girls at this arty-farty thing?<eos> They're generally part of the equation.
Please, help him.<eos> You're lucky to have a fiance who cares so much.<eos> Yeah, she's really special.<eos> All Radley adoptions were closed adoptions which means I can't access them in this database.<eos> - Where are they?
Right before he disappeared, people saw Pete diddling two different women in public, separate occasions.<eos> You mean they actually saw him in the act?<eos> What does "diddling" mean to you?<eos> Uh, Pete was never a showman, but apparently, Doris Kagen and Missy Petersen brought out the hog in him.<eos> Doris and Melissa -- uh, Missy -- they disappeared that year, too.
You asked, and if you're gonna get all judgy about it, you might as well have the details.<eos> "Judgy"?<eos> I date women on my phone.<eos> Using apps.<eos> They click, I click, and then if we click...
Dumpy!<eos> Huh! Will this lead to a police case?<eos> - No-no.<eos> But we won't spare those girls.<eos> Look at what they did.
But for the others... uh... some of them just need a little help.<eos> Right?<eos> ♪ Still sweatin' from the rush ♪<eos> ♪ His body tense ♪<eos> ♪ His hands, they... ♪
Calm down! Calm down, okay.<eos> Calm down!<eos> Just.. come on, let's go.<eos> Oh, my God. Your hands are bleeding.<eos> They are bleeding.
Hmm?<eos> 'Cause their little faces don't scream Grim Reaper to me.<eos> I've spent almost a century searching for the right offering.<eos> Trust me,<eos> - they're perfect.
'Cause their little faces don't scream Grim Reaper to me.<eos> I've spent almost a century searching for the right offering.<eos> Trust me,<eos> - they're perfect.<eos> - They're toddlers.
I don't know where.<eos> I just need to do something.<eos> Caroline, if something happens to those girls....<eos> - I know.<eos> - Look, they shouldn't be living this life.
Gibbs.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Look at those beauties.<eos> Your handy work, Popeye?<eos> They're not done yet.
- Are you writing a legal brief?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm writing an essay to get onto the law journal about the race bias within the local police force.<eos> Are you using these cases to support your thesis?<eos> 'Cause they don't work.
The truth is the government exists solely for corruption.<eos> So these amounts we hear about in the papers and on TV... 700 billion.<eos> 1000 billion... 2000 billion...<eos> These bizarre, inconceivable amounts, do they even...<eos> Yes they exist.
It's a really big opportunity.<eos> Zander, they don't care. - Hey...<eos> - Yeah, I'm telling you good news here, man.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> They're living their lives.
I wish I was as good as Mer at forgetting things.<eos> My life would be a lot easier if I was.<eos> Okay, she does not forget things. She buries them.<eos> She thinks they're gone, but trust me... they are not gone.<eos> They're gonna come back.
Metaphysics aren't real, it's just thought.<eos> Thought, yes.<eos> Everything in the universe is conserved, everything, even belief.<eos> Get millions of creatures believing something strongly enough for long enough and even space responds.<eos> You are quite right that the Arn weren't exactly wild creatures, but parts of them were and they dream like us of what comes after.
What are you guys talking about?<eos> That show used to give me the worst nightmares...<eos> Those puppets.<eos> I used to have this really weird recurring dream.<eos> They would just be screaming.
I don't want them spilling.<eos> When one is a woman of a certain age, one becomes subject to all manner of tedious lectures about what one should and shouldn't be.<eos> I'm supposed to no longer have any particular needs, wants, or appetites.<eos> My fires are supposed to be out.<eos> But they rage unchecked.
You know who you are.<eos> There are no ones.<eos> Ones are as rare as tens.<eos> I've seen about five ones in my life.<eos> They...
Ones are as rare as tens.<eos> I've seen about five ones in my life.<eos> They...<eos> Ones don't really leave the house.<eos> They... they know they upset the rest of us.
- Fine.<eos> Maybe a little strange I guess.<eos> - He's so cocky and braggadocios.<eos> And like he thinks he's so cute because of his tiny t-shirt, and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms.<eos> And he flirts with all the girls and like, they believe it.
- Is everything okay?<eos> - Uh huh.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - He's so cocky and braggadocios, and like he thinks he's so cute because of his tiny t-shirt, and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms.<eos> And he flirts with all the girls and like, they believe it.
We could draw healthy cells from his bone marrow.<eos> Use growth factor to grow them into microphages.<eos> And then we inject the microphages<eos> - back into the alcoholic liver...<eos> - And they'd repair the damaged liver from within.
- Hey.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy right now.<eos> I've some female companions over, you know.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> What are they, like, some nerdy Sci-Fi fans, or...
- Apply this.<eos> - Oh, hello!<eos> You know we've been saying how bad the roads are, Hammond?<eos> Yes.<eos> They're bad enough to kill an un-killable car.
Jake, you done good, kid.<eos> Glad I took you along for the ride.<eos> Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! All right, give it up for Charles.<eos> Yeah! No, give it up for the devil sticks.<eos> - They're the real heroes here.
PC load letter?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> The sheer audacity of a printer that won't print.<eos> I have a brown belt, dumbass!<eos> Kind of makes you wish for the good old days... before printers, and the rage they created ever existed.
You know, bees are genetically designed to recognize royalty.<eos> Royalty?<eos> You are in for a surprise when you find out what I do for a living.<eos> It's not what you do it's what you are.<eos> They sense it.
Yeah, actually, your girls are looking incredible out there.<eos> Have they asked about me?<eos> When I told them that you were here, their eyes filled with this, like, sparkle, you know, with, like, childlike wonder, and then they just started dancing together.<eos> - It was kind of beautiful. - Yeah, it was.<eos> Do they do other things together that I might be able to join in on or just watch?
Wonderful.<eos> This is very, very bad for business.<eos> That was amazing!<eos> The stars are back.<eos> I forgot how beautiful they are.
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.<eos> (Nancy) You never really wanted to be totally inside our marriage.<eos> Nor outside it, either.<eos> You were sincere in the promises you made.<eos> Still... they didn't come from your heart.
Which is the way it's supposed to be.<eos> (Joseph) Find the light you know in the east. As a child.<eos> The moon.<eos> The stars.<eos> They serve you.
I love you.<eos> I have loved you since the first time I saw you.<eos> Why are you helping the demons?<eos> "Demons"?<eos> I help them because they have helped me.
How long do we have?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Chris, how long do girls stay at parties?<eos> Well, dude, hot girls don't stay at parties long.<eos> They go to multiple ones, like five or six a night.
- How long do we have?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was there the whole time.<eos> Well, dude, hot girls don't stay at parties long.<eos> They go to multiple ones, like five or six a night.
We gotta have rules.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So what are they?
- anything to hurt you guys!<eos> - David!<eos> You won't even remember this happened!<eos> Hot girls don't stay at parties long.<eos> They go to, like, multiple ones.
You focused on your beauty more than your oath!<eos> You cannot put your life at stake since you love yourself so much.<eos> You are not worthy of this honour, leave us!<eos> These tears are not a reflection of my cowardice nor do they come from pain.<eos> They are a testament to my boiling blood.
Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.<eos> Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence and why, upon this blasted heath, you stop our way with such prophetic greeting.<eos> Speak, I charge you.<eos> The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and these are of them.<eos> Whither are they vanished?
Im not a suffragette.<eos> Im glad.<eos> You know they say that the way in which certain types of women have acted in the past months gives a good deal of colour to the argument that the mental equilibrium of the female sex is less than that of the males.<eos> Theres no madness in it.<eos> They know exactly what theyre doing.
Ma...<eos> Eggsnake's our longest friend and fanciest.<eos> Meltedy Spoon's the best to eat with because he's more blobbier.<eos> Labyrinth is the twistiest.<eos> And she hides things so I don't know where they are.
And we've got a pulpit, in a way, to tell it from.<eos> It's so weird to be doing all this and it's... distracting and it's challenging and you wanna do the right thing, and then it's all about Ross.<eos> And then we go and we see him and hug him and talk to him and hold his hand and it's just like Ross, you know?<eos> It's such a disconnect, and... it's just so hard to see him in there.<eos> Being in the prison, visiting, it's a very emotional experience, because there are all these families there and they get to see their loved one one hour a week.
As a lawman in these parts, son, let me give you two pieces of friendly advice.<eos> What's that?<eos> Don't say howdy.<eos> And two, you watch out for these two ladies.<eos> They are dangerous with a capital D.
Oh, I walked out of here a different person.<eos> Yeah, well... So I thought.<eos> And then Prudence miraculously shows up.<eos> Right, first they tell you, it's impossible. Next thing, you're swimming in babies, two in one year.<eos> You know women, they make their decisions and men, we just do our best not to be men.
There's no sign of them.<eos> Check this out. I thought the fucker would bleed out and die.<eos> Tell me where Lu is, Patrick.<eos> Fucking sealed up the wounds in just a few hours.<eos> We thought they were dying, but they're evolving.
Easy!<eos> Suddenly, I'm invaded by doubts.<eos> I'm thinking maybe the cable is tired of supporting me.<eos> What if my towers are talking to each other?<eos> What if they've had enough? What if they decide to eject me?
You stole the Governor's rum?<eos> Can he hang me twice?<eos> Captain Collins.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Our nets, sir - they've been ripped to shreds.
"Our souls will never die."<eos> No.<eos> Suppose it is more than that.<eos> It is not just "Our souls will never die" but... .."our souls have always lived".<eos> They did not need to be born as we were born.
I'm sorry... for letting you die.<eos> They have never blamed you.<eos> In London... .. we lived amongst prostitutes.<eos> Ugly, foul-mouthed, drunken, screeching whoredom.<eos> But they could... .. give birth... .. breast-feed, nurse, mother...
And guess who just logged into the party bus as admin 40 minutes ago?<eos> IP address results to a point of presence next to a motel in Jersey.<eos> What have you done with the kids?<eos> You don't understand...<eos> Where are they?
No?<eos> Well, I'll leave them there.<eos> And I'll take one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - After that, the merchants used these newly created waterways, and over the years they were cut deeper and wider, and this is why the Broads are as they are today for all of you to enjoy.
- So you can just fuck off.<eos> Go on.<eos> - Don't.<eos> You know, one of these days, Ron Kray, your miserable life will swallow you whole.<eos> You should know all about that, because I've heard all the stories. They're not good.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm calling to tell you something.<eos> See, I had some girlfriends over...<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> There was some wine there, and they drank some.
It's just a movie.<eos> I know it's a movie.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> I know it's fake, and stuff, but it's based on something that's real.<eos> Now these boards, they're not to be toyed around with like you're playin' a game of checkers and all.
Let's move.<eos> Well, move it!<eos> Walk down these stairs right here.<eos> I told y'all not to be messin' with those boards.<eos> They're real and they can bring back evil.
- That way, we can use competitive binding and find a match.<eos> It might actually work.<eos> - OK, where are the ship samples?<eos> - Right here.<eos> Wait a minute. Where are they?
I had her safely tucked away before the attack.<eos> After, well...<eos> Let's just say now I have bigger worries.<eos> There are dark forces at work.<eos> Forces we never believed could exist, but they do.
Name's Warren Roper.<eos> Your daddy says, "Come home," so home you come.<eos> Let her live!<eos> Together we've seen things not of this world and have proven ourselves capable of defeating them.<eos> What were they?
Practicing any form of magic is unbelievable enough, do we need to parse it?<eos> We need to know what these things are.<eos> Yes, they're witches, understood.<eos> Witchcraft has a long history in many cultures, Doctor, as well you know.<eos> As do fairies and sprites, but they don't walk about - Greater London, do they?
- I want 10 percent off the top.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> Your girls are rebelling.<eos> You're paying them in sodium and MSG, and they want real money.
He was... unavoidably detained.<eos> But I will be happy to walk you through our proposal.<eos> Look, I'm here to close.<eos> Women don't close things.<eos> They open them.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and among these, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<eos> To secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.<eos> And whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to establish new government.<eos> We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, do, and with the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states;<eos> That they are absolved of all allegiance to the British crown and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.
Come on.<eos> I'll take it from here, Arthur.<eos> Arthur. You're alive.<eos> We both are.<eos> Oh, and, funny story: I talk to fish now. And they actually listen.
Jamie has a way of digging in and not letting go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for your help today.<eos> Look, you can think what you like about I.A... or about me, for that matter, but don't you dare try to pretend that what I do is anything less than good difficult police work.<eos> And as far as I'm concerned, I think it takes a lot more integrity to go after corrupt cops than just to pretend like they don't exist.
That's the building she came from right before she died.<eos> She was furious, out of her mind.<eos> If Applied Holographics stole Julie's research, maybe Brandt blamed them for her death and was getting revenge.<eos> There are two more bombs.<eos> Where are they?
Oh, man, what a time to finally start getting straight.<eos> It's a good thing you already shit your pants, Jammer. Wave off. 'Cause this is gonna be a rough landing.<eos> Guys, guys! The truth.<eos> Yes, I was at the bazaar on a mission tonight to score weed for a big party at the embassy.<eos> I like to get high with girls, promise them green cards, and sometimes they let me fuck them. Not proud, but there you have it.
Are you ready, darling?<eos> The owls wait for no man.<eos> Or woman.<eos> They don't wait for anything really.<eos> They just hunt at will.
They ripped through all my...<eos> my kitchen's a mess, man. - You should see this place.<eos> - They're little girls. - They're not little girls, man!<eos> - Little girls... They're my little girls!<eos> You don't know where they...
- They should have kicked 'em all out when we come home.<eos> - Elsa?<eos> - Who?<eos> The women?<eos> - How's it right that we're out on the streets scraping by while they swan around giving themselves airs and graces for pin money?
Not today.<eos> Today, it's all a rush.<eos> If they have time, they have a little sex...<eos> Sorry, father.<eos> I feel I've fallen asleep in the prime of my youth... when women took care of me... and I woke up in a world in which they prefer... their Pilates class, their yoga class, their waxing, their green juices... to sleep and cuddle with me.
I feel I've fallen asleep in the prime of my youth... when women took care of me... and I woke up in a world in which they prefer... their Pilates class, their yoga class, their waxing, their green juices... to sleep and cuddle with me.<eos> You're feeling like a cicada, right, son?<eos> You sang all summer long... When winter came, you woke up and had no food.<eos> While they, like ants... worked hard for a place in society.<eos> And now that winter has arrived... they've accumulated courage, independence, confidence...
While Magnolia Breeland was on duty, someone shoplifted at the Dixie Stop.<eos> Brick made little Jimmy cry by threatening to stick a snake and a worm up his nostrils to turn him into a walrus.<eos> Like Jimmy's parents, I, too, am confused and upset!<eos> Well, hey, uh, your alpacas are warm and safe.<eos> They were nearly drowned because I shirked my responsibilities.
Her big dresses.<eos> Polishing that driftwood till it shined like steel or something.<eos> I lost her in the light. The light off the water.<eos> Why do these memories stay so vivid when I can't even remember stuff from last week?<eos> Those moments, they stare back at you. You don't remember them, they remember you.
We'll find a lot.<eos> And we need facilities for these folks...<eos> Someplace for them to use the bathroom.<eos> - Portable toilets.<eos> - They're not free.
All set to fire dual ammunition?<eos> I want a clear report!<eos> Conscript the men, leave the girls behind.<eos> They have a lot to learn.<eos> They haven't even fired once, all they do is supply bullets.
She would take care of me.<eos> Those girls are all I have in the world.<eos> We're family.<eos> I couldn't survive without them.<eos> And yet they will probably survive without you.
Need to find them, Jennifer.<eos> 12. 12.<eos> Numbers on a clock.<eos> 12 dancing Monkeys.<eos> Jennifer, you know they're not real.
Something personal, but private.<eos> So no photos or memorabilia.<eos> But you also like women.<eos> Temporarily, at least.<eos> And they like you.
Careful.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh. Excuse the 3000s.<eos> She got a wider stance than I realized.<eos> I told the girls at school we got a new hair dryer, and they said, "don't do anything different to your hair. We love it."
Wait!<eos> I just want you to know... that I never stopped seeing your face.<eos> Not after that night. The other girls, the ones who didn't escape... well, I saw you.<eos> The bitch who broke my hand.<eos> You think you went through hell. Oh, but they suffered more because of you!
It's not the past that haunts me.<eos> It's the future.<eos> The decisions, the choices we make,<eos> set our course.<eos> And who knows where they will lead?
- It's so... - I can't say... It's too painful.<eos> You're gonna make it, man.<eos> With the support of his friends and family, he's gonna make it.<eos> And you read... See the art, I mean, a lot of his messages are as plain as day.<eos> I'm not even going to say what they are, but you can see it.
You don't know what girls do to each other. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't.<eos> - They're vicious.<eos> - I mean, you can know about crafty girls all you want, but I wouldn't let you go on tour with crafty girls because fuckin'...<eos> It doesn't fuckin' matter, man. They... They...<eos> They diss me.
Yes, and while the clone's number checks out, he has a record of calls of delusional distress.<eos> I wouldn't take him too seriously.<eos> Send a probe to investigate.<eos> All leads must be pursued.<eos> Okay. You don't trust these clones, but they haven't done anything.
It's fiction.<eos> It's not you. It's not me.<eos> That's what I wanted to explain.<eos> What? That character isn't based on me?<eos> Characters have a... they have a life of their own.
It remembers everything. It's flawless.<eos> It never makes a mistake.<eos> And then there's a reactive side.<eos> And this is where all your neuroses, anxieties, and fears are stored.<eos> And where do they come from?
If it wasn't for the traveller I wouldn't be here.<eos> The only thing that comes back from the dead Are gods and zombies.<eos> So unless you're the second coming-<eos> Multiple timelines.<eos> You know they exist.
It's not that bad, McGarrett.<eos> It's not that bad?<eos> There's no wheels on my car.<eos> There's no physical damage other than parts missing, and those are all replaceable.<eos> They're not replaceable.
I've heard that your own brother refuses to come here.<eos> So why would these girls?<eos> Because I'm telling the truth.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> And they know that now.
I think the bigger "ifs" are what if you're wrong?<eos> What if someone did take the girls?<eos> And because you haven't considered it, you and your analysts are looking in all the wrong places.<eos> Haven't you asked yourself how four teenagers could be this good at evading the police?<eos> You're not going to find the answer investigating the girls because they're not running from you.
I think you need to see this.<eos> This feed is showing the view from the S.O.R. telescope at Kirtland.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Those stars...<eos> Are they moving?
- But...<eos> - he thinks it is uncertain, he draws.<eos> Where is the end of everything.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I thought I'd bury electric wires so that they are safe when they start flying.
Well, in Texas, state employees are indemnified by the State of Texas.<eos> Okay, how does this affect us?<eos> Well, the state, in this case, Texas, has put a cap on all damages that are able to be collected in any lawsuit against the state.<eos> And the cap is $250,000.<eos> Now, insurance companies, they have subrogation rights, which means that they're gonna put a lien against any kind of claim and settlement or any funds received from a lawsuit, to cover their medical expenses.
Stephanie: Okay, it's time to write down your preferences.<eos> Remember, the more sororities you list, the better your chances of getting a bid.<eos> So, how did it go with Lambda?<eos> I think it went well.<eos> I liked all the girls, and they seemed to like me.
And then I started thinking about my raise.<eos> 16%.<eos> That's an odd number.<eos> And then I thought it's exactly half of the difference between what you and I make.<eos> I went down to the ladies in accounting, and they never talked to Cooper.
~ No, no.<eos> Not one.<eos> But we could be in the equivalent of Dover and the cows could be in Beaconsfield.<eos> Well, I was just thinking that.<eos> What if they're all in the opposite corner?
Yes.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Dad, I'm 16.<eos> Yes, you are, but the problem with knowing secret things, Noodle, is that, then, you know them.<eos> And... they have a way of slipping out.
Well, we won't lose touch, I'll walk up here often.<eos> No, we won't lose touch. You can be sure of that.<eos> Right.<eos> We've got three months to plan this wedding so I don't want any mistakes.<eos> I don't think people want mistakes, Mrs Patmore, they just happen.
- Yes.<eos> Would you like eggs? And do you at least send each other Christmas cards?<eos> Well, I do. I just... I never get one back.<eos> Not even an e-card?<eos> But they're free.
Their story made no sense at all.<eos> That's the one thing that bugs me.<eos> What, that their story was stupid?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why? Because they aren't stupid.
And where are your fairy servants, sir?<eos> Are they visible only to yourself, or may others see them?<eos> Oh, fairies are mythological creatures, madam.<eos> Mythological?<eos> I meant to say that they do not.
They'd just rebuild them.<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> All you people don't know about lost causes.<eos> Mr. Payne does.<eos> He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for.
Don't know where you are.<eos> You need to call me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Evie didn't come home last night.<eos> She was out with her friends and they're gone, too.
Then we fight.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're late.<eos> Noma.<eos> Your wounds... are they...
Wow. Ha ha. Is that all seafood?<eos> That looks delicious.<eos> Do you want me to run it out to the girls?<eos> Oh, God, no. This is for us.<eos> They're having nachos.
Please don't ask me to do that again.<eos> How are we gonna get outta here?<eos> How did they get through it?<eos> Our girls.<eos> They went through this and much worse.
Uh, Jack, I'm in the middle of a working lunch.<eos> I... I won't take long.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted to know if you noticed the same thing that I did.<eos> The circumstances around Victoria's death, they're...
God in Heaven...<eos> Just as I said.<eos> Where is your devilish black pitch?<eos> It's the witches' doing.<eos> They've made it disappear.
I mean, you're not obviously, uh-- you're not a pro in that sense.<eos> But wait, you're-- you're not a pro, are you?<eos> I've, uh- - I've never been asked if I was a hooker on a first date before.<eos> Oh, God, no, well,<eos> I'm sorry, I-- I didn't mean-- it's just-- it's just, uh, a lot of the nice girls here, like Jeannie, they sometimes-- um-- wait, are we on a date?
Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits.<eos> They're always there, always active.<eos> We can try to be right, we can try to be good, we can try to make a difference, but it's all bullshit.<eos> 'Cause intentions are irrelevant.<eos> They don't drive us.
- Richard... If you oppose me, if you speak out in any way...<eos> Olivia Pope may not be able to tell the world what you've done, but I won't hesitate.<eos> You were right.<eos> Not all fairy tales have happy endings. But evil queens?<eos> They tend to go down.
I'm gonna have to drop you from the label.<eos> And, Will, you got to know it ain't personal.<eos> You got to know I mean it when I say that I think your songs are great, and... and I was thinking, i... if you'd be willing, um, I'd like to put a few of them on my next album.<eos> You mean record my songs yourself?<eos> That way, the songs get heard, and they deserve to be heard by lots of people.
I can't believe he's lied to my face about knowing my father this whole time.<eos> Oh, I can.<eos> Well, we can't exactly go up to him and ask him, can we?<eos> We don't have to.<eos> If there are real answers to be found, they're right here in this building.
Well, then I guess we'll have to.<eos> So I visited the Professor.<eos> He has hit the wall trying to decipher the rest of the map.<eos> There are four bonds missing.<eos> Do you know where they are?
So, does any of this tell us who Alicia and Maribel were looking to kill?<eos> No. But the owner of Novena Vida said they were looking for a Latino man.<eos> The two women were bound by their family slaughter at the hands of the Escarra cartel.<eos> Yesterday, you posited that an Escarra came looking for them.<eos> Perhaps they went looking for an Escarra.
God is good, praise him!<eos> Yes, praise him, Father Beocca.<eos> You did well.<eos> Why the tears?<eos> They are for the stranger's child.
You see what she does out there.<eos> That's what I thought about Sara, too--<eos> Stop, stop it!<eos> Stop hiding behind your daughters!<eos> They would be ashamed of what you're doing right now.
She's supposed to get married next Sunday.<eos> The first victim was 3 months ago, The second two days ago, and now madison. Hotch:<eos> He's accelerating.<eos> He may be a townie trolling bars to meet women.<eos> What if he interacted with them and they turned down his advances?
Madison's parents, are they here yet?<eos> Their plane just landed. I sent a cruiser over<eos> To pick them up from the airport.<eos> What about the bridal party?<eos> They were the last ones to see her. Yeah.
Do not come by our house if you have anything important to do the next morning.<eos> Then there's illusions, healing... nature.<eos> Hmm? Knowledge.<eos> - Psychics...<eos> - You know what they are?
There may have been a Swiffer involved.<eos> Did you touch my board games?<eos> Yes.<eos> I alphabetized them.<eos> Wait... they were alphabetized, by game designer!
She was kind of young, huh?<eos> You know, I kind of guess that Leslie harbors a little disdain for the aging female body.<eos> So it seems like the age gap just keeps getting bigger.<eos> I mean, the girls, they just... they keep getting younger?<eos> Well, like, Leslie keeps getting older, and they all stay 21.
Perhaps we could take advantage of your extended stay.<eos> I thought we might entertain ourselves with the Hound and Hare game you spoke of.<eos> I shouldn't delay my departure.<eos> And you made it clear that such games don't interest you.<eos> That was before I realized how much they meant to you.
My grandmother.<eos> - How old is she? - 96 or 97<eos> 97?<eos> Can I feed her?<eos> In our custom, women are our Goddesses. They are our leaders. Our decision makers.
You don't say no to me.<eos> See, I want this up and running inside of 24 hours, or you're not gonna like the tone of my voice anymore.<eos> What do you got?<eos> All right, so when we were first inputting these tattoos into the database, I noticed there were a lot of these really small, stray letters all over Jane's body.<eos> They were hidden in other designs, but they had the same font.
You understand your husband?<eos> He's highly compartmentalized.<eos> Most extraordinarily successful people are.<eos> That's true.<eos> My husband's online activities provide a safe space where he can explore and exhaust his darker thoughts so they don't spill over into the rest of his life.
They're getting really cross!<eos> But later, in our suite at the local Ritz-Sheraton, I was a worried man.<eos> Hammond?<eos> - What?<eos> - You know when we do these big things, they usually end in some sort of massive disaster?
Stop for a second, this is crazy!<eos> Miles, what are you looking for?<eos> Stop!<eos> Listen to me, it's those pills.<eos> They're making you crazy...
You're gonna hear that I moved from foster home to foster home since I was nine.<eos> And you're gonna hear that it was because my mom committed herself when I was eight.<eos> That's a long scar.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> When I was seven, I, um, I thought if I, uh, hurt my hands, they wouldn't hurt me.
I... I can't help myself.<eos> But you like it?<eos> I need it.<eos> But you like it, right?<eos> The little girls... they get scared.
it's just that what you heard is... that I... sometimes I talk to my pets.<eos> - A lot of the time.<eos> - No, me, too.<eos> All the time.<eos> And they sometimes talk to me sometimes.
Dr. Roth.<eos> - Ah, okay.<eos> - School psychiatrist.<eos> And, um, your degree came from which of our fine online universities?<eos> - Honey, they're just--
Expecting someone, Lara?<eos> Papa, is she old enough for boys?<eos> It is the duty of the patriarch to ensure the guidance of our young women.<eos> One cannot let the devil take root in these lovely creatures.<eos> They need a firm hand to be tamed. Protected.
- No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> It's like you're nine years old.<eos> Ooh, no, no, no.<eos> They're like young, cool hookers.
The first is physical.<eos> Push your bodies to the breaking point and you'll master the methods of combat.<eos> The second is mental.<eos> Again, breaking point.<eos> You'll face your worst fears and conquer them unless they get you first.
So I go to New York, you move in here with the girls and take care of them.<eos> -Me?<eos> -Yes, you.<eos> You miss them.<eos> And they miss you so much, Cam.
Yes. I used to have a restaurant, years ago.<eos> - Is this cream dressing?<eos> - No, it's very, very, healthy and nutritious and well-balanced. I used to be a dietician.<eos> How many things have you been, exactly?<eos> Oh, Fred, you know, life is long, and when you've lived so many years, and you do things, and you don't think when you're doing them, they matter all that much, and then,
I was given orders to commandeer the Spitfire, but...<eos> A Spitfire, against drones?<eos> Mechanical flight system.<eos> No electronics for the bots to control.<eos> You see, they can access anything electronic, anything with a chip.
- We cannot help you.<eos> - That's right, you probably can't.<eos> But your girls might be able to tell me where a 16-year-old would go to party on a school night.<eos> What does this "spider" mean?<eos> They are good girls, they do not party.
- We were taken to a party.<eos> There was drunkenness and lewdness and blasphemy.<eos> These girls have broken the covenant.<eos> They caroused with temptation!<eos> From now on, they must be within sight of another member of the flock at all times.
You come here unannounced and uninvited.<eos> I'll remind you I don't need an invitation.<eos> Piece of property is right in the middle of my county.<eos> Now I got a boy missing, and I understand that you've got two girls missing as well.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Sheriff, but my girls are accounted for, and unless you come here with evidence that they are related,
I feel guilty saying that.<eos> No, don't.<eos> Guilt will bring you nothing, I swear.<eos> When I was sent to the convent for my education, I had a beautiful idea of the piety of those... pale-faced women with their rosaries and their convictions.<eos> I wanted to be just as they are, but I couldn't.
There are so many industries that make profits off of people being unhealthy that it's in their interest to have people continue to be unhealthy.<eos> And so that's why you don't see an enormous national effort to try to improve the quality of the American diet or people's food choices.<eos> Is that why you see health insurance companies buying stock in fast food companies?<eos> That is exactly why you see health insurance companies buying stock in fast food companies?<eos> They're just covering their bets.
- Who switched on these lights? !<eos> Quiet.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> These time bombs will now be activated.<eos> As long as you keep running around this stadium... they won't go off.
- You're laughing?<eos> ! How was that funny?<eos> I'm sorry, Mishra.<eos> But even you have to admit; it's an ingenious method to meet a girl.<eos> These methods will seem ingenious if they're used to catch felons!
Hurry.<eos> - Are you sure no one has seen me?<eos> So... all that stuff in my room, the cameras...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They're totally secure, completely untraceable.

You're not a failure.<eos> You're not a failure, Oliver.<eos> Oh, yes, I am.<eos> I'm a classic failure.<eos> I collected Tiffany lamps, figured they'd always go up in value.
You know, good for the heart, good for the skin.<eos> Sometimes even vodka!<eos> But I hate girls who drink.<eos> I just cannot bear the sight of girls drinking.<eos> I can't understand why do they drink?
They're great.<eos> I give you recipe.<eos> You make for him.<eos> See how many he eats?<eos> No, they're actually good.
Go!<eos> WATSON". Consequences.<eos> Some men choose to ignore them.<eos> Some just can't see them coming.<eos> But like karma, they're always there.
- Please.<eos> Let me tell you, Elliot. You are too nice to your uncle.<eos> It's very easy being nice... when you are not the one who's around all day.<eos> Your uncle told us that the books are in here.<eos> So where are they?
That little hand-holding stunt you pulled in school?<eos> I think it's pretty obvious all you care about is winning Nick back.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I mean, things are so different now.<eos> They're not different enough.
The Earth goes around the Sun.<eos> It's a planet, just like the others.<eos> But Copernicus was only the dawn.<eos> I bring you the sunrise.<eos> The stars are other fiery suns, made of the same substance as the Earth, and they have their own watery earths, with plants and animals no less noble than our own.
- Is it already 6:00?<eos> - Have you been here all day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just got totally absorbed in my short story.<eos> Pete stopped by to give me his notes, and they just sent me in this whole new direction.
Michael, is there anything I can say to make you not do that?<eos> Nope.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> [Indistinct conversations] Get out.<eos> ♪ I can't stop ♪ So, I red in my mom's magazine that girls get turned on when they're, like, ovulating.
We don't need to have some, like, perfect weekend, you know?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I kind of like this idea. - Thank you.<eos> I've learned a lot of great communication games in rehab - and we could play those.<eos> - Yeah, they're so fun.
Well, Francis is a Southern Democrat.<eos> We have thick skins.<eos> He suggested, in order to keep your husband's political career on track...<eos> Children are the center of many people's lives.<eos> And I think they just want to make sure that their representatives will fight for their children's dreams.
- What if Atika tells Rachel? - No, she won't.<eos> She can't.<eos> Secrets are weird. People think you share them.<eos> But you don't.<eos> They have two sides. Either you own them or they own you.
- Can we play with your dog?<eos> - No.<eos> He doesn't like children.<eos> Don't throw balls in the flower beds, please, and keep the screen door closed.<eos> We have flies when there's no wind and they bite.
Dad!<eos> What...<eos> There's a hole in the mask... bees are gonna sting me...<eos> Go in the car then... and don't bother me.<eos> They're gonna sting her...
And then... can I tell you one thing?<eos> You're a beautiful woman, Milly.<eos> Thank you... if your wife hears you...<eos> I'm single... no wife...<eos> Women don't come to live in the country, they're used to comfort and luxury.
Yes, but you're not gonna like how.<eos> They want to complete the harvest.<eos> - No!<eos> - The witches say you'll be resurrected.<eos> They're liars!
He said I had the prettiest pins in Poplar.<eos> Now look at 'em!<eos> I ordered you some support stockings.<eos> They should provide you with considerable relief.<eos> But they're so ugly!
It is not an island. Do you not note anything?<eos> It moves!<eos> Why?<eos> These islands are pieces the cover of the swampy.<eos> In addition, they float.
- Unbelievable.<eos> - Hey, you know, take the rest of the day off.<eos> Go to the zoo.<eos> They have these baby pandas.<eos> They'll just melt your heart.
It takes time for their light to reach us.<eos> For the nearest ones, it takes years.<eos> For others, centuries.<eos> Some stars are so far away, it takes eons for their light to get to Earth.<eos> By the time the light from some stars gets here, they are already dead.
Two, Career Day is my thing.<eos> I do it every year.<eos> It's the official one.<eos> Well, why can't there be two Career Days?<eos> Don't you have ferrets to take care of, or do they also think you talk too much?
I know, dear. I've done the sums.<eos> And what are you going to do with 5,000 packs of cigarettes?<eos> My whist drive are enthusiastic smokers.<eos> Don't play games with me.<eos> What are they for?
Nothing helps, all right?<eos> And... and... and the vomiting started about 10 days ago, and now I want to break things.<eos> I-I never used to feel like that.<eos> I mean, these thoughts...<eos> They... they aren't mine.
Thank you for inviting me, Lady Prudence.<eos> Lady Swanson.<eos> My husband is a knight but I have no title myself.<eos> Oh, you'll capture these social subtleties with time.<eos> They're becoming increasingly irrelevant, aren't they, with time?
- What happened?<eos> - They ran away.<eos> - Why didn't you run after them? - I did.<eos> I tried.<eos> Look, I was stuck in traffic. And they jumped out of the car. I tried to chase them.
What was that?<eos> Oh, those girls didn't want me to sit with them.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Okay, they... don't want you to sit with them, but it's because you're smarter than them... way smarter, and they can't hang.<eos> That's not the reason. It's because they're all contenders for Little Miss Chatswin and I'm not.
Wanda...<eos> is there anything you'd like to say here?<eos> Okay, fine! Tom, I don't want alpacas.<eos> Their eyes are too big and they scare me.<eos> They don't even have teeth!
Their eyes are too big and they scare me.<eos> They don't even have teeth!<eos> But I knew how much you wanted them.<eos> So I asked Lavon not to give us the per pt.<eos> They are not scary, Wanda.
I don't remember.<eos> - It's just...<eos> - Answer me.<eos> All I remember is drinking with them, that's all.<eos> That's not all. They're dead.
Please. Understand, I just wanted to live.<eos> Tell Klaus I'm sorry.<eos> We should have felt our mother's hand in this.<eos> We should have known she would not be bound by anything as obvious as death. And now she has control of the witches.<eos> - They will never stop.
I promise.<eos> Mr. Wilson leave? Yeah.<eos> It's getting pretty late, I'm going to go, too.<eos> Hmm. Oliver.<eos> I know you and I have our differences, but they hardly excuse your behavior tonight.
The girl that I was, was gone.<eos> I'm not going to pretend that I've been through anything that you have.<eos> One thing that I've learned in the past year is that these things...<eos> They don't break us.<eos> They make us who we are.
Sure.<eos> [Gasps, startled] No visitors yet.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> Just check in with the nurses station.<eos> They'll let you know when a good time is.
I'm gonna make a cake so moist, girls are gonna be like:<eos> "Ew, why do you say 'moist'?<eos> I hate that word."<eos> I'll be like, "Just taste the cake."<eos> They're gonna be like, "Damn, it's moist."
And not for yourself?<eos> If Rollo rises, I rise also.<eos> And you need my help!<eos> My son is ignorant of the game and strangely ignorant of other things as well.<eos> He's only been with a few women, and they were nothing... Slaves, girls.
How'd you find me?<eos> Heard you were in the neighborhood, so I looked for the nearest place to find a pint and a pair of tits.<eos> I do have my weaknesses.<eos> Well, let me go, or you'll have a few more.<eos> There they are, eyes that could make me stab me own mum, if they asked.
I don't know what that means.<eos> All I know is I can't deal with you hating me.<eos> Brenna.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> It's just hard when you're into girls and you have no idea if they're into girls.
You're a police officer.<eos> And as much as it pains me to say it, Richard is a police officer.<eos> Now, you can dress these machines to look like cops.<eos> You can program 'em to drive a car and shoot a gun like a cop.<eos> But they're not cops.
I don't like her.<eos> Guess that's one thing we can agree on.<eos> Figures she's repping your ex-girlfriend, Lee Anne, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know, some women, you cross 'em, uh, they throw your clothes in the street, maybe smash up your car.
No, I'm quite sure that was the monkeys.<eos> So... those monkeys were infected?<eos> Of course.<eos> She's injecting them with the virus to see if her vaccine is working.<eos> And when it doesn't, they die.
This is what I'm talking about.<eos> You objectify women.<eos> You call them shrimp or... or prawns and you talk about keeping the body and snapping off the head.<eos> - Mmm... - It's despicable!<eos> It's 'cause they got a good body and a bad head.
You lived in Kenya?<eos> I'm an honorary Kikuyu tribe member, but that's a story for another day.<eos> Listen, Marcus, you're a sweet, smart, honest, just wonderful kid.<eos> Unfortunately, those qualities repel women.<eos> They like guys who are mysterious.
Mostly in the O.R. or in emerg.<eos> Yeah, where the dying happens.<eos> And?<eos> And you've led me on two laps of this hospital, but carefully avoided those areas.<eos> Which makes me think that maybe you're not sure that they're gone.
Well, then let's get you those answers.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Becky: Isabelle!<eos> I can't find my socks!<eos> Where are they?
But... But if you don't tell me, then how will I learn?<eos> Well, like you, I was abandoned as a child.<eos> Some spinsters took us in.<eos> We didn't have much, but we got by.<eos> Whenever we'd finish a job, they used to bake meat pies.
Lookee, lookee.<eos> I thought I saw your big, white ass lumbering around.<eos> As for you, santiago, well, now you certainly<eos> Showed your true colors, didn't you?<eos> And they're a shade of pink called "loser."
It would seem so.<eos> We'll take care of this, Inspector.<eos> But what if that thing goes on the rampage?<eos> Place these lanterns on the shoreline and bridges, encircling the creature at 20-foot intervals.<eos> What will they do?
It's just not your normal, typical child.<eos> According to Nikki Pattillo, her daughter Maddy has told her that her home is in the sky, and has displayed numerous astonishing abilities... like telekinesis and psychic visions.<eos> But could ten-year-old Maddy<eos> Pattillo really have superhuman abilities?<eos> If so, where did they come from?
She didn't mean that.<eos> She gets a little snippy when she's fighting with her girlfriend.<eos> Not that I have ever met that girl before.<eos> I'm a little psychic.<eos> - Women, you know, they...
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest...<eos> might this treasure hold some value to beings from beyond our world?<eos> According to author Zecharia Sitchin, Sumerian texts suggest ancient humans were made to mine gold for their gods... gods who were, in fact, extraterrestrials.<eos> Many ancient cultures were in the pursuit of finding precious gold and silver and jewels.<eos> They always did this under the premise that they were gathering it for their gods.
But then I realised the victory would be a bit hollow.<eos> Obviously, I want to beat Hammond, of course I do.<eos> But I don't want to beat that Alfa Romeo, because, to me,<eos> Alfas are special.<eos> They're really special.
Eyes forward, not to the ground.<eos> Oh, you know that walk?<eos> I was born free.<eos> Then walk free with one of your gals.<eos> They ain't important.
- They're rationed.<eos> - And?<eos> Girls love them.<eos> Girls can't get 'em.<eos> I spread the wealth, they spread their legs.
What?<eos> No. No!<eos> Good evening, Mr. Heck.<eos> You are the father of Sue, and in most cases, I feel your parental decisions have been right on the money.<eos> I mean, I think they're actually worse down here.
And, obviously, discontinue any other work you'll be doing with the sensors, and I will e-mail you a release for the patent.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry, "discontinue"?<eos> My work with Dr. Torres is ongoing.<eos> Uh, well, not with your sensors.<eos> They have to be proprietary to the work that we're doing.
You shot him, Mr. Reid, in defence.<eos> The, uh, bearer bonds...<eos> - What of them?<eos> - Where are they?
It's like a big sister thing.<eos> But you'd be terrible at that.<eos> Look, J, I'd love to help you, but I gotta get back to my little Asian tree.<eos> I just love Asian things.<eos> They're all so tiny.
Almost got it.<eos> Oh, jeez. And-<eos> - Oh--<eos> - Valerie's making me a peer mentor.<eos> Even though I didn't say anything to these girls the whole time, they absolutely loved me.
Sam, calm down!<eos> Artie, listen to us.<eos> You have to tell these girls that you have chlamydia.<eos> If you don't, you're gonna put their health at risk.<eos> And they could be spreading it to others.
I can't date you or be your girlfriend or whatever.<eos> It was dinner, wasn't it?<eos> No.<eos> Nah, you know, I, you know, I just, uh, when I get nervous I can't stop talking and now you... your backup singers probably, they hate me, don't they?<eos> No... They don't... they don't hate you.
But a kid is permanent.<eos> It's not like you're dating.<eos> You can't just stop calling or change your number or fake your own death because they annoy you.<eos> You do that to women?<eos> No, they do it to me.
Phoebe and Lyla.<eos> What about it?<eos> Oh, come on, Abby, they're the poster models for divorce.<eos> We used to mock them, remember, with their surgeries and their outfits and their kegels.<eos> Well, I was wrong about them, and they've really been there for me.
Yeah, it's a vulnerable sweet spot where these plates meet.<eos> Not so sweet for Ensign Tate.<eos> Indeed. It's likely that the ensign's killer smashed his head against the pavement. Possibly repeatedly.<eos> Yeah, I managed to pull some asphalt samples.<eos> I was about to bring them up to Abby, see what they tell her.
Alex, do you still hear the voices now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're in the quiet zone.<eos> E.L.F waves can't reach you here, so...<eos> Where are they coming from?
You hold the rings. Okay.<eos> I say, "They say the best marriages contain just a little bit of magic."<eos> We hold up our arms.<eos> You let go of the rings.<eos> They slide down the thread as if mysteriously floating All the way...
Did they say anything before they took off about why they wanted to leave?<eos> Maybe we should go search for them.<eos> They might be lost or...<eos> No! Enough about the twins. I will have no more of this!<eos> We bring them in, give them a home, a family, and how do they repay us?
Are a comfortable man.<eos> But this... would not clear a tenth of my father's debts.<eos> It wouldn't provide my sisters with dowries.<eos> My father would sell them to the highest bidder.<eos> Well, they... well, they could live with us!
I don't know.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> Do you ever...<eos> Chickens are dumb, right?<eos> They don't even... how long have we been eating chickens and they don't get... they're not a little wary at this point, they don't... haven't risen up.
I know.<eos> Isn't it great?<eos> Come on.<eos> I was watching this video and just had a bowlful of tentacles.<eos> And you pour, like, soy sauce over them and they,
So we have this weird system of, uh, you know, men being--<eos> It's kind of upside down.<eos> I think the reason is 'cause women were in charge long time ago and they were really mean.<eos> They were horrible.<eos> And they would-- you had to walk around naked and they'd flick your penis and laugh at you.
I know you've been making the aterna.<eos> Didn't know it was hurting people.<eos> I-I wasn't going to sell it. I was going to destroy it.<eos> I believe you.<eos> It was good when we used the stem-cell line, But... They were expensive.
But I know what you're doing, martin.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What am I doing?<eos> Well, I've got all sorts of scars All over my body.<eos> Haven't got a clue where they came from.
No cameras. No wife.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Those high-pitched screams you hear out there, Will...<eos> Women.<eos> They're the ones buying your albums, or at least they were.
And you've been talking to the friends.<eos> Sometimes without any adults around.<eos> I know the rules, Mr. Montgomery.<eos> No one's trying to trick the girls.<eos> They just need to know how serious this is.
The greatest treasures of the universe in just one suitcase.<eos> Doctor, what's the plan?<eos> Is there a plan?<eos> We can use the shredders, get back to the ship.<eos> They're not shredders, they're teleports, and that's not the most interesting thing about them.
- What about credit-card records?<eos> We take credit cards, but, again, some of our guests prefer ...<eos> Pay cash. Yeah.<eos> Security cameras?<eos> - They don't record. [chuckles]
My honour and skills are unmatched.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I beg your pardon, great Musashi.<eos> I didn't realize pouring tea was such a difficult task.<eos> If my girls weren't so hungover from accompanying you last night, they could pour your tea instead, Exalted One.
This calorie counting and this intense fixation with...<eos> And it's our fault, as much as...<eos> I take responsibility because it's a message we've been spewing out for the last 30 or 40 years, but we really have to try and turn things around.<eos> And Damon is living evidence, living proof, it is not the calories, it's the source of the calories.<eos> It's where they're coming from.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.<eos> Muffins?<eos> Bad ones.<eos> Filled with the plague.<eos> Where'd they come from?
Bugs.<eos> We need to deliver the profile.<eos> We believe the unsub we're looking for suffers from delusional parasitosis, a condition in which the patient believes that he's being attacked or infested by bugs.<eos> He takes his victims and covers them in insects, cockroaches specifically.<eos> We think it's to convince his victims that they share in his condition.
Moran Cerf is a neuroscientist who studies human brainwaves.<eos> In one of his experiments, he shows pictures to test subjects while they're awake and analyzes how their brains process the images.<eos> So each of those little squares here corresponds to a cell in Matt's brain.<eos> So, right now, Matt has 128 electrodes in his brain.<eos> They come from all various parts of his brain-- right, left and so on.
- The kilo weight!<eos> - One, mistress?<eos> - Yes, one.<eos> Look, the cock weight's slipped again.<eos> I put such lovely ornaments on my penis, but they keep slipping.
See ya.<eos> You're going to regret this, BoJack Horseman.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I'm gonna regret buying muffins?<eos> What, have they got a lot of saturated fat in them?
Found that one.<eos> That's what you did to me.<eos> Fitz?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> b... the brain cells, they ... they re... they react first. They die.
Sewn shut by what?<eos> We had three stuffed monkeys:<eos> See no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil.<eos> I saw them on your mantle, with the same stitches as the victims.<eos> Somehow, they... they were... Active.
I will meet you there with the remains.<eos> Oh, it's hot out!<eos> Cam said the remains were discovered by a couple of Eco-herders.<eos> Eco what? It's the new hippie-dippie thing.<eos> Instead of bulldozing a field, you just let goats loose on it 'cause they'll eat anything.
It's gross. And disgusting. And I'm gonna steal some stuff.<eos> Take what you want, honey.<eos> We don't read those anymore.<eos> Nick, who are these girls?<eos> They're not the best.
I'll do anything and everything to assassinate what little character you have, and I won't give it a second thought because you two are the absolute worst kind of people, the kind who have everything but still want more.<eos> I have the head of every news organization on speed dial, and they will run the hell out of the story of the rich parents who sent their son to have sex with the president's daughter just so they could blackmail The White House.<eos> And in the blink of an eye, everyone you now consider a friend will erase you from their memory.<eos> And every family in America will hate you forever.<eos> And forget about ever leaving your house again because they will know your faces because I will make sure they are etched into the American memory because that is what I do, and there is no one better in the entire world at it
Greer, tell me the truth.<eos> Is there any version of this life where you and Leith could be together?<eos> My sisters need me to make a good marriage, their own prospects depend on it.<eos> What if they were as clever and resourceful as you?<eos> What if they found love, a good man, a wealthy man, and then you were free to marry the man you desire?
We did that for clients for years.<eos> They came, we fixed, and we conquered.<eos> But what happened to those women, Liv?<eos> They became Anita hill, Monica Lewinsky.<eos> They stood up, Liv.
You can get very friendly with the couples.<eos> Can you tell us about his fiancÃ©e?<eos> Of course. Emily sontag.<eos> Her father owns garment factories in new jersey.<eos> That's it. They supply most of our high-end designers.
Oh, so he wasn't a protester?<eos> Well, no.<eos> He was something of a recluse.<eos> God, I love his puzzles.<eos> I mean, they were impossible.
I'M--I'M Not What You'D Consider An Exemplary Student.<eos> But I Believe I Play A Pivotal Role<eos> In The Operations Of This School.<eos> If I Wasn'T Here To Test The Rules,<eos> How Would The Other Students Even Know They Existed?
You've got flaps, that's for trimming it out.<eos> As you go up, the nose of the boat will want to rise, you put the flaps down, and it brings the nose down and gets you on the plane.<eos> I'm not on a plane.<eos> Why have I got flaps?<eos> They are on planes.
These 18-month-old cheetah sisters have been struggling to cope since they left their mother a few weeks ago.<eos> Their biggest problem is their own inexperience.<eos> They are barely managing to catch even the smallest prey.<eos> Unless they can master big-game hunting, the sisters will soon starve.<eos> They are the only survivors from a litter of five.
Why did they say that Jason and Medea's fates were entwined?<eos> He's going to kill her.<eos> You don't get more entwined.<eos> They said he wouldn't be able to kill her.<eos> - What do they know?
Okay, so a pass on the thief talk.<eos> Next topic... The women in this video... they're represented by your entertainment agency, no?<eos> This, here, is the lowest quality video and I took a quick look at these a while ago and they were just... oh... I couldn't even finish watching this.<eos> What is this?<eos> The girls. What have they been up to?

Protons can behave as if barriers don't exist.<eos> They tunnel straight through.<eos> But does this ghostly effect really happen?<eos> My colleagues in biology are already looking for the very first evidence of quantum mutations.<eos> Biologists didn't really even know about quantum mechanics, so when you tell them that particles can be in two places at once, they kind of say, "well, not in my cells, they can't!"
I will destroy every last boxtroll in this town!<eos> Hear ye, hear ye!<eos> Good citizens of Cheesebridge, the curfew is in force.<eos> Don't dawdle, or the beasts will tear you limb from limb.<eos> They will add your flesh to their rivers of blood, and mountains of bones.
There's napkins there.<eos> I know. I'm not looking for these.<eos> I'm looking for these.<eos> This has got this. This is this.<eos> Where are they?
You just got to grab on and pray to God it doesn't get in your eyes or your mouth.<eos> The fuck kind of jerking off is that? What, you never had any brothers? You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock or on a fucking tissue?<eos> No, I don't have any brothers.<eos> I was raised in a house of women!<eos> I highly doubt they fucking taught you to fucking close your eyes and fucking cum wherever you want!
It's just...<eos> I needed to see my Robin, I guess.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Those girls, they're...
Hi, Betty.<eos> You're so skinny.<eos> Come on, let's get you something to eat.<eos> No, no!<eos> They're not skinny.
Did you see something?<eos> Play it again.<eos> - This is Rachel's camera, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Again.<eos> The glitches, they...
I thought if I sent you to Cairo, I'd have a moment to myself.<eos> The President is busting my nuts about this UN speech.<eos> Turn on CNN.<eos> WikiLeaks will not say if the source was in government, law enforcement... industry, or is a private citizen with the capability to intercept messages.<eos> Privacy experts are not pleased to see personal communications released... and even less pleased that they were collected... and then stored for these eight long years.
I've been collecting them all my life.<eos> So, I'm not the first.<eos> You have had other women<eos> Yes.<eos> I've loved them all and they loved me back.
All you got is change in that fanny pack. Is that what you want?<eos> When's the last time you paid your rent when it was due?<eos> When's the last time you took one of those plump bitches out to dinner and didn't sweat them ordering dessert?<eos> You love those big bitches.<eos> And they love to eat.
Yeah yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, I remember her.<eos> That was primarily the same thing.<eos> Haven't you learned by now, Bob, that these girls aren't just gonna play it cool with you?<eos> I mean, you know that they know that they have a commodity that you want... and with a nice wife at home.
I'm going to read them all.<eos> Hey, China man... are you really Chinese?<eos> Supposedly, some of these people are famous.<eos> Does anyone know who they are?<eos> They're from the future, we don't know them yet.
Hey, China man... are you really Chinese?<eos> Supposedly, some of these people are famous.<eos> Does anyone know who they are?<eos> They're from the future, we don't know them yet.<eos> They're not from the future, they are from the present.
Secondly, and most importantly, we've got to get out of here.<eos> Now, what's your van situation like?<eos> Well, shoot. The tank's as empty as your friend's skull here.<eos> I was hoping to fill her up and those freaks turned up again.<eos> I know if we wait it out and stay real hushed that they're gonna fuck off.
What? Murch, come on, man.<eos> Every man remembers his personal best headmaster.<eos> Yeah, and he should know.<eos> He's been with white chicks.<eos> They can do it.
A long, long, long, long time ago... when this town was just a tiny village... and the woods were all around... the people who lived here believed in fairies and elves and goblins.<eos> And the years went past, and the town grew bigger and bigger... and we had houses and cars and electricity and we forgot all about the fairies and the elves and the goblins.<eos> But the fairies and the elves and the goblins like to remind us that they're still here.<eos> So, they steal my car keys, and they hide Mummy's scissors...<eos> And they came here and took Mr Johnson?
And they came here and took Mr Johnson?<eos> I don't think so, Dad.<eos> Oh, I think so.<eos> Listen.<eos> They're just playing a game with you.
Women tell you about sex, don't they?<eos> I can't talk about that<eos> Yeah, but every woman who goes to confess tells you... that she's an adulterer or fornicator or something... or why else would she be there?<eos> So you must have a very unusual picture of women.<eos> You must think that they're just having sex all the time...
The only reason why the guy didn't attack me is that I looked so pathetic.<eos> The only upside of being over 35 is that you don't get raped as much.<eos> I read it. It's true.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Once, I remember, I was watching the twins on a trampoline, you know... And they looked so beautiful... And I was happy because they were happy.
Carl.<eos> Nobody wants to open this back up, CJ, all the pain.<eos> But, that's no reason to let a killer walk.<eos> I've got doubts he is the killer, now.<eos> But, are they reasonable doubts?
What's this all about?<eos> I'd rather not say, sir.<eos> It's a personal matter.<eos> This is the army, Keenan.<eos> We don't allow personal matters, they get in the way.
What--what sort of asshole would refuse such a kindness?<eos> - What about your old lady? - What about her?<eos> What about her needs?<eos> Wives are different.<eos> They don't rub themselves raw like we do.
Yeah, I've entirely did it.<eos> Nobody likes a stale treat.<eos> That's what happens...<eos> We use too much flowers and kids are all tough.<eos> But they're not that.
And what?<eos> I just wait around for her creepy ass door to show up?<eos> What do you mean "her" door?<eos> I brought 2 people back with me from limbo.<eos> And when they died, they both got the same door.
The Wolf's gone.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> Hal, what's happening?<eos> Our curses came from the Devil.<eos> With him dead, properly dead, they've gone.
You can't flip a wish.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Your rules are ridiculous.<eos> They're Abed's rules.<eos> And they're awesome, and they always work.
This will be your future.<eos> No.<eos> No. These women are nothing like me.<eos> I'm young and hot and amazing.<eos> Oh, you don't think they were once, too?
It's hard to get a seat.<eos> To keep the ...<eos> It is even harder.<eos> A wrong bevægelse, and you can lose everything.<eos> Some girls learn the on the hard way, and they go out.
I'm sorry.<eos> Once again, girls.<eos> Let's do it better.<eos> As the best dance troupe in basketball 's Devil Girls celebrities.<eos> They excite fans from the cheap rækker for film and rock stars and politician on the front.
Big one.<eos> What happened to Milo last night?<eos> I think we lost him when that bachelorette party challenged us to a chug relay.<eos> How did we lose?<eos> They were drinking out of those tiny penis straws.
Once every two or three months.<eos> Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.<eos> Do you have reason to believe any of them were underage?<eos> Jesus! No.<eos> Look, they were mostly high-end.
Not much.<eos> I'll give you an example.<eos> In one of his paintings<eos> - Fairy Tale of the Kings - there are hundreds of tiny cities drawn on trees.<eos> They fascinated me, so I asked him what they meant.
What about this motion you filed, the relief thing?<eos> The broker you invested with went bankrupt their assets were purchasd by another company, there's no one to file a motion against right now since the broker's in bankruptcy you need to hire a bankruptcy attorney to lift a thing called an automatic stay,<eos> which really is a pain in the ass.<eos> What about the real estate company, what about that?<eos> Well they're also under the protection of bankruptcy court
It sounds pretty harmless.<eos> I thought so, but by the end of our marriage, it made her gag.<eos> That's not nice.<eos> You have lovely hands.<eos> I thought, as a masseuse, you'd have big, muscular hands, but they're very lovely.
Anyway, so, yeah, my 16-year-old daughter needed tampons, and guess who had to go get 'em?<eos> Me.<eos> Which, uh, you probably do all the time.<eos> So it's not a big mystery to you, but, you know, the big problem, really, at our house, is, uh, the fact that my girls don't get along.<eos> They... they...
Me.<eos> Which, uh, you probably do all the time.<eos> So it's not a big mystery to you, but, you know, the big problem, really, at our house, is, uh, the fact that my girls don't get along.<eos> They... they...<eos> They fight constantly.
Without a hot guy like Walt, you're just positively average.<eos> When you see me on the dance floor, you will take that back.<eos> Oh. That's so pathetic.<eos> I can already see you dancing with your sad little girlfriends.<eos> I know they won't have dates either.
But little did I know he meant that week.<eos> I think we were the first action figures of RB,<eos> The Ikettes, the Ike and Tina Turner Review.<eos> The girls were absolutely sensational.<eos> Tina was a force of nature, of course, but they were no slouches either.
Put everything in the bag. Fast!<eos> Sergio, take everything.<eos> - A clock?<eos> Without evtinii.<eos> Get the rings. They are the truth.
- Oh, right. - The nurse put the mask on my face...<eos> - That's how they did it.<eos> I put up a fight, and she called other two nurses, so three nurses were pinning me down...<eos> - How horrible.<eos> - I started to drift off. They called me "chicken, chicken, chicken..."
- Yes, two daughters.<eos> - How old are they?<eos> - 27 and 31.<eos> Oh, like us, more or less.<eos> Yes, but they're quite different.
Megan, stay back.<eos> You're angry with him, about your sisters, right?<eos> I tried to help them.<eos> I sacrificed everything to save their souls.<eos> No, they did nothing but disappoint you.
He'll mess up.<eos> They always do.<eos> Prostitutes sometimes go missing.<eos> These women don't look like, uh...<eos> They're not the street types.
He'll mess up.<eos> They always do.<eos> Prostitutes sometimes go missing.<eos> These women don't look like, uh...<eos> They're not the street types.
It's the fucking pheromones, man.<eos> You get 'em all locked up like this for a long time, and they get this prehistoric yearning for man-stink.<eos> They fucking hate my guts, you know?<eos> But they can't help themselves.<eos> I'm musty and they love it.
How you doing, Red?<eos> I'm missing half my zucchini.<eos> These girls don't realize I'm here to provide food, not dildos.<eos> I'm all out of cucumbers, carrots, beets.<eos> God knows what they're doing with those.
(Scoffs) (Whispers) You can't be rude to my friends!<eos> Oh, come on, June.<eos> These girls are a joke.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Okay, maybe they're not perfect, but you don't want to be my friend, and they wanna be my friends, and I wanna drink cappuccinos on the sidewalk.
I don't things slow, remember?<eos> I close my eyes and I jump, just like you.<eos> I think that's why we spooked each other.<eos> Our feelings...<eos> our fears, they control us, it's not the other way around.
As a child I always played with the kid next door, Frank.<eos> We hadn't been in the Netherlands long.<eos> Frank and I would play soccer.<eos> Or with those little balls...<eos> What are they called?
I thought about that when I went to do my National Service.<eos> It certainly beat reading the alphabet backwards off a card, but there was also something grimly consoling, knowing that 2,000 years ago some other poor conscripts stood there, vaguely hoping they might fail.<eos> Will you wake the nuns, when you let yourself in?<eos> I don't want you on bread and water for a fortnight.<eos> It's almost dawn, they'll be up already.
No, sir. It's...<eos> Because, in here, inappropriate can mean a smile at the wrong time, Bennett.<eos> These women are hungry, if you get my meaning.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> They want sex, is what I mean.
They call it the Face of the Giant Panda.<eos> See the eyes?<eos> Eyes, and... maybe a snout.<eos> These dots. Mm-hmm.<eos> They're formed in the central tagmental tract.
I, you know, I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> I just don't know that, um, I just don't know that I'm happy.<eos> I don't know that you're happy, either, if we're really being honest.<eos> But our girls love their parents, and they don't know what's going on with us, and they don't know what's going on in this marriage, and it... it needs to stay that way.
This whole thing has got me seeing stuff, wondering.<eos> And you're my best mate.<eos> But this...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> The women, they...
It's time to stop the shows. It's time to stop forcing these animals to perform in basically a circus environment.<eos> And they should release the animals that are young enough and healthy enough to be released, and the animals like Tilikum who are old and sick and have put in 25 years in the industry, should be released to an open ocean pen,<eos> so they can live out their lives and just experience the natural rhythms of the ocean.<eos> This is a multi-billion dollar corporation that makes its money through the exploitation of orcas.<eos> They're not suitable to have in captivity.
I think Martha and Colleen were... together.<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> - It's a thing.<eos> Men die first, and these older women are alone and turn to each other for companionship, like my Aunt Linda and her roommate, Jean.<eos> But they weren't lesbians.
I'll always protect you.<eos> I'm hiring a realtor.<eos> That girl. I knew her years ago.<eos> Listen, Abs.<eos> Sometimes these women, I protect them and they get...
There be brothers on the board, I'm gonna be free at last, yo, 'cause ain't no black man gonna let a fine black woman such as me hide her light in jail.<eos> Fool, brother is gonna be harder on you, to show he got no bias.<eos> Shit, you better hope for the whities.<eos> Yo, hope for white women.<eos> Y'all know how they love drinking wine with their friends, talking 'bout how sad it is, black folks ain't got their fair shakes.
Legendary.<eos> Yeah, well, the legend didn't reach me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, she makes these index cards, right?<eos> But to call 'em cards really doesn't do 'em justice because they're laminated, they're color-coded, they're indexed, they're categorized.
Women have this image of a man in their head that they've had since they were little girls watching princess movies and playing with their daddies.<eos> You try to accommodate them, which is an activity that women can't relate to.<eos> So you change, and you try to be what they want you to be.<eos> You change, and they believe that you don't have balls anymore.<eos> So you change back to yourself, and then they think you're a bastard.
Well, look.<eos> When you meet a girl, try to be funny.<eos> That's all you got to do.<eos> Be funny. Girls like witty guys.<eos> I'm not very attractive, but I'm funny, and they appreciate it.
Yes.<eos> It's a go.<eos> We are very excited and proud to be the first county in the state of Ohio to use brand-new touch-screen voting.<eos> Before the polls open tomorrow morning, we will insert these memory cards into the machines.<eos> They will store and tabulate the votes.
I know that you think that you're helping, but a man dancing around with fake breasts just makes this whole thing look like a joke.<eos> I'm just going to take the check.<eos> What happened?<eos> The women at that protest.<eos> They're eager to stand up for each other, but the second a guy pulls out his boobs, they completely turn.
You know what the hardest part about all this is gonna be?<eos> Where's my broken little girl?<eos> That bastard Elliot, I'll beat the crap out of him.<eos> Cheating on my angel with two women!<eos> What were they...
Look, I say we do a costume party, like the ones dad used to throw.<eos> No, we could get the whole gang back together from Commack.<eos> Even better, we make it a surprise.<eos> You know the best thing about surprise parties?<eos> Knowing when they're coming.
She broke the rules.<eos> I told you I wanted to talk to her.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I got caught up in the show.<eos> Those witches, they think that they still have power in this town.
I've shaved my head.<eos> I've got a brand-new plaid shirt.<eos> "She better treat me like a princess."<eos> Yep, you're an asshole.<eos> Why do they always look like men if they hate us so much?
Okay, fine.<eos> I'll talk to Maddie, all right?<eos> Yeah, you're damn right you will.<eos> Look.<eos> They're my daughters, too, Rayna.
I counted 40 stab wounds of various depths of penetration.<eos> He's targeting her femininity.<eos> This type of anger stems from a deep-seated hatred of women.<eos> Or a woman.<eos> So you think they're surrogates for someone who emasculated him?
Here we are indeed.<eos> I must say, I do like your game face, old boy.<eos> You haven't seen it yet, old boy.<eos> Some crimes defy description.<eos> They debase our so-called civilisation and defy every boundary of humanity left to us.
I saw a man.<eos> Getting up from a lying position.<eos> Mr Hughes, in your professional capacity, can you please confirm the credit card statements before you are an accurate reflection of payments made by your bank on behalf of the account holder, Mr Liam Foyle? Yes.<eos> And these payments were made by the card over the first three months of this year, is that correct?<eos> Yes. And they were all made online to companies across Asia and Europe, all of which distribute and produce the same... product, namely pornography, is that correct?
I walked into the mortuary and kissed her face.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did I scare you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish things could be different, but they're not.
The M.E. is still trying to determine whether it was done ante- or postmortem. According to Chinese mythology, one of the most dreadful punishments in the 18 levels of hell involves having one's tongue ripped out.<eos> It's considered to be one of the most horrific forms of torture.<eos> It's also symbolic, used to punish liars and anti-regime activists.<eos> The very nature of the M.O. is overkill.<eos> We can't rule out a personal vendetta. These women may have had something on this unsub and he wanted to make sure that they didn't live to talk about it.
Walk away.<eos> John.<eos> Because he knew my name.<eos> Go ahead, Garcia.<eos> Sir, I did premium spelunking on these 3 women and they were super duper active online,
Is something wrong?<eos> You plagiarized my work. That's what's wrong.<eos> For 3 months I confided in you.<eos> I told you everything. Listen to me.<eos> You told me that if wrote about my fantasies, they would go away.
Ivana Kiss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her parents must be very proud.<eos> They're not exactly what I would call friendly to law enforcement.<eos> These girls, they spend so much time on the track, right?
Yeah, that one.<eos> Who's ready to taste the pain?<eos> Welcome everyone to the Pacific Roller Derby Championship between the 14-1 Diamond Dolls and the 13-2 South Shore Sirens.<eos> And bad-to-the-bone Sugar Stix, full of sugar and spice and nothing nice.<eos> These ladies have battled through a long, brutal season to get here, and you better believe they're gonna leave it all on the track in this bout.
But if you run around with your eyes closed, not only do you bump into walls a lot, you miss out on seeing some pretty amazing stuff.<eos> Peekaboo!<eos> So what I'm learning is to face my fears head on.<eos> I don't run anymore, and I don't cover my eyes.<eos> I'm embracing my fears because... They're the seeds of a new life.
How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?<eos> Well, spoiler alert:<eos> - Women are liars. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. They're supposed to want commitment, right?<eos> But then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.
I thought you were on the road.<eos> I was.<eos> I had the girls with me, so...<eos> I must be in pretty bad shape for you to miss a show.<eos> Well, they were worried.
Does anybody ever ask me how my day is going?<eos> No.<eos> We practically live with these girls.<eos> We know everything about them.<eos> Do they ever for a second think about our life outside of work?
Some asses are wide-open<eos> Some asses are greasy<eos> Some asses are real tasty<eos> Some asses are bombs<eos> That go bang when they fart
No, not counting money, they're making fake cash and passing it off as real.<eos> That's what "counter felting" is, girly.<eos> Darlin', do you know any of these counterf... these men that are making the money?<eos> Did you hear your dad say any names? [Sniffling]<eos> Listen up, now... you tell us their names, or we'll send you to the sisters of perpetual sorrow and they'll lock you up for life.
Peter, what do you have there?<eos> Give me the scissors.<eos> I was just gonna make some masks!<eos> Use your scissors.<eos> They're not sharp!
I...<eos> I...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Pearls are porous.<eos> They absorb blood.
I had the same questions when Daniel died.<eos> I never found an answer.<eos> You know, maybe tonight is the answer.<eos> Those girls, they got out because we were there.<eos> We survived then, and they have a chance now.
Without Shadownet, we couldn't find Waldo, much less Amanda and Owen.<eos> Well, they can't just sell the Black Box to anybody.<eos> No, but it's not like they're gonna advertise online.<eos> It'll be a direct transaction, protected point of sale.<eos> I've got a few theories on possible venues, but they're all over the world.
Good.<eos> Henry, do the honors.<eos> Last year...is history.<eos> Those gloves helped me catch 300 passes in the last 3 seasons!<eos> And yet they never snagged you a ring, now, did they, Mr. King?
These women don't make that much.<eos> What did they have to sacrifice to scrape that money together?<eos> Well, once we get Eddie out of jail, you can come back and write them all a check.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> They really... care about me.
Now you know.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> What?<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> They were supposed to be extinct.
Try watching 'em before you go to bed.<eos> They helped me get through the night.<eos> Oh.<eos> And teen fiction novels.<eos> I know it sounds weird, but trust me, they... they work.
I already got the belt loop around my neck.<eos> Go ahead, kick out the chair.<eos> Look, the point being, for whatever reason, these smart, beautiful women chose us.<eos> And that begs the question...<eos> are they really that smart?
The important thing is to have fun.<eos> Water balloons can hurt, so no head shots.<eos> Go for the head.<eos> Terminate with extreme prejudice, especially women and children.<eos> They're slow, and they cry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - I bet you are.<eos> Were you coming in here to celebrate what a fool I am?<eos> You upset the girls.<eos> They have nothing to do with this.
Up you go.<eos> Never cut into the sun or towards your own shadow, all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And never look at the clouds.<eos> They keep moving, see, and they throw you out.
When I got back to the house, of course, everyone assumed...<eos> I was Adeline.<eos> When we started, Margaret, I told you this was a story about twins.<eos> What I didn't tell you was that I wasn't one of them.<eos> Oh, I longed to be, but they always kept me out.
It's gotta be a show.<eos> Well, you're not entirely wrong, and my mother was a bit of a local celebrity.<eos> She had a television show called Miss Penny's Puppets.<eos> Oh, that sounds fun.<eos> My mom treated those puppets like they were real.
What?<eos> You got a pain?<eos> Charlie, I'm telling you.<eos> Those pills are no good for you.<eos> They're hurting you, those pills.
Suppose one of us actually did, you know, become addicted.<eos> They'd pull us out.<eos> Go to treatment.<eos> And our cases?<eos> I mean, all our old cases, they'd just... they'd be reopened.
You enjoy more than the girls.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Hurry up, I've to pee too.<eos> Please. Call the girls.<eos> They're taking time.
That's what we need to convince her... that she's not special to Idaris, that he's using her.<eos> - So, how do we do that?<eos> - What about Ben?<eos> A guy like Idaris, been bringing kids under his power for years, probably uses the same methods.<eos> - And Ben knows what they are.
And this car was heading towards the Red Pony, not away from it.<eos> Your son hadn't even picked you up yet.<eos> Now, tell me, Bob, how'd you really get those cuts?<eos> These cuts are not from yesterday.<eos> They're fresh.
I'm sorry, henry.<eos> It makes sense for us to dream about the things we've lost And the things we hoped for,<eos> Like your father being alive And your mother coming to find you.<eos> But eventually, You'll find new things to dream about.<eos> And when you do, They'll start to come true.
Wait, but these are all addressed to me... why haven't I seen them?<eos> Maybe Hope put them in here...<eos> you know that she likes to play mailman and hoarder.<eos> It's more of those postcards from my mom.<eos> What are they doing out here?
Right.<eos> Never thought it would end like this.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> But we love our daughters.<eos> And, Rayna, they are our daughters, so...
With body, spirit, and soul, this child again becomes whole.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Maybe this isn't a spell we can break.<eos> Freya, your powers aren't just blocked.<eos> - They're gone, Freya.
I am surprised that one even exists.<eos> Good night, Cinderella.<eos> You were saying.<eos> Oh, it's a combination of GHB, ketamine, and flunitrazepam.<eos> The girls give it to their Johns, and then they do whatever they want while under the influence.
- I was. But, she'd be like the rest of them.<eos> Underwear that doesn't match.<eos> Cheap perfume.<eos> Tattoos. You like girls like that?<eos> They like me.
No, not just clocks.<eos> Anything with a digital screen.<eos> They all count down.<eos> Okay, so you're thinking that if he can't see the countdown then... Maybe it won't happen.<eos> All the other victims, they... they... they saw it happen.
Area's been sealed off. Going 4 by 4 through each building.<eos> Shooter's gotta be long gone by now.<eos> Any eyewitness accounts?<eos> Well, they run the gamut.<eos> The only thing that's consistent is how inconsistent they are.
But don't tell me if it's true or not.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> I mean, we all understand the way the world works.<eos> You have something these women want, they have something you want.
Quite a lovely city you've got here...<eos> Nashville.<eos> I can't believe I've not been here before.<eos> It is hard to believe, given your ownership of several local radio stations.<eos> Yeah, they're all, uh, held under one of my media subgroups.
And I would appreciate it if you would behave like a professional as well.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, then, why don't you watch the DVDs of the last run of couples and summarize the computer readouts?<eos> What are the couples doing?<eos> It's a sex study, so they are building furniture from Sweden.
Did you kill Thomas Griffin to use him as bait?<eos> No, no.<eos> Because he was disembowelled in the same sewers.<eos> This proves I'm right.<eos> They are down there.
Uh, wait a minute.<eos> If we know he's guilty, somebody else does, too.<eos> Whoever sent our thieves in there to steal the film.<eos> Well, it's got to be someone who knows Witten.<eos> They knew the house, they knew the security codes, and they knew that he had the film.
Hi!<eos> ♪ It's the hardest thing for me to do. ♪ Now I remember when I let you sneak into my parties.<eos> Now I'm lining up to get into yours.<eos> Yeah, well, open up a Voulez tab... (Chuckles) And I can guarantee you a booth anytime you want.<eos> Just make sure those fashionistas order food, even if they don't eat it.
Han, what are you thinking?<eos> How are you ever going to pull this off?<eos> With the help of my two best friends?<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Who are they?
Hey, that's my niece.<eos> Oh, yeah, and out of respect to you, I only listened to her friend.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Hey, how about this weekend we go out and find some women and make 'em scream?<eos> In-in your imagination, are they running away from you or towards you?
- No.<eos> Samaritan was destroyed.<eos> I know the official story, Arthur.<eos> I also know about the drives.<eos> So... where are they?
Now they're gonna think I'm engaged to a nitwit.<eos> - All right, Duckie...<eos> - Don't call me Duckie!<eos> It means "ugly duckling"<eos> because I grew up with braces and pimples, and they still see me that way.
"The Four Who Speak As One."<eos> The librarian must have visited them at different carnivals:<eos> Philadelphia, New Orleans, Chicago.<eos> These are the women who banished Katrina to purgatory.<eos> If the golem has been made real and seeks revenge against those who hurt the boy... then surely they'll be next.
Why?<eos> Birds don't have any metal on them.<eos> No, but they do have little metal bands on their legs that say, "Property of the San Diego Zoo."<eos> All right, well, let's talk about that.<eos> Machines and how they complicate our lives.
They're having a sale on deodorant downstairs.<eos> Ho ho ho!<eos> Is that all for Max?<eos> Yeah, I started looking at the girls' toys.<eos> They are way more inspiring than the boys' toys.
- Line crossed.<eos> Let's go, sweetheart.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> You used to write great songs.<eos> Where are they now?
Going to have to get me some more pink pollen tomorrow.<eos> Okay, sweetie?<eos> Becky also initiated me into an ancient knowledge passed down over the generations to the women of our family...<eos> The secret of the pink bees.<eos> Becky, how do they do that?
In any other area in life, instincts will get you there... not with women.<eos> So whatever you think you should do, do the opposite.<eos> Number 2. You need to be open, sensitive.<eos> Women don't want a man just because he's big and strong and has abs like mine. No.<eos> They want a thinker.
It's opened.<eos> Found the bronze heads yet?<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> The Rat-head, the Rabbit-head.<eos> Do they look like our replicas?
Found the bronze heads yet?<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> The Rat-head, the Rabbit-head.<eos> Do they look like our replicas?<eos> To me... they're all the same.
Why can't we profit a little from them?<eos> You feel no shame?<eos> It's a matter of national dignity!<eos> These battlered heads... have nothing to do with dignity<eos> They represent centuries of cultural heritage!
That's it.<eos> You're not going back to the school anymore. Why?<eos> So I can be dumb like you?<eos> If it wasn't for you, we'd be in Australia with Dad.<eos> 'Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard heads.
I've met Mr Dickens, and that is not him.<eos> Yes, the Dickens I knew told stories too.<eos> And he wore a while suit and a red clown nose and collected shells from sparkling blue waters.<eos> Pip...<eos> Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our fears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.
I'll come to that dinner.<eos> I think Ellen is maybe number four... since you left.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why I don't take them bitches too seriously.<eos> They come and they go and they come and they go.
- You got it.<eos> Sharks eat seals, right?<eos> Yep. They sure do.<eos> That's their favorite meal.<eos> So where are they?
Crystal arrows are our best weapon.<eos> Difficult for the witches to shield against.<eos> Most effective when you strike the heart.<eos> That's their power source.<eos> A direct hit, and they'll be destroyed by their own magic.
Yeah, you tell that to the young, dumb and itching to get his ass shot off over there he's still crying his eyes out.<eos> What do you expect, Coker?<eos> Our young thegn just wants to make a name for himself.<eos> Isn't it why we're here? Huh? Kill the enemy?<eos> Destroy the frakking machines before they destroy us.
Are your ears pierced?<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Do the other one.<eos> Why do you always use binoculars?<eos> It helps me see things closer, even if they're not very far away.
Didn't you hear what I just said?<eos> The watches don't tell the same time.<eos> Second by second.<eos> Shit. It's a code.<eos> They divide.
What if God's love is like the sun, constant and unchanging?<eos> What if you woke up one day and realized... nothing can take that away?<eos> Hey, this is Joe Bradford.<eos> You can make a difference in the life of a hurting child.<eos> There are many organizations all across the country dedicated to helping at-risk kids, but they need your help.
He thinks he killed Agent Sanderson and I'm gonna take the blame for it.<eos> But he doesn't have the ledgers.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, but I know where they are.
No, I don't think so.<eos> Then come on...<eos> all of you.<eos> Let's get to my car.<eos> Okay, so those white things that you saw take over Justin... they're looking for hosts, okay?
Donkey Green, and Mickleham Downs, the River Mole, along with the box and beech woodlands of Juniper Top with their flint, clay, and chalk soils are each as unique as the different characters associated with Box Hill.<eos> [single bell tolling]<eos> - It's dawning on us that this is not the work of a crazed killer but the violent force of undead witches.<eos> But the violent force of undead witches.<eos> They strike and kill at random.
Signora Collatina tells her students that the witches are back, and that regrettably, the massacres will continue.<eos> - AH this destruction breaks my heart. [bells dinging]<eos> Two students, Monica and Valeria, such tender things brutally taken from us.<eos> It's dawning on us that this is not the work of a crazed killer but the violent force of undead witches.<eos> They strike and kill at random.
Don't stay, 'cause you half-killed me.<eos> It's your invention.<eos> Do you think you'll change that man's life with 3 DVDs?<eos> Yes.<eos> They changed mine.
so they just let you out, huh? mm.<eos> for now.<eos> how long are the amateurs in town?<eos> till sunday.<eos> but, babe... they don't hold a candle to my silver girl.
One of these days you'll appreciate the effort girls make.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I don't know if girls like me that much.<eos> I mean, I try to be nice to them.<eos> But they always make me seem like a dork.
I thought for sure your ADD would have kicked in by now.<eos> Dude, I'm telling you, man. I don't think I'm leaving.<eos> I love it here!<eos> The chicks, they're fuckin' amazing. They absolutely love Americans and they are completely fucking insane.<eos> Yeah, well, they have to be if they want anything to do with you.
But what is being a vampire if not relishing in the pleasure of it?<eos> Come along. Let me show you.<eos> Look at the women. They're beautiful, aren't they?<eos> Not them.<eos> They're too hungry for attention.
What you did was irresponsible.<eos> All this scheming and breaking in just so you didn't have to spend the weekend with your parents?<eos> My parents don't get me.<eos> They think I, like, fit in.<eos> It would crush them to know the truth, that I only have two friends and they'd both rather be at a dance than hang out with me.
Look at us, Wilson!<eos> We're something out of a horror movie!<eos> We're all pasty and bald and bitter and... lonely and... they're all fancy and... Hey.<eos> I would rather have our daughter than that creepy little kid any day of the week.<eos> It's not really our daughter! Stop it, Pippi!
Which makes all maps, 'maps that no man can read'.<eos> Well if you can't read it, then you have no use for it, or me. Let me start again.<eos> Show me the map.<eos> I can't.<eos> It doesn't yet exist.
We need to light another one, hurry!<eos> I have two more.<eos> I dropped it.<eos> Here, take the flashlight.<eos> Where is it? Where is it?
Thank you.<eos> This is the best campsite around, okay, and nobody even knows about it.<eos> - How'd you know about it?<eos> - I just know shit, man, okay?<eos> I commune with nature, and it shows me the way.
Closed door used to mean something.<eos> My apologies.<eos> In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.<eos> Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.
This camera needs no wires.<eos> It transmits this image via satellite.<eos> I set up that camera this morning.<eos> I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit, nothing.<eos> In fact, no one even knows it's there.
Like... nothing.<eos> I died and came back to life.<eos> Surely I can cast a stupid spell.<eos> You don't summon magic.<eos> It comes for you.
You cover the Israelis like paint.<eos> Technical glitch.<eos> So?<eos> There's a... a Russian traveling carnival that features a squirrel that's running on a wire wheel.<eos> The squirrel thinks it's turning the wheel, but if it stops running, its feet get caught in the wires and the squirrel breaks its paws.
Excuse me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where's your list?<eos> What? When we got on the boat, you had a list of your members.<eos> - Where is it?
No, no.<eos> No one says anything about this to Ali.<eos> You saw this book yourself?<eos> Yes, Emily and Hanna called me when they found it.<eos> Where is it now?
We made hay.<eos> And our body of work has been presented.<eos> Are you ready to take this to the next level?<eos> Yeah!<eos> All thanks to synergy, for it provides us with low-hanging fruit.
Yet, the same blood runs through both your veins.<eos> The blood of the angel.<eos> Please, show me what it can do.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> We're still learning how it works.
Mine the asteroids. Colonize the belt. And remake the solar system.<eos> My drive would give us the edge we needed to finally break free from Earth.<eos> And build a new world for ourselves.<eos> That's the wonderful and terrible thing about technology.<eos> It changes everything.
You are a good and godly man, Magistrate Hathorne.<eos> I am.<eos> Surely love is where we find it.<eos> And we have indeed found it.<eos> Or it found us.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be.<eos> Do you know why you were so easily defeated?<eos> No.<eos> Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you.<eos> You seek to control it, and yet it controls you and has ever since that night.
To be clear, he is an actual psychic.<eos> He told me where to find you.<eos> That work deadline I was telling you about?<eos> You're gonna help me with it.<eos> You put the cardan grille over text, and it reveals a hidden message.
Worst possible place to bring a siphon.<eos> Like, easily, the worst.<eos> there's practically... magic in the walls.<eos> See?<eos> Okay, it's, uh, it's not practically in the walls.
Dude, watch the road.<eos> I got it.<eos> Anything else, Cass?<eos> Benjamin is always very careful.<eos> Long ago, he found a powerfully devout vessel in Madrid, and her faith, it... she gave him everything -- her trust and her body.
Max, listen to me.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> I had to, okay?<eos> That deal wasn't with her.<eos> It was with a demon.
All right, you're so smart, how do we get out of here?<eos> The only way out is to pull the manual override.<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> It is.<eos> But it's outside the bunker, where we can't reach it.
He sounds highly unstable.<eos> Not good guardian material.<eos> He was a wonderful, caring person.<eos> And the incredibly deadly viper wouldn't hurt anyone and we can prove it.<eos> How can you prove it when you don't even know where it is?
I have to ask...<eos> When you got there and you realized you were in over your heads, why didn't you just turn around and come home?<eos> We were too ashamed to fail.<eos> E-Especially when people started laughing at us, like, when we tried to build a school out of... out of mud blocks...<eos> We built one wall, and then... and then it just fell down.
I'm going.<eos> Okay? I'm going.<eos> But I need that bag.<eos> - Mm-mmm. - I am dead without it.<eos> So where is it?
Now, Mrs Pettybon, I understand you're on something of a crusade at the moment?<eos> I wouldn't put it in those terms, but, yes, I suppose what we're doing is the Lord's work.<eos> You're travelling up and down the country collecting signatures for a petition, right?<eos> - We are.<eos> - And what's it calling for, this petition?
How bad is it?<eos> Suppose I'll find out this evening.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.<eos> I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.
I know, but how do you expect me to react?<eos> I mean, I can't do this right now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I remember when you could never fall asleep without this doll.<eos> - (laughs) - It was yours, and you cut off all of her hair and then gave it to me.
You think you could just wait one second?<eos> Um, no.<eos> How about you wait?<eos> And you listen?<eos> One of the most amazing things in this world is when you get your shot, and it doesn't come when you want it to and it never comes again!
That would be amazing.<eos> That would be great.<eos> I was just thinking just a short moment near the end of the set, and maybe you two sing "Water Rising" together.<eos> Oh... um, yeah, I mean, I love that song.<eos> It's just, it's Juliette's, really, I don't know if I could it much justice.
Hello, Brad.<eos> Our son.<eos> He's killing his beautiful spirit.<eos> Cruelty by cruelty.<eos> When I heard that song I felt like it had to be mine.
Brown hair and eyes.<eos> Skinny.<eos> Do you remember that mysterious woman on the subway platform?<eos> Broussard's accomplice... the one who helped him kill our Host.<eos> I know who it was.
One's influence in many spheres is considerable.<eos> Then I'd be required to judge my fellow men.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Therein lies the problem.<eos> You should be aware that if you decline this role, it will be offered elsewhere...
Okay. Cool. I'll text you the deets.<eos> Later, man.<eos> Well, boys, I've been in the VC game for just one day, and already I have floor seats to watch the Warriors.<eos> But you hate basketball.<eos> I'll concede that spending all my time inside of a house with you scrawny code jockeys, the Incredible Shrinking Hendricks, and whatever the fuck Jared is here... may have blunted my conventional masculinity a hair, but it's always been there.
He's the top man in Hydra.<eos> You don't understand. Aida...<eos> Madame Hydra has put forces into motion no army can protect him from.<eos> Is this something to do with this... machine that Leopold was working on?<eos> It will kill everyone Fitz cares about.
Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.<eos> Destroy this body, sure.<eos> It was designed only for killing.<eos> My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.
Yes.<eos> Well, I better not keep my partner waiting.<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> Um, I just wanted to give you a gift, um, to thank you for your candor.<eos> It was invaluable.
I'm going to war with Krakow and Guangdong, and I need boots on the ground.<eos> I want to crush this fuck.<eos> That glass... it's not a barrier.<eos> It's an asset.<eos> It's what makes you good.
I'm well-compensated, more than well-compensated.<eos> Yeah, officially and on the books, with records of the transactions everywhere.<eos> But I wanted to spiff you above that.<eos> Everyone in our line needs cash squirreled away.<eos> It can make all the difference.
I can't just leave him.<eos> Well, that sounds like a broken promise.<eos> I thought that you were daggered, or worse.<eos> I caught Klaus in a rare charitable moment.<eos> But it won't last long.
Hiding inside the body of a vampire, because you're not as strong as you want me to think.<eos> You always had such spine.<eos> It's what I enjoyed most about you.<eos> And I know you enjoyed the power I had to offer.<eos> It's still here, Vincent.
Bullet went straight through, no lasting damage.<eos> How the hell does this happen?<eos> Just relax, all right?<eos> We need to wash our hands of this right now, before it gets back to us.<eos> Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains, which is why we keep moving forward.
So much power.<eos> It wears... a human face.<eos> What?<eos> Be careful.<eos> It... wears... A human... Face.
I smell blood.<eos> A lot of it.<eos> You let him out, didn't you?<eos> No, she did.<eos> So, if it bites you, do you...
Isn't that a little sad?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> It's like the soul, you know?<eos> No one knows for sure. Does it exist?
Are you home?<eos> - There you are. - Hey.<eos> Oh, wow. Captain Morgan.<eos> I thought we were switching to water.<eos> I'm afraid it wouldn't give me the courage that I need.
I could hear everything.<eos> God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?<eos> You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.<eos> Which, apparently, my book does not have.<eos> Nick, everyone loves it.
He'll be fine.<eos> How's he taking it, Elizabeth?<eos> The same as me-- it's upsetting.<eos> For me, too.<eos> Well, if they've come up with some kind of super wheat, think what getting our hands on it could mean to us.
I'm a little hungry.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> It, uh... came off in the water.<eos> Came down to it or me, so...
- I think he's going to divorce me.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> I think he's got a woman in Paris.<eos> And I know, I know he's had them before, but... this one's different.<eos> Do you know who it is?
I think I can handle it. I handled you.<eos> I broke your curse...<eos> the one you gave to Regina that started this whole mess.<eos> Well, that's just the thing, Miss Swan... the curse, that dark curse.<eos> It and all of the darkness you've ever faced, was borne out of one twisted soul... the Black Fairy.
The point of business is to create profit, okay?<eos> So if a company could earn an extra $10 million, it would be okay if, say, one person became collateral damage?<eos> In theory.<eos> Your paper says that corporations have a duty to weigh risk to human life against profits.<eos> I question the validity of that theory, and you said it was a legitimate treatise.
None of us will be leaving without the clearance codes to this ship.<eos> I hadn't thought of that.<eos> And I'm afraid there's another complication.<eos> I've just learned that Thrawn is very close to locating your base.<eos> - You have to tell me where it is.
The people who did not agree with this extraordinary secrecy, and made trouble for them ended up having horrific things happen.<eos> He was talking about being erased.<eos> And I said, "Man, what do you mean by erased?"<eos> He said, "Yes." He said, "You will be erased."<eos> If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project, this bullet has your name on it, and it will find you.
A true lost century.<eos> Huge progress was made in the 1920s as Nikola Tesla developed energy-generation technologies that could power the Earth, drawing endless free energy from the so-called "empty space" around us.<eos> So called "empty space" isn't really empty at all.<eos> It's actually full of energy.<eos> So instead of being like kind of a quiet empty lake it's more like the froth at the base of the waterfall or something.
And I understood, Claire, that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.<eos> Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House... it's about who owns the White House.<eos> This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.
You granted the wish.<eos> But it didn't work.<eos> The Evil Queen took the song from us.<eos> No one can do that.<eos> It's still inside you.
I hope they look good because they feel horrible.<eos> We're here on business. One drink.<eos> Top shelf only.<eos> Never finish the glass.<eos> Now, tell me, are you gonna wear that dress, or are you gonna continue to let it wear you?
Sam Farage had surgery today.<eos> He's in recovery.<eos> I watched three men die.<eos> And now I'm done with the CFD.<eos> I know if there's a way back from where you are right now, it's through this house.
Hey, if the president wants qualified candidates for this new intelligence agency, then we have to be selective.<eos> Remember when you risked your lives to ruin the president?<eos> Well, the country's changed. So have we.<eos> President Roarke's term has barely begun, and he's already seen a huge win.<eos> New Mexico becomes the crucial 34th state to petition Congress to convene a Constitutional convention, making it official.
Cameron.<eos> Oh. Hey, so, did you come to cheer me on or discourage me?<eos> Inspire you. You have to win this match.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We think Jake coded a message, and it's hidden at the end of the final level of War Zone, but it's only accessible for the next 45 minutes until we have to reposition the satellite.
- Jake needs your help.<eos> - Don't you mean you need my help?<eos> No, Jake.<eos> He's waiting for us at the end of this game.<eos> He left us a message, and I think it has to lead to his killer.
Farraday, 1963.<eos> The original publisher was the other company that Mr. Keating mentioned,<eos> Turnleaf Books.<eos> And that book is no mere how-to.<eos> It is, in fact, widely considered to be the magician's bible.
When you're resurrected from Hell.<eos> As a demon.<eos> Peacemaker!<eos> I know that gun.<eos> It's the one that killed you.
The very next day, Darius Tanz lands on my doorstep, and does the same.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Clearly, it's... something very special about this rock.<eos> Something that would warrant you venturing all the way up here, after all these years.<eos> What if I told you it was important to me?
I think you're starting to forget.<eos> Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.<eos> You're no fun when you're paranoid.<eos> SETH: You're sick, Holly.<eos> Feeding that sickness until all it does is eat.
Why am I here?<eos> - Won't you ask me what I want?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - So many things.<eos> I want my husband to have survived that silly war, but death is a part of life and we will all face it.
I am a progressive man!<eos> Today's world is progress, an equality among people.<eos> Even between men and women!<eos> That should appeal to you, Victoria!<eos> Even you, lackeys, you have the right to equality, even if you do not understand it.
Isaacs called the computer The Red Queen.<eos> Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City, there was an outbreak.<eos> The T-virus escaped from an underground laboratory called The Hive.<eos> The American government attempted to contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.<eos> It devastated Raccoon City.
I don't know if you can still see those volts of lightning.<eos> From:<eos> Wayne, Bruce Boys Share Too<eos> Cracked Luthor's Drive, found your photography.<eos> But it doesn't belong to you.
I asked my girlfriend at the time to buy me as a gift, I think it was for Christmas or my birthday, Warren Farrell's book "the myth of male power,"<eos> which she did, and it just changed my whole life.<eos> And his premise was while women are often seen as sex objects, men are often seen as success objects.<eos> And this resonated with me.<eos> He wrote this book that questioned our notions of power, of who had power and where it was, and it questioned the roles of men, but not the way feminists had always questioned gender roles.
Bixby didn't belong in their world any more than I do. Did.<eos> I wanted to tell him that the last night I saw him.<eos> That he was better than that.<eos> Nobody gets to choose.<eos> The further a man runs away from his nature, the sooner it'll find him out.
Shit.<eos> Tracy?<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Hey, man, why do you think the tape just cut out like that?<eos> You do all that video editing shit. Why would it just cut out?
Hey! Nico! Why did you take my phone without asking?<eos> You don't do that. What's a clitoris?<eos> Alright...<eos> A clitoris is a fun thing that girls have.<eos> Where is it?
Twenty-four.<eos> He didn't seem to follow in the family footsteps however.<eos> All of you with your business and law degrees and Alexander is a philosophy major at dartmouth?<eos> What's your point?<eos> Well, one of my agents came across a paper he wrote, it was published, about the corruption of government and the banking system and its negative impact on society.
It was hard at first because I missed my momma.<eos> But then I had me a Mojave...<eos> Had me a Mojave sister and...<eos> I'm sorry, this dress just don't seem to fit right.<eos> But... but the dress is part of the story, it indicates you...
Don't get any closer.<eos> I'm not sure it's safe. I...<eos> - I stepped on one.<eos> - I'm standing on a land mine.<eos> Normally, you step on a mine, it explodes within seconds, but we think that Korsak stepped on the edge of it and it rocked up and that's how he saw it.
They've called.<eos> You talked to them?<eos> I told them I'd call them back, after I got my recollections together.<eos> Funny thing is, I was gonna call you anyway.<eos> I sold the apartment building on South Vermont last month, and even though I got it in the divorce, it occurred to me that maybe you should get the profit. Seeing how it was your pet project.
They know me.<eos> I think... I mean, well... one thing they were wondering is-is about Nicole's blood. How it got in your Bronco.<eos> How the hell do I know? How the hell do I know, Bobby?<eos> The police. Faye's Colombian friends. I don't know.<eos> Yeah, but it's everywhere.
O.J. Simpson is entitled to an acquittal.<eos> They have entrusted this case to a man who says he'd like to see all niggers gathered together and killed.<eos> That is genocide.<eos> That man speaks like Adolf Hitler.<eos> Now, since you can't trust the man and you don't trust the People, is it any wonder, in the defining moment in this trial, when they asked O.J. Simpson to try on the glove and the glove didn't fit. It didn't fit because it wasn't his.
My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.<eos> The Boltons are defeated.<eos> The war is over.<eos> Winter has come.<eos> If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.
They were vulnerable to you.<eos> Had more to lose than you, less means with which to protect themselves than you.<eos> Until recently, I thought that was me as well, but now...<eos> I don't know that it is anymore.<eos> It is natural for men new to power to assume that it has no limits.
You see that one back there? - Hey, Starr.<eos> - Hey, Deirdre.<eos> Chew on a stick.<eos> Baby, why you not wearing the scarf? Shit.<eos> Where it at? Get that goddamn scarf!
Because being brave, it's really, really hard.<eos> You know what makes me brave, Mason?<eos> My badge.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> Now I'm gonna give it to you, and it's gonna make you brave.
When I can see straight, that is.<eos> Wha... What the devil is this?<eos> It's music, ye dolt.<eos> I know music when I see it.<eos> But what's it doing in a letter?
I understand why you are here, and I understand why this troubles you.<eos> But they do not understand.<eos> In the interest of getting this done as quickly as possible, perhaps it would be better if all our roles were more clearly defined.<eos> To avoid unnecessary and uncomfortable confusion.<eos> A man puts a dead thing in the ground, he expects it to stay there.
Does anyone have anything to say?<eos> If you're not strong enough to do what needs to be done, then I'll do it for you.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> It is a balance.<eos> Yeah, what's it here for?
- He's fine.<eos> He's dying... with us at home.<eos> I'm so very sorry.<eos> He has asked a favor.<eos> It will not come without risk.
And soon news will return to Nassau as to whether Rackham and his money are on their way to Havana.<eos> And if they aren't, if you and I are right, if something happened and Hornigold's cavalry weren't in time to stop it, then in addition to everything else, we will be at war with Spain.<eos> If you and I were right and something went wrong with the governor's caravan, I fear there is something even more unsettling we are about to face.<eos> What is that?<eos> You and I will be immune to this disease, for it will only attack those unfamiliar to this place.
Apparently he's been having an affair with a woman who he's very much in love with...<eos> But he's been having trouble bringing himself to leave his wife.<eos> But apparently he is so in love with this other person that he has decided to leave Karen... and plans to marry this other woman.<eos> He's been suffering so much because he likes and respects his wife but he can not live without the other woman.<eos> I did not have the nerve to ask if it was a movie star!
- Doesn't it make you feel weak?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> There's nothing like the power of unrequited love...<eos> Unlike other bonds, it isn't shared...<eos> It's mine... and mine alone.
-Right, Mylene?<eos> -Right.<eos> Because Mylene Cruz is gonna be the world's first boricua Pentecostal disco star.<eos> You know that beautiful hymn, "Set Me Free"?<eos> Does it not say that a man who says he's in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness?
Well, that's up to Prairie.<eos> I would never rush this, but...<eos> Prairie, here's the thing. The process can sometimes help people to heal.<eos> Storytelling is cleansing.<eos> But I also want to make sure you control the narrative. That you profit from it.
They always talkin' heaps about us stealing' when they know they done it first.<eos> Went over to Africa and round us up like horses.<eos> You really think she seen one of 'em round this way?<eos> You three, go get the rest of the wax paper from the storehouse.<eos> Where is it?
I say we get it.<eos> Box it up, patch it up, whatever the fuck you do with that stuff.<eos> Let's go, please, right now!<eos> You mean this one?<eos> You know it's $2,800?
But that is not why we do it, I suppose, for it to be easy.<eos> We do it because we are compelled to build a safe world for those we love.<eos> And because of the joy we'll feel in giving another a happy and healthy life.<eos> I look forward to your next correspondence.<eos> It means all the world to me.
And why, pray tell, is that?<eos> Because deep down, there's still a part of you that remembers music can be magical.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't bear to kill your passion.<eos> It will live at least until third grade, when you get Mrs. Ortner.
Only we've got your prints all over the door.<eos> And they weren't there when we first cordoned it off.<eos> I gave her a bracelet.<eos> I didn't want it to get lost.<eos> OK, so if that's true, where is it?
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.
I would pray for him.<eos> But that's gone for me now.<eos> Perhaps that is the root of what has been troubling me.<eos> I have left my faith.<eos> Or it has left me.
It's hard to say.<eos> Can you turn that off?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me your story.<eos> And if it involves murder?
The map?<eos> Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist.<eos> Claimed it allowed her to track demonic presences.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> But you know where it is, right?
Mr. Hunter can now be handed over to the Russians for trial,<eos> - which will likely result in his execution.<eos> - You cannot do that!<eos> Oh, I can, and I will. You give me no other choice.<eos> All this time, I was searching for your weakness, when it's obvious.
I say that because, despite our troubles... we are one community.<eos> One family.<eos> - And that gives us strength.<eos> - That strength is a powerful thing.<eos> It's not invisible.
Da.<eos> You see it's too late for me to just chop your hand off.<eos> Because the bracelet is joined to him now, isn't that right, Eve?<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> It's not the real bracelet.
Have you heard any banging noises... or anything of this type at higher rates?<eos> That is a negative, CAPCOM.<eos> This poses a grave danger to the mission.<eos> Tell them not to jettison the retro-package.<eos> NASA is confirming there is some sort of malfunction with the capsule's heat shield... and it may not stay in place.
Remembering's dangerous.<eos> I find the past such a worrying, anxious place.<eos> Yes, memory is so treacherous.<eos> One moment you're lost in a carnival of delight, childhood aromas, the flashing neon of puberty, all that sentimental candyfloss.<eos> The next, it takes you somewhere you don't want to be.
I mean, that's what we signed up for:<eos> - to be heroes.<eos> - I agree with Jefferson.<eos> Yes, of course you both do, because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.<eos> Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous than changing the past, because it is still in flux.
A lightbulb! Lightbulb!<eos> Yeah, I invented that.<eos> Me- - I'm Thomas Edison.<eos> I invented the lightbulb.<eos> Uh, what's it do?
- All right? - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Good, I'll see you tonight.<eos> I feel like I've been through hell and back, but here I am, dragging a hunk of metal down the street like nothing's changed.<eos> I worked with this guy once who... He... he lost his leg in a drilling accident and, um, he suffered from, uh... From phantom, uh, limb syndrome.<eos> His... his mind was so used to, uh, you know, to the leg being there that it... It tricked him into thinking it was there even though it wasn't.
You got that?<eos> Just don't do it.<eos> - I consider it a tragedy.<eos> - That right?<eos> You can save your bullshit sympathy, 'cause I don't buy it.
Yeah.<eos> That is definitely not me.<eos> She's alive.<eos> "Death is the veil which those who live call life.<eos> "They sleep, and it is lifted."
- Yeah, it's a winner.<eos> Hey, that star on your arm--<eos> - I earned it.<eos> You will too with effort, whole sleeve of 'em.<eos> - So what does it mean?
I... hey, look, you said it yourself, you don't have all the facts, so maybe you don't need a spell.<eos> Maybe you need information, and Margo's Discipline is gossip, so...<eos> - We have a real problem.<eos> - Is it in the box?<eos> - Professor Sunderland came looking for a book from the Physical Cottage Library, and it's missing.
Thank you. so tragic.<eos> What's gonna happen to the couch?<eos> The couch? It was the fanciest one in the store.<eos> He died on the fancy couch?<eos> Does that mean it's gonna be on sale?
Do whatever you like.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> I've known soldiers like you before.<eos> And maybe you were good men once.<eos> But when you see so much violence, it becomes the only thing you truly understand.
Anyone?<eos> Hmm? No?<eos> Fine. But if I were still your king,<eos> I would force every one of you to join this man's army, not because I was a tyrant and a terrible leader who hosted baby fights, which I now realize is weird and not that entertaining, even after the addition of the cobra, but because true love is rare and worth fighting for.<eos> It is life's greatest purpose.
- Nick, we can't wait.<eos> Look at his arm.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's getting better.
Simple accounting, really.<eos> At first, I wanted your friends to leave.<eos> I really had such a smooth-running operation going here before they arrived, but now I've decided they've caused too much damage, so my vindictive side...<eos> Did you know I have one?<eos> It wants to punish them.
You've given your whole life to this place.<eos> Don't worry, I'll still be in the store all the time.<eos> Just as a customer.<eos> I'll say stuff like, "Hey, can you tell me where the dental floss is?"<eos> Well, probably not, 'cause I already know where it is.
Great. Thanks.<eos> - Your usual?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Love that last song.<eos> What's it from?
So your theory is that someone has reorganized a 15th-Century cult to hunt and kill pedophiles.<eos> It fits the fact pattern.<eos> Not all of them.<eos> My associate, Mr. Weston, the man who started us down this road, was many things, but a pedophile was not one of them.<eos> I saw his dark side, and it did not involve children.
Jane.<eos> What?<eos> Where's the shotgun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is it, Jane?
What?<eos> Where's the shotgun?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is it, Jane?<eos> Why do you need it?
They're about succession of leadership.<eos> What's next after he goes. - The Plan.<eos> - Where's he going?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> The message he's receiving, uh, it's telling him that it is time to move on, and put a new leader in his place.
It's the WMD team.<eos> The bomb is gone.<eos> Response team confirms... It's gone.<eos> The terrorist took it.<eos> But only high-ranking members of the Bureau would know where it was taken.
And they want you to back off.<eos> That it had been referred to D.O.I. Yeah.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I worked another Sandy construction case in Brooklyn.<eos> And it never made it to the grand jury either.
Wooden crate.<eos> Five feet by two by one.<eos> Not ringing' any bells.<eos> I saw you receive it.<eos> Where's it at?
You must take me for a grade A chump!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Listen up, cupcake. I'm from the future, so all of your Deadite mumbo jumbo isn't new to me.<eos> You can pop now, you can pop later, I don't give a rat's ass.<eos> All I care about is that book, and you're going to tell me where it is, right now!
Um, Colonel, before we jump in, do, uh, you and Sylvester want to take a few minutes to, uh, catch up?<eos> I know it's been a while.<eos> Nine years, three months, two days.<eos> We're fine.<eos> As I was saying, during the Second World War, the Axis powers were looking for an advantage over the Allies, no matter where it came from.
Is there a solution?<eos> Lift your legs.<eos> I'll step on it instead of you.<eos> What do you mean by stepping on it instead of me?<eos> Then will it not explode?
Step exactly where I step.<eos> I won't let you die, so don't worry.<eos> What really happens if you step on a mine?<eos> There's nothing you can do.<eos> Unlike in movies, if you step on it, it goes off.
I was just embarrassed.<eos> Girl, please.<eos> How many times have I crawled in your bed at, like, 2:00 in the morning, crying over school or Nate or whatever?<eos> Okay, how about I set up some house study nights?<eos> No one even has to know it's for you.
Now that would be an innovation.<eos> That would be the... the killer application I guess you would say.<eos> Well, I try not to make predictions about anything less than two trillion years from now for good reasons.<eos> One is that no one will be able to know if I'm wrong.<eos> But that's one of the wonderful things about the future is you don't know where it's gonna go.
I got my Twitter feed for that.<eos> Why did McCarthy single out the new agent, Flynn Carroll?<eos> His wife's abduction is the obvious connection.<eos> And then... he has the scar.<eos> Does he know what it means?
But we are close.<eos> Soon, we will all be as one again.<eos> Our battles will be over.<eos> We just received an urgent message from Bob Brecke,<eos> - except it's not from Bob.
I meant, why is there bread on my table?<eos> Give her another chance.<eos> This is the first good thing to happen to her since she lost all her money, aside from the time the Red Cross gave us coffee.<eos> At least meet with her, so you can hear how amazing her story is.<eos> It's a story of someone not being defined by all the bad things that have happened to them in the past and just moving on.
He's dead.<eos> He died in my house.<eos> His family died in my house, I know it.<eos> I can't prove it, but I've seen him.<eos> And then there's this music box, and it plays at really weird times.
They said they'd have it shut off for a few hours.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Where does this pipe go?<eos> - They couldn't have gotten out.<eos> Warden, where does it go?
A friend of hers picked her up.<eos> I know why you're here, so just, just do what you have to do.<eos> I want the strongbox.<eos> What?<eos> Where is it?
That's right.<eos> We killed your friends and their wives and their children.<eos> That leaves you and Grimes.<eos> And you're going to tell me which one of you has it.<eos> Where is it?
I don't know.<eos> My assumption is that he feels that I can understand his predicament.<eos> Wait, predicament?<eos> Look, Bones, I love you and all, but this decision isn't up to you.<eos> I know... but isn't it up to Parker?
You guys wait outside.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Mr. Jang.<eos> Since becoming a prosecutor, I developed a daily routine.<eos> - You know what it is?
Because, darling, I can't have anyone resolving their unfinished business.<eos> That would be no fun.<eos> And if I'm going to be trapped in here, so is everyone else.<eos> The book.<eos> Where is it?
Nothing came between you and the job.<eos> Yeah--yeah, but I might have put it on hold if it meant I got the chance to raise a daughter like Joy.<eos> Well, yeah, it's easy to say that now because you know who Joy turned out to be.<eos> But 30 years ago, would you have really put your career on hold for diapers and teething and all-night crying fits?<eos> Look, Hayden had to make a call, and maybe it was the wrong call, but don't pretend like you don't understand why she made it.
Yes, Gerald, I see that.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Gerald, seriously, you gotta keep these things a secret.<eos> Listen, man, give me...<eos> Where is it?
Your father and I love you and will do anything to keep this family together.<eos> And maybe a difficult situation will get easier for all of us, including Pastor Tim and Alice.<eos> What about the tape?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it makes them feel good knowing it's sitting in a safe somewhere, maybe it's not such a bad thing.
- And therefore I have called to say I think it imprudent for Beatrice and Mary to spend time together.<eos> You expect me now to disapprove of Mary's friendship with Beatrice?<eos> I am very fond of Beatrice.<eos> I like their friendship.<eos> I am glad of it.
No, what makes him a bad cop are the 20 grams of meth we found on his body.<eos> Meth?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Nobody mentioned any drugs here.<eos> No one's mentioning it again outside of this room until we know for an absolute certainty how it connects to an L.A.P.D. officer.
And I know how hard that is.<eos> I once let my own belief waver.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> We need magic.<eos> It can make the world a better place.
- Mommy says it's educational.<eos> Well, a frozen body was recovered from a melting Alaskan ice floe.<eos> Oh, that's just great.<eos> So now Christine can have nightmares about Popsicle Man.<eos> While medical examiners have yet to identify the body, it was found in the same northern Alaska region where billionaire explorer Henry Charles mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago.
What's a...<eos> it's a high-resonance energy barrier permeable only by light and oxygen.<eos> It's the ultimate containment device.<eos> When you have as many enemies as my wife does...<eos> -No, no, no, no, no, no. It doesn't keep enemies out.
it's a high-resonance energy barrier permeable only by light and oxygen.<eos> It's the ultimate containment device.<eos> When you have as many enemies as my wife does...<eos> -No, no, no, no, no, no. It doesn't keep enemies out.<eos> It keeps things in... like, say, a pathogen from the lab.
Nice to see you.<eos> The fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.<eos> Okay, let's make this quick.<eos> I need to work on my presentation.<eos> It's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled,
We'll finish it off with a thick coat of mascara.<eos> Always apply a thick coat of mascara.<eos> That's it.<eos> I have this magnificent lipstick.<eos> You can take it, it doesn't really suit me.
to unlock the prisons of thought in which we trap ourselves, all in the hope that a better world or a better version of ourselves, perhaps, may lie on the other side of the door.<eos> I have your confession here, Mr. McCarthy, but I wanted to ensure that you fully understand the consequences.<eos> I understand.<eos> In addition to your execution,<eos> Mr. Frink and your grandfather will also be shot... as well as every worker at the factory before it is burnt to the ground.
Mr. Coleman, the CT scan we took of your chest showed a lot of scar tissue from your shrapnel wounds.<eos> So?<eos> It's not affecting your health or your heart functions.<eos> But this scar tissue has created a malformation which acts like an echo chamber.<eos> It amplifies the sound waves of your heart.
It was your dad's, and I think it should be yours.<eos> That's just how I feel.<eos> That's thoughtful, Ted, but, uh,<eos> I was never really that attached to it, to be honest.<eos> And I know it means a lot to you.
Infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you.<eos> You're feeling pretty good, you think the infection's gone, and then it reappears... out of nowhere... when your body's still weak, when you've barely recovered...
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> - I'm Sybil.<eos> - We are talking about a living, breathing siren.<eos> Damon is completely devoted to me.<eos> This thing, it was delivered with your vault inhabitant.
Agent, can I talk to you?<eos> Yeah, sure. Magda, I-I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but...you're gonna be all right.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You will do this.<eos> Just remember, that power... it doesn't control you.
- That is an oversimplification, sir.<eos> - Is it? I'm living in a hotel next door.<eos> I've seen where you live, Manuel, in that mansion.<eos> It's quite an upgrade from your previous home.<eos> Tell me, do you even know who it belongs to?
!<eos> Emma, drop the weapon.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Kieran!<eos> - Where is it?
Jim Pine O.D.'d.<eos> Mingan found him.<eos> I want Hector to go after him.<eos> I didn't kill that guinea pig.<eos> It was my neighbor's, and it died, and I asked if I could have it.
Come on.<eos> When officers pulled up to the westbound off-ramp of the MacArthur Causeway, they found one man mauling, chewing the face of another.<eos> When that officer ordered him to back off and he didn't, they opened fire.<eos> New disease affects the brain and spreads rapidly.<eos> It is being blamed for a wave of savage killings across the country.
I just need some more water, honey.<eos> Your skin is really red.<eos> Is it?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry I'm such an idiot.<eos> We have tetracycline, so it should be able to take care of this. Okay.
In more than one state, they have been accused of having maggots in the food that they've served.<eos> Corizon Healthcare provides healthcare services in 28 different states.<eos> Multimillion-dollar contracts for this service.<eos> Huge incentives given to contractors for very long contracts, so it's actually a disincentive to provide the service, because you're going to be paid anyway.<eos> One of the reasons it's so difficult to talk about mass incarceration in this country, and to question it, is because it has become so heavily monetized.
Where do you think the book came from?<eos> You're just as insane as he is.<eos> God didn't write that book. The devil did.<eos> You are just jealous. Because you want the book for yourself.<eos> You're damn right. I want it so I can destroy it, before it destroys all of us.
And it hurts, Dr. Bull.<eos> It hurts.<eos> I know it hurts.<eos> And that's why we're gonna prove that it took you ten years to write this song.<eos> And that it comes... from your soul.
Once people are made aware, they tend to compensate.<eos> You did one mock trial and determined that the whole world has it in for female pilots?<eos> We did five.<eos> And it's not a conspiracy.<eos> Implicit bias literally means you don't know it's there.
How come I got to deal with the sharp-taloned beast?<eos> Because, while I love birds, I am wholly terrified of them.<eos> How's he gonna know where he's going?<eos> Reginald was trained to fly on this pulse anklet.<eos> He'll only fly when it pulses, so I'll program the approximate amount of time to get him to the garage.
Just like you are right now.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, that's what's happening.<eos> You can't be mad at your past...<eos> it makes you who you are. And...
There's no way.<eos> You know that very well, Ezequiel.<eos> I know this must be difficult for you, Matheus.<eos> After all, she's here on your orders.<eos> Not that I blame you for César's death, but it must be quite a weight on your conscience.
What's gonna happen to her?<eos> It'll force her to submit.<eos> A union of demon and host.<eos> Two entities becoming one. Integration.<eos> Integration, it's said to be permanent.
How are we gonna know which one Mac is in?<eos> And I thought my cell was small.<eos> So, the plan worked.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I have a feeling we're headed for El Noche's compound in Mexico, but I can't tell anyone where it is if I'm dead.
Tell me Aphrodite's had a consensual effect on our jury.<eos> Oh, our jury loves her.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Well, leave it to a sex therapist to have all the skills it takes to unite Mount Olympus.<eos> But she has already formed an opinion of our good doctor, and it's not so therapeutic.
This nuclear reactor thing, as long as you keep pouring cool water on it, it can keep running 365 days a year.<eos> No.<eos> For 10 years, 20 years, it can keep turning without any problems.<eos> Isn't that why atomic energy is so great?<eos> It's the fire that never burns out.
Find me the closest taco shop.<eos> Here's what I could find on how to make taco shells.<eos> No, not a recipe for taco shells.<eos> Now, not only does the machine talk to you, but you can talk to it.<eos> And it's supposed to understand you.
We're good.<eos> She's gonna meet us tomorrow.<eos> Just because someone wrote a book...<eos> If he went to MIT and did work for the government, it makes sense that he'd be able to write a legitimate-sounding book.<eos> That doesn't mean it's legitimate.
Come on.<eos> Get out.<eos> Burial dirt.<eos> Nothing more powerful for dark magic.<eos> What does Belial want with it?
So confident.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.<eos> Kaulder, I came to help.<eos> Chloe. I told you not to...<eos> Immortality was never yours. it was mine.
Chris, the landmine is fake.<eos> Your friend is smart.<eos> He set you up.<eos> You watch too many Hollywood movies.<eos> When you step on landmine, it blows up.
- Just chill, man. - No, it's an omen, okay?<eos> It's a sign.<eos> We're exactly where we're supposed to be.<eos> Please spare us the fucking Gandhi routine right now!<eos> You have so much anger, and it is all in your heart chakra, and it's fucking toxic.
Dude!<eos> Dude!<eos> All the batteries are fried.<eos> This battery flew up and almost hit me.<eos> - Dude, it did hit me.
- Have you written others?<eos> - No. No, this is my first.<eos> It's just been kind of a dream until now.<eos> Any other dreams I can help you with?<eos> So, what's it about?
- Right.<eos> Okay, so you're going through this rough patch and then all of a sudden you find yourself in the middle of... I guess we got to call it a surreal experience.<eos> Walk me through that.<eos> What was that like for you?<eos> Well, when you're staring death in the eyes, and it's staring back at you... it's scary. Even for Brody Walker.
Your mother, she left because she was sick.<eos> She left because you thought she was sick, because she was wild.<eos> And you were tame, and you wanted to tame her, Dad.<eos> - So where is her love now?<eos> - Dad. No, really, where is it?
We're contemporaries, okay?<eos> You must seek out this Mamie-Claire.<eos> I'm so annoyed by Spirit.<eos> The path isn't against you.<eos> It's just the path.
Well, there are many angry and ignorant people in the world.<eos> They seem to be breeding in record numbers.<eos> Now, all we can do as a family is stick together and remain vigilant.<eos> The Mouth of Truth.<eos> Legend is that if you're given to lying, and you put your hand in there, it'll be bitten off.
I thought that love was supposed to hurt.<eos> I hurt everyone that I loved.<eos> And I measured love by how much pain someone would take from me.<eos> And it wasn't until I came to prison, an environment that is devoid of love,<eos> that I began to have some understanding about what it actually was and was not.
I had no choice.<eos> I saw and experienced things which forced me to do it.<eos> Sometimes my son asks me, because it worries him:<eos> "Dad, why this war?<eos> is there no end to it?
"What the hell has happened?<eos> "Where is he?"<eos> Family is something happy, remarkable.<eos> It's something else.<eos> It fills you up.
This was a gift.<eos> A gift?<eos> Wow. [Chuckles]<eos> Wow.<eos> Love is swell... but it is not something you build a life around.
- You're kidding me, right?<eos> - You're not going to drive over this one?<eos> - No, this is a different breed of cow.<eos> - Isn't there another way?<eos> - Also, it is a possibility it could've died?
Climbing too quickly is dangerous.<eos> You might find you don't have the right equipment at altitude, and your friends won't be there to help you.<eos> Here's to your first professional writing assignment.<eos> I've got to admit, I'm pretty excited.<eos> So what's it about?
I would be breaking the Gun Control Law just by taking it out in public.<eos> Then what about now?<eos> Right now, it's dark.<eos> And there are only two of us here.<eos> It's like a protection charm.
Sir Malcolm will be back tomorrow.<eos> I'll come back then.<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> More than that.<eos> It never leaves us.
It's not too late.<eos> Finn wants your blood.<eos> He promised to heal me if I delivered it.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> You've got to tell me why he wants it.
I love you both.<eos> Last night, I had a dream.<eos> You were so beautiful, I couldn't bear to wake you.<eos> I who never belonged to anyone dreamt I gave you one another.<eos> You are made for this love and it, for you.
Why?<eos> If you can keep me in your heart.<eos> ..then can't I keep your shin on me?<eos> You can.<eos> But what good is it to you?
One must have an honest heart, and that you do.<eos> Your job is to get Munni home.<eos> After that you can tell father anything you want.<eos> Afridi is trying to stay on crease.<eos> The ball's in the air again, will it cross the boundary? There's a fielder positioning himself under the ball, but it's across the boundary.
When all other options failed.. ...Bajrangi had only this one option left to reunite her with her parents.<eos> "Look at what's happened to me.."<eos> Every channel has refused to show this story.<eos> They say it's nonsense.<eos> No one's interested in it.
Love. His love for a 6 year old Pakistani mute girl.. ...who got separated from her parents in India.<eos> When all other options failed.. Bajrangi had only this one option left to reunite her with her parents.<eos> Every channel has refused to show this story.<eos> They say it's nonsense.<eos> No one's interested in it.
You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply.<eos> There are only so many fonts out there.<eos> Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?<eos> No. But we've been using this particular font for 12 years now.<eos> And it, in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic and Hamlindigo blue constitutes a trademark-brand identifier.
Laptops, BlackBerries, PalmPilots, watches.<eos> If you lick it and it goes... leave it here.<eos> Why?<eos> My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity.<eos> It's a medical condition.
She came to me.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> Even if they let me on the Warblers, I'll be fighting for every vocal breakout.<eos> Yeah, you'll be fighting that fight anywhere.<eos> Yeah, but at least here, it'll be a fair fight.
Half a million, at least.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Well, your label does have a liability-insurance policy.<eos> No, I can't ask you to do that.<eos> It's what it's for.
No, not all things.<eos> Well, that's why I'm writing about Zinberg.<eos> Right.<eos> A positive story about medicine.<eos> And if it happens to show a Jew who isn't a Lower East Side ghetto peasant, all the better.
Yeah.<eos> Do the police know?<eos> They're the ones who found the baby.<eos> This girl gave me her baby to look after and I completely stuffed up.<eos> I left it outside. It went missing.
The only reason he's even responding is because he mistakenly thinks you carry the Lexicon.<eos> Do I have your word that you won't leave the palace tomorrow?<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> I arranged to meet him at the next full moon.<eos> It's not for two days.
He kidnapped my sister's baby.<eos> Custody thing, you know?<eos> Nah, sorry, mate.<eos> Kidnapped?<eos> Yeah, if we invent a story, it passes the time, it keeps the interest up.
He was my husband, I loved him, but I... I couldn't say goodbye.<eos> But you have now.<eos> I don't believe it's possible.<eos> Death doesn't let you say goodbye.<eos> It just... carves holes in your life... in your future... in your heart.
See, there's only one buttermilk muffin.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is correct.<eos> And now it is mine.<eos> Well, actually, it's for me, 'cause, as you can see, I'm eating for two.
Look, the point is, her world has just been turned inside out, and I know that is not your fault.<eos> But I was just thinking, maybe you guys could work through this together.<eos> I'm pretty uncomfortable right now, and I need to figure out how to sell my unborn child to pay for Wade's muffin habit, so... (engine starts)<eos> You know, I-I really cannot wait to write my own review.<eos> Oh, really, and what'll it say?
No, I only want you to help me practice for my interview.<eos> [ chuckles ] okay.<eos> So, what's the job?<eos> It's a management training position With a really, really large restaurant company.<eos> And it comes with a great salary, Health benefits, and a pension plan.
Sometimes it feels that's all I do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You chose me first for a reason.<eos> Everything we've gone through, everything we've sacrificed... that was love.<eos> And it's still there.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You chose me first for a reason.<eos> Everything we've gone through, everything we've sacrificed... that was love.<eos> And it's still there.<eos> It doesn't go away.
And you're just telling us now?<eos> What?<eos> I was mad.<eos> She took my dress!<eos> And let's not forget, it's still out there somewhere.
Why aren't we getting calls?<eos> Why do they all support this emergency bill?<eos> If you pass it, I'll veto it, but there's no reason we have to turn this into a pissing match.<eos> You know that we have the votes to override your veto.<eos> It passes in ten days without a signature, regardless.
I refused.<eos> Salazar told me that, with or without my cooperation, his next column, a week from today, is gonna be about me.<eos> He promised me that if I alert the brass first, he'll let me claim I did it voluntarily.<eos> Says it'll look good for everybody to have a positive story about a Latino in the department.<eos> Only problem about this positive story... it's gonna destroy my life.
There are 2 paths, one worn and one yet to be.<eos> How you plant your next step ahead in this moment will determine the way ahead for all of us.<eos> We know how the kings of the past would have moved against this problem, but you are different, Sire.<eos> You are the king of our future.<eos> The only question is what kind shall it be?
Do as you must.<eos> Baptize it thoroughly.<eos> See how life fights death.<eos> Cherish this moment.<eos> It is God-given.
What is that?<eos> We're outside the dome.<eos> Look.<eos> - Do you see that?<eos> - It's changing.
Look.<eos> - Do you see that?<eos> - It's changing.<eos> It's... it's going up.<eos> Where's it going?
What is your interest regarding minor legal transgressions not related to the red hook refinery?<eos> Low.<eos> We're not hunting you, Mr. Jones.<eos> I have sources working in Stark Industries, and they told me that Howard is working on a formula for molecular nitramene.<eos> Now, theoretically, it could result in a concussive blast followed by a vacuum implosion.
That is accurate.<eos> That's why we offered a substantial sum to Ms. Cardenas and her neighbors to help them relocate.<eos> We should never let good people get swallowed up by this city.<eos> I mourn this woman's death.<eos> Didn't have to happen. It should've...
The last one came within 50 meters of a school.<eos> Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids.<eos> - You expect us not to fight back?<eos> - We need the violence to stop.<eos> If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart. And it's our best hope for long-term stability.
The virus is not yet done with us, Mr. Cole.<eos> It will mutate again and again until not even the immune are left standing.<eos> There's only one way to end it.<eos> And you are the key.<eos> I want to send you back to stop the plague before it ever happens.
I got the idea from a journal article on lucid dream therapy.<eos> They think it can be used to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.<eos> Traumatized, stressed?<eos> Check and check.<eos> The theory is that it will allow people to objectively enter their dreams and face their fears.
Are you kidding?<eos> The sequel.<eos> So underrated.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Where is it?
Do you remember it? Would you like some more pig?<eos> And then, when you left for Rome, the Page went missing.<eos> I assume that wasn't coincidence.<eos> Why do you seek this page?<eos> Because some believe it holds great power.
- Where is the Page? - I don't know.<eos> - Can you read it?<eos> - I've never even seen it.<eos> - What are your plans for it? - My plans?<eos> I don't know what it does.
I need his answer tonight.<eos> The royal seal.<eos> You are convinced of its authenticity?<eos> Monsieur de Francy, this was torn from the royal exchequer's balance ledger.<eos> In it is all the expenditures His Majesty is forced to make in order to sustain wars in India, the Caribbean, the high seas, and here in the colonies.
You want the address?<eos> I'm sorry, but, I don't know how to get your powers back.<eos> This isn't a wormhole into Powers Land.<eos> Power can't just disappear, Harley.<eos> So, where the fuck does it go?
No, no, no, no, it's not a bomb, Janice.<eos> We really need this.<eos> It'll give the Powers a reason to stay in line.<eos> It is a bomb, Christian.<eos> And it doesn't discriminate.
But I'm sure he must have a way to remove it.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> This book.<eos> It's got all your stories in it.<eos> It started all this.
One step at a time.<eos> Now,<eos> Lucrezia said you had a page from the Book of Leaves.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Where is it?
Because the whole point of having this party is to help you get over him.<eos> No.<eos> The whole point of the party was to have fun, which I am having, to cut loose, which I think I'm doing a pretty good job of cutting.<eos> And to have a good night with friends, which Kevin is.<eos> Okay, as much as I love your dress, it doesn't really exactly scream "friends."
It certainly didn't get here by itself.<eos> There are some footprints over here, but they just end.<eos> They don't go anywhere.<eos> The blood on this rock can't be more than a day old, right?<eos> Where did it come from?
Wish we could just stay here.<eos> I could cancel the Cardinal this morning.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> I take it he found that book.<eos> What is it anyway?
Does God exist?<eos> Uh, well, not... not an entirely inappropriate sequitur actually.<eos> I-I think of God the same way as I think of love.<eos> I think if you think that God exists, then He does, because your faith and your actions bring His presence into the world, and the same is true of love.<eos> If you believe in its power and you conduct your life with respect of its... of its sanctity, then it'll always be there to serve you.
Enough!<eos> - Mr. Bohannon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> I promised the American people a railroad that crosses this country, gentlemen.<eos> It will be built.
[Cellphone beeps]<eos> - Did he have a gun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you pick it up?<eos> - No. Where is it?
- Did you pick it up?<eos> - No. Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> - Where is it, Korsak?
- Oh, well, now I know why you didn't tell me.<eos> - Are you kidding, Jason?<eos> - Because clearly you had it handled.<eos> - Look, I made a judgment call.<eos> - And I thought... - Oh, and I'm so glad it didn't come back to bite...
Yeah, she's coming.<eos> That's why I'm going home.<eos> What do you got, McGee?<eos> Well, Tony found a business card in one of the victim's office desk.<eos> It has the address of our missing tax consultants, but it's all the way in Bridgewater.
I like playing on the municipal court.<eos> [Crow cawing]<eos> Okay, my serve. [Ball bounces]<eos> Oh, God! [Growling] Just give the dog your tennis ball!<eos> It's brand-new!
[Sighs] What's to tell?<eos> A truck runs a stop sign, I avoid it, everyone walks away...<eos> Bing, bang, no boom.<eos> - Um, there was a truck! - Haley: That was crazy!<eos> - Okay, okay. - Where did it even come from?
Yeah, don't worry about it.<eos> I can take him.<eos> Madam Secretary, he owns more than 100 homes, each built to his specifications.<eos> He has a fleet of special-edition yachts.<eos> When he feels like ordering a pizza, it gets flown in from Rome.
What's going on?<eos> Quagmire, we need your help finding Meg.<eos> I would love if you guys would just call first.<eos> She's run off to some foot-fetish porn party.<eos> We figured you might know where it is.
I'm done with all this.<eos> Done with all what, Marshall?<eos> Our marriage?<eos> No.<eos> Your presidency and what it requires of you to keep from me.
That was a fun call.<eos> You're a real fun guy, fun guy.<eos> This is fun! This is fun!<eos> Gina!<eos> I know astronomy can seem a little daunting and scientific, but I have a friend who I think can make it pretty interesting.
You brought a blanket to a Mets game in mid-July.<eos> This one thinks July 18th is mid-July.<eos> You guys think I'm some kind of wimp, but I'm not.<eos> I am tough, and I'm strong, and I love to splash around in chilly water.<eos> It's not chilly, it's as cold as the waters of Cocytus, the frozen lake of hell.
Come out.<eos> Come out, wherever you are.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Read through your dumb book already.<eos> I'm looking, and it's not dumb, okay?
No, we hold it in our hands.<eos> The current doesn't drag the boat away?<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> In Cape Horn?<eos> The current holds it back a bit, but it still moves forward.
Momma Denise knows you're still scared.<eos> So you just might need another ghost story.<eos> No!<eos> This Japanese ghost story is called "The Red Cloak."<eos> And it's about a ghost who lurks in women's bathrooms.
Hurry!<eos> Catherine.<eos> Francis, he's dying.<eos> I've had a vision.<eos> The prophecy, it will come to pass.
I'm trying to stop the Horseman and his ally from killing you.<eos> So listen... I know you've seen things in this war that you cannot explain.<eos> General Washington has put his trust in you.<eos> He told you this revolution isn't just a war about the future of this country.<eos> It'll determine the fate of every man, woman and child.
A girlfriend?<eos> I found a long strand of hair on his floor when we were over there last night.<eos> Oh my goodness.<eos> Do you think it's the same girl that we met at the police station from a while back?<eos> I don't know who it is, either.
- Have you seen them? - Can't say I have, no.<eos> Cannot say or will not say?<eos> Hey, where'd you get that flask?<eos> That's Maclnnis's.<eos> What's it doing here and where's my bloody flask?
What manner of thing will it be, I wonder?<eos> The mystery deepened when we arrived and were given idiotic health and safety outfits.<eos> But then all was revealed.<eos> Most of the steel used to build modern China came out of this vast hole in the ground.<eos> But today it would be our racetrack.
He was trying to say we need to differentiate ourselves and really move out of this hobbyist realm.<eos> It ended up coming out of the room saying,<eos> "We're going to call ourselves the personal computer."<eos> Industry experts say we're no longer on the verge of the personal computer revolution.<eos> We're right in the midst of it, thank you.
What happens then?<eos> - You are forgiven.<eos> - Is that all?<eos> He doesn't return the men?<eos> I bring a sheep for Allah, it disappears and I'm forgiven.
Thanks for coming, everybody.<eos> I really appreciate your time.<eos> So, what did you think of the book?<eos> Of Mice and Men, it's Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck's classic American novel.<eos> It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim.
- Of course, I'll go.<eos> I really want you to leave!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let me finish my special tea.<eos> Where is it'? - Here...
Oh, come on, now.<eos> Duck!<eos> Gracious, is that a pajama top?<eos> Well, what is a pajama top, John?<eos> I mean, if you fall asleep in that shirt, does it become a pajama top?
What type is your Mr. Carsen, pray tell?<eos> This is it!<eos> It should be here.<eos> The temple should be right here.<eos> Where is it?
They were just... taken.<eos> Well, I do hope this serves as a lesson to keep your curiosity in check, young lady. Jenkins!<eos> Colonel, if she had not been tinkering with magic, she wouldn't have had the imagination to even stumble upon her new equations for the particle accelerator.<eos> Okay, well, then I guess it's our fault, too.<eos> 'Cause all the Library does is lock up magic and try to tell people that it doesn't exist, when we could be a place where people like Lucy can come for answers and knowledge and... and training.
Drug reference!<eos> Uh, seriously, what am I here for?<eos> Nobody told you?<eos> They send a limo, I get in.<eos> It takes me somewhere.
- That's disgusting.<eos> Okay, now that is...<eos> That's definitely not appropriate.<eos> - It's totally fine. We got the can out, too.<eos> - Sure, yeah. But they're gonna ask how it got in there.
I think I know what I'm trying to say.<eos> Just someone.<eos> Not the whole town. Just save someone.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I know where I got this face, and I know what it's for.
I can fill the gap. He's a distraction.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> Okay, I got it-- level nine government research lab.<eos> It's required to burn all its documents because shredded paper can always be put back together.<eos> In other words, we go in through the incinerator because there's no surveillance on it.
You know Personally when I start feeling like I'm gonna go over the edge,<eos> I begin to salivate in the back of my mouth.<eos> Does that ever happen to you?<eos> And then my veins, they begin to itch uncontrollably, and the hunger consumes me-- every sound, every scent.<eos> The world around me falls apart, and all I can hear is the pulsing of someone's blood, and all I feel is that it belongs to me.

Okay, everybody!<eos> Gather round!<eos> Get in here.<eos> Because Phil, the hero of the moment, has a little surprise for all of us.<eos> It involves getting power up here to the cul de sac, but that's all I'll say.
You have picked a terrible moment to break your vow of chastity.<eos> - At least go to Confession.<eos> - I don't want to repent.<eos> I love him. How can love be bad?<eos> It isn't. But hypocrisy is.
He's better off with Alak.<eos> - No. - A son belongs with his father.<eos> But we have each other, just like we did when we first arrived on this planet, and just like then, we will survive and prosper.<eos> Do not lose faith.<eos> I made you a promise back then, and it still holds.
I have a close working relationship with our quantum computer.<eos> What I don't have, though, is a cassette player.<eos> Now you do.<eos> Before we get started I want to say something.<eos> In this lab we deal with death all the time, but when it hits this close to home, death can leave us with a lot of questions.
Now.<eos> What have you done, Emilio?<eos> Whatever I had to to protect you, to protect this family.<eos> You found the ledger, huh?<eos> Where is it?
Fiddleford, get a hold of yourself.<eos> You're not making any sense.<eos> This machine is dangerous.<eos> You'll bring about the end of the world with this.<eos> Destroy it before it destroys us all!
I know Jason to be innocent.<eos> That is not for you to decide. It is for the gods and those who speak for them.<eos> It is for the priests to pass judgment.<eos> I do not seek to deny vengeance.<eos> But it must be brought on those who committed the crime.
Did that son of a bitch just flip us the bird?<eos> Why did he do that?<eos> Now we got to get out of the car.<eos> You know what he did?<eos> He put bad karma out in the world, and now it's coming home to roost.
Yet, funny, isn't it, how long ago all of that feels... you needing blood, me needing the bunker?<eos> Still... now that none of us are going to die...<eos> - You've a nerve coming here.<eos> - Haven't I?<eos> See, now that there's a future, I've been thinking what it holds for me, what kind of man will I be?
Point is, love is tricky.<eos> You can't go looking for it.<eos> Then how am I gonna find it?<eos> You don't.<eos> It finds you.
You must leave.<eos> Now!<eos> Is your book more important than me?<eos> Nothing is more important than you.<eos> But it has caused great misery in this world.
Hey.<eos> Hey, Skippy.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Where'd you send that truck?<eos> Where's it going?
Good. Then we'll begin.<eos> Where is the Osgood box?<eos> You will answer me, Clara.<eos> Truth or consequences. Lie and you die.<eos> Where is it?
...bombing relief efforts.<eos> The UN says it's a full-blown humanitarian crisis, while in neighboring Abuddin, air strikes by government forces began today in the campaign to take back Ma'an City from the Caliphate.<eos> The enemy suffered substantial losses, and President Al Fayeed, who is in mourning, said,<eos> "Today we start a fight for freedom, the end of which "my grandson will not see,<eos> "but it is for all the children and grandchildren of Abuddin."
Prime Minister Cho, it's truly an honor to be here in the Oval Office, though I wish it were under better circumstances.<eos> I just came back from a meeting with the world's top scientists.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> The virus, it got them all.<eos> I was able to obtain a sample, but it's not in the vial.
Don't you think I ask myself that?<eos> I have to live with this for the rest of my life.<eos> But you want to know what the craziest part is?<eos> That night changed me.<eos> It changed me, Jules.
That's why you pushed William away.<eos> No, it was his crying that lead them to where we were hiding.<eos> It was his fault that they died.<eos> Now was it?<eos> The war was the best thing that ever happened to you because it made you the man you were meant to be.
Noma, you're gonna fall.<eos> I won't. I can fly.<eos> You can't!<eos> It's the Darkness.<eos> It's tricking you.
It was meant to be an extinction event, but oh, no, you crossed sides and made it a war, and I get the blame.<eos> All my angels came to my side but you, my own brother.<eos> You left me when I needed you most.<eos> You broke our family apart.<eos> No, it was already broken... by another... the archangel who chose humanity first, long before I did.
Why wood?<eos> Can you even get this wet?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Is that...? His real hand.<eos> Okay, it just, it just moved.
You're late.<eos> I think what you mean to say is "Thank you""<eos> Thank you, Mr. McNally, for violating the privacy of an American citizen.<eos> A nice beard.<eos> Yeah, I'd tell you what it's for, but then I'd have to kill you.
"Badge." Now it's just "Badge"?<eos> Writers are a bunch of nervous, high-strung, self-hating crazies, calling all hours of the day or night, wanting to read their stuff over the phone.<eos> But she never mentioned threats of violence.<eos> Could we see your wife's old client list?<eos> - Do you know where it is?
You are still a human being.<eos> And a woman I have come to respect believes in you.<eos> Merci.<eos> This one was given to me by someone very special.<eos> It reminds me of a path not taken.
I got a phone call off Piper, out of the blue.<eos> He said someone gave him my number and did I want to earn a few hundred quid, helping him moving some stuff.<eos> That's it. Move it where?<eos> Most of it went into storage and some of it went to a boat that he owned.<eos> Well, where was it?
It appears this one hails from Sumeria.<eos> Which means that she's connected to the prophecy somehow?<eos> One that says that we destroy the world.<eos> Though I'm not sure that I buy some slip of the tongue from Pandora.<eos> Well, erroneous message or not, what's in it for releasing evil upon Sleepy Hollow?
We always have a man on the inside.<eos> Or in some cases, a woman.<eos> Pillow talk is so much more valuable than the tedious codswallop people spout in public, but, I must say, you did remarkably well keeping your other side from her.<eos> The one thing we wanted to know about.<eos> So how do you like it, hm?
Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> [ Sighs ] I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?

Walter trusts him, and we are out of options.<eos> You take the pills, we break you out, we save the judges-- easy.<eos> Not sure about the "save the judges" part.<eos> I memorized the manual, but the legend was missing.<eos> It's the key to the code's use patterns.
I am a free man now.<eos> And you will never hold me back from getting what I want again.<eos> Killian... Whatever deal you made to get your revenge on Gold, it's not worth it.<eos> The darkness is using you.<eos> It doesn't care what you want. It only cares what it wants.
You're gonna need a dentist.<eos> Hey, give me your hands.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> Huh? Where is it?
And I want all collars in that precinct debriefed, no matter what the charge is.<eos> Commissioner.<eos> Well?<eos> Good news-- the reporter was wearing a bullet proof vest.<eos> It absorbed two of the bullets.

It destroys you.
Uh I-I didn't get a gift for the lovely bride and groom.<eos> I think most of you know that I've, uh, been in rehab, so there's not a whole lot of time for shopping, yeah.<eos> Uh so instead, I thought that I would, uh, sing a song to c-commemorate this beautiful evening.<eos> It's an old one, but, man, it's a hell of a song.<eos> And... and nobody really knows what it's about, but to me, it's about family.
This was a hard day and there have been some hard days for Sergeant Colborn.<eos> But... any pain... any burden that he's bearing... pales in comparison to what the State of Wisconsin and the people working for it have inflicted on Steven Avery and his family.<eos> And right now Steven Avery needs Jerry Buting and Dean Strang and anybody out there who believes in him, badly.<eos> We do believe in him.<eos> We are willing to do hard things to advance his cause, and he's been saying since November, 2005, that someone must have planted his blood if it's in that car.

Let's go!<eos> So I'm just trying to understand why it is that you don't erase these things before you give them to people.<eos> I have amazing playlists and people want them. That's the gift. The gift is the playlist, not the iPad.<eos> When I update my music library, it syncs to their iPads.
- Oh, you remember.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yes, you do. She remembers.<eos> She sang it nonstop, all the time, over and over and over and over.<eos> She sang it in the school talent show because it was the '92 election, and she believed that it had political subtext about how much the country needed to have Bill Clinton elected as president.
People need to handle their own damn problems.<eos> Paying you to listen to me is not the solution. Then what's the solution?<eos> I need to sort this out on my own.<eos> Thank you. Zoe, you can't keep running from your past.<eos> Because sooner or later, it's gonna catch up with you.
So, I ask you again, which one of you was it?<eos> What if it didn't come from any of us?<eos> What if she's just a vessel or a conduit?<eos> She needs to go to the hospital.<eos> Try to control your hysteria, Kristina, it's beneath you.
A lot of people have long believed that something lives in our woods.<eos> I didn't wanna alarm any of you until I knew for certain, but tonight it attacked my home.<eos> A few weeks ago, a logging camp opened up 90 miles north of here.<eos> We believe that it drove the creature south, looking for a new home.<eos> With the animals on the run, it's looking for food.
- Give me the name. The name!<eos> Robert, it's time.<eos> All right, all right, all right!<eos> You win. I'll give you the money.<eos> - Where is it?
He said it's a place where all things go to live, and all things go to die.<eos> A place for wonder.<eos> A place for fear.<eos> My father said each man's wilderness is his own.<eos> It's alive in us.
You think you could do that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I see it in your eyes, too.<eos> That bitterness.<eos> It can take over.
And we're drinking wine.<eos> And then he leans over to me, and he just starts pouring the wine over my head.<eos> And I look down and I realize I'm-- I'm a little baby, and he's giving me a tubby.<eos> And there's something weird about the water.<eos> I put my hand in it and reach up, and it's just covered in blood.
So there was intimacy too.<eos> Stop picking apart every word I say.<eos> Anything more would have endangered our relationship.<eos> I was, uh -<eos> My intuition told me that it was far more valuable than desire.
I have no intention of returning to the Briga.<eos> Kumtak, get this Gula out of the way.<eos> Even an obstinate Briga like him knows it's a grave sin to kill one who's been blessed by Gula.<eos> You used manna.<eos> It makes you faster, stronger, allows you to heal more rapidly than if you were in your sleep hive.
What?<eos> I'm dead.<eos> I belong there.<eos> Uh, I don't really have time for this right now.<eos> Can you tell me where it is?
Because religion is like a-- it's like a mind virus that parents have passed on down to their children, and Christianity is the worst virus of all.<eos> It slowly creeps into our lives when we're weak or sick or helpless.<eos> So, religion is like a disease? .<eos> (Professor Radisson) Yes.<eos> Yes, it infects everything.
I'm terribly sorry--<eos> I'm terribly sorry, men.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This map ain't much.<eos> But it's the only thing we got to get us home.
All I know is my mate's getting buried in two days time 'cause your boys killed him.<eos> Well, he did turn over one of my bars. I mean, some people would say that's karma.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> You know what they say about karma, don't you, Mickey'?<eos> It's always coming.
The fishing pole's not working.<eos> Just ask Grandpa.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.
Every human government causes suffering.<eos> None has ever succeeded in eradicating war, criminality, injustice or disease.<eos> God is here, and will soon put an end to all our suffering.<eos> Some might think that death is unjust.<eos> But Jehovah tells us it is not unjust.
Trial lawyers never run appeals.<eos> That's why we have an appellate section full of weirdy geeks who get off on academic fine points.<eos> I know this case.<eos> There won't be time for anyone to get their head around it.<eos> It's loaded, you know that.
Next thing, you're a wasted talent doing drink-driving and contested speed fines.<eos> What you did, you did out of passion.<eos> We need more of that around here, not less.<eos> You'll hear from Tracey about that brief.<eos> You make sure it goes to trial.
That's the star map! - So what exactly are we looking for?<eos> - The tetrahedron.<eos> The three-sided pyramid is also the hieroglyphic symbol for the Sirius star.<eos> Look!<eos> There it is.
What's the matter boy, wolf got your tongue?<eos> Just don't know if I'm more shocked to be alive Or seeing a man of the cloth with a gun.<eos> Well, I wouldn't agree with mr. Darwin on many things, But there is a certain credence to the idea<eos> Of survival of the fittest. You don't negotiate with nature,<eos> You either best it or it bests you.
I don't want to make a social outing of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> But you have to get on a schedule.<eos> Once a week, otherwise this is just going to keep happening.<eos> You push the change until it finally overtakes you.
It's a compass.<eos> Was mine during the war.<eos> I put an inscription on the inside.<eos> Well. [Chuckles] There you go.<eos> It says, "To my son Devon.
Unfortunately, Ryan, in this life, there are times when only violence keeps them safe.<eos> This isn't one of those times.<eos> Let me do my job, Javier.<eos> Don't start this war.<eos> It's already started.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling you can't even look at it, and other times, great black thunderheads roll across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself.<eos> What I fear most is nature.<eos> Now that it's sent its weather to exact revenge, we're all in for it now.<eos> Soon the weather is gonna put on a real show.<eos> Funnily enough, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get and the more interesting it becomes and the more it moulds itself to the narrative I have set for it.
Miranda's still on tour, much to the detriment of our budding relationship she's in Paris for...<eos> Okay, I didn't mean anything about Miranda.<eos> I meant a certain dinner party.<eos> At your house.<eos> Forced idle chitchat at a dinner party you can't leave because it's in your own home is the very definition of hell.
- Why not?<eos> - This was a Manchester-based suspect.<eos> - But the gun hasn't been found.<eos> No.<eos> So you can't say where it was from.
No.<eos> Then you can't say that he had a gun, can you, Mr Brannigan?<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> Well, er... call me old-fashioned, but it's common sense.<eos> Nobody else had access to that drawer and knew what was in it.
But with one big difference.<eos> On Titan, the seas and the rain are made not of water but of methane and ethane.<eos> On Earth, those molecules form natural gas.<eos> On frigid Titan, they're liquid.<eos> Titan has lots of water, but all of it is frozen hard as rock.
And believe me, speaking as someone who really knows about this shit, you don't have the choice, not any more.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> Because that's the side you're on, Nessa.<eos> You don't own this secret. It owns you.
And Cliff said to me, "I have never done anything the Ewings have asked me to do, and I'm sure not gonna start now."<eos> He had no regrets.<eos> And neither do I.<eos> It had to be done, Pamela.<eos> And whatever clemency he deserved died the day he ordered the rig to be blown up with you on it.
It's something much bigger.<eos> That flower is the signature of a woman who works for the Cardinal.<eos> Time to pay for your crimes, "Milady".<eos> How many times have you cleaned those pistols tonight?<eos> Respect your weapon, and it'll respect you.
The last fragment of a once living planet.<eos> Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants, while its head was cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space, screaming in pain and sorrow.<eos> In legend and in fact, it is known as
If he ever sat for a portrait, it no longer exists.<eos> He was once described by an acquaintance as "a short little man, of black complexion, and fat."<eos> Michell imagined a star so big, so massive, that nothing, not even light, could escape its gravitational grip.<eos> Can you find the dark star?<eos> You can't see it with your eyes, not directly, but it may leave a kind of footprint on the cosmic shore.
Well, I'm happy to be here for her.<eos> I do appreciate it.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - You, too.<eos> So one misconception is that a net force is required to keep a body in motion, when in fact it's needed to change whatever current state of motion the body is in.
Well, it's not what you think.<eos> It's exactly what I think.<eos> We were supposed to find it.<eos> But why give the book back after going to all that trouble to steal it?<eos> Because now it's a trojan horse.
I thought that you were still threatening me.<eos> I told you I would tell Melissa the truth.<eos> And I told you to forget it, but you were holding on to it like a dog with a bone.<eos> Hey, this conversation isn't over!<eos> It is over, Spencer.
Bobby.<eos> - Bobby, come here.<eos> - What's up?<eos> I have entered a new phase.<eos> What is it?
- Yes, but, the way he's acting... and.. Beswick, sir.<eos> I... that guy in cell six, I don't know...<eos> Don't you worry, Constable.<eos> I'll be with you very soon.<eos> The dark of the last night does not fall. It rises up.
Any chance of AC-12 getting a peek?<eos> Nurse's car. Joe's car.<eos> No accident. Mm.<eos> He never once turns round so the camera can see him.<eos> That's cos he knows it's there.
DI Denton has already provided a comprehensive statement and interview in this regard.<eos> Yes, as a witness.<eos> These matters will now be addressed under the terms of the Regulation 15 notice you've just been served, DS Arnott.<eos> You've seen this illustration before - document five in your folders.<eos> It shows the location of the safe house, 12 St James' Close, the route taken by the convoy, the location of the ambush which led to the deaths of DS Akers, Sergeant Wallis and PC Butler.

No, please, let me just-- Let me just say this.<eos> Okay.<eos> When I feel disrespected, especially by someone that I care about, it just does something to me, okay?<eos> Um... My pride is something that I'm working through.<eos> It makes me see things all twisted, and I just had to go and shake it off.
Hey" Help.<eos> I won't let you die.<eos> But I will still kill you every day.<eos> Not once, but a thousand times.<eos> You will face death each time but it won't come to you.
Alright then, my guys brought your truck back safely.<eos> How do I thank you, man?<eos> You forget kabul.<eos> I'm the one who owes you.<eos> You left the war, but looks like it never left you.
! You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.<eos> Beauty is beauty.<eos> My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.<eos> The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton is, "Did it move you?"
It would certainly explain the ugly shoes.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Carmen called.<eos> She told us about the secret lesbian drawer.<eos> Where is it?
Oh, Olivia, you must not get yourself worked up in a state.<eos> Being fobbed off by them is one thing.<eos> I will not be fobbed off by you.<eos> Very well.<eos> But you must promise to abide by the doctor's decision, whatever it is.
I'm well aware it sounds bananas. But looking at the fossil record, knowing what I know about this infection, you cannot say for certain it isn't what killed off the dinosaurs.
You kind of overslept.<eos> Nope, no school today.<eos> How about we go on a trip?<eos> Like a vacation?<eos> Like I have a new case, and it's in Maine, and it might take me awhile, and I think we should go.
His team would have spent months digging up every scrap of dirt on Andrew Nichols he could find.<eos> They would have used this against him already.<eos> And if he never found out about Andrew's drug use, then...<eos> It means the story isn't coming from Leo.<eos> Then who's it coming from?
One thing I will try to hold on to, though, is the memory of speaking here today.<eos> It will go. I know it will.<eos> It may be gone by tomorrow... but it means so much to be talking here today... like my old, ambitious self... who was so fascinated by communication."<eos> Thank you for this opportunity.<eos> It means the world to me.
Neighbors described the brutal scene as, and I quote, "a blood bath."<eos> Corey Bachman, the couple's eight-year-old son, remains missing.<eos> This recent discovery, the killing of Troy Miller and the abduction of Bonnie Lipton, along with the death of Eudora Tattler, bring to four the number of shocking murders that have terrified the residents of our peaceful hamlet in the past two weeks.<eos> Although police have not yet confirmed a connection, the grim fact that a similar weapon was involved in all four killings leads this reporter to conclude a single maniac is preying upon the citizens of Jupiter township.<eos> One can only hope that, when justice comes, it will be swift and final.
Fuck!<eos> Little fucking prick!<eos> It's here somewhere, all right?<eos> We gotta find it.<eos> Where is it, dickweed?
I'm done. I relinquish the remainder of my time.<eos> The Chair recognizes the Congresswoman from Tennessee.<eos> You have 12 minutes, ma'am.<eos> Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently embroiled in a trade war with China.<eos> It has gutted our economy. It has placed our navy in harm's way.
The last fragment of a once living planet.<eos> Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants, while its head was cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space, screaming in pain and sorrow.<eos> In legend and in fact, it is known as
Your son.<eos> You know?<eos> The one I busted my ass to get safe when he was kidnapped.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> When you needed this unit, it rallied around...
You are going to rehire me, Kate. Unless you feel like explaining to the press that your own assistant district attorney was the brilliant mastermind behind tonight's hostage crisis.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I have to say, I am impressed.<eos> I would have thought blackmail was a little dark for you.<eos> Someone recently told me, once you let the darkness inside, it never comes out.
You've proven your worth to this family.<eos> None would dare lay a hand on you.<eos> It's not my body I worry for.<eos> I wonder about the bond between us.<eos> And how it will endure.
- Yeah, they've just mastered energy.<eos> I mean, what is this energy?<eos> How are they manufacturing this energy?<eos> - Look, it just...<eos> - Where does it come from?
No, it means "removal of death."<eos> So?<eos> Isn't that the same thing?<eos> You can't just remove someone's death, Dash.<eos> It has to go somewhere.
Can we figure it out later?<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> Rough night?<eos> Yeah. My head is killing me. - You?<eos> - I'm pretty sure I ate a pine cone. Because it told me to.
Here we go.<eos> Either your marriage is in shambles, in which case, you're trying to hide it from the whole world, or you're gloriously happy, and you want to rub everybody's noses in it.<eos> Kee, don't project your relationship issues onto us.<eos> "Behold our covenant of love."<eos> You're cranky about the recommitment ceremony because it has the word "commit" in it, and you're afraid of that word.
A year later, 1909, first aerial shots.<eos> There's history to be made here, Lester.<eos> What made you look up, Mrs. Masters?<eos> Well, um, the sound of the truck, - the squeal of the tires.<eos> - And how close would you say you were to it when it passed you?
Something consistent with a boat crash?<eos> Because of the pronounced skin maceration and postmortem injuries due to aquatic activity...<eos> English, please.<eos> It's very difficult to ascertain the cause of death.<eos> As of right now, it's undetermined.
- What ring?<eos> - His wedding band.<eos> It's white gold.<eos> It should be here.<eos> Where is it?
I'll take a make-up test.<eos> I'll do extra credit work.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> I'm bringing my grade back up.<eos> And this time, I'm earning it.
- Sensible folk.<eos> - Not so much.<eos> I trained with them for a while, helped them get their hands on some...<eos> supplies, including that lantern.<eos> Knew it must do something interesting. Just never knew what.
I am devoted to him and to the precious thing that we're building together!<eos> I'm his partner.<eos> I can tell when he's vomiting...<eos> - Uh, what? No. Because he's nervous...<eos> - Never mind, Kate, I'm fine. - ...or when he's vomiting because he's sick or when he's vomiting because he had cilantro, which he loves but he shouldn't have because it makes him...
Oh, that's a real sob story.<eos> Well told. Aren't they expecting you back in Transylvania before sunrise?<eos> This vaccine your Dr. Scott has developed is now the single greatest commodity in the world.<eos> Every day its value increases, as those not yet infected grow desperate for it.<eos> And it's mine!
I understand the seriousness of the Chicago situation, but I thought there'd be a proper vetting process.<eos> So did I. Specifically told the general counsel.<eos> His decision wasn't based on Chicago.<eos> And the D.C.I. couldn't come down here and tell us himself?<eos> And it is final.
[Laughs] Yes, Lieutenant.<eos> Ms. Jones, I know I speak for the entire house when I say that 51 is proud to welcome a female firefighter.<eos> I will see to it that you are treated with the dignity and respect that you deserve.<eos> Thank you, Chief.<eos> In return, you will treat this job with the dignity and respect that it deserves.
Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why none of the guys are here.<eos> They're waiting at my apartment, ready to jump out when we got back.<eos> But if you thought that something was finally gonna happen between us, why'd you stop?<eos> We're gonna have our love story someday, and, uh, it's not gonna start like this.
If not you then maybe your men.<eos> Look, my men don't lie.<eos> I don't want to argue with you.<eos> But I took a great risk to get the CD.<eos> If it falls in wrong hands then many people will get in trouble.
If you cannot trust me, your superior officer, then I cannot trust you.<eos> And I certainly will not trust this.<eos> Burn it.<eos> This'll end in violence.<eos> Violence is what began it.
One drills a hole in one's skull.<eos> Well, I have many devices that can open a man's head.<eos> Except the trephine does so with delicacy and accuracy and to cure rather than to kill.<eos> Heathens believe the procedure releases evil spirits.<eos> I believe it relieves pressure on the meat of the brain.
I don't have any friends.<eos> You're all I've got.<eos> And I think that might be part of the problem.<eos> All I know is that when we're together, there's something about your power that...<eos> It doesn't just amplify mine, okay, it affects everything.
What are you doing?<eos> Pamela!<eos> - It's been the plan all along that I must die for all our sins.<eos> But I will return as the princess of peace, the messiah.<eos> Well, I have seen your future, messiah, and it's not very bright.
You need to tell me.<eos> Is he blackmailing you?<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> He's got nothing to do with why I need the money.<eos> You have to tell me why you need it, then.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> So, I was doing a little digging on the chain of custody of our missing weapon.<eos> Where is it?
Would you like me to count it for you?<eos> He's--he's funny.<eos> Where's the rest of the document, sir?<eos> There is no rest of it.<eos> Where is it?
- Stupid...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Pain is worse?<eos> All right, it looks like you're losing blood supply to your bowel.<eos> I'm worried that your hernia is strangulated, which means that it's cutting off blood supply to your intestines, and you could go septic.
Remember your own words, my love.<eos> "We must have faith."<eos> What are we searching for?<eos> The Hellfire Club had this stone tablet in their lab.<eos> I know it has some significance, but the photo didn't turn out right.
Having the name means I don't have to act on it all the time.<eos> So, no matter what you may have assumed, this is not an easy sell.<eos> I don't come to this decision lightly.<eos> But I see no other way to starve Darryl Crowe of his means.<eos> Once you fire this bullet, it don't go back in the barrel.
- I'm really not the right person. - Okay, just look at something.<eos> This happened the other night.<eos> I picked it up. I was trying to get rid of it, and now Claire has a bruise in the exact same place on her arm.<eos> - It's not a voodoo doll.<eos> - I know it's not. But I... I took this doll that night and put it in a dumpster, and the very next morning, it was back.
There's something I need to tell you.<eos> Whoo, happy Fourth!<eos> We're building a weapon.<eos> It's not like any weapon the world's ever seen.<eos> It draws its energy from a fast-neutron chain reaction.
Because of course, his Aston Martin is too large.<eos> Good God!<eos> Look at that!<eos> In the event of a nuclear war, they could get 14 submarines in here, and 3,000 people.<eos> It's under a mountain!
- Stop!<eos> And your mother.<eos> She's hot.<eos> - Hi, Mathilde.<eos> - Who is it?
Oh, that's fine then.<eos> I couldn't help noticing this school is located in...<eos> I'm not one to judge, but, um...<eos> I'll say it, Marge.<eos> It's in Hell!
- Maybe.<eos> - Hey, Frankie.<eos> - Morning, Dr. Avery.<eos> Hey, are you named after that big award... the Harper Avery?<eos> It's actually named after me, after my family.
You to live.<eos> Go.<eos> Corporate interests in this city have absorbed and perverted democracy at its heart.<eos> Voters elected me to put an end to this corruption.<eos> It stretches from the boardroom to the police department.
Um, I can just show it to you.<eos> You're barking up the wrong tree.<eos> No, you want this machine to stand out from every other machine on the floor, you gotta stop talking about the machine and you gotta start talking about the people that made it.<eos> They bled for this.<eos> The future's coming whether we like it or not, but it ain't written anywhere that it includes any of us.
I've got nothing to say.<eos> D-4, Skevur.<eos> Two empty wrappers.<eos> That means a second bomb.<eos> Where is it?
Well, that is a gorgeous view.<eos> Yes, it is. But don't look at that.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.<eos> Focus on what it actually means.
Have a seat, Boyd.<eos> Any place in particular?<eos> There will be fine.<eos> So, you want to explain how your buddy the marshal came to seize half our shipment?<eos> Well, seeing how it wasn't in my possession, I think that's more of a question for Darryl Crowe Jr.
I assume they were secretly meeting to discuss water prices.<eos> A toast now, took some Foreign Affairs guards with them.<eos> There was also an explosion at the Yamanote Dam.<eos> The dam?<eos> Don't know if it's related. But it belongs to a foreign-owned water company, and there's a retired Trade official on staff.
I want to bring the future of cyborg technology to the third world.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> You should live by your own free will and use your power to do something good. Not at the beck and call of people you can never trust.<eos> The war is over, you know.<eos> It's still going.
My daring escape and flee to freedom-- all true.<eos> I swear.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna need to see all your online correspondence with this "Eater."<eos> All right, sure, but it won't help you track him.
The letter's not enough to incriminate the Grayson's, but Pascal has a piece of the puzzle that I don't.<eos> - Aiden.<eos> - "TWM" is Trevor Warren Mathis.<eos> Pascal was talking about my father.<eos> As children, we flinch at the sight of blood, not yet realizing it means family, loyalty, and is the essence of life.
SA... do you... ...me?<eos> Callen, Sam, do you hear me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Sam and Callen are on the sub.<eos> Where is it?
Whoa.<eos> You know what?<eos> You want help with that hole?<eos> Here's a tip:<eos> it's always in the same place.
You know, first, I was devastated.<eos> Then I just thought, "You know what?<eos> Fine." "There are plenty of fish in the sea.<eos> I'll just leave."<eos> So I jumped into this little dinghy, and I was trying to row, and all of a sudden, it flipped over, and it started sinking.
When was the last time any of you saw him?<eos> Last Wednesday night-- practice ended at 8:00, and we all left.<eos> Coach stayed to lock up and swim laps, like usual.<eos> I think Coach Gabby was still here, though.<eos> Yeah. - Although a nonspecific response, it seemed fraught with meaning.
What am I talking about?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That money didn't just disappear!<eos> So where is it!
Were you expecting someone else?<eos> Your hair looks pretty.<eos> Have you seen my red duffel bag?<eos> Molly?<eos> What do you want it for?
The picture was taken at 9:44 P.M.<eos> Now, if we enlarge it...<eos> The person seated at table number 17 is not Jackie.<eos> - Looks just like her.<eos> - Who is it?
Imagine less. [Sighs]<eos> - Tell them about the pole.<eos> - Okay. So, I-I was working.<eos> I have this move. It's called the double helix.<eos> So, I jumped on the pole, and it broke off in my hands.
Twice.<eos> The gun is clean.<eos> There's no record of its sale, no listing in the database.<eos> It's ice-cold.<eos> As far as the federal government is concerned, it doesn't exist.
Frankie, what do you got?<eos> We went back and combed through all the victim's Autopay accounts and found something strange.<eos> Fran's gardener, Joe Martin, got a pay raise.<eos> Six months after Fran died.<eos> According to the bank, it was entered from her regular I.P. address, using her password.
How you feel now is how I felt that night in the cave.<eos> What?<eos> You are walking toward a thinny...<eos> An open one.<eos> And it wants you back.
It's just paint.<eos> What... What happened?<eos> A spirit took your body for a spin.<eos> To send me a message, by the look of it.<eos> What's it mean?
You've heard of force majeure, yeah?<eos> An extraordinary circumstance that frees both parties from a contract.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> This dome is about as majeure a force as it gets.<eos> But it's gonna deliver us to a better place.
I never should've. What are you talking about?<eos> You made a huge mistake crossing me.<eos> Did I never mention... that the dome... saved me from death at those gallows?<eos> It redeemed me.<eos> It chose me... to do what it wants.
Not at the moment.<eos> Mom, you're always a cop.<eos> Go talk to her. She will crack so fast.<eos> There's no way she can look you in eye and say that Carter stole that jewelry.<eos> But, Taylor, the problem is that Carter knows where it is, or at least what happened to it.
You okay?<eos> Last night my printer went off by itself.<eos> I couldn't turn it off.<eos> I hit the cancel button.<eos> But it just kept printing.
I know you girls don't like it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I never tasted it, but I have tested it in my lab,<eos> - and it's chemically enhancing you.
What also happens is that this fat in the liver is then sent out into the bloodstream as triglycerides, which can lead to excess weight plus blocked arteries and heart disease.<eos> Now, when we're eating lots of sugar and other carbohydrates like bread and pasta, we're producing lots of glucose.<eos> A hormone called insulin is released, which is like a key that helps to open our cells' doors so they can absorb all the glucose, remove it from the bloodstream and burn it for energy.<eos> The more glucose in the blood, the more insulin is released.<eos> But the key point for us is that while this insulin is in the blood dealing with all the glucose, it tells our fat cells to hold on to the fat.
So few people know how to wield it.<eos> - You were right.<eos> - Get out.<eos> I don't want this infernal hand anymore.<eos> It's taken possession of me.
See him?<eos> There isn't a day goes by without me longing to see him.<eos> There's a bond between a mother and her child that does not break.<eos> Doesn't matter who wants to break it or why - it cannot...<eos> It will not be broken.
Well, now I don't want to talk about it.<eos> This bonus thing has me thinking.<eos> - Ohh. - Stop.<eos> It's not really your thing.<eos> It... either my bonus is bigger because I make more and it reflects that...
What, you don't think it's cute?<eos> Neigh way, Jose.<eos> "Neigh way, Jose."<eos> I improvised that line.<eos> I mean, it was written, but I gave it the old BoJack spin.
It's a little drafty in there.<eos> Okay.<eos> - (Bleep)! - Honey, whatcha looking for?<eos> I can't find that note.<eos> - Oh, who's it from?
But that would mean Perez was shot when J-me was 9 and living in Boise.<eos> Were the details of the, uh, crucifix ever made public?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> So either J-me was psychic or...<eos> Or someone told him that story, and he didn't know what it meant.
Men like Narcisse, protected by the Church and the Crown.<eos> Your father built his power by giving the nobles what they wanted.<eos> If he were here now, he would let those men die.<eos> And what do you expect him to do, risk disenfranchising the nobles he depends on?<eos> Well, maybe it's time we change things, shift the power back to where it belongs, with you, our king.
But it was never the right time.<eos> But you know, it's okay.<eos> I have no regrets.<eos> But, Steve, the one thing I never gave up on... was love.<eos> And I guess it never gave up on me either because here he is.
- There are no records...<eos> - There are records.<eos> Receipts, paint samples, eyewitness accounts, testimonials from the junkyard that demolished your Mercedes.<eos> And it all goes to the Times If you don't vote down this challenge to the gun law.<eos> So, before you go ahead and do what you say is your job, ask yourself how much it's really worth.
Good.<eos> Because there's only one way that I can communicate with Clara.<eos> Your dad?<eos> Going by the timing, I'd say so.<eos> If you let him anywhere near the subject of golf, I will do a thing, and it will not be a good thing.
♪ Everybody needs a second chance ♪<eos> Both: ♪ everybody's working for the weekend ♪<eos> [Laughter] That song's not about working for the weekend.<eos> - [Elevator bell dings]<eos> - Beg your pardon? I love that song, but it's not about working for the weekend.
Party Started, and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever.<eos> - Is that right, boys?<eos> - Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.<eos> You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.<eos> Now this party is also for a good cause because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson.
You get a quarter from the hope commission every time you say that word.<eos> Admit it.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Well, it's easy for you to say... you're a hero.<eos> Whenever you need help, it just magically shows up, like Henry's book.
It wasn't there when I left.<eos> It... appeared.<eos> Like magic.<eos> It's a sign.<eos> And you can take it however you want, but to me, it's showing you possibility... hope.
Do you really think I can let out a reincarnation trouble?<eos> Maybe we'll use that on Mara, get Audrey to pop out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's nothing in here about splitting personality or making new bodies.<eos> Maybe I did use the right curse, and it just... mutated.
This is you tricking me into filing murder charges so you can get an autopsy.<eos> How else was I gonna get it, David?<eos> Ask nicely?<eos> That bullet isn't gonna help him, Liv.<eos> It's gonna seal his fate.
Or will you condone their religion?<eos> Do not ask me to rule on that today.<eos> Protestant rebellions in England and Scotland, Catholic rulers losing their thrones.<eos> I am in no rush to import that struggle to France.<eos> Your Grace, it is already here.
All I want is distance.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> I'm not alone. I have David.<eos> Even after he reunited with Emily.<eos> You keep waiting for blowback, but it hasn't happened.
You could never live them out alone.<eos> And by the time you came along, there was like, a scene, right?<eos> You could go fucking see how many bands?<eos> It was just like, a reality.<eos> It didn't exist five years earlier than that.
But I'm sure he must have a way to remove it.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> This book.<eos> It's got all your stories in it.<eos> It started all this.
I lied before because I didn't want Narcisse's death on my hands.<eos> Now you surely see what he's capable of.<eos> The only way to save Mary's life and my marriage is to get rid of Narcisse.<eos> That envelope contains a cipher, which is all I need to frame him for treason.<eos> When it is found at his house by the Royal Guard, I will take his head.
Before you got here, he pointed out that most of these drawers were chosen because of convenience.<eos> These are the first drawers that one encounters upon entering this aisle and are at an easy height to reach.<eos> That drawer, however, is the very opposite of convenient.<eos> Only one map was removed.<eos> I submit that it alone was the thief's intended prize.
I'm talking about next of kin.<eos> Like if something should happen to you, who do I call?<eos> God, you are so annoying!<eos> Divorced, no kids.<eos> Marry the work, Robbins. It's always there for you.
(HONKING) CLARKSON: Whilst Hammond was annoying local delivery drivers,<eos> Good, so right on Nosadella, past that big statue...<eos> Yes, I know where I am now.<eos> I know more than satellite navigation.<eos> Well, everybody knows more than McLaren satellite navigation because it knows literally nothing at all.
This has a 3-litre turbo-charge 6, and I'm sorry, but turbo charging is for the weak.<eos> I know it's very good for emissions and polar bears and so on, but there has to be lag.<eos> There has to be a gap between when you put your foot down and the car moving forward.<eos> There has to be.<eos> You can't feel it but it must be there. It...
'However...'<eos> No, he's got...<eos> No, you've blown that before you've even started, James.<eos> This trailer is really badly behaved.<eos> Why won't it...?
You get a quarter from the hope commission every time you say that word.<eos> Admit it.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Well, it's easy for you to say... you're a hero.<eos> Whenever you need help, it just magically shows up, like Henry's book.
It wasn't there when I left.<eos> It... appeared.<eos> Like magic.<eos> It's a sign.<eos> And you can take it however you want, but to me, it's showing you possibility... hope.
What's it got to do with the election?<eos> New Yorkers, they've elected drunks, crooks,<eos> Italians, homos, Jews and blacks to that seat.<eos> But they will not elect is some guy whose wife is fucking some other guy behind his back.<eos> Now this pussy, this Jack Valliant, he may be too much of a lightweight to use this story if it comes across his desk.
Same goes for the Croatians and the Nazis back in World War II.<eos> Truth is, you can go back 1,000 years and still not know how a conflict really started.<eos> But we all know how it ends.<eos> You think you're the only one that lost something in that war?<eos> It destroyed me.
Well, I think we've seen all we needed to see. You set that box down, Mr Crowder.<eos> - Billy.<eos> - Mr Crowder!<eos> Billy!<eos> You may have started this game, but you do not get to say when it is over. You know what, son?
Be a man for once and fleam this wretched creature.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'm not exactly like you, okay?<eos> I don't want to conquer planets or kill things, or wear a lame cape.<eos> It's not lame, it's lamé.
"fighting a pestilence that has no cure", well... we must each find our own answer.<eos> So...<eos> Those who wish to leave, go now with my blessing.<eos> The rest will battle death by my side until... we defeat it.<eos> Or it defeats us.
Nothing.<eos> Just give me back the card.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'll give it to its rightful owner.<eos> But it's my mom's, yo.
Oh, Canon, erm... I wonder if it's not too much bother.<eos> I was showing a snapshot of my nephew, Raymond, to the Major last night, and I think it might have got muddled up with some of his own photographs.<eos> You couldn't ask if it's among his things, could you?<eos> You can't miss it<eos> - Raymond is holding up a very big fish. A marlin, I believe it's called.
Well, that's a legend.<eos> The church has been trying to bury this gospel since before the time of Constantine.<eos> And, to Friedman, that makes the Gospel According to Jimmy even more priceless.<eos> So we nick your fancy book, hand it on over, and make scads of loot.<eos> But the thing is, it's already been stolen.
Thor tells me you just signed a big fat contract.<eos> Wonder what they're gonna pay you in prison.<eos> Good-bye, Nike, good-bye, Gatorade, good-bye, "Dancing with the Stars."<eos> Okay, I'll buy your fucking machine.<eos> What's it do, anyway?
That sample comes from Pompeii and it cost $90,000, so please be careful.<eos> I'm sor... I'm sorry, you're collecting...<eos> Garbage.<eos> From A.D. 79.<eos> History books only give us the information that people want to remember, but garbage shows us the past as it actually was.
I'm just trying to make things better.<eos> I tell you I love you, I tell you you're beautiful... I tell you that your ass looks great when you're 80.<eos> - I'm trying to make you laugh. - Okay.<eos> All right, I put up with plenty of your shit. And if you think I'm just some dog who's gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.<eos> But if you want true love, then this is it.
Then he died.<eos> Pakhi, you are my that parrot.<eos> If anything happens to you...<eos> You know, finally Manikpur has electricity.<eos> I see. And how long is it going to stay?
I don't give a shit what he ran on.<eos> He can't steamroll the House.<eos> And don't forget, you work for me, Frank, not him.<eos> If he wants something on the floor, he's gonna have to talk to me directly.<eos> I know you take a lot of pride in your manhood, Bob, and it's impressive, but as big as it is, Linda can still shut the door on it.
Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> I know what you're thinking - if I was so afraid about going back, why didn't I find it before?<eos> I did mean to find it.<eos> It does exist, you know.
Crucify him!<eos> Get away from me, Satan.<eos> I worship the Lord my God... and serve him only.<eos> Jesus resists Satan's temptations... and prepares to begin his mission.<eos> But it will be without John the Baptist.
- The Lord brought us out from Egypt.<eos> - Right!<eos> He promised us this land.<eos> That's right!<eos> And soon, it will be ours.
You scared me.<eos> I told you it wasn't a diary.<eos> I've heard of this book.<eos> It's a dirty book.<eos> No, it's just honest.
Tell me what you know!<eos> - I'm not gonna play your game!<eos> - My game?<eos> You started this game.<eos> I say when it's done.
Hello, this, uh-- this is Luther's, right?<eos> I'd like to make a lunch reservation for two.<eos> My father, and soon-to-be new best friend.<eos> Sorry, man, I'm not a fan of nature, all right?<eos> It's slow, it's overrated.
Take off your clothes and put on mine.<eos> Never take this hat off, friend.<eos> That way Bucephalus will never know I've gone.<eos> For sure he'll love you as much as me.<eos> I'm giving up my soul, it wants to return home.
But this party is not for tonight's victory!<eos> That's in the past.<eos> This party is for our future.<eos> The point is... do you want to see the future?<eos> Here it is.
She doesn't care about you.<eos> She's a phony.<eos> - She didn't care about you... - Get out! - ...until she fucking needed you!<eos> - That's my cell phone.<eos> Where is it?
He'll be here soon.<eos> Maybe his flight is delayed.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Hi Aditya.<eos> Did you forget about my proposal or, you didn't think it was important? Let's go inside and talk. People are eagerly waiting for you.
I thought psychic driving would have been more effective in breaking down his personality.<eos> Psychic driving fails because its methods are too obvious.<eos> You were trying too hard, Frederick.<eos> If force is used, the subject will only surrender temporarily.<eos> Once a patient is exposed to the method of manipulation, it becomes much less effective.
Just because you killed my dad doesn't mean you get to be him.<eos> Abigail, you've been through a traumatic event, and no one more traumatized than you, Abigail, but we went through it together.<eos> What you write, you write about all of us.<eos> I don't need your permission.<eos> And you don't need our approval, but I hope it would mean something.
Sex addiction is very different from, say, abuse of drugs or alcohol because you don't actually need either of those things.<eos> These addictions can be completely removed by removing the drug or the alcohol, not that that's easy.<eos> But the difference with sex addiction is that everyone has a sexuality that's an integral part of their personality.<eos> If one could imagine exterminating sexuality, then you'd be left with a severely reduced person because... because sexuality also includes tenderness, contact, solidarity with others, which would be hard to imagine anyone living without on some level.<eos> What you're saying is that no one can remove their sexuality, even though it's destroying everything for them.
Do you think if two men were to walk down a train looking for women, do you think anybody would have raised an eyebrow, or if a man had led the life you had?<eos> And the story about Mrs. H. would've been extremely banal if you'd been a man.<eos> And your conquest would have been a woman.<eos> When a man leaves his children because of desire, we accept it with a shrug, but you as a woman, you had to take on a guilt, a burden of guilt that could never be alleviated.<eos> Your abortion was legal, but more than anything else, it was a punishment you inflicted upon yourself.
Wait, didn't we just go through this at Christmas?<eos> Yeah, and is it true you and Sam got married?<eos> Did that happen? Shut up, Tina.<eos> I'm naming this comet.<eos> Tubbington-Bopp, and it is headed straight for Lima.
Pull out your phones! Everybody pull out your phones right now!<eos> Ryder, relax, man.<eos> Dude. I know this is upsetting, but...<eos> Well, now nobody is going to admit it for fear of being murdered.<eos> I've told this person everything, and I want to know who it is.
- The world once more.<eos> Please.<eos> We do not do anything wrong.<eos> My sister takes care of me.<eos> It brings me books.
Why would I kill your husband?<eos> Because he stole from you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I want my property back.<eos> I don't know where it is.
(Huffs) Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because you don't like to talk about God, because you can't explain it, and you hate when that happens.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... see God in science.<eos> Because it explains everything?
- Could have had him.<eos> - You quit.<eos> No. Yeah.<eos> The situation with Tammi -- it's screwing with your head.<eos> It's affecting your ability to do the job.
Tonight.<eos> Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you, and your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.<eos> I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.<eos> I dropped my hospital keycard somewhere.<eos> Do you guys know where it is?
Spencer...<eos> I know that you don't want a friend right now, but that doesn't mean that your friends don't need you.<eos> I still don't understand why you care about this costume.<eos> Some girl wore it on the train.<eos> We kinda tangled, and I wanna know who it was.
My father is Lutheran.<eos> Irish and Norwegian.<eos> No, he passed away.<eos> He was cremated.<eos> Look, Pastor, I'm not saying that you didn't give Mr. Chaough the message, I'm just saying that it bears some urgency.
Hello?<eos> Norma?<eos> Hello?<eos> So I want you to just think about poetry tonight.<eos> I mean, what does it mean?
Things aren't in the right place.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> Okay, listen...<eos> I know that you really wanted this surgery.<eos> But it's not safe for you.
- Know what's in your heart.<eos> - This is our exit, Rat.<eos> Don't be swayed by fear or history or the opinions of outsiders.<eos> Find your own truth.<eos> It will lead you to the things you love.
And just quietly, I got a real buzz out of passing my HSC.<eos> I'm sure you'll all keep that to yourselves.<eos> Outside, my life was a mess.<eos> And I hurt a lot of people.<eos> But then, Franky taught me this trick and it works, most of the time. And it stopped me from going bunta.
I get it.<eos> I get how important the flower shop is to you.<eos> No, it's not about the flower shop.<eos> That's what I meant.<eos> It's about what it represents.
Yeah.<eos> How about a movie night?<eos> Yeah. You read my mind. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Unfortunately there was a surgical complication with the donor liver, and it is no longer viable.
Remove bad.<eos> Leave good.<eos> And compulsive writing... do we categorize that as the good or the bad?<eos> It likely go with lesion.<eos> The good news is it's not near the eloquent area.
No, I mean, like, before everything. Like, Ed Jr.<eos> It'll never be like it was before Ed Jr.<eos> Yeah. I guess people really don't like dead kids, huh?<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> They fucking love 'em.
Frank: I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> I just got another call you're gonna fucking love. - Yeah, go ahead.<eos> - Bank Medici's pulling out 450 million, Bern.<eos> Stanley Chais has been draining us all goddamn year, and this is on top of Fairfield's withdrawals.<eos> I delivered for these fucking people for fucking decades and now they're all running for the fucking hills. Bern, we can't keep getting hit with these redemptions.
I overextended myself.<eos> Put them down.<eos> If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.<eos> Your superiors?<eos> Who the hell are they?
Sorry, I'm living with my aunt.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Uh, yeah, she's nice.<eos> I don't really know her that well.<eos> And my cousins, they're...
Such is true for all of us.<eos> What would you have us do?<eos> Our escorts are dead.<eos> Our brothers are slaughter.<eos> - We don't even know where they are.
- A legitimate request, Miss Turner.<eos> - I'm Richard Kontral.<eos> - And Richard Kontral is?<eos> Just a well-paid messenger boy for some very liquid guys.<eos> - And they are?
I got this!<eos> Grab on!<eos> Some days, I rescued my parents.<eos> That way!<eos> Other days, they rescued me.
Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.<eos> Are you with them?<eos> You have a weird house, Mr. Daizy.<eos> Really, it's awful.<eos> Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way, but they did sign a lease.
Heroin?<eos> Okay, you need to go to the police.<eos> No.<eos> That would just make it worse.<eos> Rand would be held responsible, and they'll just find another way to get their drugs in.
- Fine.<eos> Then she can help us blow up the whole compound with Bakuto and his minions inside.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Hey, students from my dojo are in there.<eos> They're not bad. They just...
It sounds like fun.<eos> I am going too.<eos> Remember...<eos> Wait up! We must be meaner than them.<eos> Where are they going?
Are you okay?<eos> What exactly did you tell them?<eos> - What happened?<eos> The kids are being recruited by some guy known on the streets as White Hat.<eos> I don't know what he's up to, but they're doing some kind of clean-up work.
To never face death.<eos> To regenerate themselves again and again.<eos> The elders saw this as an aberration.<eos> And so, like Lucifer from heaven, the five were banished from K'un-Lun forever.<eos> They became the five fingers of the Hand.
This belonged to the greatest warrior in our history... our beloved Anti­ope.<eos> Make sure you're worthy of it.<eos> I will.<eos> Be careful in the world of men, Diana.<eos> They do not deserve you.
How about I guess what's wrong and you stop me if I say something that's untrue?<eos> Okay.<eos> You love your parents and your tio and your boyfriend.<eos> I do.<eos> But you may be... not exactly the same anymore as how they see you, how they want you to be.
- Just saying it's too dangerous.<eos> - We'll do both.<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> Five vehicles just reached the base.<eos> They just don't give up, do they..
- Put my stuff in this room.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.<eos> Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.<eos> Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.
Were you running drugs for them?<eos> God, no!<eos> I was just hired to make sure that no one was skimming off the top.<eos> And when you found out the Kincaids were, you asked for a cut.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't know that they were gonna get killed!
I didn't know till I heard later.<eos> They stood up by me even then.<eos> If it wasn't for the individuals I've met in my past,<eos> I still had that memory, like, all these Navy SEALs that I met or military guys that I met that did martial arts.<eos> They groomed me. I just brought that back.
They've got her in a body bag.<eos> I remember thinking, "There's no handles on that bag.<eos> How are they gonna pick her up?<eos> How are they gonna carry her?"<eos> And they just grabbed the bag... and threw her in the ambulance.
- Sure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I've been approached by some people from Dubai.<eos> I mean, I'm talking about oil money.<eos> And they want to take King Beast, and they want to turn it into a major promotion.
Garo, there's no one onstage.<eos> Okay, give me a...<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> These guys are real, okay?<eos> And they love the sport, and they have money, and they have a plan, and I want Ryan to be a part of it.
We don't apologize, and we have no god.<eos> But this cracked driveshaft brings me great pain.<eos> There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.<eos> What about the weird guys on leashes, then?<eos> They're more like... interns.
Sorry.<eos> I'm... not good at goodbyes, and... I'm drunk, so, you know, I just...<eos> It looks like I'm never going to see you again.<eos> I can't really roll with the hero types.<eos> And I don't... they... They don't want me around.
Demonstrate your fearsomeness to them.<eos> Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you don't need to.<eos> Because they know it already and because at a certain point, there is only so much fear a man can endure.
The trolls can't get enough.<eos> Oh, all good.<eos> It never ceases to amaze me what people respond to.<eos> I mean, they hate this kid out there in the real world.<eos> Andrew Keane gave his life for his country, and they hate him.
Some demonstrators got out of hand, but she's okay.<eos> We got reinforcements on the way.<eos> What do you mean "reinforcements"?<eos> What kind of reinforcement?<eos> Who are they?
You are aware of this, I'm sure.<eos> I am. We are?<eos> By whom?<eos> Men belonging to Kjartan.<eos> They are the shepherds, we are the sheep.
They will call you on this with a formal invitation and instructions.<eos> All you have to do is answer it.<eos> And this is a digital record of the people who have gone through.<eos> 119 testimonials.<eos> They are not hapless suckers, not victims.
So, we're gonna fire our nukes at the Russians and they're gonna retaliate, and then that's it. We're all torched.<eos> No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed that nothing fucking happened.<eos> We give the people what they're too chickenshit to do themselves, what they elected us for.<eos> We give them what they want.<eos> And they want to die.
In agreeing to adopt you, I became your father.<eos> And as your father, I am not someone to be trifled with.<eos> You can't go easy on children. They need to be taught to obey their elders.<eos> You asked them to make dinner.<eos> And all they did was slap together some disgusting sauce.
But we're at war... and you're an asset.<eos> Despite what's gone on, you are my friend.<eos> And the men out there have had their pound of flesh.<eos> And our men...<eos> Billy, I could walk out there and tell them the sky is red... and they'd believe me.
Just yours.<eos> - I see. - Do you?<eos> I wonder.<eos> This past three years, you've made some very powerful enemies.<eos> They won't forgive and they won't forget.
Amit.<eos> - What?<eos> How can these blind people..<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, without seeing, how can they..
- What?<eos> How can these blind people..<eos> - What?<eos> I mean, without seeing, how can they..<eos> They touch and feel!
Why did you scream?<eos> - These boys are bothering us.<eos> But there is no one here except you two.<eos> But they were right here.<eos> Rohan, where are they?
Is it possible you're overthinking it?<eos> A young man wants to invest in your cafe.<eos> I think you should consider it.<eos> But is it weird that he didn't tell me?<eos> If there's one thing I know about men, it's they all think they have a good reason to lie.
You know the media's biased against us!<eos> Do you remember Hurricane Katrina?<eos> The press said that black families were "looting" food, but white families were "finding" it.<eos> Don't lecture me.<eos> Mike Brown gets killed by the police, and they print the scariest picture of him they can find.
He's always been a big faof yours.<eos> Well, that's good to hear.<eos> You did good, son.<eos> Now, the only way this is gonna work is you got to sell the virgin potential of the land.<eos> All right? They could be the first to discover oil here and get ahead of the wave that's about to come.
Cut myself, killed the lot.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> It didn't bother you?<eos> Killing?<eos> They were gonna kill me.
- You can at least try.<eos> These people will hurt us, all of us.<eos> That's what they did to me.<eos> I was pregnant, eight months, and they murdered my baby.<eos> I was just like you... just trying to do the right thing, stood up to them and they destroyed my life.
I'm a mess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When my parents died, I was young.<eos> I was alone, and I ran from this house.<eos> Trying to be what they would have wanted.
Ain't gonna find them anywhere on the street.<eos> Yeah, but I don't have anybody coming in here asking to buy 'em.<eos> Because they don't think you have one, asshole.<eos> Mikey, I got guys coming in here wanting protection from sheet holders, or car jackers, or an ex.<eos> What in the fuck are they gonna do with a stun grenade?
And I don't want to be a yoga instructor.<eos> Okay, guys, like I said, why don't I talk to - our time aberration? - Yeah, but...<eos> - Shh.<eos> - Stay in school.<eos> I'm sorry about my friends, they're just...
No.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Your partners just left me here all tied up.<eos> Where are they?
- Well, we do 'shrooms.<eos> - Mother!<eos> - What?<eos> They're not drugs.<eos> - Yes, they are.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Okay, well, I only have two signed permission slips.<eos> So do the rest of you have yours?<eos> Well... I... I didn't really ask my parents.<eos> They don't know about me, they'd totally freak out.
Everything ok?<eos> Yes. Peachy.<eos> Heh. Let's do this.<eos> - Yeah. It's lit, right?<eos> All these people, they're just...
He was still conscious enough to feel his lungs filling with water for 145 seconds.<eos> And here you were bragging about a plan more intricate than torture.<eos> Did you ever think about why I chose the name Prometheus?<eos> He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.<eos> You see, because, like you, they play judge, jury, and executioner.
We're your men now.<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> Black Sunday will be a new beginning for us.<eos> Our brothers must be released.<eos> While you play with toys, they burn in hell.
But when they reached the new lands, the promised food was nowhere to be found.<eos> Atsula communed with Nunyunnini for the barriers were thinner then between people and their gods.<eos> And Nunyunnini spoke.<eos> And he showed her what to do, as he had once shown her grandmother, and her grandmother's grandmother.<eos> Nunyunnini loved His people, as they loved Him.
What am I?<eos> I don't care, I...<eos> That's how every friendship ends.<eos> So... so what good are friends anyway?<eos> Who are they?
Who are these people?<eos> They're your parents.<eos> You don't remember anything about what happened?<eos> Why, did something bad happen?<eos> They died.
Who are these people?<eos> They're your parents.<eos> You don't remember anything about what happened?<eos> Why, did something bad happen?<eos> They died.
Come with me if you wanna live.<eos> I get it. You're freaked.<eos> But take a breath. Chill.<eos> Y-you made those people explode.<eos> Again, not people. And they were attacking you.
Um, no.<eos> That's not why we come out here.<eos> We come out here to commune with nature, not watch people get eaten by it.<eos> Okay, first of all he -- he doesn't eat them.<eos> He chases them up a tree, and they cry.
We come out here to commune with nature, not watch people get eaten by it.<eos> Okay, first of all he -- he doesn't eat them.<eos> He chases them up a tree, and they cry.<eos> A lot.<eos> What do they want?
Who you gonna call?<eos> Douchebusters.<eos> Bravo.<eos> We're working with these people now.<eos> The better they are, the better we are.
But I got a cursed coin from ancient Babylon instead. Yeah, sure.<eos> That could happen to anyone.<eos> The men of letters decided I showed promised and signed me up.<eos> They gave me a life.<eos> They, um...
More excuses?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think I will.<eos> Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.<eos> You give them an order, and they obey.
Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.<eos> You give them an order, and they obey.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> So tell me, do they?<eos> Do they obey you?
Why not?<eos> I've been cleaning up after them for months.<eos> I took care of those federal agents they stupidly allowed to live.<eos> I killed a psychic girl they thought was... Human.<eos> Honestly, they're damn sloppy.
Crowley, what will I do without you?<eos> Oh, and what do you know about Eileen Leahy?<eos> Who?<eos> Did you... did...<eos> Did your people, did they kill her? Probably.
The British men of letters, they came here because they thought they could do our job better than we could. And they hooked us with their flashy gear and their tech.<eos> Most of you had the good sense to turn 'em down.<eos> I didn't.<eos> They said they wanted the same thing we wanted, you know? A world free of monsters.<eos> That's not what they really wanted.
Most of you had the good sense to turn 'em down.<eos> I didn't.<eos> They said they wanted the same thing we wanted, you know? A world free of monsters.<eos> That's not what they really wanted.<eos> They want control.
I looked up.<eos> And I was a dead man.<eos> Lost with all the other dead men.<eos> But now, I'm alive.<eos> And they have you all to themselves.
- These are Count Olaf's accomplices.<eos> - And they're all wearing costumes.<eos> No, children, these are adults.<eos> Adults don't wear costumes unless it's for a charity ball, or they happen to be employed as actors.<eos> They are employed as actors.
I figured out how they're communicating... the code.<eos> But I can't find any mention of Whitehall.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> She's gonna meet my adoptive parents.<eos> They'll tell her I survived, show her pictures.
My boss, Mr. Mankiewicz, will be down here for the actual trial.<eos> But you are, in fact, northeastern?<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm from New York.<eos> And your parents?<eos> They're also... Northeasterns?
Sit down man-to-man and discuss what I can do for Fred Andrews.<eos> Is it satisfactory?<eos> It's more than satisfactory.<eos> My parents are unbelievable, Jug.<eos> Polly is locked up in that house like a character out of Jane Eyre, and what are they doing?
Hey,<eos> I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I just-- I just wanted to say, it was tough for Matthew when he started spending more time here, and you guys made it a lot easier, so...<eos> Maybe your parents should move in.<eos> We can be one big, happy family.<eos> Maybe they can move in, and I can move out.
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.<eos> This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.<eos> And if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.<eos> Or yours.<eos> They just like severed heads, really.
I want you to know that, every mutineer found justice.<eos> Can't think of a worse way for him to go.<eos> The Night's Watch was his life.<eos> He would have died to protect every one of those men.<eos> And they butchered him.
Not sure you were right.<eos> Hang on one sec.<eos> People keep asking how I'm doing, you know, all the time.<eos> You okay?<eos> It's nice, but I know what they're really saying.
Older than him, though.<eos> What about their drones?<eos> Well, the top of the Wall's a dead spot.<eos> They launch from up there, but their sensors aren't activated immediately.<eos> You might see them, but they won't see you.
But they're entertaining.<eos> And it's great they're back together.<eos> Vik, my father walked out on my mother with a student and completely ruined her life, and now she's just taking him back and pretending that none of it ever happened.<eos> It's not great. It's pathetic.<eos> And, my God, all that bullshit about second chances... and how they know each other?
Londoners love the House of York.<eos> They would call for Lizzie and for Teddy, too.<eos> He cannot risk it.<eos> Our cousins are there, and Aunt Eliza.<eos> Well, they have turned their coats to Tudor and he will want to make a show of it.
Even doors have been ripped off.<eos> Your servants gone.<eos> Your orchard's plundered. There's...<eos> There's nothing. And...<eos> The soldiers who were there, who came there to collect you, they were...
Catchy PR campaign they got going.<eos> Any luck making contact with 'em?<eos> They're a closed loop.<eos> As far as I can tell, they want to talk, they come to you.<eos> Any idea who they might be?
- Remember me, motherfucker?<eos> - You've been up to a lot of bad shit, son.<eos> Why do I stay?<eos> You know what I stay, 'cause I like bad guys.<eos> Because they don't wanna be bad guys.
Think practically here.<eos> Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.<eos> Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.<eos> It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.<eos> - But they do.
He intends to turn Catholics against you.<eos> What import could a place like that have for Knox?<eos> They are hosting a harvest festival.<eos> People travel for miles to attend.<eos> His hope is that they will take his poisoned seeds of discontent and scatter them as they return to their homes.
Uh, you wanna use the conference room for a bit?<eos> Maybe call DCFS.<eos> No!<eos> Don't call those people!<eos> I know who they are.
Go back to sleep.<eos> Those men back there... How'd you get them to stop? I told 'em to.<eos> You told them to?<eos> It's the collar. Gives me aan authority.<eos> Who are they? What do they want?
And there are plenty of other cases you could've used to do that.<eos> Instead, you went and you signed a class action, which is something we do not do.<eos> Well, why isn't it something we do?<eos> These men have life-threatening health problems<eos> They need someone to give a shit about them.
These men have life-threatening health problems<eos> They need someone to give a shit about them.<eos> It isn't something we do because we don't have the time or the man power to take on a giant like Velocity.<eos> Nathan, I don't know what you want me to say.<eos> I went out there, I signed these guys and they trusted me.
- You know who killed her?<eos> - We have two suspects.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> You should be out talking to them.<eos> Eddie, they're just doing their job.
Publicly.<eos> Father, the prints came back from the bottle of vodka found near the body.<eos> Miles Vincent.<eos> Jaylen Hines.<eos> They the ones inside?
Mine came in silver phials.<eos> For which I paid a premium, no doubt.<eos> Tell me again how you came by it.<eos> As I told you before.<eos> I would speak to my friends, they would speak to theirs.
Consider your health, madame.<eos> I understand it must seem like simple common sense, but this is far too tight.<eos> For example, you may be constricting blood flow to your child...<eos> You know, there is a reason our finest medical minds treat only the noble families.<eos> They understand what is expected of a person, what is required, and what is to be done to achieve it.
But they don't know that.<eos> You know you're being lied to, right?<eos> I can only speculate as to who hired you...<eos> Probably some burly guys in dog masks...<eos> But they're working for senator Nadeer, and what she really wants is inside this case.
Don't blame yourself.<eos> The Framework messes with everybody's head.<eos> No, no, but I... I... I killed people.<eos> No.<eos> They weren't real.
There's an international intelligence inquiry tomorrow morning,<eos> - and I need you there to defend S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> Damn it, Coulson, so is a vanishing banshee.<eos> Listen Phil, I'm not gonna get up on my hind legs and beg for buttermilk, but you or one of your right hands needs to be there to take down these spooks before they take down S.H.I.E.L.D. once and for all.
Is the pain on her right side?<eos> It could be appendicitis.<eos> Your friend's daughter... bring her tonight.<eos> I'll examine her. These people aren't authorized to be in the perimeter.<eos> They're on the log.
I'm sorry.<eos> These people are scared of us, Julian.<eos> - Well, my position...<eos> - I know.<eos> And honestly, I don't care what they think.
I discovered that later.<eos> This machine... is your legacy.<eos> But with all due respect, you were wrong.<eos> Your mistake was your reliance on others to make this machine work.<eos> But they can't do what you can do.
Are we close?<eos> We're closer than we were ten seconds ago.<eos> There's only two roads that will take you off of this property.<eos> And you're sure we're on the right one?<eos> They seem to think so.
He liked you.<eos> You've always been a popular guy.<eos> And now, your friends are gonna pay for it.<eos> Wynonna? Doc?<eos> You know, they're... they're not going anywhere.
Kidnappings?<eos> Serial killers have patterns, kidnappers have motive.<eos> But what's odd is that there's nothing to connect these disappearances.<eos> There's Izzy Williams, a father of four, a college student, the list goes on.<eos> And they've all disappeared.
Whatever the Legion's done to turn you into their puppet, you...<eos> Captain Rip Hunter was the puppet!<eos> First of the Time Masters, and then to some misguided duty to protect history.<eos> Can't you see, Jax?<eos> My new allies, they freed me.
There was a psychic attack.<eos> I was shielding my mind, but I got trapped inside myself.<eos> Shielding from what?<eos> My people.<eos> They know where I am.
I was shielding my mind, but I got trapped inside myself.<eos> Shielding from what?<eos> My people.<eos> They know where I am.<eos> They're coming.
I... She was the first girl that I knew that I liked in a way that was different.<eos> And I thought that she liked me, too.<eos> And so on Valentine's Day, I put a card in her locker declaring my feelings, and asking her to the dance.<eos> She gave that card to her parents.<eos> And then they called my parents.
This is Mon-El of Daxam.<eos> To the invaders, I will relinquish myself.<eos> Mon-El, what are you doing?<eos> I'm going up there.<eos> No, no. They literally just tried to kill me.
- You're welcome.<eos> I mean, you... You don't know my parents.<eos> They won't stop.<eos> They want you dead and they want me to come home.<eos> And they're...
I mean, you... You don't know my parents.<eos> They won't stop.<eos> They want you dead and they want me to come home.<eos> And they're...<eos> They get what they want.
I feel dizzy.<eos> And my head hurts.<eos> Oh, Marcel, the spell is already in motion.<eos> It's draining the life out of these kids.<eos> They're freezing.
We see where the germans are strong, where they're weak.<eos> Allied and resistance networks, A free flow of information. So we know where to land our blows.<eos> You understand my fellow comrades won't be. Easily convinced.<eos> Then convince them, alex.<eos> You didn't run when they did at the battle of france.
You can't give up so easy just 'cause you don't see results.<eos> Hey, I've seen plenty of results, just not the ones I wanted.<eos> That's not God's fault.<eos> That's people.<eos> They never fail to disappoint.
I know you're with my daughter right now.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With what?<eos> We arrested Bianchi.<eos> He got word to his men, and they're stalking Cristina.
I think you proved your point.<eos> You do have to be pretty vulnerable... and yes, desperate... to take part in a medical trial for just 100 bucks.<eos> Especially a trial where someone plants a bomb inside your stomach.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Do we know where these people are... who they are, even?
What troopers?<eos> Come here.<eos> No. No, John, you have to stay in bed.<eos> John, you need to rest.<eos> Where are they?
Oh, Lord, that is not right, is it?<eos> As I got going for the second time, I realised I'd been a bit of a chump.<eos> The mistake I've made, of course, is that I've introduced you to this car before I've really tested it.<eos> That's not what car-makers do.<eos> They test a car and then show it to the press and the public.
Working for people who will never stop fearing you?<eos> My people trust me.<eos> They shouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> You traded down, and that truth will become an itch, and it will grow into a burn until you come begging us to make you Hullen again, and they know it.
- Their leader? - He's your friend?<eos> - I'm fond of him.<eos> Why didn't you tell us any of this sooner?<eos> I wanted to, but they entrusted me with their secret, and I didn't see any harm in keeping it.<eos> So they're the ones who gave you the upgrade?
Hit the back of my head and knocked me right out.<eos> You have looked better.<eos> What's the story?<eos> Oh, I ran into some old friends.<eos> It was more like they ran into me, actually.
Are you sure you wanna do that?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Someone has to be responsible for setting off that blast.<eos> I know those guards may be denying<eos> - any involvement now, but... - I don't think they did it.
You're right.<eos> The "Raza" can make a difference, you know, be... become a symbol of hope for these people and others like them.<eos> I'll let 'em know that they have a powerful ally backing them.<eos> But you don't need me for that.<eos> They need me more, if they'll have me, that is.
Shit!<eos> Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way!<eos> God damn.<eos> Looks like we forgot that those moons provide cover both ways.<eos> If they can't see us, then we can't see them either.
What is she saying now?<eos> She says that the only reason Alex survived the mist is because she's a part of it, that they're connected.<eos> Jesus.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> We have one day of food left, and they're ready to believe anything.
No.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My, uh...<eos> My people back in New York, they're, uh... depending on me, you know, and, uh...
Well, there has to be more drugs.<eos> Sure, under a rock somewhere in this lot.<eos> Even if you do manage an arrest, good luck getting any of these guys to talk.<eos> Those guys aren't afraid of jail.<eos> They're planning on it.
Yeah.<eos> We checked it out.<eos> I mean, he was in Texas, he hit some hospital, took, like, 400 grand worth of meds.<eos> People were dying.<eos> They were just gonna throw
There has to be some other way.<eos> Do you want to get into the Badlands or not, all right?<eos> Then, our best way in is through.<eos> Well, I mean, it's technically under, but you know what I'm saying.<eos> Look at these mongrels. See what they're carrying?
Oh, uh...<eos> You can tell her I'm okay.<eos> I just need to get some rest.<eos> You're not like the other men.<eos> They get angry if she's late.
Look, she were a good girl.<eos> But she could be a madam and she could play people.<eos> Made eyes at a lot of blokes.<eos> So, what are the intimations you're making?<eos> Everyone knows she hated her mam and dad and that they didn't much like her.
Revolution can only begin on the page.<eos> The final act must be played on the streets... to the resounding beat of righteous hearts.<eos> I know these men.<eos> Speak.<eos> They will hear you.
And what do you plan to do with your newfound freedom, search for Azra?<eos> What do you expect to find there?<eos> Peace.<eos> Think of Tilda, think of all the lives we could save.<eos> Don't they deserve peace, too?
- That's what you're doing? - Yes!<eos> Then you need to be smarter. You need to think bigger.<eos> Anybody can plant a bomb under a bus, but those big Partnership buildings?<eos> I saw them pumping tankerfuls of blood into the pipes.<eos> If you could find a way to put something poisonous into that blood, you could take out thousands of strigoi and they wouldn't know what hit them.
As well as rounding up every nuclear weapon.<eos> You two are blowing up buses and you don't know they use them to transport human prisoners?<eos> If we waited for the perfect, polite moment to revolt, it would never happen.<eos> Those big Partnership buildings, I saw them pumping tankerfuls of blood into the pipes.<eos> If you could put something poisonous into that blood, you could take out thousands of strigoi and they wouldn't know what hit them. Ok.
I will upgrade the 13th to the best technology money can buy.<eos> I'm here to make it possible with this.<eos> It allows citizens to call in GPS located crime reports.<eos> You know those people you're trying to serve and protect?<eos> They just became your partners.
Amy: Nobody wants you here.<eos> What?<eos> I said you're unwanted.<eos> I have friends.<eos> They only pretend to like you.
- Right.<eos> - What are they looking for?<eos> I think it is what we were looking for, and we've had it backwards.<eos> The terrorists are not the AIC.<eos> They are hunting the AIC.
Now you see what I've been dealing with here. They're savages.<eos> Stop making excuses.<eos> What are their numbers?<eos> It wasn't numbers that made the difference.<eos> They set the terms for the rendezvous.
- What are you doing, kid?<eos> - Stop.<eos> You think you're safe here?<eos> With these clowns?<eos> They're helping me.
Will you just please listen?<eos> Sabrina, this is serious.<eos> Don't touch my stuff, psycho.<eos> I just thought you might like to know that your parents are gone and they're not coming back.<eos> They're dead?
And-and do what?<eos> The Horsemen are unstoppable.<eos> Dreyfuss is the key.<eos> He summoned the Horsemen, bound them to himself.<eos> If he dies, do they?
Perhaps our friends on the Germans' side are having more luck.<eos> You wish for me to order our artillery to stop shelling the enemy?<eos> Just long enough for us to rescue the wounded from the battlefield.<eos> And so the British can rescue theirs.<eos> I will order our batteries to stop firing when they stop firing on us.
Ginny's like a daughter to me, in more ways than one.<eos> I mean, I feel like a father to most of these kids.<eos> Right, Carter?<eos> That's right, Dad.<eos> Course, you know, soon they'll all be billionaires and they'll be moving off to start their own little tech families.
Where have they been keeping you?<eos> In a room by myself.<eos> I had hoped you'd escaped or... were released.<eos> Harry.<eos> What are they doing?
Jared, there's no pink glasses!<eos> Richard, I know you think I'm a bullshit artist.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I totally am.<eos> I have this gift where I can make people do whatever I want 'em to do, and they don't even realize they're doing it. Right.
You know what?<eos> You do your thing. I'll do my thing.<eos> But your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.<eos> Sea slugs, Reagan.<eos> They're sea slug guys.
- Our guys.<eos> Oh, you get off of me.<eos> Our guys!<eos> Jess, I asked for models, not a couple of driver's ed instructors!<eos> I know, Cece, but they're hot on the inside.
- I'm all over it.<eos> We got him now.<eos> There's only one way out this building.<eos> Come on!<eos> Where'd they go?
And what I see is frightened people running before us.<eos> I see their spineless god running away from our gods.<eos> For once, why don't you just listen to an older, wiser brother?<eos> These people who are running away, they're not warriors.<eos> They are not the ones who will stay and fight to defend this kingdom.
You came here, and you focused your rage on this. Very specific, hopefully nonlethal. Means of solving your problem.<eos> I'm not here to kill anyone.<eos> I hope you mean that.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> They're scared.
To be seen.<eos> The DA didn't see your husband in court.<eos> That's clear.<eos> Just like these people.<eos> These frightened, confused people, they don't really see you right now.
Okay.<eos> All right, you got to keep packing, okay?<eos> Put your boots in the suitcase.<eos> I know it hurts.<eos> But they love him.
Not so loud.<eos> I got mine three months ago and I feel extremely mature.<eos> - You seem mature. - You do.<eos> I think the boys take me more seriously, too.<eos> But they can't tell.
You've been in there for hours.<eos> I've been trying to talk to you.<eos> I'm busy thinking.<eos> Excellent - who needs eyesight?<eos> Those Monk creatures I told you about - if they've modelled every event in human history, if they've simulated entire events streamed from day one till now, think what they'd know.
Right now I feel like I'm doing something that's important and real to me.<eos> Besides, I don't need your money.<eos> Miss Carlotta and the girls are throwing me a block party fund-raiser.<eos> You really believe these people are gonna pay for him to get out?<eos> I mean, for God's sake, Alexandra, they can't even afford to pay attention.
Our world is rust, our air is engine fumes.<eos> So we must evolve to survive, but evolution is not fast enough.<eos> The special patients, they are strong.<eos> Soon we will all be upgraded like them.<eos> They're in pain.
Okay, y-you guys are really gonna make me be the one to say it?<eos> The oppo research.<eos> What happened to being a knight?<eos> The painkillers have worn off.<eos> And they've upped the game.
Yeah, he ran into some protesters from the Equine Resource League in a parking lot at the Port of Baltimore.<eos> They pelted him and his car with manure.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's, rattled.<eos> What are they protesting anyway?
Hang in there, Omar.<eos> We'll follow up on this.<eos> If the feds are monitoring Omar's communications, they'll know we're closing in on a suspect.<eos> Which can't make them happy.<eos> We need to find this college kid before they do.
...it was time for the event organised by Clarkson and May to begin.<eos> What they've done is told me to report here, Rockingham Raceway, where they've arranged for me to take on two drifters in some competitive drifting.<eos> The course was a series of classic transitional bends... strategically peppered with the dreaded clipping points.<eos> Baggsy was on hand to explain how the scoring worked.<eos> The main thing about drifting is that it's a judged sport, and the judges have placed the clipping points where they want to see the car.
That's it?<eos> Do you have any idea how powerful you are?<eos> You know what that power is?<eos> It's the one thing you have that every man wants.<eos> You just have to let them think they have the power, but they never do, never, unless you give it to them.
I thought he said he was from Atlanta.<eos> - So those are the guys from Atlantis? - Mm-hmm.<eos> And you're from the same place as them?<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> 'Cause they're so dour, and I'm so cheerful.

It's laughable where we are right now.<eos> We should be at least a hundred years ahead of where we are right now.<eos> And there are still files on this issue classified. Top secret, from a hundred years ago for the same reasons, because the macro economic order of fossil fuels, petrodollar, of handful of the industrial elites and corporations would be completely transformed.<eos> But the folks who actually call the shots in the multi-trillion dollar global economy, they don't want to see that happen.<eos> They know that if that power was, you know, delineated to the average person, we wouldn't need them anymore.
But what it shows is that governments around the world can actually do a lot if they wanted to to break the mold of secrecy and do something helpful. And this is the proof that that's happened with a major country.<eos> This is arguably the most important UFO document in history.<eos> The irony of it is I couldn't disclose it for quite a while until that president Sarkozy was out of office, and these folks were not in harm's way.<eos> There was an invitation extended from the Vatican to some 40 world scientists to come to Castel Gandolfo outside of Rome where the pontifical observatory is.<eos> And they spent a week briefing the highest level members of the Vatican.

Who do you want to see on the jury?<eos> Well, initially I was thinking sports players, but now... People who resent authority.<eos> Our mock trials showed only one group.<eos> People with horrible bosses.<eos> They think vin shafted him, And they want to see him pay for the daily indignities. They suffer under their own horrible bosses.
Mr. Creuster, is it fair to say. You share in the risk of each player's career?<eos> No, because I take all the risk.<eos> These are untested 18-year-olds. Playing video games in their parents' basement.<eos> I provide room and board, security, Equipment and the best training money can buy.<eos> They should be paying me.
Yawn.<eos> But a secret Ranger base, that's a scoop.<eos> So they filled in the holes using information they had on the Rangers' location?<eos> Ended up aiding in the attack that killed Kleeman, Valeo and Frakes.<eos> The GlobeSpill people should be in jail, but how did they even know where the Rangers were?
They call it "eSports," right?<eos> O.G. was a pro...<eos> One of the first.<eos> But it's hard for older players to stay on top.<eos> You know, their reflexes slow down, they get this thing with their thumbs where it locks from doing the same motion over and over and over.
Ms. Jao also said that Tendu had the company wire $20,000 each to several people in his village in Maniitok, Canada.<eos> He wanted the payments to continue for the life of his contract.<eos> But he also wanted to make sure he could stop the payments if the recipients didn't fulfill certain conditions.<eos> The payments were incentives.<eos> He wanted to ensure certain prominent citizens in Maniitok did something that they already desperately wanted to do.
I don't even know him.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Calvin...<eos> I think you're the one that pulls the strings in here.<eos> You decide when to help, and you decide when to look away, and you have a lot of friends, and they're afraid of you, so they play your little game.
- Well... - Brett, what's going on?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I am batting about a zero with men lately.<eos> Good men, bad men, all men.<eos> I'm either pushing them away, or they're pushing me, and then I look at you, and I think,
The sudden flood of supply made the stock value tank.<eos> But the brokers had already cashed out tens of millions.<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> Meanwhile, the clients...<eos> they lost everything.
They've jumped.<eos> They're no longer in...<eos> - Nothing's responding.<eos> - Get them up.<eos> Where in the hell are they?
And eventually, I guess, they decided to try to get rid of you in order to protect their operations.<eos> You couldn't have warned us?<eos> I didn't know who they were going after until I saw Hetty with Carl Brown.<eos> Swear to God.<eos> They didn't tell me everything.

As long as it doesn't start with "I left the file in my car."<eos> No.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Got a letter a few weeks ago from the U.S. Attorney's Office.<eos> They... they're opening up an investigation on me.
Gene instead.<eos> So you didn't get it?<eos> So I quit.<eos> And, Roger... it felt so damn good.<eos> They don't deserve me there.
When I was at the academy, there was a pool hall on the corner of Jefferson and Taylor.<eos> A few recruits and I would play nine-ball for a couple of bucks a game.<eos> I would take a shot, cue ball would come right back to the center, and they would say,<eos> "You got lucky."<eos> I kept taking their money, and they kept saying, "You got lucky, Wallace."
In addition to working for the CPD for the past 11 years, my client is a family man and a solid member of his community.<eos> Defense asks that he be released on an I Bond.<eos> Your Honor, my client is the third most decorated detective in the history of the Chicago Police Department.<eos> If that doesn't get him an I Bond, what will?<eos> Their résumés notwithstanding, they're each charged with four violent felonies, Your Honor.
What am I supposed to do, huh?<eos> I mean... I never wanted to be a Dad and... now here I am.<eos> I get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I wanna be a part of the twins' lives, and they seem to want to know us.
It's about forcing the last person standing in their way to veto this bill, which they know that she will.<eos> Whatever happens next will be perceived as her fault.<eos> I should have seen this coming.<eos> These people planted the seeds for this for months, years.<eos> I mean, they're playing chess, and we can't even find the board.
And ask yourself This question...<eos> Why are these men In suits so desperate. To prove that I'm crazy?<eos> I will tell you.<eos> It's because they know That I'm right.<eos> I'm awake. They're asleep.
I am really sorry.<eos> I'm just stressed. You should be allowed to enjoy fitting me.<eos> Please, continue.<eos> Above my calf. _<eos> There they are!
Only useful thing I ever got from that ass-hat.<eos> Nighty-night, jerk.<eos> Don't know what you expect to find.<eos> My best people have been over this place a dozen times.<eos> No offense to your best people, but they're not me.
You know.<eos> The crazies.<eos> Matt, when you're an alderman, here's the thing.<eos> You don't get to pick your constituents.<eos> They pick you.
Whoever did this, they they knew we were there.<eos> Maybe the same person that talked to the reporter talked to the collaborators, tipped them off as to what we were doing.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Will they pull the plug on this operation?
I'll rendezvous with the armed response team and neutralize the shooters.<eos> Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Get to safety, come on.<eos> This is an emergency evacuation.<eos> Proceed to the nearest exit.<eos> How the hell did they get in here?
All right, let's get eyes on Spann.<eos> We're going around the clock on this one.<eos> Hey, where are we at ID-ing these kids?<eos> They all got juvie records... underage drinking, possession, assault.<eos> And they're the future leaders of tomorrow.
It wasn't. It was... They were my adaptations.<eos> The exposed wires, a piece of fabric showing, a piece of plaster.<eos> I am talking figuratively.<eos> Everything was beautiful, the execution of the exhibition was beautiful, but metaphorically speaking, people didn't see this...<eos> "My God, they don't realize it."
I joined the Army, someone saw my potential, then they helped me become a doctor.<eos> Here I am.<eos> My cousins?<eos> My friends?<eos> Their jobs are all gone, and they're not coming back.
She doesn't care about you, Izzy.<eos> That's why she's not here.<eos> She knows that if she showed her face, she would go to jail.<eos> And what about the men that come around, huh?<eos> Why don't they pay?
These people are fucking nuts.<eos> I know I sound like a broken record, but I fucking heard it and I've seen it.<eos> You think you understand. You fucking don't.<eos> These people are not fucking cops, Bobby, all right?<eos> They will make you die for days and they've got fucking good at it.
Every life I take, every atrocity I commit, is on your head!<eos> Keep your eyes peeled, lads!<eos> We can't delay any longer, sir.<eos> No! The undead will have reached the bridge soon, and then it will be too late.<eos> They're not back yet!
Where are we?<eos> The same world only much later.<eos> What happened?<eos> The humans turned against us.<eos> But they worshipped us?
An amazing battle! And we're in the 15th round.<eos> This fight is gonna go all the way!<eos> We are counting down.<eos> Six, five, four, three... And the bell is going to ring!<eos> Here they are!
Georgia sucks!<eos> Can we please just go?<eos> They've got boyfriends.<eos> Those meatdick fucks?<eos> They're not their boyfriends.
Shit.<eos> Yeah, we'll be right there.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> And then I came back from the bathroom and all those black guys from the club were, like, standing around Lenore and Dr. Richards and they were yelling at them and threatening them and they, like, kidnapped them!

I traced it.<eos> I thought I recognized that!<eos> Enough catching up.<eos> Let my friends go.<eos> They've literally done nothing wrong.
Exclamation point.<eos> Smiley face, smiley face, smile... like we give a fuck.<eos> I am an old soul.<eos> I like old music and old movies and even old people.<eos> Bottom line is i have nothing in common with the people out there, and they have nothing in common with me.
I will leave the door open.<eos> I brought you this.<eos> Has your mother told you what it means to be a woman?<eos> Many people believe that God does not approve of violence.<eos> They have not read their Bible.
Let's go.<eos> Use the trampolines.<eos> Can you get up there?<eos> We've got intruders!<eos> What the heck are they doing?
He'll be working on the assumption that if we betray him, you good people will stand up for him and his family.<eos> He's making a lot of assumptions.<eos> What choice does he have?<eos> He's trying to protect the people he loves.<eos> They're using you.
Sounds like he cut off his radio, Mr. Cluff.<eos> He's going it on his own.<eos> Bernie Webber.<eos> What do ya know?<eos> How are they gonna find their way home?
Getting out is easy.<eos> There's a gate. 20 miles west.<eos> We dodge the hill tribes.<eos> - We can make it.<eos> - They need us here.
There's a gate. 20 miles west.<eos> We dodge the hill tribes.<eos> - We can make it.<eos> - They need us here.<eos> They need more than us.
So?<eos> - So?<eos> We have to first sort out the problems of the board members and our people<eos> I hope you understand<eos> With all due respect, they are also your people
- Yes, I'm the dragon warrior.<eos> Facing maniacs, that's my job.<eos> But because of you I left the valley unprotected.<eos> I left my friends unprotected.<eos> And now they're all.... they're all....
Dad?<eos> Where are my parents?<eos> Dory? Are you really Jenny and Charlie's girl?<eos> Yes, I am!<eos> That's me! Where are they?
Go and eat your bread in the cart!<eos> When I have leftovers, I'll throw them.<eos> - It is so unpleasant to eat with the servants.<eos> Let her eat with the horses.<eos> They don't mind.

Idiots.<eos> It's a vest.<eos> That's why I need a vest, James.<eos> Accidents like this.<eos> Who are these two fools, and what are they doing in my house?
I feel bad for you guys.<eos> It's like when my nephew loses a soccer game.<eos> I wanna give you a hug and a Capri Sun.<eos> But I feel worse for these guys.<eos> They have to kill two rogue cops who they mistook for terrorists.
I was in jail too.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I'm so ashamed I was dependent on people.<eos> I'm not anymore.<eos> I don't understand them and they don't understand me.
I saw three men standing at the window.<eos> I nearly crapped my pants.<eos> - The husband?<eos> - And his henchmen, yes.<eos> They just stood there.
The primitives lived over 10,000 years ago.<eos> So by digging down, we look back a telescope of time.<eos> This must have been a good place.<eos> Sheltered.<eos> Did they sleep on the mud?
Tell me about the beginning, the first night of your happening.<eos> - What was your brother doing?<eos> - Brothers playing and fooling about.<eos> I wasn't quite sure, no.<eos> - They were scared?
These men destroy people's lives.<eos> Spying on the world, robbing you of your right to privacy.<eos> And they do that by hiding in the dark.<eos> So, in the Horsemen tradition, we're here to expose them.<eos> Tonight, they, like all of us, are finally stepping into the light.
He went.<eos> Okay, guys, I've been thinking about what happened today, And I think it's a sign for us to go somewhere else.<eos> He is right.<eos> Those buyers could come for us.<eos> They are all gangsters.
I missed my parents.<eos> I wanted to see them so much.<eos> I wanted to hold them like I had never hugged them before.<eos> I wanted to sit down and talk to them about nothing.<eos> I just wanted to be close to them, because they know who I am.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Esposito.<eos> Teenie, you brought men home.<eos> Gentlemen, this is my sister.<eos> Wanna put something on, Queenie? Oh, sure.<eos> So, who are they?
I will not ask again.<eos> Tell me, and you're free.<eos> Give your word.<eos> My word.<eos> Where are they?
Tell me, and you're free.<eos> Give your word.<eos> My word.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're everywhere.
Human piloted simulations showed that you could make it back to the airport.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> These pilots were not behaving like human beings, like people who are experiencing this for the first time.<eos> Well, they may not be reacting like you did.<eos> Immediately after the bird strike they are turning back for the airport.
All those innocent people.<eos> Dead, because of me.<eos> No.<eos> Not because of you, because of them.<eos> They tried to kill you, sir.
Dead, because of me.<eos> No.<eos> Not because of you, because of them.<eos> They tried to kill you, sir.<eos> And they killed all these people, just to make everyone else a little more afraid.
We didn't know his family was there.<eos> His daughter was killed.<eos> Well, he certainly got his revenge.<eos> Civilians?<eos> Well, if they're not being targeted specifically...
The men?<eos> - Us?<eos> The women?<eos> To have a white woman who we must love and trust and respect as our sovereign?<eos> Whoo. You belong to the whites, but they won't want you, either.
We're done here.<eos> Move.<eos> Open BA201.<eos> Ma'am, these men are here to transfer you.<eos> Who are they?
Open BA201.<eos> Ma'am, these men are here to transfer you.<eos> Who are they?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are they?
They gave her medicine, but she was really sick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And she... died.<eos> Sick people die.<eos> Sometimes they-they die.
Who's there?<eos> Our family is an embarrassment.<eos> That's not much of a joke. Okay.<eos> Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family. Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents for the first time, and-and they're academics and-and intellectuals, and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.
They are the majority of the homeless.<eos> They are the majority of suicides.<eos> They are majority of the drug addicted.<eos> They are the majority of the unemployed.<eos> They are majority of the school drop outs.
They are majority of the drug addicted.<eos> They are the majority of the unemployed.<eos> They are majority of the school drop outs.<eos> They are the majority of those in prison...<eos> How do we know that they're not the cause of these problems?
We didn't pay attention, and they want attention.<eos> And they know that attacking girls or women is gonna get them attention.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Start a campaign, "bring back our boys"?<eos> Oh, wait, they're dead.
- Bean.<eos> You... You shouldn't let them treat you like that.<eos> Nobody should.<eos> I lives with nine bean-eating giants.<eos> They takes, so I gives back.
The three most beautiful words.<eos> They should die.<eos> It needed only a suitable opportunity.<eos> It took only a moment.<eos> Best of all, they thought they cheated us.
I can't believe we let her go to New York.<eos> She's 16, Seymour.<eos> We don't even know who she's with.<eos> We don't know who her friends are.<eos> Well, she likes them, they like her. That's what's important.
- Okay?<eos> All right?<eos> - Please proceed to the next level.<eos> We're running out of time, people.<eos> They're gonna.... regenerate.
Shit!<eos> Don't say I never do anything for you, sweet cheeks.<eos> Level clear.<eos> High score, Atlas.<eos> People... they only notice something when it smacks them around the head.
It's clean.<eos> I want a phone call.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but all the phones have been shut down on account of monsters breaking into our stationhouse.<eos> Well, I hate to break it to you, but legally I'm entitled to a phone call.<eos> - Tell me where they are.
You think t.J. Jackson had a small unit, sir, or a big ol' large unit?<eos> Stocky, you're a third grader trapped in a grown man's body, shut the fuck up.<eos> All right, anyone else?<eos> Any non-comedians?<eos> Can you think of any point they may be trying to make, anybody?
Any fool who followed Hallendale deserves whatever end they got in his company.<eos> You were right.<eos> This war is getting more dangerous.<eos> The strong among us must stand together and face it.<eos> But the fools and the pretenders... they were never truly among us to begin with.
- You took the money, though, I notice.<eos> - Listen!<eos> They're hoodlums.<eos> Hoodlums! Hoodlums as you call them, Mr Totten, who have been risking their lives for our country and I would be grateful if you show them the respect they deserve.<eos> Madam Florence, they're tearing the place apart. You must go on.
I'm moving in with them.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why don't you come with me?<eos> I have nothing to do with that and neither do you.<eos> - Do you know what they're doing?
Cornell was a repentant man dealing with his violent past.<eos> Making amends for his wrongs.<eos> He had every intention of... of cooperating with the police.<eos> Goddamn vigilantes who call themselves heroes, like Luke Cage, they are dangerous.<eos> They are a menace to the safety, the security, and the sanctity of our community. You know what?
Please stop.<eos> Where are the assassins?<eos> Where are they hiding?<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Where are they?
- Why?<eos> - Well...<eos> Let's just say the last owners... left in a little bit of a hurry, mid-renovation.<eos> What the fuck is mid-renovation?<eos> They didn't survive the Purge.
The Black Watch should be guarding that door!<eos> The Chosen... they're all dead.<eos> No... one still lives.<eos> This must be the work of Gnomes.<eos> They've struck at the heart of the palace before.
Until then, he will dispatch his Demons to carry out his murderous biddings.<eos> Like he has done here.<eos> Can my father and I please have the room?<eos> Father, you need to send this Druid away.<eos> People are starting to talk, they don't understand why you're under his thrall.
Freddy, you know what I can do.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> You know the Thuringer brothers, right?<eos> Yeah. They're on the list.<eos> Yeah. They took them.
A growing boy.<eos> Growing boy!<eos> We got two guests inside.<eos> We'll go talk to them, you sort this mess out.<eos> You know, they're supposed to turn on each other, but only if a guest takes them on the High Sierra storyline, and Walter always buys it.
I appreciate you inviting me tonight. Oh, yeah.<eos> No problem. It's a great group.<eos> I really think you'll like them.<eos> - Yeah. - You said you wanted to meet people. - Oh, I do.<eos> - They're people, so...
And so here I sit,<eos> elected by you, to play my part...<eos> The part of the scapegoat.<eos> The patsy.<eos> Sent into the wilderness so that men sitting in this room can lay their sins upon my back, and claim they themselves are clean.
You're still fighting him.<eos> But he's not here anymore.<eos> You said earlier you felt his life was incomplete.<eos> Every father's life is incomplete.<eos> That's why they have sons... to finish what they started.
- No... Changed, how?<eos> Forget the Chicago suburbs. Think bigger.<eos> - Bigger?<eos> - I'm not chasing them anymore.<eos> They're chasing me now.
Just come on in and we just sit down.<eos> We just... we just... We just sit down and relax. I'm sorry, man.<eos> All these people out here like this.<eos> All the cops, man-- you got to tell 'em I'm sorry, that I didn't mean for them to have to come out like this.<eos> No, no, they just... they just... they just want you to be safe, Juice.
She had a black eye, a cut forehead, a swollen cheek.<eos> In her torn bra, Nicole pleaded with the officers,<eos> "You've come up here eight times.<eos> You never do anything about him."<eos> And they want to tell you that the police conspired against Mr. Simpson.
And I have always, always had faith that when I look at a jury, we have that in common.<eos> Everyone wants justice for victims, right?<eos> I never doubted that... until this.<eos> After all they heard, after all they know, a man who beat and beat and terrorized his wife, until he just... snuffed her out.<eos> And they let him go.
I just want to make a brief statement.<eos> Okay, uh, I am relieved that this incredible part of the nightmare that occurred on June 12, 1994, is over.<eos> My first obligation is to my young children, Sydney and Justin, who will be raised the way that Nicole and I had always planned.<eos> Then when things settle down a bit, I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers who slaughtered Nicole and Mr. Goldman.<eos> They're out there somewhere.
Who are you?<eos> Uncle Benjen.<eos> The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.<eos> I led a ranging party deep into the North to find white walkers.<eos> They found us.
All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about... - Grandmother. - ...until I tell them to stop.<eos> If I tell them to stop.<eos> - You could use a good bashing.<eos> - Grandmother, please.<eos> What have they done to you?
Desire as consciously strive for a particular purpose is inherent in man. "<eos> I will read a passage about desire from Plato's Symposium.<eos> He says, "When a man and a woman come together...<eos> Is the kind of existence.<eos> But if two men get together, they find satisfaction in their relationship. "
I don't know what else to say to you.<eos> All I know is Rain that fall in Virginia get burned off by the sun Rise up to the clouds, and then them clouds, they drift away.<eos> Maybe the same rain that fall here fall there on your own people.<eos> And I know they want you to live.<eos> And they know your true name.
They're not expecting nobody, so... he should be alone.<eos> There's two good men there.<eos> You do what they say.<eos> But I fire the bullet, all right?<eos> Yes, you can be there. But it's better if they do it.
He needs to verify the value.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you these past few months.<eos> You would never steal from your family, would you?<eos> The collection was mostly my mother's anyway.<eos> It is more mine than theirs. And they would never have sold it.
And I know that you all want me to say that I'll change, that this fucking business will change.<eos> But I've learnt something in the last few days.<eos> Those BASTARDS... .. are worse than us.<eos> Politicians, fucking judges, lords and ladies.<eos> They're WORSE than us, and they will never admit us to their palaces, no matter how legitimate we become... .. because of who we are.
Do either of you even know what our arrest numbers were?<eos> - 12.<eos> - No!<eos> - Then no.<eos> - Yeah, they're not the leak.
When I started in this business, rock and roll was defined like this...<eos> Two Jews and a guinea recording four schvartzes on a single track.<eos> Now it's changed so much, it's not even recognizable as the thing people used to be so afraid of.<eos> Now, that's not a judgment.<eos> I mean, I always tried to give the audience what they wanted and in return they made me ridiculously stinking fucking rich.
Which part of this don't you understand?<eos> It's not that she lied to you.<eos> I know... I know... but these people are like this.<eos> She is the Begum's daughter after all.<eos> They don't care for anyone.
I should think so, too.<eos> They're delaying a convoy carrying much needed agricultural equipment.<eos> It's an absolute scandal.<eos> You are a very bad man.<eos> They didn't watch the cups, you see.
But trust me, I do.<eos> The things I... and Kelly... have seen... brutality, natural disasters, massacres... there's always the ones left behind.<eos> Human wreckage.<eos> People suffering so badly, they can't possibly go on.<eos> They need answers.
I says, "No, I'll just kick you on the pot like everybody else."<eos> Hey. Hey. Easy, lads.<eos> It's just a pack of new recruits.<eos> How do ten men just walk into the camp without so much as a challenge from the sentries?<eos> I just smiled and waved, and they let me pass.
Cotters we may be, but we're here, same as you.<eos> For gore and glory.<eos> Gore and glory, is it?<eos> There's no pigs ye're slaughtering here, but men.<eos> And they'll be looking to do the same to you.
I have it on good authority, Harlee.<eos> And this authority definitely puts an informant in our crew?<eos> Yes.<eos> The feds deal in fear.<eos> When people are scared, they make mistakes.
Hey, Lieutenant Wozniak.<eos> And this is Detective Nazario.<eos> Wow, looks like you lost an argument with a Louisville Slugger, huh?<eos> Manny was at the park last night with a couple of friends, and two patrol officers started harassing him, and he defended himself.<eos> This is what they did.
We don't get to fight a preemptive war.<eos> We don't get to pop people because of what we think they're gonna do, but it happens all the time.<eos> And that's why they're afraid.<eos> That's why they don't trust us.<eos> Yes, we do not get to shoot people in the head before we know that they're bad guys.
Darren is my friend.<eos> Brenda is my friend.<eos> Amy is my friend...<eos> They're your friends, right.<eos> But do you think they treat you like a friend?
Lobbying is about foresight.<eos> About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising countermeasures.<eos> The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition, and plays her trump card just after they play theirs.
We need to hit 60.<eos> Anything less doesn't cut it.<eos> Fifty-nine doesn't cut it.<eos> We need 60 senators to show up and vote.<eos> We don't get that, they win, period.
- No!<eos> Rheda, let us be clear.<eos> You are telling us that the most reviled of all our enemies is running loose in Herot?<eos> As soon as it was discovered, I had it hunted down and killed.<eos> I favour peace... but if we have enemies, they will be struck down without mercy.
Well, that's a good question, Mulder.<eos> One for the ages.<eos> Well, think about the immense power in those prophecies, the power in those words to convince young men to put on suicide vests today and murder for their angry God.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Those boys, they just swallow the pill.
The guests don't return for the obvious things we do, the garish things.<eos> They come back because of the subtleties, the details.<eos> They come back because they discover something they imagine no on had ever noticed before... something they've fallen in love with.<eos> They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are.<eos> They already know who they are.
...talking, the four of us, confidentially?<eos> - No!<eos> - Okay. But your confusion and fear is not gonna go away no matter how much you talk to me.<eos> If people are getting hurt, we have a responsibility.<eos> You think everything is about talking, but they're not like that.
What did the markings look like on the blonde boy you were talking about?<eos> Who cares, Mom, okay?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> I think I killed a guy.<eos> Clary... did they look like this?
You can't afford a mark in the loss column.<eos> There's a saying in baseball.<eos> Towns fire managers.<eos> Owners just give them the bad news.<eos> You're the only one running the big money they cheer for.
-We threw a little party.<eos> -You see, I--<eos> It was just to raise money for our music thing, and it became a big party.<eos> And then, these guys came that we never met, and things got out of hand.<eos> They smashed up the place.
'Cause, like we were reached.<eos> No.<eos> There's no place for the word of God in your disco.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, the people in the discos, they want-- they wanna feel raised up, they want God, they want the light, that's what we've been working on night and day.
Do you know where you are?<eos> I'm in a dream.<eos> Before this, do you know what happened?<eos> My parents...<eos> They hurt them.
I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be this hard.<eos> But goodbyes are always hard, especially when I am the one saying goodbye.<eos> Today, effective immediately, I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli, am forced to officially say goodbye to the entire Nucleus division.<eos> All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated. But make no mistake.<eos> Though they're the ones leaving, it is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure.
- My "resiliency"?<eos> No, I mean it. Look around you.<eos> We live in an age of superfluous men.<eos> Not one of these knuckle-draggers can handle a fraction of what you've endured.<eos> Well, I think they got the better end of the bargain.
When people glibly say,<eos> "Oh, if I'd have been in Germany, "I would never have collaborated, "I'd have resisted,"<eos> Do you have any idea how dangerous and difficult it was?<eos> Standing up to the enemy was arduous and uncertain and exhausting.<eos> But they had to do it.
Just get them to the gym. Harry can't.<eos> - I need your help, Uncle.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Get those pricks out of my sight.<eos> They're just kids!
Get those pricks out of my sight.<eos> They're just kids!<eos> No different than Jake or Gub.<eos> We can't buy into any of this. It is bullshit.<eos> They want us to tear each other apart.
Send a couple of cars in.<eos> I don't care about collateral damage.<eos> I can work with that.<eos> But three Hairy boys loose in the streets tearing people's hearts out...<eos> They didn't.
Like you, I understand that the size of the problem dictates the size of the solution needed.<eos> If being honest and truthful is so damn purifying why do I feel like the bottom of somebody's shoe?<eos> Government does the job that only government is big enough to do.<eos> Our courts are not the enemy of freedom.<eos> Look, they have the reports.
Liam's gonna love it.<eos> I'm not nervous about Ezra's chapters.<eos> They're filled with nothing but the truth.<eos> Are you afraid yours aren't as honest?<eos> Actually, I think they're a little too honest.
Who the hell is Maggie Chen?<eos> Uh, that's the woman Beth shot.<eos> Neolution gives us the opportunity at self-directed evolution.<eos> Wherever you think the science is at, I guarantee you're wrong.<eos> They haven't just infiltrated Leda.
You know what it is?<eos> Somebody going, "I'm hearing a noise in the basement.<eos> Go see if we've got rats."<eos> Well, you know, then I'm the one. I got to go in and start rooting around.<eos> And I got these guys -- they're looking at me like -- you know, like I-I was accusing them.
To end this.<eos> Harold, are you in there?<eos> Is there something special about this place?<eos> My father and I used to sit out and watch the birds fly south for the winter.<eos> He would tell me all about the migration patterns and the countries they'd visit along the way.
Some good people.<eos> And they taught me the value of life.<eos> Those people, they wouldn't want you to kill me.<eos> You're right.<eos> But they're all dead.
I lost a lot of subjects.<eos> And whether they were out for seconds or moments, it was always a roll of the dice whether I could bring them back or not.<eos> Until I realized that those subjects who had previously experienced an NDE were far more likely to be revived.<eos> And when I began working exclusively with near death experience survivors, the work took off.<eos> They have an almost limitless potential for being revived.
And because of the broad number of young people doing this, there's no longer the social stigma attached. Is she done?<eos> I can never tell when she's done.<eos> I'm the one who should move back in.<eos> Mom and Dad are like my best friends.<eos> They're my only friends.
Authorities are cautioning citizens to beware.<eos> There are dark times ahead.<eos> No one can be trusted.<eos> Stay inside, lock your doors.<eos> If they can kill Retro Girl...
Who said that?<eos> Mao.<eos> Allen, you're starting to sound a little crazy.<eos> Like those crazy people in the Weather Underground or the Panthers or that creepy-looking girl who shot her way out of jail.<eos> I mean, they're... that's how they think. They... they're crazy.
My fiancée, Alicia, was killed in a shootout between the Chicago PD and an armed gunman.<eos> The police blamed the FBI.<eos> Chicago was a blown sting.<eos> Someone above me screwed up, and people got hurt.<eos> The terrorists, they're calling.
I'll see you at home. Hey.<eos> I love you, okay?<eos> I'm sorry we couldn't help your friends.<eos> Participation in a cause like ours can be tough. Especially for people with close family and friends.<eos> They have the most to lose.
Strike two!<eos> I don't know. That looked a little low to me.<eos> Anyway, we got a subpoena on your folks' investment portfolio and it seems that they were in on the Pepsum trade, among others.<eos> And I know and you know that was not a legal trade.<eos> And they'll say that they didn't know, that they're innocent.
I don't know. That looked a little low to me.<eos> Anyway, we got a subpoena on your folks' investment portfolio and it seems that they were in on the Pepsum trade, among others.<eos> And I know and you know that was not a legal trade.<eos> And they'll say that they didn't know, that they're innocent.<eos> That they're innocent. But hey, that's what they all say.
Was that the first time that you'd seen someone die?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside. They will destroy your life without conscience.
Uh... That's not a... a Hebrew name.<eos> That's not a name.<eos> -He's not Jewish, is he?<eos> -Well, what does it matter?<eos> I mean, you said you'd marry two men and they're both men.
The answer is right in front of you.<eos> How do the most successful scientists achieve greatness?<eos> Given your history, drinking copious amounts of alcohol and cavorting with loose women.<eos> That's a good guess, but it's wrong. Nope.<eos> They get smarter people to do the research, and then they steal it themselves.
For that, yeah.<eos> And, uh, and because I can.<eos> I can't not, you know?<eos> Um, it's my escape.<eos> Some people, they... They drink, they do drugs.
Unless someone makes a decision soon, it's game over, anyway.<eos> No one's going home.<eos> We're staying, we're fighting, and we're getting out alive, with the hostages.<eos> Roger that.<eos> If we're flying blind, so should they.
- This belongs to us.<eos> The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.<eos> It's been 3 hours.<eos> What are they waiting for?
Thank you for backing me.<eos> I was just doing what was right for my people.<eos> Your ambassadors betrayed you.<eos> How do you move forward?<eos> They were doing what they believed was right for their people, too.
It was self-defense.<eos> - You know I'm on the right side of things.<eos> - I know that.<eos> I'm not sure our friends agree.<eos> If you wanna smooth things over, I suggest you find Clary soon... or they will.
Sure.<eos> I'll find out where he is right away, Thessaly, and I'm sure...<eos> Say, what kind of name is Thessaly, anyway?<eos> It's a name that 20 million readers trust.<eos> They want the truth, Eddie.
That's human nature.<eos> And even though it seems as if they're shutting the door on you right now, I'd encourage you not to shut the door on them.<eos> Sometimes people just need a...<eos> No.<eos> No. They're being jerks.
So, Hettie, you're doing a concert tonight.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Could you tell our listeners why you didn't perform with your older brothers and sisters?<eos> I mean, they would ask me to.<eos> They would...
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why do you think I picked you?<eos> I knew that you would understand them.<eos> And they'd understand you.
What do you mean?<eos> Why do you think I picked you?<eos> I knew that you would understand them.<eos> And they'd understand you.<eos> And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
It's victimhood.<eos> I blamed those... black kids, and I blamed this school,<eos> I blamed the cops;<eos> I blamed everybody.<eos> I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
Everyone here matters to me, and I go out of my way for all of 'em.<eos> That's why I got him the best medical care.<eos> The same as when Mick Danzig gets tackled on his lawn with a machine gun in his fucking hands, I'm the one who pays off the cops to make the problem go away.<eos> That's what I do here.<eos> I take care of my people, and they know that.
Each of you is guilty of the same crimes as Kane, and as such, you will share the same fate... death.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> My people are innocent.<eos> They know nothing.
You're brave, Clarke.<eos> Clarke...<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> They're lucky to have a friend like you.
I understand you perfectly.<eos> These cocolos all over the ball like it's a free sandwich.<eos> Cocolos?<eos> For real?<eos> I bet you got cousins darker than they are, pana.
I won't disappoint.<eos> I think I'm gonna like this century.<eos> Constable.<eos> By 'concurrent', I mean 'extraneous and unnecessary'.<eos> So while they play detective, you'll play nurse maid, nothing more.
No reactor, no possibility of a meltdown.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Some people believe that toxic, radioactive waste Is being transported...<eos> Tree-huggers already won the battle.<eos> They got us shut down, But they gotta bellyache about something.
And you believed him.<eos> Did I have a choice?<eos> You can cry later.<eos> First finish your cigarette.<eos> My officers will be here soon" ..and they are not as generous as me.
Authors, Mr. R. Ahmad and Mr. SKA Al-Qadir.<eos> To give more robust and far reaching legal protection in this country to the status of those merchant seamen from the South Asian colonies.<eos> He, Mr. Hafeez also, also they fight lascars.<eos> Now, this was a cornerstone of his legal career.<eos> Why would he steal from them, and why would they kill him?
No more.<eos> You!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Where did these people come from?<eos> Who are they?
Uncontrollable urges to run away, answer disrespectfully and refuse work.<eos> We should talk about this more.<eos> Owning slaves is our most important liberty.<eos> The only cure for Drapetomania is severe whippings and hard labor to send vital blood to the brain.<eos> In a sense, they're freer than we.
It's my son's birthday today.<eos> It's not fit for a dog, let alone a monarch.<eos> What's happening, Marcheaux?<eos> The prisoners attacked the guard and stole his keys!<eos> The whole Chatelet is wide open, and they're not going to go back into their cells like nice little sheep.
He shot at me.<eos> It was one of the guys you saw in Alex's memory.<eos> The guy who took his parents?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They weren't just taken.
Go! Go!<eos> Walk in the bar!<eos> You have no right.<eos> Those dark objects are my family's legacy.<eos> Well, that's funny because I seem to remember my brother Kol making them, so perhaps they've been my family's legacy all along.
This feels like something different.<eos> This here is hallowed ground, home to the nine covens of New Orleans.<eos> Y'all need to be on y'all's way.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna give you one guess what they're here for.<eos> Cami, either they're gonna kill you or Klaus will for losing that thing.
I do.<eos> The 2 words that start every marriage: "I do."<eos> True love.<eos> People need to see.<eos> They need to know what a joke that is.
- We are time.<eos> My herb, they don't work unless the leaves are red.<eos> Gives you pictures in your head you can't erase.<eos> No!<eos> They're gonna kill him there.
That how you justify butchering innocent people?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Those people were just like me.<eos> They could hear the voices.<eos> You saying they were Primary?
Um, are you not paying attention to what Chronos is doing?<eos> Fall back!<eos> Get to the jump ship!<eos> 1958's swell and all, but I miss the Internet... and cell phones.<eos> Uh... what are they doing?
Forensic report regarding Operation Damson.<eos> Gunshot residue from the discharge of a Glock 17 pistol was detected on the hands and clothing of the following:<eos> Victor Charlie Five One,<eos> Victor Charlie Five Two, Victor Charlie Five Three.<eos> They all discharged their weapons. No-one's disputing that.
- Is something stirring them up?<eos> - Not that we've heard of.<eos> Why? I'm seeing the bottom of this.<eos> The thing about trolls is... you rub along with them all right.<eos> You keep to your mine, they keep to their woods.
You're here to lead us on a suicide mission.<eos> Listen, I'm here, too.<eos> My life is on the line here, too.<eos> Shall we proceed with the plan?<eos> I'm sure they all have a plan.
Why did you target me?<eos> I didn't target you. The people I work with did.<eos> They targeted Princess Zara, too.<eos> The people he works with.<eos> Who are they?
She has the same type of M.S. Susan has.<eos> But Celinex wasn't expected to go into clinical trials until next year. So the drug's not even finished yet.<eos> That's why it's poisoning people?<eos> But if that's true, the patients in the first clinical trial would've had the same symptoms.<eos> So where are they?
Now stop making a spectacle of yourself and get off.<eos> Holy Father, the papal tiara has arrived from Washington, it's in perfect condition.<eos> Prepare the Sistine Chapel.<eos> The time has come to address the cardinals.<eos> They're still there.
If Chronos was gonna settle for taking one person, you'd think it would be you.<eos> He took Snart for a reason. Uh, hello?<eos> A UFO sighting in Hub City in 1960 has created a time anomaly.<eos> It looks like your friends survived.<eos> And what would they be doing in 1960?
The Governor of Nagasaki took four friars, and one of our own society (?<eos> There are hotsprings there.<eos> The Japanese call them hells Partly, I think, in mockery. and partly, I must tell you, in truth.<eos> The officials told our Padres to abandon God and the gospel of his love.<eos> But they not only refused to apostatize. They asked to be tortured. So they could demonstrate the strenght of their faith and the presence of God within them.
Throw in a Pinot and a cheap motel, and you've got the beginnings of a romance.<eos> Well, you'd have to survive this first. (Ropes creaking)<eos> You see, there's an anchor locking my brothers inside.<eos> Something representational.<eos> That's why they can't get out.
Come on.<eos> Camille!<eos> This has to stop!<eos> Why are you defending these people, Elijah?<eos> Oh, that's right, because they're the only ones that can protect you from the white oak.
But I can't leave here.<eos> And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.<eos> Let go.<eos> You can barely control yourself.<eos> Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
They already took his body.<eos> Now are you going to your punishment, or do I have to order these boys to take ya?<eos> Well, I am sorry.<eos> I am sorry that the boy got hurt.<eos> But you got no idea the threat that they pose!
And we got set up.<eos> Maybe them boys just went down to the shop to... I don't know, play cards or...<eos> No, I told you.<eos> It was their church day.<eos> No, they was waitin'.
I'm saying, don't you think the people of this town need a new hobby?<eos> What kind of cut you want?<eos> Get to work, brother.<eos> Thought so.<eos> Look, I don't know these men, but they've done a terrible thing.
I've been warning you On these demons.<eos> I'm gonna tell you, They's after us.<eos> Now we got one here with a gun<eos> Right close enough to touch.<eos> All right? Now you see How they are.
Ashamed.<eos> It's what everything i read online tells me to feel.<eos> Do you feel ashamed?<eos> I got my mom dragging me around to the cops, to doctors.<eos> She's telling them i got assaulted, And... They're all just, like, smirking
But, no, th-that didn't happen.<eos> It didn't happen because boys don't get raped.<eos> First of all, Boys don't do that to other boys.<eos> And even if he could... The boys fight back.<eos> Wait. Are they even taking this seriously?
Check this out.<eos> Bingo.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - Yeah, shot at. At least two of the insurgents were operating out of the top floor of the building.<eos> - Where are they?
You know the difference between the Circle and the Clave?<eos> I don't.<eos> They all lock the same to me.<eos> Shadowhunters think they're better than us.<eos> They're the ones killing each other over petty disagreements.
Yeah, maybe we don't have angel blood.<eos> We got each other.<eos> We're a family.<eos> A pack.<eos> We're stronger than they'll ever be.
How would milk do that?<eos> It's from cows who are smart enough not to get turned into hamburger.<eos> Hmm. Oh. I never looked closely at this milk before.<eos> Is it made by a soda company?<eos> They don't just make soda, Marge.
War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
Well, how's your sense of direction?<eos> Worse than Columbus.<eos> But that didn't stop him.<eos> What are we waiting for? Then my parents get home and the yelling really starts.<eos> And the whole time, they're yelling at her, not me.
- Is someone there?<eos> - Someone...<eos> These people...<eos> Jesus.<eos> What are they doing to you?
And the people who gave them aid?<eos> Most likely.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wow, Matt. I... I really have not missed you at all.<eos> But, look, Claire, nobody knows they're here.
I could go right now.<eos> Uh, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Guys, can you come here?<eos> Uh, what's this?<eos> Oh, well, they're, um... they're going with you.
It just occurs to me you've never told us about your past, Rip.<eos> And I don't trust a man with secrets.<eos> Look, the less information you have to offer on me, the less valuable you are to our now numerous enemies.<eos> Like I said, convenient.<eos> - Are they fighting?
Well, since you're obviously lower on the human evolutionary chain, perhaps your hearing hasn't developed as well as it should, so I'll repeat myself.<eos> Who... stole... my... property?<eos> Everybody back the hell off or you're going to jail.<eos> Pardon my boys.<eos> They don't always have the best, uh, people skills.
He made me a torturer!<eos> Can you even begin to fathom what it was like?<eos> Eons spent providing a place for dead mortals to punish themselves?<eos> I mean, why do they blame me for all their little failings?<eos> As if I'd spent my days sitting on their shoulder, forcing them to commit acts they'd otherwise find repulsive.
The people of Krypton choose not to see the truth.<eos> Your monstrous plan would have deprived people of their very freedom.<eos> You are deluded, sister.<eos> You cling to the belief that people are inherently good.<eos> But they are weak.
But it's not gonna bring them back.<eos> I know that your parents died in that fire.<eos> - You shut up.<eos> - And that you feel responsible.<eos> Responsible because you lived and they died.
Yes!<eos> It's Mr. Dennis'.<eos> He doesn't even know I stole it.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> You can listen to people talking and they don't even know you're listening.
Has Dr. Fletcher been getting our emails?<eos> This is what we have to do.<eos> As in 1008, when Anandapala suffered the Shahis' most crushing defeat and Mahmud overran the entirety of the Punjab region, taking the famed temple of Kangra, we have been wronged by this alliance, this horde of Patricia, Dennis and the boy.<eos> Their actions do not represent us.<eos> They are every...
- I don't know.<eos> I'm waiting for something interesting to happen.<eos> You?<eos> - Magic is what I'm doing here.<eos> They're hedge witches.
Pocket knife from the Philippines, Vietnamese penlight, matchbook and condoms from China.<eos> Even pirates play it safe sometimes.<eos> But this is the key.<eos> When the pandemic hit, pirates looted the Singaporean reserve bank for gold coins, and this became their currency.<eos> They're the only ones in the region who use it.
How long was the needle in your arm, Captain?<eos> Half-hour, give or take.<eos> It's like they're taking our blood and feeding it to half their crew.<eos> During our first trials, when you got sick, Dr. Scott used Bertrise's blood to buy some time.<eos> Maybe they're sick.
Standing by for exfil.<eos> These people aren't from around here.<eos> They all came looking for black-market cure, and no one knows anyone named Kenji.<eos> Okay. Where to next?<eos> Where are they?
So the services you provide, the transplants you negotiate, they're all done by professionals?<eos> Mm. The buyers are arranged months in advance.<eos> Not only would such a man not be able to sell a kidney stolen in such a hasty manner, but he'd face my wrath.<eos> And people here are not afraid of the law.<eos> They are afraid of me.
I thought about what you said.<eos> Perhaps we can work together.<eos> After all, my unfinished business is also yours.<eos> You told me nothing happens in this slum without your knowledge, and that people are your greatest commodity.<eos> You work with what you have, and so do they.
Give us a second here!<eos> What? What friends?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing's going on. It's just a couple of friends. They're cool.<eos> - Who are they, Garret?
Hormones can also impair one's judgment.<eos> But you seem fine.<eos> So... why don't you want your parents to stay?<eos> Oh, this is just a stop-off on their park tour.<eos> They're not really here to see me.
It freaked me out... where'd you go?<eos> - Everything is fine, Julian.<eos> - No, everything's not fine.<eos> These people are bastards, man.<eos> They don't understand.
Joe's in the hospital. They nearly killed him.<eos> No, he isn't.<eos> Joe West, your Joe West, is alive and safe on your Earth, so is Caitlin, so is Iris.<eos> These people, Barry, they're mirror reflections.<eos> As far as your life is concerned, they don't exist.
We heard them coming in the night.<eos> Me and Mama Kizzy went to Miss Patricia with babies, but she had locked everything up, and we couldn't get in.<eos> Then the militiamen showed up, set fire everywhere.<eos> Screaming about some man named Turner and an uprising.<eos> They was hunting us, George.
Thank you so much for your cool-headed role in this transaction, Officer.<eos> - Transaction? Mm -hmm.<eos> You stole food from hungry people.<eos> And you're gonna pay for that.<eos> Actually, they're gonna pay for it.
- They were dug in on the cliffs.<eos> - And our tanks?<eos> - They were the best.<eos> How were we to know?<eos> They had flamethrowers, they were designed...
All right. We have to help them.<eos> You let it track you here.<eos> Get me out of here! Come on!<eos> If that thing comes after me and messes with my plans, you're all dead.<eos> - Where are they?
I'm not a racist.<eos> I'm a classist.<eos> That's just as bad.<eos> God, what is it like to go through life thinking whole groups of people are below you?<eos> You can't even be bothered to remember something as simple as what they look like.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Who were those people?<eos> My relatives.<eos> Now they ARE mad.
She's a freaking Grimm!<eos> Yeah, just what we need.<eos> Well, you were right.<eos> The brothers are working with a Wasser Zahne named Logan Cobb.<eos> He's been doing the killing, they've been collecting the profits.
If they share it, the deal is off.<eos> How do I know you won't?<eos> I can't force you to believe me... but we are hours from finding them.<eos> And you know how this goes.<eos> Jim Miller dies. They die.
You're dreaming if you think you're gonna take my spot in New York.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I guess even pros lose their footing once in a while. Choosing a field office is about more than picking a job.<eos> It's about finding a home, a place many of you will start families.<eos> Samar spoke to your parents, and they know that you know that they're alive, and they want to talk to you.
Wow, okay.<eos> You're gonna deflect by bringing up my resurrected parents?<eos> Caleb said you still haven't reached out to them.<eos> Don't you at least want to know why they left?<eos> How do you know that they'd even tell me the truth?
The Bureau is unlikely to change its mind, and so am I.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I was just getting you off my back.<eos> I don't want to meet my parents.<eos> Okay, Samar says that they want to meet you.
They're just as much con artists as she is.<eos> Yeah, I-I get that, but Samar has been above board ever since you found out.<eos> I mean, she came here, she returned your money, she's even divorcing the jackass husband that conned you out of that extra $5 mil.<eos> And if you ask me, I believe her when she says that your parents want to meet with you and just explain why they did what they've done.<eos> What do you think they're gonna say?
Okay, how are we getting back, Clyde Barrow?<eos> Okay...<eos> I arranged for your parents to meet us here.<eos> What?<eos> And they're staying at a hotel nearby.

Nowhere else had any space.<eos> What you've done is put that little old lady in there in a potentially very vulnerable and dangerous position.<eos> If it's who we think it is, these people don't muck about.<eos> If they think Ilinka's told us stuff that could compromise them - and she has - they'll kill her.<eos> They'll put a petrol bomb through the door, they'll do something.
Got something on the car.<eos> Ford Expedition, rented in the name of Krisztian Ajandok.<eos> Hasn't been returned.<eos> Then they're on their way to get the books.<eos> The cargo company doesn't open up till 9:00 tomorrow morning, but they're not gonna wait for that.
- I want to talk to him. These people don't know the truth.<eos> - Take her away.<eos> The people of Pakistan don't know the truth.<eos> He's innocent!<eos> Dalbir, they won't understand. Come on.
"When Captain Poldark came to my house, "he told me to hurry and rouse the village "because there was a wreck and the sooner it was stripped, the better<eos> No, sir, I never said them words and I never thought 'em neither.<eos> I remind you, Mr Paynter, that this statement was made before witnesses and read aloud to you before you signed.<eos> Aye, well, sir, see, I is hard of hearing.<eos> So it's likely I misheard what they said and they... .. misheard what I said.
As to what happened when they came upon the beach, I ask you to think of the traditions of our county.<eos> That people scour the beaches for flotsam. This is commonly known.<eos> But in times of dire need, when fathers have seen their children without a crust for their bellies or a rag for their backs, these pickings have been the means of keeping ordinary people alive!<eos> What else would you have them do, after they have rescued the crew and brought goods ashore?<eos> Are they then to await the arrival of the excisemen and watch them carry off the goods that they have salvaged?
A great doctor once told me,<eos> "Never assume treatments will not get better."<eos> You know, I now remember why you were my favorite.<eos> The other students were restless.<eos> They... they couldn't commit.
You trained me well.<eos> And yet, I still have so much to teach you.<eos> I brought you here for a reason.<eos> Look, fight me, and watch your friends die.<eos> See, you are strong, but they make you weak.
Do you want to not look so tired?<eos> Your loss.<eos> Hey, you. Where have you been?<eos> Me... oh, big store. You know, I...<eos> Sometimes I'll run into people, and they'll say,
NYPD's been chasing reports of erratic behavior all across the five boroughs.<eos> People are killing each other over this drug.<eos> Authorities are in the process of running down the drug's source.<eos> Mexican cartel.<eos> Weed's drying up as it gets legalized, and they see this as a start-up venture, their biggest, most lucrative market yet.
Why did you ask me to come here?<eos> I asked you to come because this unfortunate NZT plague has had unforeseen consequences for me.<eos> As in, Senator Morra has friends in all sorts of places, including this one.<eos> Those friends, in the wake of that drug's release...<eos> They're making moves even now to eliminate me.
All I'm asking is that you have my back like I've had yours.<eos> God. You're right, Mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was being selfish.<eos> This is gonna be fun, and I actually like Rebecca's parents and siblings and they love me, so let's go in there and have a good time, okay?
Grammy, you may have been in a coma, but I feel like it's me that just woke up.<eos> For the past five years, I have been really missing all of this, but it's not good crystal that makes a life.<eos> It's good people.<eos> People like them.<eos> And they are not "the help," but they did come here to help me.
You're real and you read?<eos> Though I find the political bias in your paper's editorial - not entirely to my taste. - I'll pass that on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Who are these gentlemen?<eos> - They're... I don't actually know.
It'll hold for at least ten minutes.<eos> The people will panic, yes.<eos> But what about the world leaders?<eos> The presidents and kings, the prime ministers and generals?<eos> What will they do?
It's a good plan, I like it.<eos> How come our side never gets plans like that?<eos> The humans have no plan at all.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> They have the same plan they always have.
So, no weekend getaway huh, Christian?<eos> I need you to turn around, put your hands behind your back.<eos> Just the two of you?<eos> Angela Lange, also known as Lynx, you are under arrest for the theft and illegal sale of over $14 million dollars of impounded contraband and the murder of four DEA agents.<eos> You think they were clean?
I know you said I couldn't do this anymore, but I need to talk to you.<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> - About what I have to do.<eos> You're gonna turn yourself in, aren't you?<eos> Louis, the jury didn't come back, and since they went home, I'm going home.
I'm the victim.<eos> Today you are.<eos> But the people who victimized you?<eos> Those nutjobs?<eos> They go after two types of people-- pedophiles and money launderers.
That's a big negative, Team Leader.<eos> Target is southbound in a festive black sedan.<eos> Suggest you break off current engagement.<eos> All teams, continuous fire for 15 seconds, and then full withdrawal.<eos> What are they doing?
They're gonna get the tires. Hang on.<eos> Liz, what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Give me that.<eos> Get down!<eos> - Where'd they go?
Eric Tanner's return has to be a display of acceptance on our part.<eos> Our families...<eos> This isn't San Francisco.<eos> Nobody is trying to deal with having a gay kid on a sports team.<eos> We start calling those people out as homophobes, they start to pivot.
Please make sure it doesn't turn out like the last one.<eos> - No, come on, I know these guys.<eos> - You said you knew the last ones too.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - Babak, what do they do?
-Really? But you're a girl. -Mmm-hmm.<eos> Girls can like trucks.<eos> Well, I don't know any girls who like trucks.<eos> My brothers don't even like trucks.<eos> - What are they doing?
'Cause Jane's the first real lead we've had in years.<eos> The safety and security of this entire nation hangs in the balance.<eos> You want vengeance for Mayfair?<eos> Then you want Sandstorm.<eos> They're the ones that did this... not Jane.
Your colleagues, the FBI, they're into some very, very terrible things.<eos> No... they're good people and they are my friends.<eos> Friends don't imprison you.<eos> Friends don't let the CIA capture you and torture you.<eos> They had nothing to do with this.
This place has an airstrip?<eos> The mining companies built it back in the '80s before they moved out.<eos> That's when the pirates moved in.<eos> This island is basically a safe port if the waters get too rough for them.<eos> But they use it too inconsistently for the government to really do anything about it.
How many of them are there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's more coming!<eos> It's the passengers.<eos> What are they doing? !
I don't know.<eos> There's more coming!<eos> It's the passengers.<eos> What are they doing? !<eos> They're gonna get themselves killed.
And if I can, I wanna protect the people you care about too.<eos> But I'm the good cop, and the bad cops, they're not so concerned about that part.<eos> What, bad cops?<eos> You left very strict instructions... the possibility that you'd be an unwilling participant with something you've accounted for.<eos> The people we work with, they'll stop at nothing to make sure this plan succeeds.
So there were three guys in the truck.<eos> Check that out.<eos> "Atropine and pralidoxime... for use in nerve agent poisoning."<eos> It's the antidote for sarin gas.<eos> So they were transporting chemical weapons.
Mayfair's reaching out to his office right now.<eos> You got anything on the victims?<eos> Yoo Jin Lee, Young Park, and Min Ha Cho.<eos> All South Korean Nationals, clean criminal records.<eos> - Did they work at the CMA?
Yoo Jin Lee, Young Park, and Min Ha Cho.<eos> All South Korean Nationals, clean criminal records.<eos> - Did they work at the CMA?<eos> - No.<eos> So where did they get sarin from?
- No.<eos> So where did they get sarin from?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> I'm building out the Koreans' known associates here and abroad.<eos> How'd they get in the country?
You sure you're still okay with this?<eos> We can't risk tipping these guys off.<eos> It needs to be a simultaneous takedown.<eos> If we only get one, we risk the other one setting off the sarin.<eos> We have no idea where they are in the building.
I sat in this very room and I was all alone.<eos> I didn't know where I was or how I got here.<eos> All I wanted was to go home.<eos> I want you to know that you can trust us.<eos> These people, they've been helping me.
And while you will be special agents when you graduate, in a way, you'll still be trainees with a whole lot of learning ahead.<eos> You're gonna have to make tough choices.<eos> It's not about your son, Mr. Haas.<eos> It's about my parents.<eos> They're alive.
I want your permission to do what I need to do.<eos> Well, if, uh, "Do what I need to do," means what I think it means, then the answer to that, you know very well.<eos> That's a long conversation with our friends at Jimenez.<eos> That's a long, long conversation.<eos> Just like they couldn't do what I think you are talking about to you while you are under my protection.
Volleyball team.<eos> Our children are on that plane.<eos> My daughter Emily and her teammates.<eos> There's eight students and two chaperones.<eos> They can't possibly be involved.
In the last 24 hours, they've all shown up at Chicago Med flooded with chemo.<eos> Dani's dead, and the other three are in comas.<eos> Uh... They teach you... a lot about the body in medical school, but what they don't spend enough time on is teaching you how to deal with loss.<eos> You get attached to your patients.<eos> They're fighters, and you fight with them, but with oncology, you rarely win.
- But we're married.<eos> Just 'cause you're tied to the fence doesn't mean you can't bark at the cars.<eos> Ooh, those are your matches.<eos> Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to take a look.<eos> Oh, my God, they're all so old.
We'll never make it if we stick together. I'll hold them here.<eos> You get them back safely.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - We're not splitting up.<eos> - It's me they want.
And once we blow the power they have going into that place their defenses will be cut in half. - Half!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And that's it.<eos> That's our moment.<eos> We will spill in there like a million insects from everywhere at once, and we will kill those things like they have been killing us for three years, without mercy!
You just have to call, it's all set.<eos> You think I'm gonna leave my job here?<eos> So that what?<eos> Your... your cronies can call in favors?<eos> They're coming for you!
You went off the reservation, stuck your nose in federal shit!<eos> Are you actually worried about me?<eos> Actually?<eos> Or are you just disappointed I'm not using this to line my pockets?<eos> They're gonna find some way to fuck you up.
He fell asleep?<eos> That's what I told the kids.<eos> You were trying to protect them.<eos> I keep trying to save them.<eos> They keep dying. Over and over.
It's pretty straightforward.<eos> How does it work when you do it?<eos> Oh, I'm pretty sure it's the same.<eos> I... ask them what they want.<eos> They tell me.
Red and Bobby. Excuse me?<eos> There were two guards that worked for me at Quitman.<eos> I took them there hunting a couple times.<eos> They knew where this land was.<eos> They must have buried him there.
Now, those fellers might not seem the sharpest shivs in Heaven's shed, but still, I mean, you said they were bloody angels.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> And I don't know how it works, but don't...<eos> I don't know...<eos> don't they outrank you?
Much like Krypton, this planet is on the verge of ecological destruction.<eos> I can stop it.<eos> But the humans won't like my methods.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> They trust you.
But then you made the mistake of coming back.<eos> I'm a property owner doing business in my old neighborhood.<eos> Ain't no law against that.<eos> You do realize people aren't afraid of you anymore, and they will come forward now.<eos> And where are they?
I'm still getting stamps.<eos> Look to your left.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm hiding.<eos> They're here.
- Titan.<eos> You know about it?<eos> I know that the search for Titan only leads to death.<eos> Your friends... their rage is blinding.<eos> You need to see what they can't.
Now is not the time to be resting on our laurels.<eos> No, time for a re-up, corner kids.<eos> - Yeah! - Yeah.<eos> Tonight's mission...<eos> They're here.
I went to Northwestern.<eos> Northwestern? What the fuck are you doing here? Didn't work out.<eos> I guess.<eos> But he said it wasn't his drugs. Ma'am, they all say that. I mean, look around here.<eos> All these guys in here, they all say it's not their drugs. But he wouldn't lie to me. He said they weren't his.
You got to think of something else!<eos> - What do we do?<eos> - Well, I don't know.<eos> Our friends are basically 8-year-old girls.<eos> What would they want to do?
Or your hundreds of cameras?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> We blew up your surveillance system.<eos> Now do you ever think maybe this is all just a waste?<eos> We keep killing each other, and that's exactly what they want.
Helen?<eos> Maggie.<eos> Why are you out here and not with Natalie?<eos> Oh, um, her... her parents flew in from Seattle, so...<eos> they're in there with her.
No.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't always like this.<eos> I remember back when I was teaching high school, I started noticing a change after 9/11.<eos> The president came on the television. And started talking about keeping americans safe, And suddenly all the students were repeating it.<eos> And these current students, they're... They're even younger, and... And they've grown up.
Okay, if you say it's for the greater good, I am gonna punch you.<eos> You accompanied me once to my former residence in London, 221B.<eos> Did I ever tell you about the people in 221A?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't like having me for a neighbor, either.
I am great.<eos> I don't know how people live out here;<eos> there's nothing to do.<eos> You're on a bus with an Xbox.<eos> - Yeah, but they don't have Xboxes.
Your job is to upsell the bereaved.<eos> You got that covered?<eos> Yeah, for the most part.<eos> I can remember coffin models and prices like it's the days of the week, but when clients come in from before, I'm lost.<eos> They seem to know me, but I have no clue who they are.
Gator, tell the OOD to get us closer.<eos> - Roger. - Any sign of those other two ships?<eos> - No, sir. - It's been five hours.<eos> They could be long gone by now.<eos> Who are they?
Do you mean, uh, one of those homeless guys that Amanda lets stay at their house?<eos> Stay at her house?<eos> Careful, Gabe.<eos> We can check that out with her parents.<eos> If they don't back you up...
He'll know I betrayed him.<eos> If you don't help us, the devil will take him.<eos> Forever.<eos> Get me the money or it's on you.<eos> So, do you think the people who work for Dwight know he's Wesen, or do they actually think he's possessed by the devil too?
Forever.<eos> Get me the money or it's on you.<eos> So, do you think the people who work for Dwight know he's Wesen, or do they actually think he's possessed by the devil too?<eos> Bodyguards we interrogated said that he was a prophet.<eos> I think they're believers.
Fuck it!<eos> - I'm so fucked!<eos> - Surely it's not a bad as all that?<eos> I owe a shitload of money! Money I don't have.<eos> These guys... they're gonna kill me.
I don't think they meant for that to happen, 'cause they pulled their masks down and I heard one of them say he needed more gas.<eos> You saw their faces?<eos> The lights were on, but... my covers were up enough that they didn't see me, so I pretended to be asleep and eventually I passed out again.<eos> I didn't wake up until this morning.<eos> Were you awake when they...
Ruth... you and I have done some very questionable things in the service of this country, but there is a line.<eos> You show me that line when those beasts invade your home, attack Willa, your children.<eos> Hunters have not only promised to shed blood, they've made good on that promise, on domestic soil, no less.<eos> And if we don't stop those things now, God only knows how far they'll go.<eos> They are not the only ones to have shed blood.
Agent Briggs, you wrote that Agent Regan appeared to be a willing passenger in Musa's helicopter.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I know you killed my parents.<eos> Is that what the humans told you?<eos> Are they still alive?
We don't negotiate with animals.<eos> That's probably what they say about us.<eos> You would know.<eos> - Our people are gonna die.<eos> - They won't be the first.
Do take care of the house.<eos> We will.<eos> Between you and I, it's my favorite property.<eos> And don't let the neighbors bother you.<eos> Why do they throw a lot of crazy parties?
We will.<eos> Between you and I, it's my favorite property.<eos> And don't let the neighbors bother you.<eos> Why do they throw a lot of crazy parties?<eos> No, they keep to themselves.
He was just a baby.<eos> I didn't know him at all.<eos> You know it's funny.<eos> A lot of time when people find out that I lost my mom, they try to be sympathetic.<eos> But I know that for the most part they don't get it.
Okay, so the question is now where's Rudnick's body?<eos> Hey, dogs are on to something.<eos> Car's locked, Lieutenant.<eos> Open it.<eos> Where are they?
No.<eos> It's not.<eos> You don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> At least the people online, you know, they're-they're honest, you know.<eos> They-they know that I'm not gonna just snap back and be the person that I was before.
Have a seat.<eos> Actually, Monsieur Emerson, if I could just have a word with you in private, s'il vous plait?<eos> Sure.<eos> Jean-Luc, did you bring these men here?<eos> Oh, yeah. They're with me.
Look at all these people.<eos> Exercising in the middle of the day, drinking their free-range, cold-pressed nut juice.<eos> I mean, don't they have jobs?
What the hell does that mean?<eos> You've given almost your whole life to your country, to your people.<eos> It's time.<eos> It's time for you to come home.<eos> And they're waiting for you.
You know, it doesn't matter, you can't go.<eos> I can and I am.<eos> Well, we need you.<eos> You might.<eos> They don't.
Okay, Ms. Paige?<eos> There are three people outside.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, what do they want?
Listen to me.<eos> I want you to go try to get in the house, find a phone and call for help.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Try to shoot them before they shoot us.
Businessmen, cops.<eos> Hey, salary's about 100 grand a year.<eos> How much?<eos> I am dead serious, okay?<eos> Aldermen... they get to vote on where contracts go, what laws get passed.
That Aridity thing.<eos> That's what we do to Company pigs.<eos> Look. We're Killjoys.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> They're with me, Tighmon.
And then my neighbor... asked me why I was walking so weird.<eos> It was subtle at first, but then I noticed it, too.<eos> My gait has changed.<eos> I-I've been to doctors and specialists.<eos> They just... they just don't know what it is.
It was subtle at first, but then I noticed it, too.<eos> My gait has changed.<eos> I-I've been to doctors and specialists.<eos> They just... they just don't know what it is.<eos> In fact, they don't think it's anything.
Law enforcement.<eos> Experts in their fields.<eos> And...<eos> I'm not sure what you want me to say.<eos> CEOs of Silicon Valley's 14 biggest companies... don't they serve on the steering committee too?
It's the northcliffs. -Bedroom's clear!<eos> -Kitchen's clear!<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Dad?<eos> Where are they?
One of you has to die.<eos> Those are the rules.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> That's the same question I asked my parents<eos> When they would rip me away from my twin sister --
- she was making.<eos> - Yeah, El loves purses.<eos> Mm. Then Agent Devereaux...<eos> the FBI agent... uh, the questions he had about Alicia, working with her... uh, my rich friends.<eos> Your rich friends, who are they... donors?
Pe...<eos> You're in love.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Not the other ones.<eos> No, the other prisoners, I helped them. They helped me.
- I can't help but feel responsible...<eos> - Thank you, but I didn't trade Gideon for General Gaghan out of the goodness of my heart.<eos> Gentlemen, please.<eos> I need my very best military men around me.<eos> And they cost a lot more than the mercenaries that you will require.
Uh, my dad had a drinking problem.<eos> But every family has their problems.<eos> It was nothing, uh, extraordinary.<eos> It was ordinary.<eos> You know, they both tried.
Chandler's the acting head of our military, and he never would have allowed it.<eos> Captain Chandler is 12,000 miles away.<eos> The regional leaders need to be able to call their own shots.<eos> If they can't control their own regions, who will?<eos> They're the ones stoking the unrest.
Okay.<eos> Okay, this is getting a little weird.<eos> You knew I'd be here because of the calendar App.<eos> Well, yeah, but I'm here because I was invited.<eos> I'm psyched to meet these people, and, to be honest, they are excited to meet me.
You're a witness.<eos> You saw my face.<eos> But I want to help you.<eos> We cannot waste time.<eos> Listen to me, they're on their way.
Who my husband is?<eos> You know our names, our reputations are of the utmost importance.<eos> So when you come into my town and accuse my men of having something to do with this, this is why you're here in front of me.<eos> No.<eos> I'm here because your man made a deal with my brothers, and now they're dead.
Hi, David.<eos> we can decide it's never too late to change.<eos> These people don't have that chance.<eos> They left it to you.<eos> They let you learn from them.
Chase, we gotta get out of here.<eos> There's fucking Zs everywhere, man.<eos> We're not going anywhere until I get what you promised me.<eos> You said your guys would be here.<eos> Where are they?
-Right there!<eos> -Where?<eos> No, I don't like rats.<eos> -Where?<eos> -Where is it?
Run!<eos> Down with Vortigern!<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> I wasn't controlling it.<eos> It was controlling me. I can't even remember what happened.
I'm OK, I want to steal that bank.<eos> It's a good place to hack it like anywhere else.<eos> Well, how do we start?<eos> Contact the man who deals with him My previous month.<eos> Why will it help us?
- Lisa?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay. I'm in a cave.<eos> The shark almost got me.<eos> Where is it now?
Fucking beer everywhere.<eos> It wasn't Jeff's fault.<eos> The stop sign on the corner had been knocked down earlier in the night.<eos> I don't know. The cops thought it was Jeff's fault, I guess.<eos> But it was already down.
The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.<eos> The voice you hear in your head...<eos> I imagine I know who it sounds like, as I know Eleanor wanted those things.
You have to believe me.<eos> That night at the pier, where did you hide it?<eos> The wire, where did you hide it?<eos> My daughter's inside.<eos> Harlee, where was it?
Harlee, where was it?<eos> This is not the time or the place.<eos> God!<eos> Tell me.<eos> Where was it?
That can prove very dangerous.<eos> What's dangerous is allowing you to go on killing with impunity.<eos> Now, let her go.<eos> Where is the key?<eos> Where is it? I have it.
It's my handwriting.<eos> "It's true, H.G., don't be daft."<eos> Believe it.<eos> I wrote this, but...<eos> This symbol, what does it mean?
I found proof that Zach didn't kill the lobbyist.<eos> Okay. I'm not gonna ask when you found time to do this, but what did you find?<eos> I was looking at the lobbyist's rib.<eos> I was with Dr. Brennan when she analyzed that; she found nothing.<eos> Within one of the stab wounds, I found the microbial signature of the killer and it is not a match for Zach.
Allow me.<eos> Y'know, they say a nice watch band Is as important as the watch.<eos> That's what I get for cheapin' out.<eos> We'll find it for you.<eos> Where the heck is it?
Where is the Soul-Sword?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Our interrogation techniques have improved since you were one of us.<eos> You can torture me all you want.<eos> I don't know where it is.
You didn't want me to know that you didn't want me.<eos> No, you're right, I...<eos> I didn't want children.<eos> But if there's one thing my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that time often doesn't provide us with what we want.<eos> But it... it's quite adept at giving us what we need.
Would've given us time to find a cure.<eos> Jim didn't have to kill him.<eos> Cure?<eos> This virus isn't the disease.<eos> It's the antidote.
But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.
He's a total fraud.<eos> He's not even a scientist.<eos> And I'm sure you couldn't even remember an ATM code if you tried.<eos> All those... all those numbers.<eos> It's only four digits.
I'm going to give you an understanding of what you've become.<eos> You've had a powerful, traumatic awakening, just as I did.<eos> My true self sprang forth at the moment of my death.<eos> Along with hell and eternal suffering.<eos> I'm as much a part of my psychic dimension as it is of me.
This is Dean's other other cell, so you must know what to do.<eos> Dean, call me.<eos> We've got a problem.<eos> Hello, Mary.<eos> Your hand print doesn't open this room because it's not for you.
It's begun.<eos> I'm piped into the FAA network.<eos> Control centers at SeaTac, Vancouver, Anchorage...<eos> No sign of our plane. Nothing.<eos> It didn't just disappear.
Since his tragic death,<eos> Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.<eos> Quantum computing's a pipe dream.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's real.
But you... You're a Blossom, through and through.<eos> Okay. One more thing before you go to the dance.<eos> Nana Blossom's ring...<eos> It's not in my jewelry box, it's not with Polly.<eos> Where is it?
- Thanks.<eos> I'm pretty sure you saved my life.<eos> - That was my goal.<eos> - I know I had a gun with me.<eos> Where is it?
It's extremely fortunate that you were.<eos> It was awful.<eos> You think you'd get used to the sound of men yelling, but you never do.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mrs Marsh.<eos> His sight, it... It will come back, won't it?
I'm not sad, I'm happy.<eos> Look at the garden, Patrick.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> There'll be so much space for the little ones to run around in.<eos> Ah, it's certainly big enough.
Based on what's happened before this time it feels different.<eos> Someone new could be behind it.<eos> - Is that the vaccine simulation? - Mm-hm.<eos> The infected are exhibiting different traits this time around.<eos> I'm attempting to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the base of the infection.
And I was just talking to them. About the music video idea.<eos> Yes. With video, people do the marketing for you, right?<eos> They tweet about it.<eos> They post it on facebook.<eos> But it has to be distinctive.
Hadn't heard from you.<eos> So I thought I'd check in.<eos> How are things going? What are you up to today?<eos> I'm sitting here outside my old house.<eos> And it looks exactly the same.
So Renard knows about the symbols?<eos> Apparently, Diana drew them when she was with him.<eos> What else does he know?<eos> He knows about the tunnel.<eos> He just doesn't know where it is.
So long story short, we just have to destroy the Destroyer dude, or we're toast.<eos> There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that's bothering me.<eos> It was completely cracked up, as if it had been put back together by a lot of different pieces, and not one of all of these texts references anything like that.<eos> Yeah, something bothers me about it too.<eos> I mean, if it's as all-powerful as it's supposed to be and belonged to all the people it supposedly belonged to...
Ask any cop. Sometimes there's a...<eos> A shiver runs up your spine, and you have to pay attention to that.<eos> But I've never loved anyone the way that I love Gus.<eos> And the... the idea of never seeing him again makes me sick to my stomach, and I...<eos> Which is why, once you've identified your instinct, then you've gotta try and figure out where it came from in the first place and see if you can better explain yourself to Gus.
Someone wants this $300,000 worth of drugs.<eos> Any word from wes?<eos> No, ma'am, but there is some good news.<eos> According to the manufacturer, The gps beacon we found only sends out a live signal.<eos> So even if it doesn't remember where it's been, If you're tracking the beacon online, You can find its location.
I swear.<eos> Kyle...<eos> Kyle! Where in the Holy Hell do you think you're going?<eos> We're done here.<eos> That... woman just told us Sidney has a partner, and she damn sure knows who it is.
Let's go! Let's go!<eos> No!<eos> No! - No! No!<eos> - The painting.<eos> Where is it?
He's charming.<eos> Do you mind if we join?<eos> Yeah, let's sit here.<eos> Kara, I appreciate the rescue,<eos> - but it's not necessary.
- Why?<eos> Those pods, what's in them?<eos> - I got it wrong.<eos> I got it very, very wrong.<eos> The colony ship isn't on the way, it's right here.
Nah. It's probably The Purge.<eos> Congratulations, Red.<eos> You got me.<eos> Oh, did Mommy not tell you about her secret plan?<eos> What was it again, comrade?
I need to get back to my son.<eos> I didn't want to leave my son today, either.<eos> But I left him, bleeding in the hospital.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because until you kill the monster, it'll keep coming back.
What is this Space Invaders shit?<eos> Clearly not.<eos> Right, full power for the Isn't again.<eos> Electric ain't for engines.<eos> It's for lights and chairs.
Now, for this to be a proper Alfa Romeo, there must be...<eos> something wrong with it.<eos> Think about it.<eos> A person who's kind to his mother and punctual and sober and well-dressed, he's an Audi. And nobody wants a friend like that.<eos> If you're going to form a relationship with a car, if you're gonna develop a bond, it's got to have human qualities.
You killed them all. And now they're gonna kill you.<eos> I didn't know about Praimfaya.<eos> You can tell them that.<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone. The sword doesn't care what you meant.<eos> It just cuts.
"Now is the winter of our discontent."<eos> Washington's men are encamped at Valley Forge where they have been overcome with a sense of dread foreboding.<eos> I was called to the camp because the general believed a malevolent force was behind this disquiet.<eos> The British had loosed upon us a monster that fed off raw human despair.<eos> The way it operated was to capture a single soldier and then imprison his soul.
Stephanie Borden. Yeah.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> - I need a Danish dough whisk.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm staying at Grey House and I found an interesting recipe, but it calls for a Danish dough whisk and Cassie said you might have one.
This issue, if not dealt with, will tear this new union apart.<eos> Good day to you, Mr. Crane.<eos> This was surprisingly pleasurable.<eos> Safe journeys from whence you came.<eos> So, if this ward was built by Banneker and it is able to deter the Horseman, what else was in his arsenal?
Or worse.<eos> Then Syd came.<eos> She woke me up.<eos> The monster realized it couldn't hide anymore.<eos> And it...
Dreyfuss won't rest until he's got his hands on the gun.<eos> Until he's used it.<eos> What happens when he does? You know.<eos> You have to know.<eos> That gun, when you fire it, it raises the Horseman of War.
Roman soldiers don't run, and we did.<eos> What?<eos> They're underground, by the river.<eos> There's a carving of a fish.<eos> Is that it?
Someone who walks in the laws of darkness, pride, idolatry.<eos> Kingsley.<eos> Voda.<eos> I've been thinking about Article 9 and how it relates to you.<eos> And it commands its leaders to "provide for all of the wants of the Church according to their abilities."
That leaves four nights between the seven of you.<eos> - Phil won't do one.<eos> - He will.<eos> He didn't know Mam was dying, but he knows now and he will.<eos> Just when you need a miracle, it happens.
So when I'm not home,<eos> - thank yourself. - Hey, guys!<eos> Guys! I'm buying a car!<eos> Two great features are the intelligent four-wheel drive and the foot-activated lift gate. Wow.<eos> So you just put your foot right there in back and it does whatever you want.
You've got five minutes before we take him into custody.<eos> Make them count.<eos> Pay attention. This is real.<eos> There's a cab in Lower Manhattan with liquid sarin in it.<eos> It's in a duffel bag.
In response to Project Blue Book, an academic committee was formed in 1953 called the Robertson panel.<eos> Comprised of some of the most respected physicists and astronomers of the day, the Robertson panel was tasked with providing a fair and independent academic analysis of the UFO case files.<eos> And in this document it says point blank, that the people who are on this committee are answering and working with the CIA, but that can't be disclosed.<eos> And these are esteemed scientists in academic university settings.<eos> It says point blank. When there's a very strong piece of evidence, we need to set up something so we release certain type of balloons, and film it so that it will look like that, to sort of debunk it.
I don't love the whole tea thing.<eos> Mitchell and Haley always come back giggling over shared secrets, and I feel left out.<eos> I once tried to start my own uncle-niece tradition, but...<eos> I'm not questioning the methodology behind accelerated mass spectrometry.<eos> I'm merely pointing out that it's not singular in its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass.
Okay, so you're saying that we can remove that without-without setting off this bomb?<eos> Yes. But there is another issue.<eos> That canister holding the uranium is lead-lined.<eos> Right now it's protecting you.<eos> It's the only thing protecting you from the radiation.
You know what?<eos> I'll, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor.<eos> You can eat the bacon, baby.<eos> I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol.<eos> Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention.
You know, I actually met our new neighbors.<eos> The husband, anyway.<eos> His name is Dean.<eos> And guess what?<eos> He offered to fix our fence and pay for it.
Okay, so, tomorrow, two sets,<eos> Breezewoods Country Club.<eos> That is where Otto and I went on our third date, when he got me that huge diamond.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, but when he found out that it was a blood diamond and a little kid's fingers were cut off in order to get it, he hawked it, and he sent the money back to Africa to build an orphanage.
-DO HOUSES FLY?<eos> -I HAD TO LEARN, LOLA...<eos> We see a bird flying as something without a purpose.<eos> But for the bird, it is every purpose.<eos> It is looking for something.
We see a bird flying as something without a purpose.<eos> But for the bird, it is every purpose.<eos> It is looking for something.<eos> It is not just fluttering, hovering.<eos> No, it is going somewhere.
Woman?<eos> Scalpel!<eos> Inside the trans movement there are people who are clearly fascists.<eos> How do you see this fascism?<eos> Or how does it show?
- Aw, you don't have to thank me, Rachel.<eos> All I want is for your wedding to be exactly what you want.<eos> - And what I want is gonna take some time, because, Dad, you were right.<eos> I want to... enjoy it and make time for it.<eos> So Mike and I are gonna set a date, but it's not gonna be for a while.
Today, most kids would rather play basketball or football.<eos> Do anything but get in the ring.<eos> You can't play boxing.<eos> It's not a game.<eos> It's a test... of how much you can hit... without being hit.
Losing a president is like... It's like losing a father.<eos> And you were a mother to all of us, and that's a very good story.<eos> The entire country watched the funeral from beginning to end.<eos> Decades from now, people will remember your dignity and the majesty.<eos> It will serve a definite purpose.
BY Who?<eos> By me. Teaching 'em mad skills, yo.<eos> For real?<eos> Well, I got a question for you.<eos> The Mara Salvatrucha sign, where's it come from?
No. I was at a concert... and then on the side of the stage there was this... like, a two legged rabbit.<eos> I don't know what part in that I play.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen.<eos> I would move... and then it would mimic everything I was doing.
A world, where wishes are granted<eos> All of us must know For, an incredible stream of love runs in every heart<eos> Could there be such a star somewhere in the vast blue skies?<eos> In the vast ocean that the sky is, I have travelled in a boat that the moon is<eos> If you are looking for a beautiful world, it is right here
Homeland Security?<eos> Mmm. No, no, no... ma'am.<eos> Planetary Security.<eos> The fragment is of a radio active Xeno mineral<eos> We suspected it might have bio interactions, so, we took the sample to AMRIID. Where they keep the remains of the Kryptonian decedent.
I was told you were as well, Mr. Bouchard.<eos> So tell me:<eos> - What do you think he's doing?<eos> - What do you think you are doing?<eos> I brought you the pointer, and now it's gone.
We have to stop them.<eos> You can't keep living like this, BFG.<eos> BFG, what did you do with my blanket?<eos> I thought you had it there.<eos> Where is it, in my other... - In the cape?
There we go.<eos> - Glass of wine?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> I didn't recognize the car.<eos> Whose is it?
How?<eos> Please advise.<eos> There's a master switch to the base of the Comm tower.<eos> Master switch, describe, what are we looking for?<eos> What does it look like, the master switch?
Hey, pal, what can I do you for?<eos> Free drinks.<eos> What do you have?<eos> Hey, Chet? Chet?<eos> Amelia's film, where is it?
Why am I here?<eos> Because you and your buddy Dr. Stockman found something of mine.<eos> The teleportation device.<eos> The teleport was supposed to break me out of prison.<eos> But it is capable of so much more.
The night Naz was arrested, he lost a lot.<eos> He lost his freedom to return home to his family, to his school, to his night job that helps pay for that school.<eos> But what he didn't lose, and what none of us can lose, were his Constitutional rights to an attorney, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his peers, and to the presumption of his innocence<eos> We hear that term a lot.<eos> But what does it really mean, huh?
Pigs get fat... but hogs... get slaughtered.<eos> This was all about you.<eos> You know what?<eos> You always stay ready with a plan, bitch.<eos> So what is it?
If you have info, please share it.<eos> Yesterday's "council of experts"... were too baffled to conclude anything.<eos> Hazama, Johoku University biologist ,<eos> Hazama, Johoku University biologist I put together a simple profile.<eos> It's shown us 3 configurations.
I wanna be the solution for something.<eos> You know what this is?<eos> It's a tomato.<eos> First it was a seed.<eos> You take care of a garden and it takes care of you back.
But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.<eos> Over the centuries, we've tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that plagues Gotham, only for it to start up again.
- Exactly.<eos> Jay, did you find anyone else associated with this Project Volt?<eos> Would you stop trying to connect dots that don't exist?<eos> Actually, Carrie, I did find a list of professors and scientists linked to the project, so, yeah.<eos> Look, I just think we should consider the possibility that someone rebooted this program and made it operational, and somehow you might be involved.
Guys, am I not speaking English here?<eos> What the hell is a squat cobbler?<eos> ! It's when a man sits in pie!<eos> He sits in a pie! And he... he wiggles around.<eos> Maybe it's like hellmann's mayonnaise. It has a different name west of the rockies. I don't know.
Everything and anything in her power, I imagine, up to and including walking out in the middle of the road ahead of us to be run over by your horses in the hope of slowing you down for even a moment.<eos> It is fascinating to me how stubbornly you people expect the unlikeliest of outcomes because you prefer them.<eos> You expect the world to become what you want it to be despite all available evidence and experience to the contrary.<eos> This was not the way I'd hoped this affair would play out.<eos> But I can assure you it is most certainly not going to play out the way you hope it will either, because even to stand in the road ahead of us, she would have to know which road to stand in.
Very pretty, but a bit melancholy.<eos> Leonard says it's the poignancy of life:<eos> and not only do we have to embrace it's meaninglessness... but celebrate life because it has no meaning.<eos> It's too deep for me but Mom always boils it down to...<eos> "Live every day like it's your last.
Cornea burns, unable to handle the light's intensity.<eos> And you temporarily lose your vision.<eos> The theory... pain is only psychological since the retina has no pain receptors.<eos> This particular model was built by Homeland Security to torture prisoners after 9/11.<eos> Unfortunately, it was banned... after some of those fuckers went blind for good.
You know what I love about the ocean?<eos> I love how it doesn't give a flying fuck about you.<eos> I get that.<eos> It'll swallow you up.<eos> It's big, you're small.
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.<eos> Oh, these talks.<eos> I don't know if they help or hurt.<eos> Do you ever wish you could forget?<eos> This pain... it's all I have left of him.
They might've caught the murderer<eos> Which of course is... brilliant<eos> Did you notice anything unusual on the ship?<eos> Yes, there was this strange guy, and this one time, he was taking this photo of this dead bird.<eos> What the hell's it called?
She was capable of terrible things, but she chose to do good.<eos> Well, ever since she found you, at least.<eos> I watched her die 12,483 times in the seconds before she expired.<eos> I couldn't save her, but I kept trying.<eos> You can't conceive of my grief because you can't experience it like I do, but it's there.
You're all right.<eos> It's just if you're talking, you ain't listening.<eos> You hear the wind?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's gonna lead us right to them.
I'm down.<eos> You're just listening to the wrong voice.<eos> It's what I like to call the prisoner's dilemma.<eos> No, you don't like to call it that.<eos> That's what it's called.
You know, you're wondering whether I'm still "the liquor".<eos> No. Guess what? I'm on top of the liquor.<eos> I am the monkey in charge of bananas.<eos> What's my secret? This little device right here.<eos> I just take a little blow... (Blowing) (Electronic beep) and it tells me when it's time for a little top-up.
Carl Emerson, I have a message for your leader.<eos> I will not stop until my people are free.<eos> If you don't let them go, I will irradiate level 5.<eos> We all have pain.<eos> Some of it is physical.
What happened?<eos> I blew a read.<eos> Badly.<eos> And I know the reason wasn't in the numbers.<eos> It was in here.
The £50 this place takes in.<eos> You're suggesting this was a robbery?<eos> I don't believe anything without evidence.<eos> Sister Fabian kept everything in here.<eos> Unfortunately, she had the only key and I have no idea where it is.
He was a mathamagician. (groans, sighs)<eos> Mathlete.<eos> But your reactor's cold.<eos> Uh, I stand corrected.<eos> Uh, in fact, we, uh, had 200 fuel assemblies In the reactor, but now it's empty.
Okay, 5pm at the station then.<eos> You can use the hotel car, right?<eos> Hey have you seen my hat?<eos> Your hat?<eos> I wonder where it is.
You're the critical part.<eos> I've got 800 years to find balance.<eos> We need to help Mason right now.<eos> I need my sword.<eos> It was forged with a unique power.
So the fact that it went missing the day I told you what I did that's just a coincidence?<eos> I suppose it is.<eos> Hanna, the police haven't come knocking with a warrant.<eos> The only person who suspects that backup drive is in this house is you.<eos> Mom, just tell me where it is.
Probably from under one of these piles.<eos> Well, help me find it.<eos> I've got to call Mallory back.<eos> -I can't remember her number. -Oh.<eos> Where is it?
No, I couldn't possibly!<eos> Boy. Boy, come here.<eos> You look like a sweet lad.<eos> May I ask you to run this letter in through that door, drop it on the big desk just inside, and then run back out?<eos> Who's it for?
Look... there was a boy... and his father bought him a falcon for his sixth birthday.<eos> Are you seriously telling me a story right now?<eos> Please, just listen.<eos> His father told him to tame the bird.<eos> Make it obedient.
- Bye.<eos> - Could fly with my feet.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Okay, bye.<eos> So, I am 100% certain that a finger will not float, but I'm glancing into the water, so he won't freak out, and there it is.
The outside door is locked.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> I hear the tiniest little splash and here it comes.
It's the responsibility of the eldest son.<eos> The hospital releases the body to the families so that they can wash and prepare the body for cremation.<eos> That's it.<eos> We thought the festival was the trigger. It wasn't.<eos> It was an opportunity.
"Transfer succeed"<eos> "November 2014"<eos> Time, really is something fearful.<eos> It can heal everything<eos> No matter they're good or bad memories, it will shave them away. Leaving to us blurry scars.
Yes, yes.<eos> Last autumn, your tailor made you a suit in this material.<eos> Do you remember it?<eos> Hmm, yes, I do. Yes.<eos> Where is it?
Both keys must be turned simultaneously or the alarm will sound.<eos> That way a thief can't pick the lock without setting off the alarm.<eos> Our lad picked the lock then, did he?<eos> He must have.<eos> I'm the only one with the key and it never leaves my pocket.
- Me?<eos> You're the freak watching your husband read a book.<eos> I set up a hidden camera to see what he's up to.<eos> Do all the rooms have cameras?<eos> Because sometimes I sit when I clean the TV remote and it accidentally turns on.
Yes. I understand.<eos> Is her hair still natural?<eos> She relaxed it.<eos> She used flat irons for a while and, erm... then she had a... erm, a treatment.<eos> What's it called?
So, look at the vent.<eos> Okay, pick a spot and focus on it, and see if you can melt it.<eos> And a bird hit me when I was flying.<eos> No, you... you hit it.<eos> No, it hit me.
Ah, the drawing, the crest, it means that you were in a certain Fillorian castle.<eos> - Kill me.<eos> - It was built by dwarves.<eos> Ah, okay, let's not get caught up in the details.<eos> The... the point is that the... it's full of a... a ton of incredibly magical shit.
Natalya should never have known what I was.<eos> I thought love was enough.<eos> This secret...<eos> It doesn't protect us.<eos> It kills us.
Broadway, fashion week, his criminal trial.<eos> My father got me front-row seats to the "Inability to Love" awards.<eos> I'll try and let this go, but I'm just saying, we could have gone to the Taste of Bushwick, and we'd still be closer to the court.<eos> Oh, I love the taste of Bushwick.<eos> I don't care for it much.
Yeah.<eos> It's ours.<eos> And it's highly classified.<eos> It's a mega rodent, a rat on steroids.<eos> It-- it lets us take remote control of any system on a network.
- And ZIP was part of it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So there's got to be a connection.<eos> Well, ZIP isn't a rare drug, but until your case,<eos> I'd never seen it used in such high doses.
Do you know where your family is?<eos> What's the extent of her injuries?<eos> She had some pretty deep cuts, possibly from metal or glass.<eos> We've given her a tetanus shot as a precaution.<eos> This picture, what does it mean?
If Camila didn't have a few state troopers on her payroll...<eos> What is she gonna do with Batman?<eos> That's between them.<eos> Between us, I've got a plan for a future.<eos> And it doesn't include getting killed by crossfire meant for you.
Classic dad deflection.<eos> "Can we have a pony?" "Well, let me think about that one."<eos> And how is that pony, huh?<eos> I haven't seen it.<eos> Where is it?
- It's Baal.<eos> - It's Baal.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> We need the Kandarian dagger.<eos> - Where is it?
Oh, Jesus.<eos> We need the Kandarian dagger.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Oh, someone confiscated it.<eos> Tell me where it is.
We've all read the latest sales agreement, yes?<eos> Actually, I don't think I was CC'd on...<eos> So I believe we can move straightforward to a vote?<eos> Actually, I'm sorry. I have an issue with, uh, section 14, paragraph two.<eos> Um, it states that Maleant has exclusive rights to purchase any appliance made by Pied Piper for the next five years.
Do I need to spell it out to you?<eos> It's a nay-no on no-Pablo.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Just so you're clear, the Necronomicon is the only way we can banish Baal back to the underworld.<eos> Nuh-uh, I got a plan for Baal, and it doesn't involve recycling Pablo into some stupid book.
The pain of your loss...<eos> I long for it.<eos> Revisit it.<eos> Open it... again and again.<eos> But it's the only thing holding me back.
But I assure you, all you will find is a nation desperate to grow and become part of the first world.<eos> Feeding your people might be a start.<eos> Mr. President, the Western allies are just curious about the energy flare that was captured over your desert recently.<eos> A kilowatt overload caused an energy arc in one of our solar turbines.<eos> It brought down that building over there.
I'm in a dream.<eos> I do not know when it began... or whose dream it was.
Should've known you'd never let them.<eos> After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert.<eos> For a little while longer, anyway.<eos> I tried to tell you the maze wasn't meant for you.<eos> It was meant for them.
Some people see the ugliness in this world.<eos> I choose to see the beauty.<eos> But beauty is a lure.<eos> We're trapped, Teddy.<eos> Lived our whole lives inside this garden, marveling at its beauty, not realizing there's an order to it, a purpose.
And now, it is time to say good-bye, old friend.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Do you know where you are, Dolores?<eos> I'm in a dream.<eos> I do not know when it began or whose dream it was.
Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?<eos> All right, it runs the A.I.<eos> And if we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we can destroy her.<eos> I know where it is.
Merrick's got the detonator.<eos> He's demanding that you get over here, or he's gonna use it.<eos> I'm still not getting anything.<eos> I need to know that you guys don't fix whatever it is you did to this craft!<eos> It has to go down!
Francisco Luis Vargas... doesn't that just roll off the tongue?<eos> Ma'am, if you could just take one step back from the monitor...<eos> I will literally murder you.<eos> The Governor's education plan... is a dud.<eos> The bottom line... It does more harm than good.
Die... in a fart... Brown cow.<eos> What?<eos> Yowsers. Blunt.<eos> God, it's like we climbed into it.<eos> I don't even understand how it got in here.
We use surgical scissors when we do embalming.<eos> I-I-I left some out, I just turned right into them.<eos> Looks more like a knife wound to me.<eos> You know, one of the men at the arcade who was killed, Ray Mui, he had a switchblade on him when he died.<eos> It would've left a mark like that.
Why are you all in my vault?<eos> Short version... thing with fangs trying to kill us.<eos> And you're hiding instead of fighting?<eos> I saw the same monster in my dream.<eos> And in the end, it... it killed me, so...
See, these guys like their own product.<eos> They never sleep.<eos> So Dunning's never had a chance to actually check the computer.<eos> So you can't confirm its contents without storming the castle.<eos> If you storm the castle, and it's empty, you've wasted a year's work.
I know it sounds silly, but, you know, I actually...<eos> I actually think it could be a really big hit.<eos> I mean, tons of people have dogs, and I'm sure they wonder what they're thinking.<eos> Yeah, maybe, but they don't wonder what her dog's thinking.<eos> Or what she thinks it's thinking.
We'll see you soon.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> We were admiring the diamond...<eos> Where is the diamond, Matelio?<eos> Matelio, where is it?
Now, where were we?<eos> We were admiring the diamond...<eos> Where is the diamond, Matelio?<eos> Matelio, where is it?<eos> Where is it, Matelio?
But the chip, that's what this is all about.<eos> Rose took Mateo to get it.<eos> Elena took Luisa to get Rose to give it to her.<eos> But Rose doesn't have it because Nadine didn't give it to her.<eos> So where is it?
Did Henry tell you about the Baskerville trust?<eos> He did not.<eos> You know each other?<eos> The trust is where Charles got most of his money, from the estate of Hugo Baskerville, the rail baron.<eos> It passes, intact, to the oldest surviving heir.
The killings will only get worse Until I get what I want.<eos> Body count is about to go through the roof.<eos> And from what I hear, This "green meanie" will make the red devil look like... A girl scout.<eos> Please, Hester. He's murdered number five's hideous boyfriend.<eos> Please tell us who it is.
So, um, how did you find me in Dallas? You're not hard to follow.<eos> We never received your immunization records.<eos> State school board requires those for employment.<eos> Yours don't exist.<eos> I investigated your degree and found out it was issued by what generously might be referred to as a "mill,"
The slug I pulled from our victim was a ballistics match to the gun that was used to murder James Lam.<eos> Which mean Lam's competitors killed both men.<eos> If we are to believe Sang Min's account of events, then yes.<eos> All right, but if T.O.D. was before we took Sang Min out of prison, then that would create reasonable doubt.<eos> Well, unfortunately, the condition of the body makes it very difficult to determine the precise time of death, however, I can confirm it was within the last 72 hours.
Seriously, back up.<eos> Let me take a gander at this handsome new addition to the Underworld.<eos> We have to get a message to our friends in the world above.<eos> And you ripped out the phone booth that can do that.<eos> Now, where is it?
Pleasure, too.<eos> Try it.<eos> They make delightful drinks that go far to relieve some of the pain of incarnation.<eos> There is not one I would rather have fight beside me.<eos> But an army may only have one leader... else, like a two-headed snake, it may strike itself with its own fangs.
So how did it go down?<eos> Where'd the DEA catch you? Was it here?<eos> Where's the mic?<eos> I just want to make sure I'm heard.<eos> Where is it?
We should probably be 100% sure before we tell her the guy she likes is a jerk who's tryin' to run everybody out of camp.<eos> Ugh, you gonna give us a hand here, Rarity?<eos> I would love to, but I really need to get the stitching on this poncho done if it's going to make it into the camp fashion show.<eos> Though at the pace you two are moving, I don't know that the runway will ever be finished.<eos> The dock is our gift to the camp and it's gonna get finished.
Why did you come here?<eos> What happened with Owen's sister?<eos> You're a friend of Owen Hunt's.<eos> I figured he would have told you.<eos> He said you put her in a helicopter, and it crashed.
They need to know that Afterlife works under real life conditions.<eos> So the Army, they just seize whoever they want.<eos> Claim they turned Z, who's gonna argue with that?<eos> Everyone who's infected has a chip, right?<eos> It carries one to three years of Zombrex.
See, he likes yours. 'Cause it's scribbly.<eos> It's not scribbly!<eos> No, it's not!<eos> Yes, it is!<eos> Liam, it's beautiful.
Did he rule on potential life...<eos> They ruled it's my property.<eos> I knew it.<eos> It had to be.<eos> It's not alive.
If this isn't Storybrooke or the Enchanted Forest, then where are we?<eos> Well, wherever we are, I'd rather not stick around long enough to find out.<eos> Can you... use the wand and get us back to Storybrooke?<eos> Not quite.<eos> So we're trapped in this mysterious realm, wherever it is.
- It means a lot.<eos> - Of course.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Rachel needs training, so I'll give that to her.<eos> How long it takes and what's involved, I don't know.
And that, that is your house right there, isn't it?<eos> Yes. 1547 Oakmont.<eos> Did you grant permission for the drone to fly over it?<eos> No. Absolutely not.<eos> And how often does it do that?
You told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot a drone, so he brought it down safely and he returned it.<eos> Well, was the drone returned to Ms. Hamm in one piece?<eos> It was, but...<eos> Why are you bothering me with this?<eos> He gave the drone back, it wasn't damaged.
I made it myself from scratch from a rabbit I shot.<eos> - Wow, you shot a rabbit?<eos> - Right?<eos> You know, I never cooked that stew for nobody but Jean.<eos> It was homemade, but she just... turned it down.
I'm sorry. This is your shop.<eos> I should not tell you how to run it.<eos> Erin, do not worry about it.<eos> Everybody's just trying to do their job.<eos> So, this house, you, uh, you think it exists?
What?<eos> A premonition?<eos> I see a man in my dreams.<eos> It's like I'm peeping into his life.<eos> Who is it?
And, yes, I don't love Doug and Craig, but I really totally respect your decision to keep them at the company.<eos> Like I told Donna, I'd have paid for them to go away.<eos> Cost of doing business.<eos> But it shows strength that you decided to make it work.<eos> Look, this call is appreciated, but it's unnecessary.
We used to number in the hundreds until the Court saw our growing strength, and they offered us a partnership, only to betray us.<eos> Many escaped back to Ukraine but a few of us stayed back, hoping to find a way to enact revenge.<eos> And we did.<eos> The key.<eos> Well, what does it open? A safe.
Ellie, you saw what they did to your friend.<eos> Okay, but... why -- why would they kill Nick?<eos> Those are great questions.<eos> What do you tools want with the watch?<eos> And what does it have to do with her?
Of course you are right, Onoda-kakka, but wherever there is power there is subversion, whether in Manchuria or here.<eos> Kakka, may I raise with you again the subject of the films?<eos> You missed the point, Kido-Tai'i.<eos> We are seen as weak.<eos> If a nation is seen as weak, it is weak.
It might seem farfetched, Anna...<eos> But there is a long-term brilliance to the whole thing.<eos> Sadly, no proof absolute, but better than that she escapes censure altogether.<eos> There's a missing piece to this.<eos> Once you've delivered your manuscript, it could give it proof absolute.
SARAH: I'm sure she murdered Milly Davis.<eos> Now, you remember what I said about a roman á clef?<eos> Readers recognize the truth behind the fiction.<eos> And reputations can be slayed.<eos> Once you've delivered your manuscript, it could give it proof absolute.
Oh, shoot, we have to reschedule.<eos> Gaby and Fiona took mushrooms, and Kennedy wants me to babysit.<eos> But we have to study.<eos> A lot of studying to do.<eos> Am I making this music, or is it coming from a speaker?
Something to guide us home when we feel we've lost our way.<eos> If we're lucky, someone gives us a method and we follow it.<eos> If not, we find our own.<eos> Pablo's enemies had found their own method.<eos> And it was an ugly one.
You can't be serious.<eos> You want me to explain it using smaller words?<eos> That research will lead us to a cure.<eos> When are you going to accept the fact that there is no cure?<eos> You found your cure once and it failed.
You know how the neutralizer made it so the poison only - targeted the animals? - Yeah.<eos> Well, it looks like he was working on an alternate neutralizer.<eos> Alternate how?<eos> This neutralizer isn't going to make it so that the gas is safe for humans.<eos> It's... going to make it so that the gas is safe for animals.
So Aristotle was Plato's student.<eos> And Aristotle believes that your character - is voluntary, - _ because it's just the result of your actions, which are under your control.
So, that means...<eos> It means... it's not a stone?<eos> Or it's not... JUST a stone.<eos> Correct.<eos> So... what is it?
- What is it?<eos> I left Poppy behind.<eos> - Who's Poppy?<eos> - My turtle.<eos> You mean it belonged to your host?
Yeah. The Shadow Kin believe that they're an evolutionary mistake.<eos> Like... a peek into the universe's dark side that it never wanted, so they were cast down here to live in our shadows and be forgotten.<eos> They're pretty pissed off about it.<eos> Yeah. I've noticed.<eos> These are here to remind them that the universe will crush them if they don't defeat it.
That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.<eos> It's mine.
But some things weren't meant to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How would you feel about renovating my summer house in the Hamptons?<eos> I appreciate the thought, Louis, but I don't do residential work.<eos> It's not residential. I use it as a home office.
I mean, maybe this is a good thing.<eos> They're gonna do tests and figure out what's wrong with her.<eos> I'm gonna get everyone coffee.<eos> Henry, this hospital...<eos> It was the closest one to the train.
It wasn't.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Yeah, and the Broadway picture.<eos> You had ten of us writing behind him, and you didn't make that one, either.<eos> Just because you make a script better doesn't mean you made it good.
"All warfare is deception.<eos> In the middle of chaos there is opportunity."<eos> So just delete the virus from my tablet and return the votes.<eos> The Chinese just ghosted it onto your tablet to implicate your administration.<eos> It's actually being run from one of their computers.
I'd be in the same position if the store asked us to start selling, you know, hashish or the morning-after pill.<eos> We sell the morning-after pill.<eos> What?<eos> I don't wanna sell rice anymore.<eos> It doesn't taste like anything.
Excuse me. I-I overheard.<eos> I work for the government;<eos> we might be able to help.<eos> My son can track Daniel's tablet.<eos> It has no locate function;
- Yeah, I'd love that.<eos> - And then we can all do dinner and a movie.<eos> - Okay, one step at a time.<eos> - Hank, I noticed you're carrying some undue stress in your lower back and shoulders, so I bought you this special ergonomic desk chair.<eos> I think you'll... find that it provides more than sufficient lumbar support.
Well, too bad.<eos> Now take your pill.<eos> I don't like methylprednisolone.<eos> Uh, it makes me jumpy.<eos> Toby says it keeps inflammation down around your L4.
Pretty sure I'm not crazy here.<eos> Watson. Did Mr. Dalal's story check out?<eos> It did. But that's not why I'm calling.<eos> I found the motive for the attack on the key-holder group.<eos> Or rather, it found me.
What?<eos> No! You weighed in wrong.<eos> I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen.<eos> And I'm not taking your side against the universe's.<eos> - It's hundred of years old.
- lose the weight.<eos> - Guys, this negativity's really breaking my concentration.<eos> Of course we have a solution.<eos> We already have the weight loss sensor.<eos> It tells her when she's had enough calories, right?
First of all, if the wind shifts you get drift.<eos> -One.<eos> -Secondly, it's such a slow descent, it gives your enemy ample time to just shoot your cargo out of the sky.<eos> So, the British came up with the idea that they would just strap rockets onto the cargo.<eos> That way it drops at terminal velocity and, at the last minute, ignites the rockets giving it a nice soft landing.
Shame was about the only thing that transpired.<eos> Shame... and realization.<eos> I don't know if Draal should be the Trollhunter or not, and I don't care.<eos> I just know that I am not.<eos> Master Jim, despite whatever doubts you may have about the amulet's choice, it is now bonded to you.
Me?<eos> I would like to stop him.<eos> A ghost.<eos> Ghost?<eos> No, it's not ghost.
Dude. Dude, get off me.<eos> Listen to me very carefully.<eos> That's the abominable snowman.<eos> You don't get that nickname by accident.<eos> And it just crawled out of a book.
You don't get that nickname by accident.<eos> And it just crawled out of a book.<eos> That doesn't just happen, Zach!<eos> I'm going after Hannah.<eos> Look, I read what it did to Pasadena.
Pure craftsmanship.<eos> Artistry!<eos> That belonged to my great-grandmother. 1890s.<eos> I wanna rip it apart and spread it out all over the floor.<eos> And no offense to your great-grandmother, but I see a clock like that, and I wanna know what it looks like inside.
Once upon a time, there was a girl called Ella.<eos> And she saw the world not always as it was, but as perhaps it could be, with just a little bit of magic.
- Her.<eos> - I think she can fix it, David.<eos> - Wait. What? I've been pirating your signal.<eos> Every time you turn it on here, I can see it there.<eos> And it flickered. The percentage dropped, David.
- Yeah.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the OS is what runs the computer.<eos> In fact, it sort of is the computer.<eos> How has it been running?
And the right computer...<eos> A friendly, easy computer that isn't an eyesore, but rather sits on your desk with the beauty of a tensor lamp, the right computer will be a bicycle for the mind.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I was given back.<eos> And what if, instead of it being in the right hands, it was in everyone's hands?
We will.<eos> Wille...<eos> Check the moon.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's red.
There, there!<eos> Yeah, I hear it, too.<eos> It's like a fricking clicking noise or something.<eos> Yeah, check over there.<eos> - I don't know where it's coming from.
Yeah, I hear it, too.<eos> It's like a fricking clicking noise or something.<eos> Yeah, check over there.<eos> - I don't know where it's coming from.<eos> - Where's it coming from?
Quick!<eos> That's one hell of a pilot!<eos> The girl I've heard so much about.<eos> The droid.<eos> Where is it?
The waltz.<eos> Not a complicated dance, really.<eos> The lady takes her place slightly to the left of the leading gentleman.<eos> Six basic steps, and that's all.<eos> However, it is said that the true test of the perfect waltz is for it to be so swift, so delicate and so smooth that a candle flame will not be extinguished in the hand of the lead dancer.
You've done a good job protecting...<eos> How do we get it?<eos> We can't fight them.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Now prove yourself smart and tell me where it is.
What? Oh, no, I literally can't stomach sports.<eos> Yeah, I know. Your opposition is perfection.<eos> This really feels like a Bryson article.<eos> Yeah, this feels like a "me" article.<eos> lpflchedit Yeah, you pitched it.
Okay, Claire, listen to me. Claire, that's not going to happen.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen, and neither are you.<eos> No one is going to see that video.<eos> It won't see the light of day.
That wants the souls of the living... to join it in the shadows.<eos> She's only half a person right now.<eos> After the accident, it got half her soul.<eos> It needs all of it.<eos> And if we don't hurry, it's going to get it.
Most sorry children.<eos> With us they brought a sympathy icnu girl.<eos> I work there as a teacher.<eos> She drew a funny sketch. I'll show you.<eos> Where it has gotten lost?
And if it's not a crime, why is it there...<eos> Because it's prejudicial to a jury to have that sitting there unproven just... just smearing him.<eos> The portrayal they want is of someone who they could present to a jury of not having redeeming value.<eos> It's a way of poisoning the atmosphere so that the jury doesn't focus on the allegations, but focuses on this atmospheric that the government has created that in some sense is a diversion appealing to the emotional aspect of it<eos> so that if the proof is weak, the benefit of the doubt doesn't go to the defendant, where it belongs, under the presumption of innocence, but it goes to the government because there are these awful things lurking out there
Well, here.<eos> Why don't you use one of these tools.<eos> You got a little...<eos> I thought the volcano was dormant.<eos> It was, and now it's not.
Of course. Yeah. Wow.<eos> Peter O'Toole. Oh, my gosh.<eos> Very thin, but delightful. Hey!<eos> Look, there's the Mary Tyler Moore statue.<eos> Yeah, there it is.
It's much more believable if I'm the husband.<eos> Well you're the one who pinched the costume, from when you were on Downton Abbey.<eos> They gave it to me.<eos> Besides, you're never going to pass as straight.<eos> You're making that rug gay just by standing on it!
No.<eos> No, I think actually, I think unemployment, eradicating it, and I think a strong economy is something both parties want.<eos> Okay, speaking of everyone, there's a recent poll by Reuters.<eos> I wanna get this right.<eos> It says that eight out of ten Americans agree that you lack, quote, "effectiveness and leadership."
I don't want a version.<eos> I want a vision.<eos> As head of this team, and I think I speak for everyone,<eos> - we have done--<eos> - Speaking as the president, who chose this team and for whom it works,
- Paul...<eos> - No.<eos> May, you can't give Annie all this hope and then not deliver on anything at all.<eos> We don't need to find the darkness here, Paul.<eos> It's everywhere.
What are you doing here?<eos> ~ Where does he keep his rum?<eos> ~ Has he sent you for it?<eos> In a way.<eos> Where is it?
~ Clown!<eos> When I thought they were hanging me, yeah.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> You had to get Letters Molloy to write it for you.<eos> ~ What did it say?
We need to stop this.<eos> People could die.<eos> The whole hospital is shutting down.<eos> We designed the malware so that the only way to terminate its control is with a kill switch.<eos> - Where is it?
"did I think I was going to die?"<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> And that's what you need to know going in because it's going to happen to you.<eos> This is space.<eos> It does not cooperate.
Listen good, you gotta bring the creature back to the grove.<eos> But you gotta be careful, it won't come willingly.<eos> It's tasted human pleasures.<eos> What about Will?<eos> The only way is to bring the changeling back, but don't let it sense your intension, it senses things.
This outcome, it's not at all what I would have wanted.<eos> Vice Admiral Lord Kensington.<eos> I don't need to explain to you his interest in achieving the greatest possible exposure for this proceeding.<eos> String him up! He's going to put on a show.<eos> And once it begins, I fear I will not be able to control where it goes.
No, we didn't.<eos> Serge, we own 80% of the bio-tech patents in this country.<eos> You willingly shared the information from your trials and you were well compensated for it.<eos> -One second, look.<eos> We engineered this virus and it may have reconstituted.
No.<eos> - Okay. All right.<eos> Do you realize how selfish you're being, Doris?<eos> You cannot keep that house all for yourself.<eos> It belongs to all of us.
And we were each appointed a local constable.<eos> The fella that was appointed to me, his name was Stephen.<eos> And we were given radios and maps and... A huge sack filled with polythene body bags.<eos> So Stephen and I, we set out across this moor.<eos> Every piece of anybody we found... We picked up, I photographed it,
Lost four head last night.<eos> Whole county'll be ruined if that keeps up.<eos> You'll figure something out.<eos> But you must remember such incantations are dangerous and you must never speak the Devil's language idly.<eos> Let this language not become easy in your mouth or soon it will no longer be your mouth but his.
Critics claim typewriters didn't have that ability in the 1970s, but some did.<eos> In fact, other Bush military records released by the White House itself... show the same superscript.<eos> Here's one from 1968.<eos> Some analysts outside CBS... say they believe the typeface on these memos is New Times Roman... which they claim was not available in the 1970s.<eos> But the owner of the company that distributes this typing style... says it has been available since 1931.
Find out where the 8:30 bus comes from?<eos> It's here. It's here.<eos> Brother, where is this bus coming from?<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> We want to know where it's coming from?
But if I fail, or if he's already dead...<eos> I will marry you.<eos> I'll not force any of my men to go to their deaths.<eos> But I'll not stand in the way of any that choose to go.<eos> Look, I like the lad, but it's Wentworth.
The ring of the Magi.<eos> Where is the ring?<eos> I don't see a ring.<eos> The five maidens are your five fingers, and the serpent is the sacred ring.<eos> You know where it is.
Nothing you do tonight will change that.<eos> But go ahead. Keep hitting me.<eos> Let's see who drops first.<eos> Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.<eos> Where is it?
Besides, I come bearing gifts.<eos> The only thing I want from you are signed copies of our divorce papers.<eos> I hear your request, and being that it's not in my best interest to sign those papers, I'd like to offer you a counter.<eos> These are my house keys as a gesture of goodwill.<eos> This will always be my home, but I respect that it is your house now.
No, I'm not...<eos> I'm not ready to go back there.<eos> You want to know what the best thing is about having our gift?<eos> It's always there, like a good friend.<eos> You know, when you open your mouth, there it is.
This drug, Xanadu, it-- it has shown promise.<eos> And I'll be getting that drug... as part of the trial? Yes. That or a placebo.<eos> A placebo? Um...<eos> Uh, yeah, I don't understand.<eos> You see, in order to ascertain the effectiveness of a drug, it has to be judged in a controlled setting against an equal number of patients that are not getting the drug.
With me, you have a chance to defeat her.<eos> Without me, she will take your daughter and make her a slave.<eos> She will suffer as I had, never knowing her mother and father because Dahlia will have rendered you into ash.<eos> Are you quite finished?<eos> If there is to be an alliance between us, it will be one of my design...
We can cling to the past or embrace the inevitability of change...<eos> And allow a brighter future to unfold before us.<eos> Such an uncertain future may call for even more uncertain allies.<eos> Either way, a new day is coming, whether we like it or not.<eos> The question is will you control it, or will it control you?
And these will help you keep those fears in check.<eos> It's my understanding that due to the lack of credible evidence, the people wish to drop all charges against Ms Godfrey?<eos> - We do, Your Honour.<eos> - So ordered.<eos> And as to the challenge of guardianship filed by Roman Godfrey, the court has found it without merit.
And if it's any consolation, uh, you even make mud look good, Lemon Breeland.<eos> But I should, uh...<eos> Yeah, I should probably...<eos> Wait.<eos> Lavon... I've been waiting for the perfect moment, and I certainly didn't think that it'd be a time where I'm covered in alpaca droppings and mud, but I just cannot wait any longer, because... I love you.
- Don't worry.<eos> I got a thing for older men.<eos> - I can hear them approaching.<eos> The end... It isn't coming.<eos> The end." It's already here.
- You once used one to bring Nathan back.<eos> That was a different Trouble.<eos> That was one that we knew how to control.<eos> Ona has had her Trouble for what, a few days?<eos> She has no idea how it really works - none of us do.
Just let your mind go blank.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making contact with the poltergeist.<eos> What do you wanna do that for?<eos> To see what it wants.
Mom!<eos> Mom?<eos> I can't find my lunch.<eos> Just get a 20 out of my wallet.<eos> Where is it?
He had to get you to do it?<eos> We want my brother fully exonerated.<eos> We want him released right now.<eos> You understand there's going to be civil action against this office.<eos> If a mistake's been made, it will be corrected.
Run that watch, homeboy.<eos> I said run that watch.<eos> What watch?<eos> Yo, man, you see a watch?<eos> Where it's at?
I said run that watch.<eos> What watch?<eos> Yo, man, you see a watch?<eos> Where it's at?<eos> Where it's at?
Mm. Yes, actually.<eos> I wanted to see if I could convince you, uh, not to kill me off.<eos> Look, it wasn't an easy decision.<eos> I have carried this show on my back for months.<eos> I am the only reason it became an international sensation loved by millions...
One of Jainismâs tenets.<eos> Thank you for sitting with me, Petra.<eos> I know Roman was closer to you than anyone.<eos> Look...<eos> Our relationship, it, um...
Hi, it's me. Where are you?<eos> Like you care.<eos> I saw the photograph, Claire.<eos> Why were you wearing a pendant belonging to Pippa Gillespie?<eos> It wasn't Pippa's.
Please, help me.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Ohh...<eos> The virus.<eos> Where is it?
The virus.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's done.<eos> It's gone.<eos> It... it's...
Where is it?<eos> It's done.<eos> It's gone.<eos> It... it's...<eos> it's completed.
There's a 50% chance the cat's been killed, but until you open the box, there's no way to know one way or the other.<eos> Quantum physics says before you open the box, the cat isn't dead or alive.<eos> It's both. What about after you open the box?<eos> Reality collapses back onto itself.<eos> Cat's either alive, or it's dead.
What did he want?<eos> He said that he'd forgive us for everything we've done if...<eos> If I help him make a new friend.<eos> Okay, what... what... what friend, honey?<eos> Did he... did he say who it is?
The virus was lost to us in Chechnya.<eos> It's time to move on to Oliver Peters.<eos> He will re-create it for us.<eos> Ugh!<eos> The virus... where is it?
Can I please come to your rehearsals?<eos> Can we talk about Timothy?<eos> Oh, sweetheart, why don't we just wait for the school assembly for that.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I don't know if he got fired because he made us read that article on education reform, but I found it very informative.
But, like most criminals, you made a mistake-- using a burn phone to text Zoey's father.<eos> We traced the serial number from that phone right back to you.<eos> You can't prove any of what you're saying.<eos> Even I know that burner phones are untraceable.<eos> But what you don't know is that the first time you connect a phone with a computer, it logs that activity.
- Zo!<eos> Shit!<eos> Say goodbye to your Prince, Da Vinci.<eos> The signal...<eos> Where is it?
It was, um...a series of pulleys and gears...<eos> Yes.<eos> ..attached by a metal-permeated cable to your headless bird.<eos> I thought the wind would activate it.<eos> The crystal mechanism, does it rotate?
But if I do, will you drink a beer?<eos> Fine.<eos> You're gonna lose.<eos> So this virus is released, or whatever it is.<eos> And who does it kill?
Here, take these.<eos> Annie still needs the drugs whether you stay or you go.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> Just shoot the plane down.<eos> It wasn't even close to the border.
Hera! Wait.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> Status report on the rebel craft.<eos> Sir, we've locked onto a ship, but it's not the rebel craft.
Could be a boyfriend.<eos> Though from Anna's reaction,<eos> Looks like she's been knocked around by someone.<eos> _<eos> If Anna's in a relationship, it's anything but healthy.
George Clooney's really gonna come out in this weather?<eos> He said he's coming out for one reason only, Noah.<eos> To meet you.<eos> Shit, there goes my phone.<eos> Where the fuck is it?
And no one knows what these three witches want Regina to help them steal?<eos> Not for sure.<eos> But they're powerful witches seeking more power, And who's more powerful than the Dark One?<eos> His dagger... it's still in town, isn't it?<eos> Why do you think they're after it?
- Oh. - Oh, my God.<eos> Can I get you a drink?<eos> You know, I could use one, but it can wait.<eos> I want to see the note.<eos> Is that it?
It's pushed existing tissue aside, shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself.<eos> How do you remove it without destroying the brain around it? How do you kill the baby without killing the mother?<eos> I stare at these scans, and the tumor stares back at me, daring me to try to extract it.<eos> I mean, this tumor is bold and brazen.<eos> This tumor thinks it's in charge.
Jason, not now.<eos> Down.<eos> Yuck. We don't have a secret, all right?<eos> Do we have a secret, Terry?<eos> If we did, it's a secret from me.
- Hello... I'm in here.<eos> - Oh, I know. I'm sorry.<eos> Our shower's still busted and I got rounds.<eos> You know what? I told him a thousand times...<eos> You put the bread on the counter, it molds.
Okay.<eos> You don't have to be up here so much.<eos> I won't be.<eos> This is the direction he'd come in.<eos> If he sends up a signal, it'll be from out there.
Well, I think you probably got here just in time.<eos> Look, Mrs. Ellingsworth, according to your... your blood tests, you have a curiously toxic amount of thallium in your system.<eos> Thallium?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Uh, it was used as an insecticide, uh, but because of its high levels of toxicity, it's been banned for years.
- Yeah.<eos> - Sub... substantially less.<eos> You're gonna go to Georgetown?<eos> If I'm accepted.<eos> Um, I got an internship at the Microloans Program, and I can only do it if I apply it toward a college course. So...
Did you find the woman?<eos> She led me straight to the man she works for.<eos> The man who sent her to follow me.<eos> Follow you?<eos> Who was it?
That all looks very exciting, but we start tonight with our sensible hats on.<eos> You see, a few years ago, we staged a race across London.<eos> We used a car, public transport, bicycle and a speedboat, down the River Thames.<eos> And it was one of our more ~ genuinely interesting tests.<eos> ~ Yeah, it was, but it's always troubled us, because the bicycle, ridden by me, won.
Oh, Christ, look behind you.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Well, there we are. Proof that the car is... ~ Is better. ~ It's better.<eos> ~ Was worth it.<eos> I'm afraid, even when it's comedically small,
Thank you for asking, Sir. 28 men and 3 women.<eos> That's how many casualties this war has cost us already.<eos> My thoughts are with them... the 31 service members who have lost their lives in an unnecessary war.<eos> Does your report even mention their names?<eos> Does it reveal the reason why they were sent into battle in the first place?
Including who I'm dating and who you are.<eos> David, that alternator is in worse shape than we thought.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, of course it is.<eos> I'll see to it. All right, just don't remove it.<eos> I think it's holding the hull together.
I just care about being with you...<eos> Captain Dozerman, an adult man who has passed into the nether world.<eos> Move over, Peralta! Move over!<eos> Okay. And if I may do a third toast.<eos> It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt.
They'll have to custom-mix the color because they no longer make raspberry sherbet.<eos> They're all so beautiful.<eos> And they're all about to be tested... bouncy-styles.<eos> ♪ To the wall ♪ I love this mattress.<eos> And it loves having you in it.

I understand she's been through a lot, but the fact is, she needs to prep for Face the Nation.<eos> I'll try to block out some time in her schedule for this afternoon.<eos> MATT: It's not like we're being overly dramatic.<eos> Rogue CIA director starts a coup in Iran under the White House's nose?<eos> And the only reason it fails is because she literally puts herself in the line of fire.
And then all of a sudden - oh, yeah!<eos> Your wife's alive and she's with some fucker that looks like you.<eos> Oh, and also, your mum's not your mum and you're going to die!<eos> Best Regards, the Universe.<eos> Where is it?
I don't believe in your cause, I believe in you.<eos> And I'm done trying to change you.<eos> Though I do think I can help you be a little less sloppy.<eos> Now, your father keeps a pistol in the house.<eos> I know where it is.
Yeah, guy's got a mortar shell stuck in him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He has a...<eos> Guy has a mortar shell stuck inside of his body.<eos> - How did it get there?
Now, there are many truly great car companies, all with rich, magnificent histories - there's Ferrari, Jaguar, Lancia, Maserati and so on and so on.<eos> Yes, indeed, but tonight, James and I are going to look at the history of the most brilliant, most inventive car company of them all -<eos> Peugeot.<eos> For thousands of years, there was only one way of crossing this spartan landscape in the vast, dusty heat of North Africa.<eos> This was it.
If you get busted for speeding in this car, you get a thank-you letter from Greenpeace.<eos> And rightly so!<eos> 'But before we get carried away with this environmental stuff, 'there's one important point we all need to remember.'<eos> I've always had a fundamental problem with hybrids.<eos> And it's this.
~ An actual rabbit.<eos> ~ Yeah, yeah, but I think they're the same thing.<eos> No, a rabbit's... not a car.<eos> That's what I, that's what I, that's what I...<eos> It does exist.
- Yes.<eos> Uh, everyone, tonight we are witness to the amazing work of Nola Anderz.<eos> [applause] Why don't we all just stand here quietly for a moment and let Nola's pictures speak.<eos> [cell phone ringing] That's my phone.<eos> Where is it?
He had this gun he said he took from his teacher and I told him, "Just forget it, go home."<eos> She took the bait.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, Carrie's a minute out.<eos> And so suddenly we were fighting over the gun, and it went off.
Look, Crunchie, it's just that we're a little bit concerned about your behaviour lately.<eos> What behaviour?<eos> I watched you wrestle a bicycle yesterday, Crunch. And you lost.<eos> You lost against a bicycle.<eos> It started it!
Toramex alleviates arthritis, targets TNF, and is proven to reduce associated inflammation.<eos> These proteins can be up to 25 times higher in Alzheimer's patients' brains.<eos> Right, so the tricky part is, how do we get the drug into the brain without it dissipating in the body?<eos> Which is why we tilt them.<eos> By injecting the drug into the spine here, it will flow directly into the brain.
We both know that's not gonna happen.<eos> No dinner meant no dinner.<eos> I didn't come down here for food.<eos> I'm down here for... the crisper drawer.<eos> I'm building a fort, and it needs a window.
Yes, but then, one day, the phone goes quiet, and all you have left is the work that you worked so hard on.<eos> Turns out it's just a pile of fake Monets.<eos> Mr. Swann, uh, can you tell us anything about this painting?<eos> You don't waste any time, Anthony.<eos> I just got your e-mail saying you were interested in The Chesapeake, and now, here it is.
- Where should we go?<eos> - To the other side of the metro.<eos> - Where are you now?<eos> - On the other side.<eos> It's right there.
So you are the young fella that found the key.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was on the doorstep.<eos> ~ Now why would you be wondering about a reward, you of all people?<eos> Have you found out where it's from?
~ Ah.<eos> But the blame for that lies not with Mr Higgins, rather it lies with you, Mr Wood, and your employer, Mr Bray.<eos> ~ Surely the transcript is a matter for public record?<eos> ~ And he will have it.<eos> The question is, why does he want it?
You noticed.<eos> Respect.<eos> This is Tandy Land, and he knows it.<eos> He smells the spray, he's trying to tip-toe through it.<eos> But it's all over his feet and legs.
Tell me.<eos> Uh, you wait.<eos> - I wait?<eos> - They will come to you if it is safe.<eos> This film, what does it mean?
Grey, need a hand.<eos> I flew a plane.<eos> I had the controls in my hands.<eos> I don't know how to fly a plane, and I flew a freaking plane!<eos> We were in a plane, and it crashed.

Even if "here" is a country that turns its history into themed restaurants.<eos> Hmm. I suppose you're right, Lieutenant.<eos> It's not the country I thought it would be.<eos> But it is the one I have.<eos> And I must accept it for what it is, just as I ask it to accept... me.
Can I make you love me again?<eos> In a letter, for losing?<eos> If the letter is the last thing left of me, will it sit on your shelf, with my ashes, gathering dust to dust?<eos> Look, look, you were right.<eos> That gun, it is going to protect you.
Thanks.<eos> Why don't you hold onto this?<eos> In case you wanna talk to someone.<eos> - I can't take your phone.<eos> - No, it's not mine.
It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.<eos> Yeah, so much for the good old days where you could just look for the glint of a sniper-rifle scope in a nearby window.<eos> What does it do, this virus, to the body?<eos> The CDC's still breaking it down.<eos> But they're saying it attacks the central nervous system.
I used to be like you, when I first came here.<eos> You think it's all a bit of a laugh.<eos> Pub called The Black Dog.<eos> Tall tales of Old Shuck roaming the woods.<eos> But it's there and everybody knows.
I don't know. She can walk through walls.<eos> But she can't make another thinny without my ring, so we know she didn't go hide in the Void.<eos> And we know she's done helping us.<eos> Why does she think that her trouble's worth keeping?<eos> It's got to have a downside, right?
How does it taste?<eos> Or about why you cross your legs when I come closer?<eos> Or about why you smile when I walk in the room.<eos> And I know that smile.<eos> And I know what it means.
We traveled all around the countryside just to catch a glimpse of one.<eos> Then, finally, in Somalia, we found a small herd of Hirola.<eos> Yes, it was as beautiful as we had hoped, and many photos were taken.<eos> But when we traveled home, we realized there was an emptiness.<eos> We had expended so much energy on a single-minded pursuit, and it was over.
The network's down.<eos> Ariel used to call me babe.<eos> Everything I've done, I've done because I love you and I want to save you.<eos> The bunker is real and it's your only hope.<eos> I know where it is, you don't.
Good evening.<eos> Because I am not taken seriously due to my gender, a friendly guard has hidden my invention until a future time, when some liberated young woman has the permission of her husband to look for it.<eos> There's a whole closet of these things!<eos> How many magicians do they have in this place?<eos> Find my journal, and it will lead you to my greatest invention!
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards, closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.<eos> Sure you don't want to just blow it up?<eos> All we need is one security flaw.<eos> Look at this place, man.<eos> It was built not to have any.
That's not a lead. That's a wild goose chase.<eos> Uh, I cross-checked every location against any houses with lead-based glass like the type that we found in the victim.<eos> You think that we have time to be running all over the place?<eos> We also know that Jared Booth fell from a three-story structure.<eos> And that it's in McLean, Virginia.
A bunch of guns.<eos> You can't tell me you don't have any cash laying around.<eos> Put it to work.<eos> Here. Read the prospectus.<eos> It lays everything out.
- Oh, dear.<eos> I'll stand here till I die before I pay for that cake.<eos> Fine.<eos> I was only going to waste this money on a pacemaker, anyway.<eos> - Where's it going?
[Grunting]<eos> Emma crushed my heart.<eos> We have no time to waste.<eos> We have to make sure that Arthur can't get this dagger.<eos> This altar is the place to secure it, but it's shielded by a nasty protection spell.
We're here for the magic helm,<eos> I need it to save my kingdom.<eos> You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?
Don't be so literal.<eos> Yeah, you just... feel the music.<eos> Maybe if you told me what the piece was about.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> It's about... falling in love with someone you can never be with.
She may have signed that contract, but it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time.<eos> What?<eos> Your Honor, I know this man, and that document could have come from anywhere.<eos> Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.<eos> All it's gonna prove is that Alyssa Lang had no legal capacity to sign.
- Yeah.<eos> - It's in my pocket. - Okay.<eos> At least, I thought it was in my pocket.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> - I know where it is.
What was that?<eos> Okay, that's one tall glass with ice, two shots of vodka, Tabasco sauce, and one celery stalk.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> I think you're missing a key ingredient there, mister.<eos> It'll come soon enough.

Well, it looks like it was good advice.<eos> Aye. Now, is my potion done?<eos> Yeah, a-about that, do you know what this potion will do to you?<eos> Think I would ask you to make it if I didn't?<eos> But it'll turn you into a... a bear.

She's very important to me. Please, if you know where she is...<eos> She's at the protest.<eos> What protest?<eos> At the school.<eos> Well, what's it about?
Sniffer dogs?<eos> Err... No Sir...<eos> Was there a cooler panel on Khempa_BAR_'s body?<eos> Er... why yes Sir, there was...<eos> Who must have kept it?
Janja, I'm hungry!<eos> Me, too!<eos> You two only have yourselves to blame.<eos> To think that you were scared by the roar of a lion cub!<eos> Janja, see, Kion's roar, it wasn't like, like a normal roar.
Catherine left-- it sucks, I'm hurting a little bit, but it's happened before.<eos> A, B, I'm gonna be fine, all right?<eos> Brother...<eos> let me explain something to you.<eos> There's only one way to get over a woman walking out on you, and it involves you, me and that bar.
If that's the case, last night when you went to Crane's house he would have you leave with the painting.<eos> Well, he said he would call back with a time and place for the drop.<eos> Well, that's perfect. When he does, you keep him talking, we'll run a trace.<eos> What we have to do, though, is get the painting back.<eos> So where is it now?
All ready, my queen.<eos> My friends.<eos> We stand on the precipice of a major scientific discovery.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a New World Order.
And speaking of truths, do you have anything you want to share with me, Sammy?<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> We've checked Ruiz's cell phone.<eos> Any calls or texts to his ATF handler?<eos> None listed. Also, if Ruiz had a speed-dial to the number that detonated the bomb, it's been deleted.
Thank you.<eos> She's back.<eos> You're on a deserted island with nothing but a blanket, a packed lunch and a gazebo.<eos> There's only one guy there.<eos> Who is it?
Good for you.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Sam Guttman.<eos> I'm a rare automobile broker... with a keen interest in the car you're trying to find.<eos> I'm not sure it's for sale.
Unless the sign says "open"... you're not invited.<eos> I think I was invited.<eos> I hear whispering.<eos> It's the dagger.<eos> It's calling to me.
- Bailey's looking for you.<eos> You have to pull it together.<eos> - You're getting yourself in trouble.<eos> - I know.<eos> ...it reignites.
I gave her a soda.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Great work, Ralph.<eos> Now send an emergency alert.<eos> It will go out to every cell phone, TV and radio in town.
Alonzo-- is he... is he gonna be okay?<eos> Well, he's in surgery now.<eos> They're doing everything they can.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt him. But he came at me, and we fought over the gun.<eos> And it went off.
Well, get one cut or get somebody to open it for you!<eos> No, I can't.<eos> But if we get the key, then we get the money.<eos> And then we're gone, and then you get Lucy back.<eos> This key...where is it?
I thought they were brilliant and it was great to see one nearly destroyed.<eos> It told you that the show wasn't just going to be about the high-end cars that you could never possibly afford.<eos> You can all own one of these and, in actual fact, you don't have to be quite as violent with it.<eos> That's got it.<eos> They did absolutely everything that they possibly can to destroy this car and it is indestructible.
A billion trillion?<eos> Yes?<eos> - Where is the proof?<eos> - I gave it to you.<eos> It proves it.
It strengthens their powers.<eos> Makes their illusions seem more real.<eos> Why would my mam have it?<eos> Mother Malkin, she had the stone once.<eos> In her hands, it has tremendous power.
German blew a hydro dam last night flood the whole area.<eos> We got the engineers up there looking for needed repairs.<eos> So what about the rest of our trucks?<eos> We let them risk it all but the last track that crossed.<eos> It got caught up in something tipped over the bridge into the river, luckily no one died.

He's just afraid.<eos> Everyone's afraid.<eos> I know, but fear does something strange to people like Al.<eos> But not you.<eos> Fear doesn't shut you down, it wakes you up.
You destroyed it.<eos> Human nature destroyed it.<eos> Those of us with the vision to see that are called upon to protect the rest.<eos> We will restore the peace.<eos> And this time, it will last.
I didn't say that.<eos> Tell me about the voice.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about the voice.<eos> Did it just start telling you to do things today?
Join the fucking club, sister.<eos> Look on the bright side.<eos> At least you've had real sex.<eos> I'm so paranoid about AIDS I have to live vicariously through you.<eos> Okay, well, the problem is that once you've had real sex, it's, like, all you can ever think about.
No!<eos> They've made the show even worse!<eos> - Bravo!<eos> Bravo! - Amazing!<eos> Where is it?
Matter of fact... I think he's our killer.<eos> Tighten it up.<eos> Yeah, you can go on upstairs.<eos> My room is the first room upstairs on the left.<eos> It's the only one available.
Now, Mr. secretary, whatever is causing all this is some kind of something that should be contained.<eos> The Earth cannot survive without the Moon, so you damn well better deliver me some answers soon and keep this quarantine quiet!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We keep thinking the flower's new.<eos> Maybe it's super-old, but it's just always fed off helium trapped deep down in the Moon.
Two hours later, there was my turn.<eos> Oh my god .. ..<eos> Gosh .. Give me back my remote control.<eos> B ...<eos> Where is it?

Well, it's a little frustrating, sure.<eos> - But at the end of the day...<eos> - Tomato paste is a vegetable?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Well, it's...

Probably.<eos> But you won't do that.<eos> Probably not.<eos> There's this ritual.<eos> It's given a few of my patients some comfort.
You can put the knife away.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Paul.<eos> And I am not putting the knife away, not until my brother is fixed and we are walking out that door.<eos> Okay, I'm just saying, you don't need it.
Yes.<eos> We're trying to figure out what's wrong with your wife.<eos> Hmm. She had a tonic-clonic seizure.<eos> Okay. What does that mean?<eos> If her brain continues to seize, it will eventually wear out and start shutting down.
Say 20 minutes?<eos> It might need a full work-up. 10?<eos> Yeah. 10.<eos> Mm. I lost your engagement ring today.<eos> I tried it on, and it flew off my finger.
There is law and order and a system here<eos> Like hell there is!<eos> What law and order and system do you mean?<eos> The system only grabs<eos> It snatched away our childhood and put guns in our hands

It's an intelligent house.<eos> Is it as intelligent as a squid?<eos> - As a squid?<eos> - Cos it can fit through a hole.<eos> It's intelligent in a way...
- Absolutely, sweetheart.<eos> I've never seen the point of funerals myself.<eos> Nice people all standing around in the kirk while the priest tells a pack of lies about what a great man you were.<eos> Nah, put me out with the recycling.<eos> Purple bin, isn't it, for plastics and dead granddads?
This is a nation founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves.<eos> Moving borders.<eos> They call it American imperialism.<eos> Obama didn't create this movement.<eos> It created him.

Well, I was looking into common issues associated with post-40 pregnancies, and this drug came up.<eos> But there wasn't much on it.<eos> It's Cruvenae...<eos> Cruvenae-tenuestrin.<eos> You probably haven't found much because it's, still in the beta stage.
It works in conjunction with this.<eos> Here.<eos> This is "As above, so below."<eos> That phrase is believed to be the key to all magic.<eos> It means that... what is within me is outside of me.
I would... but I-I didn't know Sofi.<eos> It's a false positive, you understand?<eos> It's an error; it has to be an error.<eos> It's st... it's a statistically impossible data point.<eos> If I drop this phone a thousand times, a million times, and one time it doesn't fall, just once, it hovers... in the air that is an error that's worth looking at.
You don't have a TV?<eos> What do you do after work?<eos> Uh, well, last night, for example,<eos> I, uh... crafted Jules this necklace.<eos> It's, uh, made from the grains of sand that you were standing on when I saw you for the first time.
Spent a couple of hours in the hospital wing.<eos> The con in the bed next to me had had scalding hot water thrown in his face.<eos> Yeah... and they put sugar in it.<eos> Why sugar?<eos> It makes the skin keep burning after the face has dried and it's a Monk family trademark.
..and after going for four seasons every fortnight, we never went again, which meant we never spoke again, really.<eos> See, our common language had gone.<eos> So, no, I don't.

Fuck it, you do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am so, so, sorry. I'm so sorry, your honor.<eos> Your honor, when the district sold my client that land, they understood the financial rewards of the project.<eos> It'll bring millions of dollars to a city that's basically bankrupt.
Wouldn't surprise me if the killer lived in the states.<eos> Did this guy stalk Ahneesah before he killed her?<eos> Anonymous gifts, notes, phone calls.<eos> Ahneesah reported it, but the Windsor cops couldn't do much.<eos> She didn't know who it was, and the guy hadn't broken any laws.
- I'm terrible company.<eos> So am I. I didn't come by to talk.<eos> - Where's your ring?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Oh, it's ... safe deposit box.
Oh, I am that.<eos> But I grant you, it's not all that I am.<eos> Can the cipher be broken?<eos> Perhaps. Eventually.<eos> But it's eminently complex.
They can land near the refuge.<eos> How will they know is she there?<eos> Surely, there is a transmitter reflector on her.<eos> Go! Found it!<eos> - Job, there is a compass, it will react.
I, um, I told him...<eos> I'm not entirely sure, Crowe.<eos> That's rather awkward.<eos> Everyone thinks I have the power to invent new facts when the old ones become dangerous.<eos> They think if they tell me their predicament, it will disappear.
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for her.<eos> But if I met her today, we couldn't walk down the street together without causing harm to one or both of us.<eos> That's the reality of our world.<eos> The integration program isn't perfect.<eos> But it has shown me that there are more humans out there like that girl than there are Red Hawks.
We call this "proximity overlook."<eos> Yeah, well, the rest of the world calls it stalking.<eos> What you're seeing here is aerial surveillance footage of the Bawri Tana marine combat outpost -- or what's left of it.<eos> It was attacked by a suicide bomber at 0800 hours, local time.<eos> The blast killed 12 marines and injured 45 more, making it the deadliest attack on U.S. forces - since the Bagram air base was hit two years ago.
Hang on. The...<eos> All the pieces are the same color.<eos> Would make it hard to play chess.<eos> This chess set isn't hiding a bomb.<eos> It is the bomb.
We didn't know where you were!<eos> We couldn't just wait.<eos> Not after everything that he went through!<eos> You know I love that ring.<eos> Then where the hell is it?
I was confused.<eos> But I didn't have time to be, because I was working my way down the list, and I had to hurry if I was gonna fix my life.<eos> It's almost 7:00.<eos> Aren't you gonna eat?<eos> I can't, I have to finish this essay and make sure it captures the essence of my brand.

The girl on the right is Samantha Royce.<eos> She's a college student at the University of Arizona.<eos> The girl on the left is Mackenzie Bradshaw, daughter of Tom Bradshaw, senior senator from Arizona, chairman of the foreign-relations committee.<eos> The satellite is the Geo-9 that we're selling to Mexico, right?<eos> The Mexican government is counting on it to provide border security, if the senate foreign-relations committee votes "yea."
Will you stop with the cups and the blankets?<eos> It's how they comfort victims in movies.<eos> Okay, I am hereby banning change from this campus.<eos> - You really think that's an effective...<eos> - Guess what, your two cents is change... - ...and it's banned.
Oh, I am that.<eos> But I grant you, it's not all that I am.<eos> Can the cipher be broken?<eos> Perhaps. Eventually.<eos> But it's eminently complex.
So, I think this might have been the kitchen.<eos> Really?<eos> I would say that's probably a hearth.<eos> Strange.<eos> I have no evidence that my ancestor visited this castle, but it was within his operational sphere. So, it is just possible that he walked these very halls.

Different people. It's never the same person twice.<eos> Jolene Parker?<eos> I'm telling you, I don't know any names.<eos> My husband hides a key in the house.<eos> What's it for, a safe deposit box?
Something very strange happened tonight.<eos> I followed her to the cafe, and I'm not quite sure what I saw, but I think she had some kind of pain.<eos> Because of the pregnancy?<eos> That's what it looked like, but it's what happened after.<eos> She reached for her coffee, and I swear she never touched the cup, but it moved away from her hand.
But then again, it always was. - My liege.<eos> - Hey! Focus.<eos> I need to get back on that train.<eos> - Well join the club.<eos> - Where is it?
- I haven't the foggiest.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> I assure you. I do not lie.<eos> My brother Munin trapped me in that jar soon as you got on that train.<eos> Where it is now, I know not.
_<eos> Where are the Hwatab?<eos> I alerted them to some urgent matter inside the Sector so that you and I could straighten some things out without any distractions.<eos> You were gonna tell them what you saw on the flight recorder, weren't you?<eos> Where is it?
Let them go, and I'll get it for you.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> Why don't you take me to the mirzan.<eos> I hid the flight recorder in here.<eos> So... where is it?
Can I help you? Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, Detective Williams with Five-O.<eos> Um, just need to ask you, do you have a rifle on board?<eos> We do. We use it when we go shark fishing.<eos> Okay. What's the problem?<eos> Uh, you're gonna have to point to it, show me where it is.
The kilo was totaled too.<eos> No way!<eos> The capsule was dented and the bell jars were smashed.<eos> What about the kilo itself?<eos> It...
Well, since none of us seem to know what you're actually for, I think your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure.<eos> I want the key to your cypher.<eos> I've had 20 years to work on it.<eos> It's rather good.<eos> Where is it?
I think you need the kick-ass heels.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got those GPS records on the Benjamin case.<eos> Turns out Erica didn't have her phone.<eos> And you're gonna be very interested to hear where it was located.
It still wouldn't work.<eos> Well, uh, of course it would work.<eos> It couldn't.<eos> Because some things cannot be undone.<eos> As much as you want to un-ring the bell, it's rung.
These tracks were left 260 million years ago.<eos> So you want to know the age of the earth?<eos> Just figure out how long it took to deposit each layer and then, instead of counting the "Begats," add up all the layers.<eos> Easy, right?<eos> We know from observing this process, Just one problem, because it still happens today in oceans and lakes around the world. That sediments can be laid down at widely different rates.
Lead is a neurotoxin.<eos> When you ship your tetraethyl lead from the factory... before you add it to the gasoline... it's handled just like a chemical weapon.<eos> There's a reason for that.<eos> Where do you suppose all that lead goes after it leaves the tailpipe?<eos> Think about what it might be doing to us and our kids.
It's gonna be smooth sailing from here.<eos> Sync and corrections by masaca<eos> Fashionably late as usual, I see.<eos> I have a problem.<eos> Would you like to know what it is?
Couple of things jumped out at me about Walt Yeager.<eos> Like what?<eos> Single guy, holds down a six-figure-a-year job.<eos> He owns a home south of broad.<eos> So why would a man like that break into a home to presumably rob it?
It's one of those buildings with all the drawers in the walls where they keep people's ashes.<eos> I'm gonna need a court order for those ashes.<eos> I want to find that ring.<eos> I can get you an order.<eos> But it might not be from the court.
Mm, you might not be the best judge of that.<eos> No, no, see the thing is I could... sort of use some help.<eos> I'm a little lost. I...<eos> I can't find my car.<eos> What does it look like?
Let me help you.<eos> You know, when I was in Vietnam, they told me who the enemy was and I believed them.<eos> But when I got home, do you know what I saw?<eos> What?<eos> I saw the real enemy... and it's right here.
- Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> - The whole thing just donged on me.<eos> - Donged? ! I think you mean "dawned."<eos> No, I mean donged.<eos> You hit a gong, it makes a dong sound, and then you realize something.
I've been told that you want to see me.<eos> Please, take a seat, Simone.<eos> We have a letter that we need to give to you.<eos> The letter's from the Assistant Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police and is signed by him.<eos> It says that we're aware you are in a relationship and living with Malcolm John Webster.
Just... so much chaos, you know?<eos> - But...<eos> - You found it.<eos> No.<eos> No, it was given to me.
Droids and apostrophes, I could write a book, except you are... barely a Droid any more.<eos> There's more human in you than machine.<eos> So tell me...<eos> what do you think of the view?<eos> It is beautiful.
The war hero.<eos> You didn't get enough gunfire overseas?<eos> I have the necklace.<eos> Let her go.<eos> So, where is it?
- Yeah.<eos> - Oh, right. - I mean, come on, you saw yourself.<eos> Scott only reads the first page of a scout's report - before passing it on, right?<eos> - Yeah. So we get Abe's letter and we fold it into a report, yeah?<eos> And then watch it sail right into Georgia's hands.
check your e-mail.<eos> You sent this from my account?<eos> I wish you'd stop using my e-mail.<eos> Where did this come from?<eos> I posted a photo of the symbol on Reddit, asking what it meant.
Hannah!<eos> There's a spider in there.<eos> Oh, can't be that bad.<eos> Wait till you see it. Where is it?<eos> Wait till you see it.
Could we have a moment?<eos> What an eventful day.<eos> Francis's return, news of the queen's death... and this.<eos> News from the Vatican.<eos> If this letter confirms Sebastian's legitimization, it should take away any reservations you have about a bastard at your side instead of a king, as Bash will be king one day.
It overtakes you.<eos> The fury.<eos> You try to let it go.<eos> I prayed for it.<eos> But it consumes you.
When Pam found me in France, I felt the same way you do-- nihilistic, prepared to die.<eos> Wanting to die.<eos> This disease, it doesn't just destroy the body--<eos> It's not the disease, Eric.<eos> Nobody's talking about it, but it attacks-- it attacks the spirit.
[deep voice] I'm you. [laughs]<eos> Rapunzel, it's not a witch.<eos> It's you.<eos> You said she appeared after you had the night root.<eos> You thought it didn't work, but it did.

Oh, I can't believe this.<eos> I know he's been down about the whole, you know, fecalmaster thing.<eos> There's no need to thank me.<eos> It's just a small gesture to brighten his day.<eos> My day isn't just bright, it's blinding!
Good.<eos> How's the diary?<eos> Look, don't be mad, but I've stopped it.<eos> It's your diary.<eos> It was useful when I was struggling, but I'm not... so... it's not.
- Human blood is salty and sweet.<eos> I know from experience. If you cut the chest of a woman, looks like a coconut milk filter.<eos> Full of holes.<eos> There was a communist woman.<eos> She lived with her brother. But it was not a Communist.
Hello, Pastor, or may I call you Kingston?<eos> I do feel, given the intimacy of this moment, we should be on first-name terms.<eos> By the time you see this, I will have spent some quality time with your son.<eos> I have a lesson about the nature of true faith.<eos> Actually, it's not just a lesson for him, but you, your followers, and the entire world.
They.- All of them.. Those who didn't vacate their houses..<eos> ...their houses were burnt down.. ...those who didn't sell themselves, their deaths were bought.. ...and people like me, who tried to raise their voice, were silenced.<eos> And no one did anything? What can anyone do?<eos> This cancer is not restricted to one part of the country.<eos> It has spread all across the country. If you cure the cancer in Dombivali..
Now each ring is distinguishable by its setting--<eos> Gauche like those that wear them.<eos> Klaus thinks you have the white oak stake.<eos> But we don't.<eos> That doesn't matter because if they think you have it it means they don't know where it is.
Fancy.<eos> What else you got?<eos> You're wasting your time, Voldemort.<eos> I'm as much a part of this Warehouse as you are,<eos> - and it won't let you kill me.
The one that, if I died, I hoped would have been delivered.<eos> Not stuck in the ground with me.<eos> No man wants to think that his last words wouldn't make it home.<eos> I told myself I'd carry it home. To you.<eos> Where is it?
- Yes.<eos> - What!<eos> No!<eos> If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem.<eos> All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks.
I knew you would make the right choice.<eos> What's that?<eos> A very special pendant.<eos> Each of the witches In the sisterhood wears one.<eos> Guard it with your life because, in many ways, it now is your life.
Have you ever seen it?<eos> No.<eos> All I know is he was really worried about it.<eos> Wanted to get it to someone who would understand.<eos> - So where else could it be?
- So where else could it be?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't even know what we're looking for.<eos> Well, he didn't drive all the way here without it, so it has to be here somewhere.<eos> When he told you about it, he was trying to get out of bed, like he was gonna show you where it was.
And what the hell was he doing way out here?<eos> Well, he wouldn't be the first guy to come out here chasing a payday, Mr. Stokes.<eos> Loot from the robbery was never recovered.<eos> There's a million-dollar treasure out here just waiting to be found.<eos> Local lore-- they say it's still out here somewhere.
We had to cut Vulcan loose.<eos> What?<eos> What happened?<eos> His lawyers are claiming that it's not him in that photo.<eos> And since Vulcan doesn't have any vehicles registered to his name, we can't prove that it is.
It is a choice.<eos> You are only what you choose.<eos> That alone is what makes you.<eos> Do you know what you choose?<eos> Then hold onto that choice, because it's your salvation.
- The gem.<eos> The gem.<eos> Get me the gem.<eos> Oh, my God, the gem.<eos> Where is it?
Well, I posted that photo of you in my bed on Instagram, but... I'm not gonna say anything.<eos> It was one night.<eos> It's not like we're a couple.<eos> Besides, she's probably calling to gush about her sex life, not ask about mine.<eos> JT, the gem that keeps Vincent from beasting out, where is it?
I can't succeed without your help.<eos> I'll need money. And resources.<eos> Your bank accounts are already fully funded.<eos> This is a hard drive with all of Simmons' research, both Coulson and Skye's blood work, all the data on the guest house drug.<eos> If there's a key to how this stuff works, you'll find it in there.
Spoiler alert...<eos> we can't seem to find one.<eos> I think we have.<eos> Garrett and Cybertek have been working together for years.<eos> - If it's on Garrett's system...
Hey. So the animal bone fragment Finn gave me turned out to be a piece of narwhal tusk.<eos> What is a piece of narwhal tusk doing in the remains?<eos> That I cannot explain.<eos> And to add to the delicious complexity of this find, I did radiometric dating on it.<eos> It's at least a thousand years old.
So, we were wrong?<eos> Cheryl didn't kill Harry.<eos> Yeah, it looks that way, but I'm not giving up.<eos> I know the real killer is somewhere on the key log of the members that were at the club the day of the murder.<eos> We have that document right there, but it's not gonna help you.
Find out anything about that adoption agency?<eos> Not much. After Putin made it illegal for Americans to adopt Russian kids,<eos> Angels of Kirov just sort of disappeared.<eos> Uh, still can't get into the phone either, but it turns out it doesn't actually...<eos> Turns out it doesn't actually belong to the victim.
- We thought it was Josh.<eos> - But it couldn't have been because Josh wouldn't have called his own father by his last name.<eos> - He just would have called him "Dad."<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So if the dead guy wasn't Josh, why would John claim that it was?
How about a grease fire in the middle of a Fourth of July Parade?<eos> Pulled into a car wash, put the flames out, still made the "1812 Overture."<eos> So, what you're saying is that this is a death trap.<eos> No, what I'm saying is this car is indestructible.<eos> After the apocalypse, it, my mother and cockroaches will be the only things that survive.
You're the cultural anthropologist.<eos> What is this?<eos> Wilt Chamberlain's Jersey number.<eos> Yeah, th-this symbol was found at a crime scene today.<eos> - It means something.
No!<eos> $1,800 it is, then.<eos> I'm not... I'm not buying this car.<eos> Walden, this car is a piece of your life.<eos> It doesn't mean anything to anybody else in the world except you.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Our esteemed board members and our renowned faculty.<eos> Tonight, we are proud to unveil the museum's latest acquisition.<eos> A most rare specimen.<eos> And while it did cost a pretty penny, we trust that this new exhibit will bring thousands of visitors from around the globe.
There's no hiding it.<eos> It's just who we are.<eos> Now, you... you carry your shame on the inside.<eos> You keep it trapped in there.<eos> It eats away at you, feeding on you like a living thing, till there's nothing left but the rot.
- you don't have to pay me back for anything.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> According to my sponsor, I need to start to be accountable.<eos> Don't mess with my program, okay?<eos> It's working.
When dad retired, I had to horse-trade him for the number, and he only had it a couple of weeks.<eos> Please tell me you remember his name.<eos> No.<eos> But I remember that he was a real hotshot, and I remember that I had to give up this great number for it.<eos> What was it?
It was clear that something was weighing heavy on his heart, And he needed my help to free himself.<eos> I see that as my job, detective.<eos> Isn't that what confession's for?<eos> [ chuckles ] well, I'm a fan of the ritual.<eos> But it doesn't always give people what they need.
No, I mean, he's trained to cover his emotions.<eos> He's a closed book.<eos> And I'm almost positive he never mentioned Iraq.<eos> PTSD. Paranoia.<eos> You know guys like that can't keep a lid on it forever, right?
You went to medical school in Guam.<eos> Before that, you actually worked as a grave digger, and you carry around a 300-year-old pocket watch.<eos> So, Henry Morgan, what's your story?<eos> Well, I won't bore you with the details, but the watch was a gift.<eos> Legend has it had belonged to a doctor seeking passage on a ship from Africa.
The moon isn't breaking apart.<eos> The moon is hatching!<eos> The moon's an egg.<eos> Has it, erm...<eos> Has it always... been an egg?
What kind of soldier would I be dying with bullets in my gun?<eos> - Fifty seconds.<eos> - Someone shut that man up!<eos> For the record, it didn't even flinch.<eos> Where is it now?
But there's gotta be some type of way.<eos> There's always a way.<eos> It just depends On how much "way" you can handle.<eos> There's a spyware program that I've used before.<eos> It could open a back door in arcadia's firewall,
Stay there for a minute.<eos> You have a basement, somewhere you can hide?<eos> Basement, no, no basement.<eos> We can hide in the church.<eos> Where is it?
The only reason he'd be carrying a briefcase like that is if he's using it to access the bank's data remotely.<eos> I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> So tell me about Natasha's key.<eos> It's a flash drive with encrypted code on it. Plug it into the laptop.<eos> It uploads a tap that allows us to access and track all the bank's data.
MONTE: I know you could use it.<eos> Mind if I have a look-see here, Officer?<eos> Why did you bring him back here?<eos> - He had the ledger.<eos> - Where is it?
Fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.<eos> It's nitrite poisoning.<eos> A few hundred milligrams can be toxic, although not in this case fatal.<eos> So which one of these clowns do I demote for trying to kill me?<eos> Once you stop ingesting nitrite, it naturally leaves your body.
Sure, put the commissioner through.<eos> All right, keep me informed.<eos> Hey, Commissioner... Hey.<eos> We get anything on that phrase on the wall?<eos> Ran it through a quick translation program, and it says something like,
Come on!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Where is the moon?<eos> It died!<eos> I became a guardian and it died!
Then there are super-fans, who become part of the show's family.<eos> Then there are psycho super-fans who end up hiding in your closet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's why the container's in my name...<eos> To keep the psycho super-fans from finding out it belongs to Jon.
That was your story. Look, man, I got one of those too.<eos> Okay, but those stories that we tell that keep us going... man, sometimes they blind us.<eos> They take us to dark places. The kind of place where I might beat the crap out of a good man just for the fun of it.<eos> The people who love me... they pulled me back from that edge.<eos> Cole, once you touch that darkness... it never goes away.
I assume that's something you made?<eos> I'll do whatever it takes to get my sister back.<eos> I can tell you care about her a lot.<eos> I'm sorry about her necklace.<eos> Where is it?
You can't just drop a theory like that and leave.<eos> Governor, the helplessness you feel will incline you to irrational behavior.<eos> So please, resist the temptation to do anything stupid, like standing in my way.<eos> SYLVESTER: I checked the AVG scanner, came up with nothing.<eos> If we can find a signature in the viral code, it'll tell us who sent it.
But I wanna see what happens if I can juice these four apples.<eos> Right, so that's four apples.<eos> That's the sugar from four apples in one glass.<eos> Now, one apple is about four teaspoons of sugar, so that's 16 teaspoons of sugar in that glass.<eos> See, nature has given us this perfect little packet, and it's got all the nutrients, the fibre that tells us when we're full, and just the right amount of sugar in this.
I had a chicken dish last night that was pretty sweet.<eos> And I could just tell that my body feels lethargic and it's waiting for its next sugar injection.<eos> So the perfectly named UpGo is gonna start my day today.<eos> Banana flavoured with, uh... about four to five teaspoons of sugar.<eos> It was obvious that sugar was affecting me physically, but the real surprise was the impact it was having on my moods.
Society has changed.<eos> 200 years ago there was not a society in the world when they had a festival that was basing what they ate and what they drank on sugar.<eos> Today, it has become synonymous with any celebration.<eos> But, more profoundly, it is one of the simplest ways we communicate love.<eos> I think the reason that sugar has become so ingrained is that it actually evokes love.
If we're feeling upset, what do we do?<eos> We have some sugar, "Oh, I feel better."<eos> If there's not enough sweetness in our life, not enough love,<eos> "Oh, I'll just have some chocolate."<eos> With sugar having such complex associations with our hearts, minds and bodies, I wonder if it is having far greater ramifications for the culture than we've considered.
A-Am I a bad person?<eos> I mean, take the money.<eos> - Take the check.<eos> - No.<eos> It's not free.
Central America, then.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> No.<eos> Remember I told you I discovered an extra gene on the virus?<eos> All this time I've been struggling to figure out where it came from.
- I'm Lauren.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Well, I've had a cough for a few weeks.<eos> I thought it was a cold and figured it would just go away, but I've reached my breaking point. [Coughs]
That's $100 a square yard.<eos> How much are you losing per day, at the tables?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Now, to avoid the cost of re-wiring your ceiling cams, these pressure pads, going under the carpet, will be linked to a Brownian motion program I developed.<eos> It's based on the principle that people naturally move in random patterns.
That's great.<eos> So, what's wrong?<eos> We're running standard protocol searches through the Chauvenet files. We got a hit on this.<eos> I recognize that address.<eos> If you replace the number 13 in the file name with the word "thirteen," it becomes an anagram.
(gasping) You know I'm a butcher, right?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Duke will be back soon.<eos> I'm looking for Lorelei's stenotab.<eos> Do you know where it is?
I just want him to ask a girl to dance and for her to say yes, and I don't want him to be crushed...<eos> Okay, let's get you to the dance, Mr. Sharp!<eos> Could you moan more softly, please?<eos> Oh, God, I am crashing, Axl, and I'm crashing hard.<eos> I rode the caffeine pony, and it took me to the depths of hell.
Once this is over, I'd like that.<eos> May hates coffee.<eos> See?<eos> So it's like a ... a small disease.<eos> - A virus, yes, and it's going through ... through the plane's electrical systems.
Meanwhile, now we know HYDRA is searching for evidence of the alien writing.<eos> That's not good.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> And that's not the worst of it.<eos> The analysis of the painting came back ... it is 500 years old.
This is crazy!<eos> I found a Starter log on his comm-it's the virus!<eos> He must have kept the virus inactive within his neurochips.<eos> His infiltration was unexpectedly quick.<eos> So, it combines victims' memories of past hostility with objects in front of them to plant instantaneous false memories?
You know I'm a butcher, right?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Duke will be back soon.<eos> I'm looking for Lorelei's stenotab.<eos> Do you know where it is?
Has it already been two years?<eos> Time flies.<eos> How much longer are we gonna listen--<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh. This sound is the opposite sound of your voice, and I so enjoy it.<eos> How did it even get here, Damon?
Jesse, tell me you have the key.<eos> I left it in the ignition and now it's not there.<eos> - Tell me you have the fucking key!<eos> - I don't have the key.<eos> - Where is it?
So, for example, if I wanted to see the content of your email, or, you know, your wife's phone calls, or anything like that, all I have to do is use what's called a "selector,"<eos> any kind of thing in the communications chain that might uniquely or almost uniquely identify you as an individual.<eos> And I'm talking about things like email addresses,<eos> IP addresses, phone numbers, credit cards, um, even passwords that are unique to you that aren't used by anyone else.<eos> I can input those into the system, and it will not only go back through the database and go, "Have I seen this anywhere in the past?"
You want me to believe you're on some kind of psychotic lark. But I'm not buying it.<eos> You're on a mission.<eos> You need to find that aether that William hid.<eos> Somebody finally clued you in.<eos> What is it for?
Pow-wow.<eos> You called it a pow-wow!<eos> So, Detective Peralta, you found some "new" evidence last night. Correction:<eos> I found some damning new evidence last night.<eos> It was hidden in an old dumbwaiter in the defendant's house.
Oh, no.<eos> - Hey! Program is hacking your laptop.<eos> It's overridden the deletion sequence.<eos> It's fighting back.<eos> What was it doing?
Those girls are in danger.<eos> I've lived in that house.<eos> I know. Jack:<eos> Know what?<eos> You don't believe in the spirit world, but it's real.
Until an associate clued me in.<eos> A heart.<eos> Well, if you need my help procuring it, know the only help I give you is with your demise.<eos> Oh, you're gonna help me, all right.<eos> You see, this spell is gonna finally separate me from the dagger so it no longer holds power over me.
Who sent you? What do you know?<eos> Nobody sent me.<eos> Nobody, uh...<eos> This, it sent me.<eos> The object, it sent me. (STAMMERING)
This is open-and-shut.<eos> What about the artifact?<eos> We need to find it.<eos> Whoever had them steal it, it and they are long gone by now.<eos> Someone has to know where it is.
Think I can borrow Lucky the King's car?<eos> No.<eos> Not unless you've got something he wants.<eos> Router speed is ten times what it was.<eos> It will never break down, and from now on, it's free.
Before he was arrested,<eos> Rex dropped the malware into a lady's shopping bag.<eos> And then he contacted me just before you guys picked me up.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I-I accessed the records of that store, what's it called?
Do you have it?<eos> It's right here.<eos> It's pebbles from the mine.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where is it?
It started as a prank... and ended in murder.<eos> They thought they could burythepast... but this Halloween, they're going to learn-- evil begets evil!<eos> Allow me to introduce you to our killer- - Jack Knife.<eos> Released in 1984, it was originally panned by critics as a pale knockoff of John Carpenter's Halloween.<eos> However, in recent years, it is enjoying a well-deserved, rabid cult following from...
I'm the same guy I've always been...<eos> I'm a conservationist.<eos> And as you pointed out, I'm a businessman.<eos> I understand the law of supply and demand.<eos> As long as the market exists... And it will always exist... there will be people willing to meet the demand.
I mean, let's just arrest this freak.<eos> He's good for it.<eos> And frankly, you don't need to deal with his lawyer.<eos> Why?<eos> Who is it?
Well, Gwen, I'm happy to say that it's clear you are not involved in any criminal activity.<eos> Be good.<eos> Bye! Drive safe.<eos> Put the fake phones in her room.<eos> She'll show you where it is.
He always had a cigarette in his mouth, cowboy hat on, you know?<eos> And he'd go take his hat off and go like this, turn, and then ride off into the desert for a while.<eos> Brought the horse inside the Rancho one time.<eos> We thought it'd be cool.<eos> And it just started to unload its bowels all over the floor.
Have fun with your gym fling.<eos> Leave me to mine.<eos> Ok.<eos> Where's the last piece?<eos> Where is it? This isn't happening.
He told me that during his time there, he shared a cell with a man who was a great interpreter of dreams.<eos> A man who could divine the future.<eos> Was he speaking of you?<eos> I have been plagued by the same dream for many months now.<eos> Tell me what it means and I will spare your life.
I can go one better.<eos> By measuring the wood ash over the length of the burn, we can determine whether our jet was throttling up or throttling down, so to speak.<eos> And?<eos> Tip to tip, the intensity of the burn drops 20%.<eos> Wait, so it was slowing down?
- Sir, high and low.<eos> There's no sign of this corpse I am off to Unionville now to try to find the widow of the corpse, as it were,<eos> - to see if she has a photograph.<eos> - Does this corpse have a name?<eos> It does... or he does.
- Right away, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Any luck in the bookshop?<eos> Sir, the one copy of Mark Twain's novella was purchased by a young waitress.<eos> It was later stolen, possibly by a man who was seen in the park.
- Did you take the shard of glass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How did you know to take it?<eos> I knew that Finch had taken the photograph.<eos> When I saw you begin to examine the fractured negative, I knew what it would depict.
- These guys are so dumb, huh?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> See? He's an asshole.<eos> Fuc[bleep] him.<eos> Each time you go into the virtual world, it becomes more and more dangerous.
Not my favorite Guard member.<eos> Or mine.<eos> He went after Charlotte the other day.<eos> Ever since his trouble kicked in and he suffocated those people at the hospital, he's been desperate for a cure.<eos> So he stole the aether 'cause he thinks it can turn off his trouble?
- It's like I have no past.<eos> - Of course you have a past.<eos> And with time you'll feel more and more connected to it and to them.<eos> Opens and close, please.<eos> We cling to memories as if they define us, but... they really don't.
My mind is human.<eos> My body is manufactured.<eos> I'm the first of my kind, but...<eos> I won't be the last.<eos> We cling to memories as if they define us.
Well, I have a request.<eos> Don't call her Jo.<eos> I met you today and you think I'm gonna name my daughter after you?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I've been a nanny to a lot of children who've grown up and if they don't see fit...
Do you know where he is, Ella?<eos> Bill?<eos> No, not a clue, he just vanished.<eos> But by the way, it was really nice to see you reading to those kids.<eos> They really loved you.
You didn't give me a choice.<eos> Claire didn't.<eos> It's our job to give Michael a future.<eos> You know, I used to teach kids your age.<eos> I thought they loved me, but they just didn't want to listen anymore.
Huh? Take your hand off me.<eos> You could've bought another ticket.<eos> I will leave you.<eos> You touch me like that again, and i will fucking leave you!<eos> The injuries were many And they were severe.
- Anti-pickle serum.<eos> - It's anti-pickle serum.<eos> Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.<eos> My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.<eos> They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.
Well, then how long, Nora? How long before you move past it?<eos> Move past what?<eos> That you lost your kids.<eos> I did not lose them!<eos> My kids are not dead. They are gone.
Oh, no. No.<eos> No, I always hoped I would, but I'm married to the law, and you can't very well have book babies... now, can you?<eos> Well, you dodged a bullet.<eos> Let me tell you, those children are monsters.<eos> I open my home to them, and all they do is complain.
We're gonna catch that scum bag.<eos> Instead of working shoulder to shoulder with him?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Things may not have worked out between Gay and me, but she was always there for the kids.<eos> She loved them, and they loved her, and now she's gone.
Well, he's not at his favorite bar stool drinking imaginary bourbon to wash his guilt away, so now what?<eos> Damon's in here, all right.<eos> If this is his subconscious, that means he's responsible for everything that happens, including... this animal attack.<eos> All we have to do is follow the clues,<eos> - and they should lead us right to him.
As Freud says, "We are what we are because we have been what we have been."<eos> Now what does he mean?<eos> Our dreams represent unfulfilled wishes.<eos> When repressed, these deep desires can be masked.<eos> But if we analyze... if we listen... they will reveal what it is our unconscious mind truly wants.
Will... look at me.<eos> I'm telling you, from one professional to another, I'm not fishing.<eos> We have everything.<eos> Including your kids.<eos> ♪ ♪ Where are they?
How about, "Good morning"?<eos> I brought some gifts for you and your children, I hope that's acceptable,<eos> I wasn't going to come all this way empty-handed.<eos> My children? Are they here?<eos> Where are they?
Did you ever see Jason do that trick where you'd pull a card out of the deck and it turns out it's in his pocket?<eos> Yeah. When he was a kid.<eos> Yeah. I saw him do it once up on the pediatric oncology ward.<eos> I guess he used to go up there a couple times a week to do magic for the kids.<eos> And man, did they love it.
First of all, boy, did it do a good impression of you, and second, you got there just in time.<eos> Speaking of that White Martian...<eos> When it was me, did you have a conversation?<eos> Because I have these memories.<eos> They're like a... Almost like a dream, that we talked. But I'm not really sure if that was real.
I understand.<eos> Is money enough?<eos> There's also this.<eos> Arendt's children?<eos> He will know that I will know where they are every day that he's in jail.
I know you and I are going to get along together just fine.<eos> It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard.<eos> I've had that said to me a million times if I have once.<eos> People would laugh at me because I use big words.<eos> But they're exciting and descriptive words, like...
Yeah, some people just need a nanny.<eos> So, do you want to, um, come over for dinner tonight?<eos> What about the kids?<eos> With the kids.<eos> You seem to like kids. They seem to like you.
I have heard great orators of yore make hay from more dire situations than this, Agent Thomas.<eos> Sometimes all the people need are some words of leadership.<eos> People of Washington!<eos> Switch off your mobile devices!<eos> They are dangerous!
Aw, look.<eos> Petra's babies are warming up... to Anezka.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Oh, I just missed them so much.<eos> And they missed their Auntie Anezka. Hmm?
Can you talk to her?<eos> Please?<eos> Well, it seems she made up her mind.<eos> You know, it's ironic.<eos> You give your kids this-this-this magical, privileged life so they don't have to know how black they are...
Men, woman, children.<eos> Yes.<eos> All those children dead because of you.<eos> No!<eos> The children... they're alive!
- Are you sure?<eos> - I've spent 30 years building an intelligence network of spies, informants, patriots, traitors.<eos> I've used it to build an empire that exists for only two reasons... to keep me free and you safe.<eos> Elizabeth, I may not be there, but I have eyes and ears everywhere.<eos> And they tell me the Debt Collector is coming for you, which means he's the next Blacklister.
Never very much.<eos> Clearly, I never did.<eos> I always hid these things from myself...<eos> The certainty of my desires...<eos> They always came...
No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I don't have anywhere to go.<eos> Those kids are so lucky to have you.<eos> No, they're not lucky at all.<eos> They're not lucky.
"As Eugene's eyes became accustomed to the haze... "of the cigarettes and cigars swirling miasma-like... "he saw a woman, in serge...<eos> "as he is undone by its rosy, promising pinkness.<eos> "Those were her arms.<eos> "But it was her eyes that stopped his breath... "and made his heart leap up.<eos> "Blue they were.
- Yeah, everyone's good.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Copacetic on the island.<eos> How are those washed-out pictures you're taking because you still have the lighting optimizer on?<eos> They're not...
Jesus.<eos> Nut the fuck up.<eos> It's just a college party, you nance.<eos> Chill!<eos> Hey, here they are.
You bastard.<eos> Those men had wives, families. They deserve to know.<eos> I could imagine a woman on a widows walk... I could see her on the roof of her house... looking out across the horizon, waiting for her husband to return from the sea.<eos> I thought about all those sailors children. Lost at sea... has a much nicer ring to it than dead.<eos> They could still hope that way.
Take them to the cells.<eos> Don't hurt those creatures.<eos> Nothing in there is dangerous.<eos> Please don't hurt my creatures.<eos> They aren't dangerous!
Mr Khama, you are a protectorate, which differentiates you somewhat from other colonies.<eos> Meaning the mineral rights should be vested with the people of my country.<eos> Ordinarily, yes, but you have been placed under direct rule. Your situation may have become vulnerable.<eos> My grandfather negotiated those rights.<eos> I know they remain with us.
Yeah, a dead one.<eos> You're doing it again. I hate it when you do that.<eos> Hate it when I do what?<eos> Stare at the photos like they're about to start moving.<eos> They are talkin' and movin'.
I'm going around... hooking up wiring all over from here to San Diego.<eos> Baby, I want to believe you... but I can't keep uprooting this family... in the middle of the night again.<eos> I can't do that, okay?<eos> These kids need to trust me.<eos> They need to believe that we're in a family... that we're a unit, that they're secure.
Five years ago, the American people, torn apart by war, cried out into the darkness and turned a hopeful ear to the void for an answer.<eos> Americans needed a dream and I gave them one.<eos> A transcontinental railroad that would unite this nation and its people.<eos> Dreams don't come pretty, they don't come clean and they sure as hell don't come simple...<eos> They come true.
We are so close.<eos> This isn't what I signed up for.<eos> It is exactly what you signed up for.<eos> We're cutting up children.<eos> They present as children.
That's why we survived.<eos> The snow looked so beautiful, it...<eos> Charles?<eos> The children were playing in it.<eos> They were the first to die... 15 of them.
Hello?<eos> Martin?<eos> Diana, where are you?<eos> I told you not to hurt my children.<eos> They don't know any better.
And I wake up.<eos> Oh, it's just your mind working on things.<eos> This process is not about epiphanies.<eos> Dreams matter, mind.<eos> And they're part of the architecture.
These two rug-chomping dykebats called Animal Services on my babies!<eos> All right-- all right!<eos> Would you just calm down, and tell me the story without the gay bashing.<eos> Look, man, I've had Michael, Tito, LaToya, Marlon, and Janet since they were eight weeks old.<eos> They're not licensed.
What is it about boys and their coddled eggs?<eos> Whoa, so orange.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't eat these.<eos> Flanders has freshly-pooped eggs, orange as a sunset over a field of ripe Doritos, while these-- look, I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking-- store eggs are yellow.<eos> They're yellow eggs, Marge.
It came out of her vagina. So no, I don't want to hold it.<eos> Really puts things in perspective.<eos> You know, the whole circle of life thing.<eos> Yeah, it's true.<eos> Yeah, you raise kids, teach them everything you know, and then they grow up to stab you in the back.
Oh, how I've missed this jewel.<eos> Now, it's your turn to pay up.<eos> I wish I could retrieve your memories, but I no longer have them.<eos> What?<eos> Where are they?
This isn't only the past.<eos> You will also see the future.<eos> Not possible future.<eos> Not a prediction.<eos> You are looking at events as they will happen.
Waters a bit rough, are they?<eos> What-what the hell are you doing?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm going to brutally torture you until you give me what I want.<eos> My wings... where are they?
You want some juice with your eggs, honey?<eos> - I don't like eggs.<eos> - What?<eos> Since when don't you like eggs?<eos> They're a wondrously scrumptious start to your day.
We've all had our dalliances with your kind.<eos> There was a stable boy who worked the horses when I was Mary's age.<eos> And it's not because you bore my husband's children.<eos> That's nothin' more than free labor.<eos> But my children, they were the one thing I was promised would be mine.

I need to get to my kids.<eos> Those aren't your kids!<eos> Those are human beings you turned into bloodsuckers in a sex den.<eos> Just because you put a stamp on 'em doesn't make 'em yours!<eos> (grunts) They don't belong to me.
- No.<eos> - Good.<eos> "Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been and there you will always long to return."<eos> You know what's remarkable about those words?<eos> - They were written 300 years before man first got in a plane.
How much is the deposit?<eos> Um... 30% down, which comes to 195.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Cash okay?<eos> And then she picked up my babies, one on each hip, and she whispered into their ears and they both stopped crying immediately, and I was like,
You think before all that, Hurricane Carter ever shot somebody?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you gonna be for Halloween?<eos> My mom found this picture on Instagram of these kids, they were shadows.<eos> So they crept up next to kids, other kids, and they used to spook 'em out and look like shadows.
What the hell did you do?<eos> I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own, so I made some friends who could help.<eos> Who are these friends?<eos> Alaric's babies are the future of the coven.<eos> They're inside of you.
He didn't want them to see what he was doing to their kid.<eos> Then why not just kill them immediately?<eos> I mean, he must have a reason for rendering the parents functionally blind first.<eos> You know, the sand in the eyes could be a purely symbolic gesture.<eos> The Sandman was a mythical character who would sprinkle magic dust in the eyes of children while they slept.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> So, Don is at the top of the hill, and I'm down at the bottom, the kids are on the sled, and the snow was like frozen, thick ice.<eos> And I think, "It's okay.<eos> Even if they come too fast, I can stop them."<eos> Well, Don let them go, and they are starting to rush down the hill. Whoosh!
Oh, so not only aren't you half the man the ballads say, you're old and slow.<eos> Hey.<eos> Animals are better hunters and trackers than we are.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because they know how to stop.
Just flashes.<eos> My mom's smile.<eos> The smell of my dad's shirts.<eos> Mostly just... this feeling of being safe.<eos> Those memories, that's all that I have and they mean everything to me.
How many people... We haven't even processed.<eos> And our kids?<eos> Are we putting them in danger?<eos> I mean... We're a target now.<eos> Are they?
Yeah, it's beautiful.<eos> Across here.<eos> This is where we will build our tomorrow.<eos> Unfortunately, all these trees will have to go, except for the pines.<eos> They age better.
Around here somewhere...<eos> Please.<eos> I am one thing, but... but not my children.<eos> Where...?<eos> Please, where are they?
I know this patient.<eos> This is Gretchen McKay.<eos> What's your name, honey?<eos> My kids, please.<eos> Are they okay?
tell me what you remember.<eos> And nothing is too strange or weird to mention.<eos> The thing that took Libby was naked and pale.<eos> Except for the eyes.<eos> I swear to God, they flashed green for a second.
Got the guy from the pawnshop looking through mugshots.<eos> - We're trying to get fingerprints off the bracelet, the watch and the earrings.<eos> - Good.<eos> Serial killers don't take trophies to sell them.<eos> - They've got a different value.
It's just a flower dance.<eos> Let me just show you what I mean.<eos> Okay, so, the kids...<eos> They're stacked up, and then flower, flower.<eos> They're... They're exploding, fanning out.
Yes, well, that doesn't prove their innocence.<eos> Yeah, but these confessions sure don't mean they're guilty.<eos> _<eos> The boys' confessions were contaminated, coerced.<eos> Let's forget they existed.
It's arguably the greatest discovery in the last 50 years.<eos> Now, this, Dr. Baker, is what I need your expertise with.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Oh, you see these grooves.<eos> They indicate it was a wheel-made lamp versus the mold-based ones that became so popular in the '40s...
My kids should've<eos> - never been involved in this!<eos> - Our kids!<eos> My kids.<eos> They're mine, Caroline.
He ditches me.<eos> And you, too, by the way.<eos> And rides off into the sunset with Auntie Amara.<eos> He needed my help, and he'd say anything to get it.<eos> His words, your words, they mean nothing.
Well, I've been juggling my whole life, Jimbo.<eos> That's great.<eos> You know, as long as you're happy,<eos> I am a big believer in modeling happiness.<eos> Kids, they-they mirror so much of what they see.
Who the hell is that?<eos> That's the body of Jonas Walker.<eos> We stopped him from going on a shooting rampage, just as you tried and failed to do, between 11:14 and 11:17.<eos> - 20 seconds.<eos> - We know the events of tonight because, for us, they've already happened.
Man, here's the thing. Man, I... it's hard for me to care about this when nobody cares about me as a black human man, you feel me?<eos> Like, Caitlyn Jenner is just doing what rich white men been doing since the dawn of time, which is whatever the hell he want.<eos> So why should I care?<eos> What make him so special?<eos> But... but as a black man in this country, shouldn't you care about the civil liberties of others, - since they're so closely related to... - Mm.
Yes, we-we do animal testing.<eos> On rats, or chimpanzees, or...<eos> Uh, both.<eos> Um, why?<eos> So these animals you test, uh, do they go on to live long and healthy lives?
What is that?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Mitch?<eos> The animals are behaving just like they acted in Mozambique.<eos> They weren't coming after us.
The mission comes first.<eos> Stop him.<eos> I can hack into the system, slow him down with the warrant, stall him for a couple hours, maybe, but eventually, he will be coming!<eos> Why these memories?<eos> They could be random... or these memories were so strong they survived your arrival.
So unless I cross it, I'm not in violation of your restraining order.<eos> Edward Nance, murdered...<eos> It doesn't matter where you stand.<eos> You can't slander Mr. Vachs with false accusations.<eos> Oh, but they're not false.
Eat me.<eos> It's all I'm good for.<eos> Rose:<eos> Now, now, that's not true at all.<eos> Sure, all these places have been explored before, but they haven't been recorded so intimately as they have been in this journal.
I get all messed up.<eos> What is it... about me... for you?<eos> It's your face.<eos> It's... your eyes.<eos> It sounds stupid, but it's like they're lit from behind.
I'm always on him about the old neighborhood.<eos> It's because of me he was with Marcus.<eos> Bad things happen in every neighborhood.<eos> We've got good kids.<eos> They've got good parents.
I told him...<eos> We told him never to play in there, but he... he's got this imagination as big as the sky.<eos> Hey, it's not your fault.<eos> Kids are kids.<eos> They don't think beyond what they're doing in the present moment.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Found for the plaintiffs both times.<eos> Hey, did that calico get out again?<eos> No, no, no, she's warming up to the kids.<eos> And they love her.
I thought you must have got lucky because the gods chose you, but... Maybe that is not true.<eos> But you are not Viking.<eos> You renounced your heritage!<eos> You embraced our world and our god, and I have had your children.<eos> And they are not Viking.
But they wit! know who we are and what we did.<eos> That we did not bow down!<eos> We did not give in!<eos> We rose up, at this moment, at this hour, willing to sacrifice everything<eos> so that they can live in freedom!
Shoe.<eos> It's a little girl's shoe.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Reid.<eos> Why are there clothes down here?<eos> What are they doing here?
Rational, thinking creatures still have desires.<eos> Oh, well, we can soon deal with that.<eos> No! - No, no, don't take my desires away from me.<eos> - Why not?<eos> They're what makes my life worth living.
Sure.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna take you out.<eos> Sort of like a little welcome to the neighborhood?<eos> I appreciate that, but you got.. You got kids at home.<eos> Yeah, but they live with their mother.
I am a fully grown woman. You sat me at the kids table!<eos> You have no idea what that feels like, and you never will, you have a family,<eos> Don't I count as family?<eos> Don't my kids count as family?<eos> They're your family too, goddammit!
It's bloody nice, having a friend, Henry.<eos> Me think all those deaths would've prepared me for this.<eos> If you haven't been ready, you'll start to remember bits of your past, Henry.<eos> And those memories are real.<eos> They're you. Trust them.
Dr. Henry?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Those kids, they came out of nowhere.<eos> You have to listen to me. You have your car, right? Tell me you have your car.<eos> Parked... parked down the road. - Okay. - But they're everywhere!
Those kids, they came out of nowhere.<eos> You have to listen to me. You have your car, right? Tell me you have your car.<eos> Parked... parked down the road. - Okay. - But they're everywhere!<eos> I'm not going back out there.<eos> - Who are they? - I don't know.
Since we've had absolutely no progress.<eos> Nothing.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> There are too many pieces here.<eos> John blocked his memories because they defied his morality. And his son Roy is a defence mechanism.
Who hates me?<eos> "Why did this happen?"<eos> I thought more about it and all that brought about in me a love of hatred, a love of vengeance.<eos> Man isn't born with those feelings.<eos> They grow over the course of your experiences.
I don't see life that way.<eos> You just have to live life.<eos> We all have been, we all are, and we all will cease to be.<eos> I think I was born to give birth to one or two children.<eos> To feed them from infancy so that, when I'm old, they take care of me, in return.
And Vice?<eos> Julian Michaels... This guy... he somehow talks his way into getting a special license to operate artificials in the strictly controlled confines of Vice.<eos> You gotta believe me, the second that I found out what his plan was, I tried to shut it down, walk away. But he had a controlling interest in the company, so he seized everything, including you.<eos> And all my memories, everything I feel?<eos> Listen, you have real emotions, but they're built on the fragments of someone else's life.
I looked my parents up, they have a counseling website.<eos> People love them.<eos> Ironically, they counsel people, which is a hoot.<eos> Whatever. I told the kids. They said they wanted to go.<eos> I told them I didn't want them to go. They said they were gonna go anyway.
You're in charge out here.<eos> You gotta make a lot of tough decisions.<eos> It's probably easier to pretend these animals are just numbers on a spreadsheet.<eos> But they're not.<eos> They're alive.
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Words came to me blindly, like an animal instinct.<eos> I don't even know what I said.<eos> You knew them?<eos> What are they?
And now...you want me to be like him.<eos> Turn a blind eye because Raghuram Rathod wants his revenge.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I'm neither dead, nor is this life worth living.<eos> My dreams, my future, they took everything.
- We live here!<eos> - You two, down,<eos> - There are kids here!<eos> Both of you, on the ground, now!<eos> Where are they?

Something has to change.<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.<eos> You walk in and there are just pastries everywhere.<eos> Where do they come from?
We can't keep burying this family.<eos> You still got a son.<eos> We're gonna have children.<eos> And you deserve to be in their lives.<eos> And they deserve to be better than we've been.
Me and Aris, we found bodies.<eos> Too many to count.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Dead bodies?<eos> No, but they weren't alive either.
Dead bodies?<eos> No, but they weren't alive either.<eos> They had them strung up.<eos> With tubes coming out of them.<eos> They were being drained.
I have come to set you free.<eos> If you help me destroy your children, gods led by their selfish appetites, and let mortal man govern himself.<eos> I am your one true god.<eos> Release me, and you shall see my light.<eos> Will you help me bury your children as they have buried you?
I don't want that kind of life for her.<eos> Or him.<eos> She's got feelings for you, Barry.<eos> She may not know how to deal with those feelings right now, but I know her.<eos> They're there.
It's from Paris.<eos> It's from my boyfriend.<eos> He's so thoughtful.<eos> You should treasure those memories.<eos> They're what define us.
Who are you?<eos> The owner of these cars.<eos> This is my charming brother, Aron.<eos> And you are not the owner.<eos> Neither are you. They're not for sale.
We allow them to recover.<eos> We continue our tests.<eos> But the key goal here is to protect them from Drill.<eos> If... if we start rounding up children, people are gonna ask why.<eos> If they start dying and we did nothing to prevent this, they are gonna do a whole lot more than start asking questions, sir.
All I can figure is, he must have done it before they got here.<eos> That would explain why their symptoms are gone...<eos> Drill was dying.<eos> The only way to save himself was to take a body.<eos> When he got better, they did, too.
Do we get to go home soon?<eos> Not yet, sweetheart.<eos> I need you to do me a favor, all right?<eos> If any of the kids start acting strange or start... Asking the children to do things for them, I need you to tell me, okay?<eos> Henry says they already think I'm some kind of spy for the grown-ups.
It's... difficult.<eos> It feels unnatural, I know, but you can dominate the urge.<eos> Ausgezeichnet.<eos> Now, we mustn't forget the eyes.<eos> They are, after all, the windows to the soul.
I don't want to be legally bound.<eos> I'm going to ask you one more time, directly.<eos> Will you be living by yourself in this new two- or three-bedroom?<eos> Uh, well, I'll be... I'm hoping to be sharing it with my kids at least half of the time.<eos> The plan was for Ms. Bailey to be there with me whenever they're not and for her to leave when they come.
I have infected with the filth of pride.<eos> I know it.<eos> I am.<eos> Dispose of me as thou wilt, yet redeem my children.<eos> They cannot tame their natural evils.
Nope, never left my bed.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> So, how was your playdate with Laurel? Okay, let-let me...<eos> let me ask you guys something.<eos> When you had young kids, and they were still in the house, did you have a hard time, like... you know... ♪ Bow chicka wow wow?
We got everyone's name, we're checking them out.<eos> So just, you know, give it some time, Booth.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, look, I know that this is difficult, okay?<eos> You think the feelings are gone, but they come back.
I think you might know that the goal of Southeast Economic Alliance is to... innovate prosthetic technology and monopolize the market.<eos> Many kids can still upgrade their prosthetic body, it's not a deadend yet.<eos> Do you wanna sell them to enterprises as commodities?<eos> They have inherited hopes and dreams from all of us.<eos> They'll become next-gen prosthetics. They can have upgrades in the long term.
We'll have to fatten you up.<eos> Don't freakin' touch me.<eos> Oh, I'm going to do more than that.<eos> Children.<eos> Oh, they're so sweet and innocent.
Which is when she came to me for help.<eos> Must have been tough for you. Nah.<eos> It wasn't, actually. I...<eos> I... I hated her for what she did to me, but, you know, it didn't replace those other feelings.<eos> You know, they... They never went away.
It's about the officers' families.<eos> It's about them getting to see their spouse or mom or dad as a hero.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I won't approve your recommendation at this time.<eos> Sir, I get it that you don't want to show favoritism to your kids, but they also shouldn't be punished because their father happens to be the police commissioner.
My children did.<eos> They watched her die... wondering where I was.<eos> I found them in an extermination camp...<eos> In a stadium, like the one you were in.<eos> Had I shown up an hour later, they'd be dead.

Let's get you cleaned up.<eos> Just a little.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Animals will do it.<eos> They'll, uh, you know, tear open a prey species and soak themselves in the blood and tissue to hide a scent.
- I just call them sleepy and grumpy.<eos> Sleepy and grumpy, that's good.<eos> Yeah, well, our kids, they tend to be more energetic.<eos> They're good kids, great kids.<eos> They're just...
I never feel great leaving them with someone we don't know.<eos> I thought Anna seemed like a very nice girl.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> The kids are gonna be fine, okay?<eos> Jan Abbott said that Anna is great with her girls and we both know that they're nightmares.
- For your stomach.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - Your eyes.<eos> - My eyes?<eos> They're not just windows into your soul, they're also sometimes windows into your stomach.
- We have to find someplace to hide.<eos> - The passageways.<eos> We used to play in them when we were children.<eos> Renaude's men won't know of them.<eos> - Where are they?
- No, no.<eos> I want to remember you all like this... as the girls we once were.<eos> I hope you'll remember me that way, too.<eos> Oh, such dreams we had.<eos> I believe they can still come true.
Hey, this is serious.<eos> The fastest way to your demographic is through their kids.<eos> Kids don't give a shit about tech companies.<eos> Kids don't give a shit about the burger in their Happy Meals either.<eos> They just want the toy.
Kids don't give a shit about the burger in their Happy Meals either.<eos> They just want the toy.<eos> We are not pitching Brooks.<eos> We're pitching Brooksy Bee.<eos> Hey, when you have kids, they dictate every decision you make.
Alex, he watched over you your whole life.<eos> Why are you acting like this?<eos> I'll use my wings to call him. We need him.<eos> Don't. Hey, don't.<eos> Look, I don't know why these markings were given to me or what they mean.
He isn't just any patient.<eos> He came in a year ago for a pulmonary transplant.<eos> He's one of the organ recipients.<eos> Both lungs.<eos> They're Will's.
You're the one who said all my photos were creepy.<eos> Well, I..<eos> I mean, creepy in a good way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, they're officially starting to creep me out, so..
I'm trying to protect you.<eos> Why must you insist on making it so difficult? !<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> But I wanted to see my children for one last time.<eos> But apparently, they didn't have the same desire.
I saw that right from the start.<eos> You came into town like I once did, too damn brash and too stupid to even consider failure as an option.<eos> What we had was a dream.<eos> Do you know what happens when you abandon your dreams?<eos> They don't dry up and blow away.
Happy campers comin' at ya.<eos> Ah, what are you guys doin' here?<eos> Brad got us lost.<eos> It wasn't my fault.<eos> Uh, the-the trees, they, uh, you know it's like the trail map just stopped making sense.
Gosh, it can really move people's hearts, that pipe.<eos> I told you.<eos> Beasts with ears move at the sound of my pipe!<eos> Beasts...<eos> That's what they are.
Or your grandchildren.<eos> You have a relationship with Mariana because we allow it.<eos> It's not your place to parent her.<eos> They're right.<eos> They're her parents.
Oh, no!<eos> Right, that was our experience of classics, and now for something a bit more modern, with cars like these -<eos> VW Tiguan, Toyota RAV4.<eos> Manufacturers call them sports utility vehicles. And experts are predicting that very soon over half of all vehicles sold will be SUVs.<eos> Thing is, the manufacturers are not really selling these cars as cars, which is just as well, really, because they're largely terrible.
Maybe you're the alien cure too.<eos> Great. Just great.<eos> So how long have you been in contact with these Visitors?<eos> At first,<eos> I was like everyone else. I saw the lights in the sky, but I had no idea what they were.
But only 'cause I have work.<eos> I've got a driving lesson.<eos> Uh, something.<eos> Honey, you found those eggs weeks ago, and they still haven't hatched.<eos> Should you prepare yourself for the possibility that they might be...

I have the formulas.<eos> It's not that I can't see what you've claimed.<eos> It's that I'm not sure that you know how you got there or, indeed, that your claims are correct.<eos> There are subtleties which...<eos> But they are right, sir.
No, no, we didn't do anything!<eos> I swear, I swear!<eos> We told you to keep them on ice.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're gone.
I swear, I swear!<eos> We told you to keep them on ice.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're gone.<eos> They're gone.

I was afraid and I didn't see any option, so I went along.<eos> May I remind you that you're under oath?<eos> I just gave in.<eos> I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes.<eos> They were a reflection of my feelings, and it was like losing a child.
Oh, come on.<eos> I don't know what it is about me.<eos> I just... I think I freak kids out.<eos> Even in the womb, apparently.<eos> They can feel stress, remember?
Your agents and contacts were compromised.<eos> Men who trusted you died, and that stays with you always.<eos> And all that damage we leave behind.<eos> All those lives, all those empty rooms,<eos> what would they have been for?
Okay, bugaboo.<eos> Bye, Ryan.<eos> I'll see you later, okay?<eos> Kids.<eos> They know, you know?
Six girls born on the sixth day of the sixth month.<eos> Yet you, Jacob Brown, declared it a miracle.<eos> Even now, with this disappearance, you think it a coincidence?<eos> These are normal girls, and they've lived their whole lives with the whispers of something they know naught of.<eos> As we speak, they are together at Ruth's house worried sick.
They're only gonna grow up once. They're gonna look at you like you are the greatest thing in the world only for so long.<eos> And things that are gonna happen in their life are gonna happen once, one time only.<eos> And those are the memories you wanna hold on to.<eos> Memories of the job?<eos> No. They won't even come close.
The problem just keeps getting worse.<eos> This is a terror from within.<eos> It is a global epidemic.<eos> Epidemic. Clearly something's gone wrong.<eos> Kids are being told the biggest lie they will ever hear in their lives.
You sure can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you lost any weight?<eos> It's just kind of aggravating... because... I mean, my weight's not really going the way it's supposed to go.<eos> When we release our children into the care of schools, we expect that they're not going to drink unsafe water that will make them sick, we don't expect them to breathe unsafe air that will make them sick,
Thanks, Mom.<eos> With the fox guarding the henhouse, children's exposure to junk food ads, including online increased 60% from 2008 to 2010.<eos> The Federal Trade Commission has less authority to regulate advertising to kids than it does to adults.<eos> You would think that would be just the other way around.<eos> There are several studies that show that when children are watching television, especially with food commercials, they're primed to eat more.
You will feel it as your parents age and also will your children when you age.<eos> These memories are all I have, I need to keep them vivid<eos> or they'll fade, like the face of my husband.<eos> Like any mother, I wanted Kai to be with me.<eos> I want to dwell on these memories and cry over them because they comfort me.
What do we use for a target now?<eos> Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?<eos> Kolya, the kids...<eos> What about the kids?<eos> They just went deaf.
Mercury poisoning?<eos> Why?<eos> Nine children were sick with mercury poisoning in 1992... and the company doctor treated them.<eos> We had some mercury leakage at the old mill.<eos> - They died!
I did some research on you.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Come.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do all these children... do they eventually end up at the community center or...
Do you understand that?<eos> Dead!<eos> And maybe you'll find this strange.<eos> But I've other things to do apart from saving your life.<eos> And they are quite important.
You didn't hear from me 'cause snitches get stitches.<eos> Mm-hmm. - Some guy named smokey comes by, And you give him the money,<eos> Except mauricio refused.<eos> - I've hauled in the owners Of these other roach coaches for questioning.<eos> - Aw, man, I thought those injuries were from the murder. They happened before he was killed.
And in the end, it's your hands on me.<eos> You wanted more than your hands on me.<eos> You wanted me, my life, my future, my children.<eos> You just don't understand.<eos> They were going to be perfect.
Is there anything here?<eos> Or is it just empty boxes?<eos> -They're empty.<eos> -She knew it was a set-up.<eos> Where are they?
Hold, please.<eos> Hey. I'm not even sure if the words "thank you" can suffice for that date!<eos> - Wow. You guys went out already?<eos> - Just now!<eos> He was a total gentlemen, paid for everything, and those eyes, I mean are they real?
Second, no one in your organization steps foot in Kentucky again.<eos> You keep to Memphis, and you leave me and mine out of it.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> You see, the problem is, I entered into business with these kids, and they pulled a slick one on me.
Uh, our comptroller was just outlining the virtues of a town merger.<eos> Here you go.<eos> All right, speech is this.<eos> Governor believes it would save our fine state millions of dollars if we can get some of our less populated towns to merge... with their neighbors.<eos> Well, I know I speak for Mayor Gainey when I say, we both relish our towns' unique identities, and can't envision a world in which they are merged into one.
I suppose I should take this opportunity to say "thank you."<eos> For what?<eos> It appears you two are the only two people in Wonderland that care whether I live or die.<eos> We need to get rid of these torches.<eos> The creatures... that's what they're drawn to.
I am a person living with early onset Alzheimer's. And as that person, I find myself learning the art of losing every day.<eos> Losing my bearings, losing objects, losing sleep... but mostly, losing memories."<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think I'll try to forget that just happened.<eos> "All my life, I've accumulated memories. They've become, in a way, my most precious possessions.
And if he tries to pull anything suspicious, all you gotta do is contact Cara and we teleport in.<eos> All right, you guys got my back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But who's going to take care of Astrid when I'm gone?<eos> The windows, they just pop open...
They say one throw can make a thousand cuts.<eos> A thousand cuts sounds about right.<eos> I need to make Klaus bleed.<eos> It's ingenious.<eos> and yet they are not real.
But one thing is true.<eos> Love will always be a stronger bond than blood.<eos> Trust that.<eos> And those children out there love you.<eos> They need you.
And now we're gonna throw this gasoline on the fire as well?<eos> And by the way, wouldn't it have been nice if you had asked me if I was okay with this?<eos> So now I need your permission?<eos> Our kids are gonna read this Kathryn.<eos> What the hell are they gonna think?
Tell me a secret, something you've never told anyone else.<eos> Something is wrong with my balls.<eos> Something like that.<eos> I just...<eos> I-I had a tick and I pulled it off and now they won't stop swelling and I'm afraid they're gonna explode.
They need about a mile to stop, right?<eos> More or less.<eos> Okay.<eos> Your last thoughts are important, Claire.<eos> They're all you get to take with you.
So, like, "Subway, work, sleep."<eos> And that's the routine of everyone back home, no excitement.<eos> [speaking French] How do you feel about what has been happening to you over the last few months?<eos> When I look at my children, I keep asking myself,<eos> "My God, how will they grow up under such conditions?"
Well, for us... it's about intimacy, you know?<eos> I mean, look, we can brag to the guys about some legendary triple in Cleveland, and pray the wife never finds out.<eos> But you know what's better?<eos> Taking your partner with you to all those dark places.<eos> Then they're not so dark anymore, they're just... free and beautiful.
You're a spiritual warrior.<eos> Every eastern philosophy emphasizes physical sobriety to allow the consciousness, the ever present "I," the godhead, to merge with the white-hot moment of the eternal now.<eos> You don't say.<eos> Animals get it.<eos> They live in the now.
I was getting hammered from upstairs and, what can I say?<eos> I shouldn't have taken it out on you.<eos> Oh, it's no big deal, really.<eos> I just yelled at my kids when I got home.<eos> Well, that's what they're there for.
- Just bring the kids back there.<eos> - No, I cannot.<eos> I've been on a plane for 19 hours.<eos> I'm not making a side trip to yonkers tonight.<eos> They are already asleep.
I don't...<eos> What? A child trampled through my garden last night.<eos> - Janine...<eos> - I saw the way she looked at them.<eos> My babies wouldn't hurt anybody, and now they're dead, and she killed them!
I know.<eos> I feel like...<eos> No one should ever ask you those questions.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought they were thought-provoking.
It really was.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, tonight we are trying to prove that we really do like small cars, and our producers are trying to prove that they're rubbish.
A lorry or a Hindu temple?<eos> This has been extensively modded.<eos> Has it?<eos> Not just the visual improvements.<eos> They are significant, the lights and the little studdy things, but note...
That was our job.<eos> 3 victims have been found in upstate New York in a town called Hamilton over the past 10 days.<eos> All of the bodies were discovered in a sort of public place, the first on a dead-end street, the second in a desolate alley, and this is the last one-- in a field.<eos> Dorothy, we're not in Kansas anymore.<eos> Although each victim was abducted from a neighboring city, they all have something in common.
Wait. Barbozza?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You mean, like, Mickey Barbozza?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that's it.<eos> I mean, this guy wants those pictures something fierce. But I wouldn't tell him where they are, 'cause I didn't want him going after Tildy. I'm sorry.
I deleted 'em.<eos> They're gone, I swear.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> If you don't tell me where they are, you're not gonna need these court papers.
Yeah, well, my daughter's my greatest blessing.<eos> Now Wendy seems like she'd make a great mom, but...<eos> If your marriage doesn't work out, so be it.<eos> But...<eos> Your kids, they last a lifetime.
It's the baker from Pudding Lane!<eos> It's the man who started it!<eos> ~ Get off me!<eos> ~ Leave my children alone!<eos> What harm have they done to you?
The fire's coming.<eos> What the devil is wrong with you, Lizzie?<eos> Why haven't you packed the curtains?<eos> If the house burns, we won't need curtains.<eos> They cost me a fortune!
I don't know what to think.<eos> Then stop thinking.<eos> All your questions will be answered, Ryan. Eventually.<eos> But the big answers are like those missing kids on the milk cartons.<eos> They don't want to be found.
No, you want to be with Wilfred.<eos> You know, some people believe that animals choose us.<eos> They come into our lives when we desperately need them, and they help us find our way to happiness.<eos> And when they die, they're not really gone.<eos> They just... move on to someone else.
- Dad!<eos> Mr. Carbone, we spoke earlier. Just wait.<eos> These pictures could cause a lot of problems, right?<eos> I don't think he should give them away for nothing.<eos> Well, technically, they're the property of the Philadelphia PD.
We're talking about us, and it's not the point.<eos> Well, I'm not going to let my kids be losers.<eos> Well, I'm not going to let my kids be Hitler youth.<eos> What?<eos> You're not gonna like send them to some academy, so you can put a crest on their shoulder that you get to brag about in the aisles of Whole Foods and they grow up not knowing what a person is.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.<eos> They're going to eat me alive!<eos> So what's the basic problem?<eos> The basic problem is that he's distressing the toddlers.<eos> Sounds to me like they're distressing him.
I'm not a boy anymore.<eos> You married? Yes.<eos> - Children?<eos> - Soon, God willing.<eos> They get in the way.
Soon our family will be one more British dynasty with all the same prejudices as everyone else who shops at Harrods!<eos> Any children will be brought up to know both sides of their heritage.<eos> Your children will not be Jewish!<eos> Don't you understand that?<eos> Their mother will not be Jewish and neither will they!
Yeah, we'll hit the front, Tig.<eos> Well, all right, then.<eos> Let's get our goddamn guns.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Well... there they are.
So I've been doing some thinking.<eos> - Hmm? - There is a big wide world out there with so much new to explore.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I know that if you don't reach for your dreams, they could be gone in a heartbeat.
- Strangulation?<eos> - That is right.<eos> It is strangulation.<eos> - Yay, science.<eos> - Also, uh, the lab results came back on the fibers from the windowsill, and they were from a heavy-duty composite rope.
And there's a lot of tidying up to do!<eos> How did the Shakespeare go?<eos> Honestly?<eos> The mistake us teachers make with children and Shakespeare is Midsummer Night's Dream, because we think that cos it's all full of magic they're all going to love it.<eos> But they don't.
It's a big part of growing up.<eos> And you only get one life.<eos> Mom, your passion was designing, and in college, that's what you wanted to do, and it's 20 years later, and that's still what you want to do.<eos> What's your point, honey?<eos> That you have to follow your dreams, because they're not gonna give up following you.
Because I can text the Easter Bunny, you know.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're trying to help?<eos> As you stand here, chatting, chatting, your lives are ending.<eos> Unless you wake up, unless you free yourselves from these dreadful creatures, they're going to destroy you.
For real.<eos> I shouldn't have been the first.<eos> I killed my sister.<eos> Go to your kids.<eos> They're what matter now, okay?
It came down to her or my kids.<eos> Did you ever see her mistreat them?<eos> I loved his kids.<eos> I would never hurt any child.<eos> But social services started getting anonymous calls that when I was over there, they were crying or whatever.
Humbug.<eos> Yeah, I guess I did kind of ruin Christmas.<eos> No, that's not what...<eos> At school this week, I was reading the kids A Christmas Carol.<eos> They, um, wanted to know what "humbug" meant.
I went to prison because of him.<eos> You went to prison because you put a man in a coma.<eos> I don't appreciate you coming here, guests in my home, waving your guns and your badges around the kids and leering in judgment of the very people who pay your salaries.<eos> We'd be happy to discuss this downtown.<eos> You two sit in judgment of me and my beliefs, but they come with integrity. Do yours?
Good.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Where are your chairs?<eos> Oh, they, um... they arrive tomorrow.
And I've got a button here.<eos> It's the ANIMA button.<eos> That's Italian for animal.<eos> I bet Hammond is sitting in his Lamborghini now talking about animals. 'Cause he doesn't know that ANIMA, which is what the button's called, in Italian, means "soul".<eos> And there's three different modes, so I'm guessing they're like different animals.
Of echoes, of fake distant whispers of what once made is real.<eos> Excuse me for one second, Fiona.<eos> We must continue.<eos> I wish I would have been there when the memories returned.<eos> They were the truth.
I'm going to ask you one last time.<eos> Charming.<eos> I never really wanted children.<eos> I couldn't quite see the appeal.<eos> Still, I'm sure they mean a lot to you.
So, the Battle of the Year is coming up, right?<eos> And I'm sponsoring the US crew.<eos> So my crew is called IA's Finest.<eos> Now, these kids are good.<eos> Acrobatic, they got skills, but they're not great.
One whole weekend, you looking after my little girls.<eos> Yep, as long as I can bring this.<eos> Look, I love your kids.<eos> I do.<eos> But they live to terrorise me.
The water supplies section...<eos> Wash away the blood.<eos> Have you seen these kids?<eos> I don't know anything about...<eos> Where are they, you bitch?
Okay, then get out!<eos> Go back to turkey town and stay out!<eos> Patchi, are you messing with the Troodons again?<eos> I thought I asked you to watch the eggs.<eos> I am watching them, but they keep not doing anything.
In these instances, the victim can often see things that aren't there, react to them.<eos> The world of the imagination and the real world blends so that they cannot distinguish the difference.<eos> In such a case, it's natural that he could have believed that a man or a shadowy figure of some kind was stalking him.<eos> It's important for your audience to be aware that these delusions are fairly common, but we must remember that they are only in our imagination.<eos> And no matter how frightening they seem,
It's not her fault.<eos> Kids just don't take to some people.<eos> I don't know what you were thinking.<eos> Sorry, he's right.<eos> They're like pit bulls.
Father, we ask You to bless this food for us, With a smile for those without, in Jesus' name we pray.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> All right. My kids don't know anything on history about Uganda.<eos> It's a sad thing.<eos> We try by all means to make our home more African. But the only country they know is America.
I'm going off my head trying to work out the alignment of these devices, you know, just trying to figure out which one fitted into which.<eos> - That can't be easy.<eos> - But not impossible.<eos> You know, gearboxes are like people.<eos> If they've been together long enough, then, eventually, they take on each other's forms.
Xavier ...<eos> I just wanted to tell you ...<eos> I love your kids.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yes, I love them, they are ... great.
I'll tell you right, then. What's that?<eos> I'll tell you, goddamn it. Tell us what?<eos> I'm gonna tell you where they at, them bodies.<eos> You said if I told you, you were gonna turn me loose.<eos> Where they at?
And all you're concern about is my dry eyes? !<eos> Fine, I'll show you!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Are they dry? !<eos> Are they?
Damn it!<eos> Are they dry? !<eos> Are they?<eos> Are they dry? !<eos> Are they?
Yeah.<eos> You know, I broke up with him, so I'm the winner.<eos> Oh, no, come on. Show me the photos.<eos> I can't stand this. Show it to me. Show it to me.<eos> oh! Oh, Josh, they're awful! Oh, they're so awful!
O'Hara, I forbid you to buy into this load of crap.<eos> We should arrest them and go back to the city.<eos> Uh, I am sensing these bodies did not get up and walk away on their own.<eos> Which also puts the kibosh on Lassie's zombie theory.<eos> You see... they were dragged.
- ♪ I know I've kept you waiting ♪ ♪ I know I made you mad ♪<eos> ♪ But this time that we've spent creating ♪ ♪ Was the best time I ever had ♪<eos> ♪ Now I love to sit with memories ♪<eos> ♪ But they won't come until we're gone ♪
To what end do you bother me?<eos> I bring you news.<eos> Which, if acted on, will bring you all you seek.<eos> These children?<eos> Do you know where they have come from?
Lisa.<eos> Did you wash everything in this load?<eos> Some clothes are missing.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> So, where are they?
And now it's like... It's all come full circle, hasn't it?<eos> Marsden couldn't be any more screwed if they put an exocet through his front window.<eos> You can crow all you like, Mr Regan. But spare the girls.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Where are they?
- I'm just so pissed off. - Yeah.<eos> So we hope that it has been made clear that the intentional blocking of this vital information has had, and will continue to have a negative psychological impact on each and every single one of Starbuck's children.<eos> In finishing, while the donor may have bargained for confidentiality with the clinic, and the parents may have accepted that confidentiality as a condition to receiving the sperm donation...<eos> The children didn't agree to anything.<eos> Yet, they are the ones, they are the ones most directly affected.
I would eat it if I could.<eos> Sometimes I wish I was single, just so I could have girlie sheets.<eos> You would love that.<eos> I have flowery sheets.<eos> They're not all they're cracked up to be.
One could be Smith and the other could be Wesson.<eos> You name arms after guns, not shoulders.<eos> Shoulders are part of your arms.<eos> No, they aren't.<eos> They're part of your shoulders.
- Anything to report?<eos> - Nothing... special, no.<eos> Kids?<eos> School?<eos> You know, they always adjust better than we do.
It's so much easier to deal with.<eos> Right, so, I found some particulates embedded in the scraping wound on the back of the ribs.<eos> Any idea what it is?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Dr. Brennan thought that there was evidence that animals might have gotten to the remains, so maybe they left them.
You okay?<eos> They all have one thing in common.<eos> We brought your wife in for questioning.<eos> She never did anything but raise those children.<eos> She didn't ask where they were coming from?
I got assigned to a new boring doctor.<eos> Sorry, I have to go now, happy painting.<eos> Luca, no more bats.<eos> Make something cheery for the holidays.<eos> I think they're cheery.
Is this how you remember it?<eos> I guess so.<eos> I'm not doing it for me.<eos> It's for our children, Kit.<eos> They need to know where they came from.
But then Franky taught me this trick.<eos> And, most of the time, it works.<eos> It stops me from going bunta."<eos> "Puppies and jelly.<eos> I get this picture in my head of puppies jumping around in jelly and they're all mushy and cute and sticky."
As trainers, we never forget Shamu's true potential.<eos> We see it each and every day.<eos> That's why all of our interactions are very carefully thought out, especially our water work interaction...<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> You big dork. Especially our water work interactions, because they're potentially the most dangerous.
We knew that from the suitcase striking boats and rocks.<eos> But these-<eos> Spider fracturing like this can only be caused by compression.<eos> But since the injuries aren't spread out over the surrounding bones, it's not just a factor of being put in the case.<eos> Let's catalog the injuries and get a rough time line of when they might have occurred.
Come on...<eos> Babli. You're bound to get hurt while playing.<eos> Babli.<eos> How long will you father these children alone?<eos> They need a mother to look after them.
We got to start thinking... about the next move.<eos> Did you, um, check out any of those GED classes I talked to you about?<eos> No, not really my thing.<eos> No, as soon as I clear this, I'm heading to LA, doing some modeling and acting.<eos> Yeah, the problem with dreams is that they stay dreams, not reality, for most.
Why are there kids on the plane?<eos> I told you to secure the cargo.<eos> As I explained to Nikita, everyone pays what they can.<eos> The children are Kosta's payment.<eos> Who are they?
Well, I hope my future son appreciates what his dad is giving up for him.<eos> Or daughter.<eos> I mean, what do you think they're gonna be like?<eos> Aren't they just gonna be, like, the coolest kids?<eos> Hell, yeah, they're gonna be cool kids.
It doesn't make sense.<eos> Maybe that's it.<eos> That's what?<eos> We've been assuming the same person who killed Therese tried to kill Sister Anne.<eos> But if you look at the crimes, they're very different.
Six pounds of pressure, you can rip someone's ear off, but an eye... takes dedication.<eos> The whole time, Jimmy was squealing like a little stuck bitch.<eos> Prison's a disease.<eos> It gets in your blood.<eos> You pass it to your kids, and they pass it to their kids.
You're not obliged to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned...<eos> Where's Lisa?<eos> Where are my kids?<eos> Ah, they're safe, love.<eos> Where are they? !
Unusually for snakes, her maternal instincts continue for days after her eggs hatch.<eos> Even so, the forest is such a dangerous place that only one in 100 of her youngsters is likely to reach adulthood.<eos> Just occasionally, the competition eases.<eos> A tree suddenly produces fruit.<eos> It's a magnet for the creatures of the canopy, and they, in turn, as they feed, create a bonanza for those on the ground below.
- Excuse me?<eos> - I'm staying.<eos> But, but, but you can't.<eos> It'll be a disaster. For the children of Portugal.<eos> They can wait.
Put out your cards.<eos> I don't know where they are.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> I had a dream about you the other night.<eos> Your eyes were green, they were glowing, because it wasn't you, it was a shifter, somebody doing evil in your name.
Those suits...<eos> Uh...<eos> I haven't priced these yet.<eos> Are you interested?<eos> Well, they're...
What's that?<eos> What happened to no technology?<eos> This is the only exception.<eos> I have to document my manliness for my children.<eos> This way, they can watch it for years to come, and... crap.
Hey, you burn through that box of rubbers yet?<eos> - What are rubbers?<eos> - Hey, don't interrupt.<eos> Nice to see you don't talk down to them.<eos> Well, I love kids, and they love me.
It doesn't tune in to any other stations?<eos> No, that's it.<eos> It plays it on a loop constantly.<eos> Why do you want anything else?<eos> What if you get in your car after your children have been driving it and they've left it tuned to Radio One? !
They're great.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> I want you to give me away, Seeley.<eos> I'm sorry. So you've been a mom to... his kids?<eos> Yeah, well, we've been together for quite some time, and they were at an age where they could still use a mother.
And Tom's socialism will ensure his approval of the plan. You laugh.<eos> But, as a matter of fact, I've been thinking about it quite a lot lately.<eos> About what?<eos> My beliefs, I suppose.<eos> I'm not too sure what they are any more.
Just take a breath.<eos> I love my children.<eos> Please tell them.<eos> They know.<eos> They know.
His grieving widow doesn't think he was a traitor?<eos> Why didn't you say?<eos> That makes all the difference.<eos> Have you talked to his kids?<eos> I'm dying to know what they think.
First of all, miss lohan, I've seen "freaky Frida y," like, 400,000 times.<eos> Let's just get that off the table.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And, second of all, How do you get your eyes like that?<eos> They always look so twinkly and cute.
Once you have slept, you're gonna realize it.<eos> Do you think maybe he heard me?<eos> You know, in utero, he heard what I said about how he was gonna be evil?<eos> Babies aren't like us, Arlene.<eos> They only hear the good stuff.
A therapist may want to try that.<eos> But right now we need to play along with her delusion.<eos> But isn't that just reinforcing the psychotic belief?<eos> Mr. Resnick, if I tell your wife the truth, she's not gonna believe me.<eos> She's gonna believe her own feelings, and they're telling her you are an impostor.
"so I can't help but think she'll be a little sad, too.<eos> "the city has lots to offer,<eos> "but there's one thing she won't have there,<eos> "her memories,<eos> "because they're right here, In Cedar Cove."
- That's odd.<eos> - Um, what?<eos> There are takeout containers in the trash can.<eos> So? That's my dinner from last night.<eos> What's odd is they're in the trash can.
The league is not gonna allow you back as coach.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Then it's no deal.<eos> I'm not gonna abandon my kids.<eos> They're not your kids.
Good for you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's lonely in neverland.<eos> Are the children who visit in their dreams.<eos> But they can't stay.
I'm about to start a presentation to team leaders on the history of our search.<eos> Well, I'll be candid with you, Malraux, just so we all know where we stand.<eos> I couldn't give a damn about your research.<eos> You see those test rigs there?<eos> They'll verify whether there's oil.
I'm pissed off because the Rangers just lost to the Boston Bruins.<eos> I hate the Boston Bruins!<eos> Look, Barney, I hate these feelings.<eos> I hate myself for having these feelings.<eos> No one wishes they would go away more than I do, but I just... I... I can't seem to make that happen.
Why?<eos> The university cut their budget.<eos> We weren't a priority.<eos> Apparently, the tight-asses on the grant committee think that helping children walk is more important than our casual sex research.<eos> Don't they realize that after these kids start walking that they're gonna want casual sex, too?
Did you take notes during these interviews?<eos> - I did.<eos> - What did you do with these notes? I shared them with Ms. Lockhart, and then I<eos> - put them away in the files.<eos> - Lionel, clearly these notes are part of the client files, but they have been redacted.
Uh, that's a terrible idea.<eos> Nobody likes to look at other people's vacation photos.<eos> Besides, those pictures don't exist anymore.<eos> BURT:<eos> Yeah. They melted in a...
In the car, I always have to sit on the hump.<eos> It makes reading impossible.<eos> Lisa, your food's getting cold!<eos> It's raw veggies.<eos> They're supposed to be cold!
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence?<eos> If we be not, show us the hand of God that hath dismissed us from our stewardship<eos> For well we know, no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane, steal, or usurp<eos> And though you think that all, as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us, and we are barren and bereft of friends<eos> Yet know, my master, God omnipotent, is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence And they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against our heads and threat the glory of our precious crown
You think they mean something?<eos> Of course they mean something.<eos> Everything means something.<eos> The question is what?<eos> What do they mean?
I'm going to put my hand on my heart and say this is the best Top Gear adventure we've ever had.<eos> It's a noble quest in a truly stunningly beautiful country full of utterly hospitable people.<eos> 'And then, of course, there were our cars.<eos> 'A trio of 1,500-quid high-milers.<eos> 'All had been presumably sold 'because their owners thought they were on their last legs, 'but they'd come here and taken on the worst 'that Africa could throw at them, and they'd survived.
We were worried, Tink.<eos> You are so lucky nothing happened to your wings.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> But something did happen.<eos> They sparkled!
They sparkled!<eos> But you heard her.<eos> It was just the light reflecting off the snow.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> They actually lit up.
She needs to rest.<eos> No.<eos> Look at the eyes.<eos> I never believed it.<eos> They do exist.
I'm serious, okay?<eos> I need help.<eos> Dude, you're gonna be fine.<eos> You've just got to get over your fear of babies.<eos> They can smell fear.
- Please, leave.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it, stop it!<eos> And just leave them?<eos> - They should be in the creche.
And just leave them?<eos> - They should be in the creche.<eos> Creche, my arse!<eos> Are you sending your kids to Germany to work?<eos> Do you have any idea how old they are?
The parents of Cold Rock need to know.<eos> Are the children dead?<eos> No!<eos> I couldn't keep them all.<eos> Where are they?
- Grieve, grieve.<eos> We're all grieving.<eos> But I'm just trying to think practically on your behalf.<eos> You're not getting any younger.<eos> They shrivel.
-So you're leaving?<eos> -I think it's best.<eos> I mean now that your kids are here--<eos> -Don't leave me alone with them.<eos> -Lilly, they don't want me here.
The pain and guilt are too much!<eos> I can't go on knowing what I've done!<eos> Oh, Fry!<eos> Can you really remove all my memories of Fry?<eos> Oh, they'll still be there, hon.
When was the last time you ate?<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I'm just gonna start the tapes and take a look...<eos> You know, why don't you... take a break and have lunch with the kids?<eos> They need you too.
Not so much.<eos> Shit.<eos> Um... are you looking for anything in particular?<eos> - Drill bits. - Drill bits, drill bits...<eos> What do they look like?
I'm the cabin clown.<eos> And then he went into the kitchen, slowly opened the refrigerator, and it was empty!<eos> So then, the man, weak with hunger, raced from the refrigerator to the counter to look for a delivery menu, but all he could find was one for a vegan place!<eos> Vegan places aren't real, right?<eos> No, they're not real.
If it was the Wannop girl - if the woman that's come between you and Sylvia, dammit, is our little suffragette...<eos> - Good God!<eos> - Put her back, Chrissie.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> They say they're all whores.
You haven't changed.<eos> You're wrong there.<eos> Let me get those photos.<eos> In the garbage?<eos> Where are they?
It is just a fact. Don't give me...<eos> Don't give you what...<eos> The truth?<eos> Isn't that what you came here for?<eos> Look, I am building something in that rehearsal room, and with all due respect, it would be a lot easier if everyone pretended just for five minutes not to have all those annoying feelings, because frankly, they get in my way. Theater is about feelings!
Nothing.<eos> Nothing real, at least.<eos> There is a-a legendary alchemical mixture...<eos> A-a potion, as it were... Called The Tears Of Ra.<eos> Egyptians used it to euthanize beloved pets so that they could be buried with their owners who pre-deceased them.
Τhe country is a smoking ruin.<eos> Despite this, their ruler, Εmperor Ηirohito, is still worshipped by his people as a living god.<eos> We have placed this Sacred Son of Ηeaven on the protected list until we decide what to do with him.<eos> I fear the Japan I fell in love with will be scarred beyond recognition.<eos> I'm seeing aerial reconnaissance photos, but they only tell part of the story.
All due respect, Regina,<eos> I don't think you know much about evil.<eos> Well, if she didn't do it, then who did?<eos> I don't know, that's what I've been trying to figure out.<eos> But those blackouts I've been having, they've made everything so hazy.
Go. It might be that kiss you've been waiting for.<eos> Tag. You're it.<eos> Think you could hold on to that until London?<eos> This is our last run, isn't it?<eos> This is where your dreams become a reality or where they're left to die.
Sometimes it makes me embarrassed to walk erect.<eos> But you help animals.<eos> They love you.<eos> They don't love me.<eos> They... just love.
So what went wrong here? The problem was that his past - in it's material existence was erased. - Well, here's your transportation.<eos> What remained the same were his dreams - because when the company organised his rebirth, - when the company provided a new existence - for him they simply followed his dreams. His dreams were wrong dreams - and this is quite a deep lesson for the theory of ideology.<eos> It wasn't wasted. Remember that. On the way to the operation hall, he discovers - the horrible truth.<eos> We should draw a line of distinction - within the very field of our dreams. Between those who are the right dreams - pointing towards a dimension effectively beyond - our existing society and the wrong dreams: the dreams which are just an idealised - consumerist reflection, - mirror image of our society.<eos> We are not simply submitted to our dreams - they just come from some unfathomable - depths and we can't do anything about it.
You brought the, uh, whole neighborhood, huh?<eos> Crazy.<eos> So... your children had a scare.<eos> You know kids and their-- their imaginations.<eos> They seem convinced that Dick is an alien.
Three.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Honestly, those little boxes?<eos> They taunt me, Charlie.
So let's call up to maintenance and get a sawzall.<eos> Mm. You really want to wait that long?<eos> - Uh, fire and rescue has tools.<eos> - Better.<eos> Hey, th-these tools, what are they gonna do, Rip apart the grinder?
It's gonna be a long fall.<eos> Nolcorp, I.T. Department.<eos> Hey, it's Nolan.<eos> Those photos we pulled down for the Graysons,<eos> I need you to find out where they originated.
Look, you're not gonna die alone, babe.<eos> We have kids.<eos> That's the point.<eos> They're gonna be here for your last breath, and then get into a fistfight over your jewelry.<eos> They'll move away, and you will be long dead...
- H... how'd it go?<eos> - Fine.<eos> You?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> The, uh, the questions... they were.
Anything with a jaw can be knocked out.<eos> Cows, pigs, horses.<eos> Anything.<eos> But I like animals...<eos> and they can't hit you back.
THE SWAN: She's just very masculine: face; body; basically everywhere.<eos> So we really need to change her body with a lot of liposuction, breast augmentation... we really need to feminize her face by doing a brow lift, rhinoplasty, take the fat out of her cheeks and her chin.<eos> She really deserves to be in this program.<eos> NARRATOR: This one is called 'My Super Sweet 16' where children have tens of thousands of dollars spent on them simply because they are turning 16.<eos> They are treated like celebrities, despite the fact that they have achieved nothing and are out of touch with reality.
Have you seen Liam?<eos> I thought he was with you.<eos> Like he was yesterday.<eos> What does that mean? I called the production office to find out about the publicity photos Liam was supposedly taking.<eos> They don't exist.
Ready, roll-in, ready, SOT 1.<eos> - Ready.<eos> - In four, three, two, one.<eos> Roll-in.<eos> I welcome these hearings because of the opportunity that they provide to the American people to better understand why the tragedy of 9/11 happened and what we must do to prevent a reoccurrence.
O, dear foreigner<eos> I could not understand anything... but you sing beautifully... This was mom's favourite song 5 year's back she died, since then...<eos> Sir tea In the house there's only myself, dad and Peeshi<eos> One thing's for sure your children will become singers<eos> Meaning Genes, after all they will have an effect.
Not unless you're mad.<eos> You're telling me everyone in that house went mad?<eos> Why didn't you see that ten years ago?<eos> Nancy died trying to protect those children.<eos> They still need rescuing.
He threatened my children...<eos> Your children are in Los Angeles with your brother, and LAPD has been notified.<eos> They are safe.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> They're all I have left.
And it might not be for a while, but we will see him again.<eos> I need to see my children. That won't be possible.<eos> I've booked a passage on a steamer to Panama and, from there, I'll make my way over land to Rio de Janeiro.<eos> 'My life is about the children now. '<eos> We've done what we've done, but they shouldn't be made to suffer for it.
Okay.<eos> You see these people?<eos> All of these... your people, Your fake aliases that I lovingly created.<eos> Over the last four years...<eos> they are also burned, useless.
I missed you, so I was reading some of your books.<eos> They're thick.<eos> They're really... they're heavy.<eos> I only had time to excavate the remains, so all I have to examine are these photographs.<eos> But they're not enough.
Stevie plays soccer.<eos> He'll be an Alpha male.<eos> All good.<eos> Taylor is gonna stab the prom queen and Shayla's gonna get date raped by fishermen.<eos> Oh, please, you add a little me and a little you and they're gonna be fine because you give a shit about them and they know it.
Sorry.<eos> Us eat you?<eos> You're the ones who enjoy finger foods and order kids' meals.<eos> What are kids' meals?<eos> Are they made from kids?
Are they made from kids?<eos> I guess I never thought how weird this must be for you guys.<eos> God.<eos> You're not answering the kids' meals question.<eos> No. No. They're not made from kids.
I guess I never thought how weird this must be for you guys.<eos> God.<eos> You're not answering the kids' meals question.<eos> No. No. They're not made from kids.<eos> I mean, no one knows what they're made from, but it's not kids.
How do you even declare brain death in an anencephalic child?<eos> Lack of reflexes, pupillary responses.<eos> No.<eos> Those criteria don't apply here.<eos> They indicate an absence of brain stem activity.
A whole lot of money is being made off of our children.<eos> Each of these foster homes receives federal money for the children in its care. But they get double for Indian kids. Double.<eos> You know, to motivate foster families to take them in.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> Not when they've been kidnapped from good Cheyenne families.
But frankly, I wouldn't blame Carmen if she didn't wanna work with either one of you.<eos> You're both acting crazy.<eos> And you know what?<eos> The two of you are so anxious to hire someone to take care of your kids, but this time is precious.<eos> And sooner or later, they're gonna push you away.
I truly do not wish to feel this way, Miss Audrey.<eos> And every day I try to stop myself.<eos> I tell myself it is hopeless.<eos> I try to push away the feelings.<eos> But they insist.
What a ball-breaker, huh?<eos> - You can handle it.<eos> Any chance voight beats this?<eos> - No shot.<eos> Speaking of shots, where are they?
And that my job and my life and my dreams are somehow secondary to that.<eos> I'm sorry, but am I wrong for feeling that way?<eos> Pumpkins, bear Bryant once said,<eos> "feelings aren't right or wrong.<eos> They just are."
Oh, that's ridiculous.<eos> Is it?<eos> These boxes are full of stuff from your time with Lily, and I can see how revisiting those memories could be difficult.<eos> Look, let me help.<eos> I will unpack the boxes, and when you come back, they'll be gone.
No, just caught on something.<eos> That does not explain your arm.<eos> What about my arm?<eos> The burns you're hiding...<eos> they're not from the sun.
Why would we do that?<eos> Because you're part of it.<eos> What, the great government conspiracy?<eos> Authority has always attracted the lowest element in the human race.<eos> They will submit to any indignity, perform any vile act, do anything to achieve power.
Dixon's injuries are less severe than mine, so my guess is that his parts probably work, but not... not that I'm looking into his business or anything.<eos> Nope, nope, me, neither.<eos> Annie, you know, sex isn't just about the parts.<eos> I mean, one thing that I learned from... from my experience is that, um, you know, these injuries, they don't suddenly make you a new person.<eos> Whatever problems you had before, whether it's with yourself or with your partner, they don't disappear.
He planted evidence that would implicate O'Brien-- the phone used to contact Ramirez-- and then he writes a recommendation that he knows would demonstrate that O'Brien has motive for murder.<eos> Now all that's left to do is to destroy any evidence that might unravel his plans:<eos> Firstly, the incriminating videos he keeps on his computer.<eos> Secondly, his eyes.<eos> They're proof that he faced a long, horrible illness.
Fleoge thu swa swa se windraesgrimsath.<eos> These funny feelings of yours...<eos> They're not funny.<eos> Stupid then.<eos> Where do they come from, you think?
But now we have them day in and day out.<eos> And you know why?<eos> It's because they have us in their pockets.<eos> What I like is the variety.<eos> - They even smell different.
What else do we have?<eos> Rickety posts.<eos> Beak rot in the tortoises.<eos> A weak enclosure between the jaguars and the tigers.<eos> They don't get along.
This is a very kind invitation,<eos> Mr. Hasegawa.<eos> However, unfortunately, the children will not be able to attend.<eos> Why not?<eos> Sir, they're very young.
- Well, how many do I take?<eos> - Two, and you'll sleep like a baby.<eos> No!<eos> I said two, Dad.<eos> - From what I remember about babies, they wake up a lot.
How do you know?<eos> Because you've "investigated"?<eos> Have you even been to Vermont?<eos> Well, actually, no.<eos> Then how can you claim to know what they're not?
Even worse is 500 calories of oil, which is almost pure fat and barely triggers any response at all.<eos> The problem with weight management in humans is that if you make these foods completely artificial, which we do today, you wind up with a problem that people have to overeat just to be satisfied.<eos> But why do these concentrated foods that are so harmful to us give us so much pleasure?<eos> Dr. Lisle says the answer is related to a system called the motivational triad.<eos> This is a trio of biological mechanisms that nature has designed into every creature on earth so they can survive to pass their genes on to the next generation.
It's just a diaper...<eos> Okay.<eos> We need a game plan.<eos> We need to rehearse exactly what we're gonna say because that is the only way I'm gonna hold it together when my babies are looking at me with judgment and disgust.<eos> First of all, that's how they always look at us.
I understand the practicality.<eos> I studied a similar tribe in Papua New Guinea.<eos> I take it back.<eos> Those children, are not deformed, Booth.<eos> They...
like "Children of the Corn."<eos> I crown you King of the Wussies.<eos> What?<eos> ♪ Dominus ♪<eos> They don't blink.
What is it?<eos> Sophia, I know you.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't ask these questions.<eos> They do us no good not here.
I wished the volcano would have a huge eruption, so the four of us could live together again in Osaka...<eos> I know that...<eos> I know that. but...<eos> Mom's started working again and we're in a crisis<eos> But I planted vegetable seeds last month, and they'll ripen in the spring
Sixty... sixty will be fine.<eos> I have a paper due tomorrow and I'm gonna fail!<eos> But what about the children?<eos> I know!<eos> They're the future.
You know they're going to win<eos> Come, sities, come, come<eos> Orangutans are happiest at play in the jungle<eos> And this group is now old enough to explore the forest that surrounds the care center<eos> These trees bear the same fruits they will find in the rainforest
Hoyt told me you slept with every pretty girl within a hundred miles.<eos> Look at ya.<eos> How can you not think you are special?<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Sometimes words just come out of my face, and I got no idea what they mean.
They mean well. They really do. But they have different beliefs.<eos> We can't change them. We shouldn't try to.<eos> But they can't change us, either.<eos> It's important to take pride in our beliefs.<eos> They are what sustain us and give us purpose.
They won't come out.<eos> -Not even for you?<eos> -Nope. That's how scared you got them.<eos> I swear I didn't do anything.<eos> I went in to check on them and they got hysterical.
But I'm not Liu Jinxi<eos> Jinxi That day by the pond if the woman you met hadn't been me Would you have stayed?<eos> Sir, spare my children<eos> Kill me if you must!<eos> They're innocent
If you don't mind.<eos> Uh, they tend to be personal in nature.<eos> I'm his wife.<eos> I can probably answer them better than he can.<eos> They're about his job.
Now development threatens to erase this place.<eos> Commerce is commerce.<eos> That's not really the point, is it?<eos> The truth is, a town's identity is made up of places like this one.<eos> And once they're gone, they're gone.
It started when I was 17.<eos> They'd make a cash drop,<eos> I'd get the eggs, collect the balance on delivery.<eos> Okay.<eos> The guy I was running for said he was selling them as pets, but they weren't pets.
Can't you handle it?<eos> Come to Mummy.<eos> Come on!<eos> Babies, eh?<eos> They're just always thirsty.
NARRATOR: Over in Departures, Moses is collecting for charity.<eos> MOSES: As you may know, I do a lot of work behind the scenes for my charity, WishWings, if you'll pardon the pun.<eos> Basically, it's free flights for very ill children.<eos> We take sick kids and we give them a break from being ill.<eos> Well, I mean, they're still ill but they're on a plane.
- No, no question.<eos> Leave.<eos> A channel. There are children.<eos> Sassine, change the channel.<eos> There are children. Should not they see it.
long toes on its feet.<eos> Its spine and its ribs still connected.<eos> Its jaws have long teeth which would've enabled it to snatch fish from the surface of the lagoon.<eos> But the most fascinating parts of its anatomy are its wings.<eos> They are supported as in all pterosaurs by a hugely elongated finger.
Because that's how active kids' imaginations are.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I mean, imagination is one thing.<eos> She got up in the middle of the night. I mean, it's a little odd that she got up in the middle...<eos> You haven't been around kids for that long. They do weird things.
But, since we humans are going to be consuming these resources over time we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify- we also need to track.<eos> We need to make sure we don't run out of any of this stuff... that would be bad.<eos> And this means not only tracking our rates of use but the rates of earthly regeneration as well such as how long it takes for, say a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.<eos> This is called "Dynamic Equilibrium".<eos> In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back- we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.
-What?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Unfair.<eos> I don't even like children.<eos> They like you.
Being who you are and your past...<eos> When you have to be dad to your daughters, and you go, "don't do that!" and they go, "dad,"<eos> and then show one of your old videos or something?<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> What happens is... at our house, we have a go-kart track there, so I'm teaching my kids to ride, and, you know, we do all this stuff, and they got the little atvs.
Some birthday, huh?<eos> For a moment, I thought this was gonna be awkward<eos> What's up with the windows?<eos> Did you turn the radiators on?<eos> They're scorching.
Just like kittens.<eos> Isn't this the worst thing he's done?<eos> He'll kill five children.<eos> They're five small persons, he killed more homeless.<eos> They don't know they're in danger.
Sir, over to you.<eos> Best of luck. hello, kids!<eos> It's nice to see you dressed today.<eos> I was afraid you might show up in your underwear.<eos> I am scared of these kids. Because they are the future of our nation.
Yet there are places on Earth where we can begin to encounter time on these universal scales.<eos> This is Ostional on the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica, and I've come here to witness a natural event that's been happening long before there were any humans here to see it.<eos> And I suppose it really is a window into the distant past of life on our planet.<eos> Once the sun has dipped below the horizon and the moon conspired to make the tides just right, this beach is visited by prehistoric creatures.<eos> Under the cover of darkness, they emerge from the ocean.
The parents of Cold Rock need to know.<eos> Are the children dead?<eos> No!<eos> I couldn't keep them all.<eos> Where are they?
How have they handled it?<eos> They're... they're the best people I know.<eos> I love them more...<eos> I would do anything to see them not hurt.<eos> They love their father, and they have stood by him throughout.
I just think it's easy for people to judge, and I think it's harder for them to forgive.<eos> So you have forgiven him?<eos> I have.<eos> What is in the past is in the past.<eos> And your children... have they forgiven him?
I have.<eos> What is in the past is in the past.<eos> And your children... have they forgiven him?<eos> My children love their father.<eos> They would do anything for him.
There's my sexy girl.<eos> - Hey, lover.<eos> - Blah! - Sorry.<eos> - Look, there's 40 towels-lady.<eos> They're for everyone!
She doesn't hate you.<eos> There's too many rows, too many things said.<eos> I've screwed around and rubbed her nose in it.<eos> But those kids, I love those kids.<eos> They love you.
Rotten seed.<eos> We're all bad seeds.<eos> Subhuman.<eos> Go on and have some babies.<eos> Maybe they'll turn out different.
They turn around, and so they all join up in patterns.<eos> There's a self-organizing property in fields.<eos> They're inherently integrative.<eos> And what I'm suggesting is that there's another kind of field called morphic fields, which organize the bodies of animals and plants and organize the activities of brains and minds.<eos> Rupert believes that morphic fields are what allow birds to fly in perfect formation, what guide the mass migrations of herd animals, and he also believes they are the reason we get that uncanny feeling when someone stares at us.
Eh? No doubt about it.<eos> You'll have to separate the sweating cows from the rest of the herd and slaughter them.<eos> Are you mad, man?<eos> I can't kill live, healthy animals.<eos> They're in calf.
I'm gonna make her sorry she ruined my life.<eos> She didn't ruin your life.<eos> I did.<eos> I'm the one who wrote all those letters.<eos> I just used her name and picture, because I'm a celebrity, and celebrities... can't be associated with prisoners, unless they're researching a role.
It's a bit boring, bland.<eos> It might look boring...<eos> It isn't boring because...<eos> What are these cars about?<eos> They are about the sensation of driving, and this will give it to me because it's a small Renault and they're the best in the world at that.
Keep less?<eos> How much less?<eos> Just enough to spoil your kids?<eos> No.<eos> But they need it more than people with TB or children in Indonesia with no eyes?
And maybe our idea of the Reaper was extraterrestrial in origin.<eos> NARRATOR: Mysterious plagues accompanied by extraterrestrial sightings.<eos> And gruesome deaths preceded by ominous apparitions.<eos> But were those strange metallic objects seen in the skies over Europe really misunderstood cosmic events... like meteors and comets... as most mainstream scientists believe?<eos> TSOUKALOS: In 1731, there were UFO sightings over England, Ireland and Romania, and they predated the worldwide flu epidemic of 1732.
You're a good troop leader.<eos> Not for these times I'm not.<eos> It's taken me a while to see this, but these kids...<eos> I don't understand 'em.<eos> And they certainly don't understand me.
And, if so, what other even more powerful weapons might they have had in their arsenal? An unmanned aerial vehicle hurtles across the sky.<eos> It travels at supersonic speeds, spitting fire, launching deadly missiles... programmed to seek and destroy.<eos> The effect is devastating... high-tech warfare at its most lethal. But what could be a page stolen from a U.S. military black project, is actually a description written down over 2,500 years ago in the sacred Hindu text known as the<eos> Mahabharata. COPPENS:<eos> When it comes to the ancient Indian accounts, they're really eyewitness testimony of the gods fighting. When you read the ancient Hindu epics, they talk about horrific weapons... missiles... and atomic weapons... massive laser weapons that are melting and devastating entire cities.
These are long and ribbon-like.<eos> Almost certainly, only for show.<eos> They're the earliest record of ornamental feathers.<eos> Not just for attraction but also to threaten.<eos> In fact, the very name Epidexipteryx means "display feather", and they're among the most bird-like of any dinosaur.
It's called El Chemistri, and they use science to make the food.<eos> Behold... pine needle sorbet.<eos> Pine needle... sorbet?<eos> Pine needle sorbet?<eos> My kids do not eat sorbet; they eat sherbet.
Washington is capital of the United States.<eos> So the point was to demonstrate at the height of of the Cold War, that they were a power greater than us.<eos> It's sometimes thought that during periods of political upheaval and turning points and history that these extraterrestrials suddenly show up<eos> What were these strange lights that penetrated the airspace of the U.S. capital?<eos> Could they have been, as ancient astronaut theorists suggest, alien craft-- sent here to monitor this turning point in our history?
This demon was said to possess eternal life while feeding on the living.<eos> The notion of the thing from the spirit world traveling through the various Indian nations was a great fear<eos> among not only the Cherokee but also the Sioux and Arapaho.<eos> But who, or what, are these mysterious creatures and where did they come from?<eos> Might they be, as ancient astronaut theorists believe, extraterrestrial beings abandoned here on Earth?
You know, I can see why you're not close to your children.<eos> Oh, wow. (Laughs)<eos> That's pants.<eos> Oh.<eos> Are they half off?
You're up.<eos> Feeling better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were kind of in and out a little, so I took the liberty of putting your dresses away.<eos> I wasn't sure if they went on the left or the right, so I went with the right.
Sure.<eos> That's why I can't even walk through my own home without tripping over one of your dead offspring.<eos> I loved my children.<eos> To death.<eos> They are a part of me, just like that unborn child is a part of me, and I will not have you put your filthy hands on my grandchild.
(SNIFFS) I really want a hug.<eos> But you can't hug me, can you?<eos> Cos you haven't got any arms.<eos> I can give you a hug... because I have got arms.<eos> And... and they're not just for rowing.
Then we need to find something that either threatens your brother or shames him, something that we could take that would make him afraid to come after us.<eos> The killing of the Southern Sudanese. He videotaped them.<eos> He wouldn't want the world to see those.<eos> If we had those videotapes, he wouldn't follow us.<eos> Where are they?
So, who's the father?<eos> Eh, it doesn't matter.<eos> If there's one day a year to give unwed mother's a break, it's Christmas.<eos> Okay, everyone, smile while the pets take our picture.<eos> Hmm, funny how they evolved and we didn't.
Please.<eos> You have to help me find my son.<eos> I hate heroes.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> Where are they?
Now, imagine someone drives into the back of you at 100 mph<eos> That is what it feels like<eos> And yet, despite everything this is a quiet car, a comfortable car<eos> It's not refined, it makes the noises racing cars make<eos> But they are subdued in the background
"O resplendent sky what should I do"<eos> "On these sleepless nights?"<eos> "Place your restless heartbeat on my hand..."<eos> Place your knotted breath on my breath...<eos> "My eyes feel shy... as they travel across your face"

He daughter is an idiot! Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP.<eos> - Her daughter is an idiot!<eos> No, no she's not.<eos> We have a list of six demands.<eos> Here they are in alphabetical order.
Following the same logic, a fighter pilot traveling near the speed of sound, attempting to make a 90-degree turn at the same speed, would experience something close to 300 "g"s of force.<eos> The most that a human pilot wearing a pressure suit can manage without blacking out is around ten "g"s.<eos> If his physiology were remotely similar to humans, an extraterrestrial pilot undergoing a 300-g maneuver would instantly perish.<eos> His internal organs would continue moving forward and crush against the skeleton.<eos> If they were similar to us, they'd probably have to have a way of injecting fluid- - Internal fluid- - Inside their bodies so that they dealt with this problem of their organs floating around inside, and if they were strapped in properly and cushioned properly, uh, end up not having internal damage when they accelerated and decelerated.
It's her!<eos> Blistering barnacles!<eos> What's that noise?<eos> My ears,<eos> - they're bleeding.
I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> You've opted for vacuum-aspiration abortion today.<eos> I'm just going to ask you a few questions.<eos> They're sensitive in nature so if at any time you're uncomfortable, you just let me know, okay?
They've never been out of this part of town.<eos> We can camp.<eos> No, I'd rather have a dog, a little dog<eos> No, darling.<eos> They poo all day and cost a fortune.
But you didn't.<eos> It's a wonderful miracle.<eos> I'm your number 72.<eos> This letter will be delivered by our children.<eos> You will not recognize them because they are beautiful, but they know who you are.
Letls start with something easier.<eos> Whatls your favorite color?<eos> What is that? Purple?<eos> Black.<eos> How about these little things you saw? What do you think they are?
It's empty.<eos> Like the threat of the sign.<eos> Who dares enter this secret domain?<eos> Watch these eyes.<eos> Watch these eyes as they watch you.
You mean gets on the "happy meat" train right?<eos> - Not tonight, come on Dennis.<eos> I'm sorry to rain on your parade.<eos> What have you really accomplished except making people feel better about imprisoning and killing animals for pleasure and profit?<eos> As long as they're property they're going to be exploited.
What do these experiences say about the nature of reality, the nature of our minds or the function of our brain that we can so quickly shift into these alternate realities?<eos> Let's take a step back and consider how these experiences inform us about ourselves, our conscience and the symbiosis of the two.<eos> It started seeming to me that what was happening with DMT particularly with respect to some of these reports of entering parallel or alternative, free standing parallels sorts of realms of existances, that indeed was what their consciousness was doing.<eos> The chemistry of their brain, which is the organ of consciousness, was being changed by DMT in such a way that they could then receive information that we weren't able to receive normally.<eos> Yes, there's the experiences from DMT and ayahuasca, and they have their, their function but if we also look at what it enables us to see.
It really is-here's the crazy Part about it.<eos> Kids are the only people In the world That you're allowed to hit.<eos> Do you realize that?<eos> They're the most vulnerable, And they're the most destroyed By being hit, But it's totally Okay to hit them.<eos> And they're the only ones.

I have no idea. So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech.<eos> He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics.<eos> He said these equations are so advanced that only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life<eos> - could've come up with them. - So...<eos> So, what do they mean?
He's a con artist who hides behind the cross.<eos> And quite frankly I'm tired of this football rivalry.<eos> I mean, Overland stole our mascot this morning.<eos> It's a tradition.<eos> Dean Simon, if you can find it within your heart To reinstate me for Saturday's game, don't do it for me, Do it for the children of Chile 'cause they desperately need my help.
Your mother's dead?<eos> If he didn't tell you, I'm sure he had a reason.<eos> Look, you can mock him all you want about peeing the bed, but please don't bring up our mother.<eos> Your blood contains an abnormally high volume of certain proteins, called cryoglobulins.<eos> They become thick when it gets cold outside.
Me, too.<eos> It was just so important to me that Juanita was doing well. I know.<eos> No, I don't think you do.<eos> My kids are my calling card.<eos> They're what I have to show for myself.
I need you to do me a favour.<eos> Can we have a moment?<eos> What happened to his eyes?<eos> He donated them.<eos> And where are they?
And since there's no apple juice in your trash, and this hasn't been opened,<eos> Eddie, have you been cheeking your meds?<eos> What* No.<eos> Eddie.<eos> They're for my mom.
Can you toss me my camisole?<eos> No, my camisole.<eos> Camisole?<eos> You don't know what a camisole is?<eos> I was brought up by these animals, and they didn't like questions.
No, no Madame.<eos> michael Garfield is not responsible for the death of Joyce Reynolds.<eos> e was in Athens at the time.<eos> Poirot he has already checked.<eos> And the sources of Poirot, they are impeccable.
But it's ridiculous to think there's anything on this planet worth seeing which merits crossing what are literally astronomical distances.<eos> Maybe aliens are anthropologists?<eos> Maybe they just want to study our religion and sex and... love and our funny languages and line dancing?<eos> That's an interesting possibility I hadn't considered.<eos> Well, living creatures, they like to reach out, Bones.

So when you filled out your insurance, you weren't thinking about my muscular arms... or my ass, in the combat-firing stance?<eos> - No, I wasn't. I don't.<eos> I mean, I'm...<eos> So full of shit, your eyes are brown.<eos> No, they're...

I'm not telling you again! (beep) I will not say this one more time!<eos> So... Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> The kids don't listen to me unless I yell at them. (earrings thud)<eos> I'm tired, and they push me.
Sorry.<eos> It was my children who called here earlier.<eos> - Yearning of home?<eos> - Home?<eos> They will not return.
Well, I don't have any doubt, detective. You tell me how a man Doesn't run back in there to save his own sons.<eos> The neighbors, they saw him on the street While my babies burned up.<eos> How could he not go back in there?<eos> Tell me that!<eos> Those were your kids, would you stand outside While they burned alive?
And we could use the money, with the kids' college...<eos> - baby, I don't care about the money.<eos> - Kayla, I know what you want, what you all want,<eos> - but you cannot risk your life for this.<eos> - But these babies, they're alive, and we're so close.
- baby, I don't care about the money.<eos> - Kayla, I know what you want, what you all want,<eos> - but you cannot risk your life for this.<eos> - But these babies, they're alive, and we're so close.<eos> They're not our babies.
It's nice the holiday is memorable in some other way.<eos> I'm sorry a little girl spoiled your Thanksgiving.<eos> Next time I'll tell her not to get sick.<eos> I've raised children in my life, Henry.<eos> They're terrified of her.
Other hazardous weather, 80%...<eos> To understand how the solar system came into being, we need to understand the physical principles that govern the whole universe.<eos> But, of course, the same laws of physics also control the world WE inhabit, so to discover how the solar system started, we don't need to look out into space or back in time.<eos> We just need to look around us.<eos> One of the remarkable things about the laws of nature is that they're universal, and that means that the same laws that describe the formation of the solar system can also describe the most mundane things here on Earth, like the motion of water as it drains from the sink.
Uh, not yet, but we expect him any minute.<eos> I've just got a few more questions for you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> They're very basic.
Lying about my kids even?<eos> Let's talk about your kids for a minute, Mr. Bailey.<eos> I-I don't mean the private schools, the fancy away camps, and the beautiful house...<eos> All the luxuries you've managed to give them on a $38,000 income.<eos> But how will they survive without their dad and their mom?
You want to know if I think my mom Did something to that dog.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sit.<eos> Don't most kids drink soda?<eos> Who knows what they do?
I tried to explain, it's not violent death that makes me morbidly depressed.<eos> It was life.<eos> And he thinks that explanation shows a positive attitude?<eos> Oh, I'm quite positive about my job.<eos> For example, these injuries, how cool are they?
We've voyaged to the farthest reaches of the solar system.<eos> We've photographed strange new worlds, stood in unfamiliar landscapes, tasted alien air.<eos> Now, the laws of physics are simple and they're universal.<eos> What applies here applies everywhere else up there.<eos> But it's fascinating that they can manifest themselves in so many different ways across the solar system.
I was just telling her how much it hurts me when my kids are sick.<eos> Mmm, I wish I could just take all that sickness and put it all inside of me.<eos> Do all the suffering for them.<eos> My little munchkin.<eos> What do they have?
Okay.<eos> Think there's any pizza left?<eos> Where are the pictures?<eos> Damn, I told you I break cameras.<eos> No, seriously, where are they?
Courthouse is only a couple miles away, you know.<eos> We can't do this just anywhere, all right?<eos> It's under control.<eos> Fire Engines and Ambulances use traffic-control devices to make traffic flow their way.<eos> They're fairly simple -- strobing at a particular frequency that can be picked up by the traffic light.
And we know how you feel about candles, so...<eos> Well, what's wrong with candles?<eos> Well...<eos> Hold it, hold it, hold it-- Hey, kids, kids, come here a sec. Huddle up here.<eos> No, if the little kids want to go to the haunted house, if they can, then I can too.
I mean, if you're gonna leave a permanent record, the only way you can do that is in stone.<eos> But if advanced beings from another planet really did bring their technology to Earth, might the ancient astronauts have left one of their tools behind?<eos> The methods used to build huge megalithic structures such as Puma Punku and the pyramids of Egypt remain a mystery.<eos> But what about the tools used to build them?<eos> Where are they?
power tools... mega-machinery... And the ability to explore the heavens...<eos> Have these technologies been available for just the past few centuries?<eos> Or are they of ancient origin, only recently rediscovered?<eos> Were our ancestors capable of these incredible achievements?<eos> Or might they have come from another source, one much more out of this world?
Like I said, I've been studying your work.<eos> You didn't have anything better to do?<eos> I like numbers. And equations.<eos> I always have, ever since I was little.<eos> They don't lie.
I need to live my own.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> My dad wanted me to be a dentist like him, but gums freak me out, man.<eos> A lot of things freak you out.<eos> They sure do. You have no idea.
- Yes, Gus, opportunity.<eos> With a woman like that.<eos> * * She's making eyes with me.<eos> She has eyes, yes.<eos> But they're looking at me.
But I found this by the fireplace.<eos> Lint?<eos> A tear from Santa's trousers.<eos> I've tested the fibers.<eos> They're fire-resistant.
- The troubles.<eos> - Couple years later, I got better, and I stopped hearing about them.<eos> - And you're afraid they're coming back?<eos> - No.<eos> They are back.
You don't have any idea.<eos> I've seen a lot of children.<eos> We'll keep an eye on Harrison, but I really think your son is gonna be perfectly fine.<eos> Ooh. He wants his head back.<eos> Ahh. Children Harrison's age can exhibit what might seem like violent behavior, but they're just releasing energy.
And I'll tell you something else, the children never mention Sarah, do they?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Oh, no, not to you.<eos> But to Mum, to Robin, to me, to everyone except you, cos theydon't think that you want to talk about her, but they miss her too.
So who is ready to talk Radon?<eos> We are.<eos> This is a list of his initial requests.<eos> Great, that's great.<eos> They're all doable.
Bodie! Yeah!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the press, thank you for coming here today.<eos> It's come to my attention that the BMS football program has committed major NCAA rule violations.<eos> Now these violations are in no way, shape, or form unique to our program.<eos> They happen at almost all major schools every year, but they are serious nonetheless.
It's just not bloody right.<eos> What's not bloody right, love?<eos> Taking food from kids.<eos> I'm not taking it from the kids.<eos> If they, if we didn't eat it, it would just go in the bin.
Schultz, Kerry?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Okay, uh, my patient's scans are up.<eos> And, uh, seriously...<eos> They're all beige to me.
Or visions.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But they're so real.<eos> Premonitions.<eos> Telling you something they are.
Nothing.<eos> I just think maybe we could use expressions that are from this century, for those of us who were born more recently.<eos> Yeah, but "seeking sanctuary" feels kind of on the nose.<eos> Okay, well, how about we use Mafia terms, right?<eos> They're timeless.
No, sing!<eos> Sing!<eos> Are you seriously crying 'cause I'm not gonna sing?<eos> Putting the kids... putting the kids to bed is torture.<eos> That's the hardest thing in the world to do, because they don't want to sleep.
You sure that's a good idea?<eos> No.<eos> But it might be.<eos> No tachycardia.<eos> So only the delusions are left, if they're even still there.
I said 11:00. We've got a game in the morning.<eos> Shut up and load your tranquilizer rifle.<eos> We had a family of badgers in my yard when I was growing up.<eos> Those things killed our German shepherd, man.<eos> They're dangerous.
This is the acr 1:33 edition.<eos> What do you guys think of this?<eos> [ Cheers and applause ] Yeah. When you think of viper, you don't think of subtle, right?<eos> And the red wheels...<eos> They're not subtle, so it fits right along the lines.
I asked them who they wanted to live with - Mummy or Daddy.<eos> For God's sake, they're little kids.<eos> They said Daddy, of course, but they meant Mummy.<eos> Which goes to show how the odds are stacked against us.<eos> A bloody awful mother, a wonderful father, and they still chose the mother.
Curiously, after 13 years of digging, archeologists investigating the ancient site have failed to recover a single stonecutting tool.<eos> Nor have they found any agricultural implements.<eos> How in the world can you contemplate 19-foot-tall, perfectly-sculpted columns that are 11,000 to 12,000 years old, and no tools?<eos> The mystery of Gobekli Tepe is further compounded by the ancient stone carvings found throughout the site.<eos> They depict creatures like armadillos, wild boars and geese... animals not indigenous to the region.

That would have provided the visual imagery and the basic ideas for some of the ancient mythology.<eos> In Judeo-Christian and Islamic tradition, there was an idea that there will be some kind of final warfare when God defeats Satan once and for all.<eos> That's been interpreted by some people to say that the aliens will come back and they'll fight it out again one final time.<eos> But have these warnings of imminent war on Earth actually come from God?<eos> Or could they have originated from somewhere else?
What a mighty God we serve<eos> So, I have an audition later today, but I don't think I'll go because I'll never get it. But you're Working with a casting director.<eos> That's huge. See, that's what I thought, too.<eos> And they do get me some auditions, but I'm up against the same 15 girls. And they always get the part.<eos> Yeah, maybe, but they're not Joy.
He demanded that i recall the planes,or he would launch.<eos> - What does hodges want?<eos> - I don't know... but he's requested a face-to-face meeting.<eos> He'll be at the white house in a few minutes.<eos> Madam president,the only reason he wants a face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands, and whatever they are,you cannot negotiate with him.
Yo, Mr. Barlow, you're supposed to be on break, man.<eos> Go, get out of here!<eos> Go grab a soda or something, huh?<eos> Okay, but watch out for children.<eos> They like to touch things.
And yet you will die for this man, deserting your children forever?<eos> Do you value this man more than them?<eos> - That's not a fair question.<eos> - It is a question!<eos> Or maybe... even if you die, they will not feel the loss.
And then, it got worse during the day, so I called the doctor, and he thought she was just colicky, but I thought-well, anyways...<eos> I brought her in that night, and, um... then her breathing started to get bad, and then, they told me she had a heart defect, and then, on monday, she passed away...<eos> in my arms.<eos> She had such a sweet little face, you know, and when she went, her cheeks, they turned... gray.<eos> So suddenly, they... just gray.
I love to travel.<eos> One day I shall have to resume my exploration of the world.<eos> It's in our blood, isn't it?<eos> You're not like the other girls.<eos> They're still waiting for their lives to begin.
But not you.<eos> But you can go whenever you choose.<eos> Why do you stay?<eos> I stay for my girls, of course.<eos> When they leave, so shall I.
We all knew Deputy Hawes.<eos> Can you think of anybody who'd want him dead?<eos> I'd imagine nearly everyone living on the reservation.<eos> Well, maybe not the kids.<eos> They didn't really get to know him.
Lucas, stop it.<eos> Can't you see they're scared?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I told you what your chores were, leave the kids to me!<eos> But they were so scared.
Why do you make such an effort for these ingrates?<eos> Just do your job and you'll be happier.<eos> I am happy.<eos> With someone else's kids?<eos> Before you know it, they've grown up, they're gone and they don't even remember your face.
I am happy.<eos> With someone else's kids?<eos> Before you know it, they've grown up, they're gone and they don't even remember your face.<eos> Those damn ingrates.<eos> I love them and they love me.
He was my friend.<eos> And he died in vain.<eos> Everybody out there has died in vain... if we start our future with an act of cruelty.<eos> What will you tell your children?<eos> What will they tell theirs?
Let me in!<eos> Asia, goodbye.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> -No, the judge...<eos> Just because he believes your lies doesn't mean they are true.
Who cares if it kills me?<eos> At least I'll go out with a headline.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen what you are about to see is not a trick or an illusion.<eos> Simply a display of daring and dexterity.<eos> Now, young lady, if you'll please check the bindings. You'll see they're very real. Very tight.
Dirk, he, - He had his troubles.<eos> What kind of troubles?<eos> School was never easy for Dirk.<eos> We didn't have much money and, well, you know, kids, they can be cruel.<eos> They picked on him. They picked on him?
- What?<eos> - Sir, there's a murderer at large.<eos> - Then you'd better hurry.<eos> - You are an officer of the court and therefore obligated to aid in the capture...<eos> I am well aware of my obligations, Chief Johnson, in particular, as they relate to my client.
Only one of them?<eos> I mean,how did they,you know,when they were...<eos> I just don't see physically how they...<eos> Okay,look,that's not the issue.<eos> Just take that image out of your mind and pretend that they are separate individuals, and ask yourself if you found anything that suggested a relationship.
Go ahead.<eos> No, I would like to get back to work, actually.<eos> - Please.<eos> What is a two-way petting zoo?<eos> You pet the animals, they pet you back.
I don't know.<eos> They're so mad it's hard to tell how they feel.<eos> They're mad at you, Paul? That's what they feel?<eos> And what if I'm just like him?<eos> I mean, did they feel that they had to compete with my patients for my attention?
Well, no, the air felt great.<eos> It's just that...<eos> Connie and Natalie, they were just so... tentative with me.<eos> There's a separate studio near the main house that I've used as an office sometimes, or sometimes just to... for a little peace and quiet when the kids were younger.<eos> I wanted to go there but they kept asking me why.
Previously on Ghost Whisperer... day of the accident, I saw Jim's ghost step into sam's body.<eos> you're back!<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Your memories, they're not yours.
it is gonna be a bloodbath!<eos> Hey, babe. what's up?<eos> It's your children. they've run amok.<eos> What?<eos> now that you've gone back to work, They won't listen to me.
They really know how to push my buttons.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I got a couple monsters at home, too.<eos> The key is, you gotta be the bigger monster.<eos> Well, unfortunately, They're not afraid of me.
Thanks, bro.<eos> Guys...<eos> I got it.<eos> The bodies in the basement...<eos> The way they're all arranged...
- You don't.<eos> I've got the kids.<eos> - Well, until I fix the house.<eos> - No, for good.<eos> They're gonna come back to me, Jessica.
In which case, your children will be taken without you.<eos> But you've seen what they do to them!<eos> They're just girls, sir!<eos> They're just girls!<eos> They're not...
But you've seen what they do to them!<eos> They're just girls, sir!<eos> They're just girls!<eos> They're not...<eos> - They're not...
So...<eos> You're overseeing other people?<eos> I'm sorry if you misunderstood our arrangement.<eos> What am I supposed to tell our children?<eos> They already know, and they're happy for me.
- Old clothes.<eos> - Good clothes.<eos> - Not good enough for Hunter High.<eos> I've seen the clothes them kids wear.<eos> They're cheap.
Single.<eos> Any children?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> I have nothing against children, of course, but they complicate matters:
No youre not!<eos> You're just saying that to be with some old git.<eos> You think Im on the wrong track.<eos> I think you should be bloody careful when interviewing children.<eos> They might know something about Rebecka Odelman that we don't.
- - Not sure. Something about my daughter?<eos> -<eos> - We found children. - - Children?<eos> Hundreds of children, perhaps thousands.<eos> Where are they? What i have done them?
I'm reeling.<eos> Kids just don't seem to like me.<eos> I wish they did.<eos> I've always liked them.<eos> They just don't like me. And maybe, if it were mine...
Whereas one from a drier island had a peak at the front, which enabled it to reach up to higher vegetation.<eos> Were these tortoises, each on their separate islands, different species?<eos> And if so, was each one a separate act of divine creation?<eos> The differences that Darwin had noticed amongst these Galapagos animals, were, of course, all tiny.<eos> But if they could develop, wasn't it possible that over the thousands or millions of years, a whole series of such differences might add up to one revolutionary change?
Sorry I'm late.<eos> Let me just grab my books.<eos> I don't want the girls to know I'm back till you and I have talked.<eos> Ok. Not sure it was necessary to go all "Boo Radley" on me, but-<eos> How they doing?
Fate.<eos> It's not about the losing streak.<eos> What's it about then?<eos> It's disturbing when I think about how the kids look up to you, Ray.<eos> They love you.
- I have so much love to give.<eos> - Then give it to me.<eos> I do, but I wanna give it to the kids.<eos> - Then give it to the kids.<eos> - They don't want it!
- You mean,fire,flames?<eos> - Oh,yeah,right.<eos> wait. Mom.<eos> Mom,do you remember when he made those cookies?<eos> What were they called?
I understand.<eos> But this baby...<eos> I-I can't get rid of it.<eos> I love him.<eos> we all have dreams, And sometimes they get complicated.
How areyou?<eos> My tractor's broken.<eos> Can you pick up the animals from music school?<eos> - I'm busy,<eos> - They're in... Mrs, Longray's class,
And i know bailey does, which is why i'm mad.<eos> Because it's wrong, sir. it's wrong and mean to use a robot<eos> To lure dr. bailey back into general surgery 'cause i don't have a robot.<eos> All i have are little kids,<eos> And... they're not as fun as a robot.
Oh, yeah, Will?<eos> How's that workin' out for you?<eos> You have to remember something.<eos> We're dealing with children.<eos> They need to be terrified.
Hey, Dex.<eos> Hey, Elliot.<eos> Have a nice day!<eos> You knew this day would come, Dexter.<eos> You've always been good with kids, but eventually they grow up.
I'll tell you something about those two bitches.<eos> - Have they gone yet?<eos> - KELLY-SU: No, we're still here.<eos> - Have they gone now?<eos> - They're just...
What is the rush?<eos> On our nightstand, Rob and I have a wireless router where our wedding photo used to be.<eos> This year, my sister and I exchanged happy birthdays via text message.<eos> And I love Lois' kids. Right? But every one of their experiences is basically virtual.<eos> They've been denied a connection to the real world. And to their family.
We've established something. Whatever can I ask?<eos> Are you illegal in 17 US states? No, that's much too exaggerated.<eos> It's only nine, if I... Nine, illegal in nine US states.<eos> I just can't believe it. Some people have told us that you only know two facts about ducks and both of them are wrong.<eos> Is that true? Well, obviously they don't fly.
All right.<eos> What are these kids doing here anyway?<eos> Orphans mostly.<eos> They have nowherelse to be.<eos> If we're successful today, they may not have to beg anymore.
A city of pain under our feet.<eos> Oh, pain's a beautiful thing.<eos> In the end, it's the only thing we really deserve.<eos> It is only due to the concept of guilt we allow ourselves to see ourselves as imperfect.<eos> Our ego depends on guilt for its survival as it allows us to separate the world into different objects which we then call "good" and "evil."
The handle's maybe rotted away or perhaps even snapped off at the time of entry.<eos> Right. So, there are blade marks on the fourth and fifth left side ribs here. And here.<eos> All of which is consistent with a fatal stab wound to the chest.<eos> To the heart?<eos> - Mm-hm. Based on striations and the width of the blade, it would certainly have penetrated the heart and the victim would have bled out fairly quickly.
I'm dazzled, astonished.<eos> I'm also profoundly disappointed.<eos> I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.
Does that mean we won?<eos> We got those pieces after Hanna found out that Mona killed Charlotte.<eos> The body.<eos> Whatever Tanner has, she doesn't have the body.<eos> Then where is it?
And I'm lying there, praying that Mr. Boss' dimwit henchman doesn't shoot me in the head.<eos> And then suddenly it all became clear.<eos> You made all this happen. All of what?<eos> Everything!<eos> I don't know when you got the idea, but I'm guessing it's when you took the cure, and it worked.
Finally we're getting somewhere.<eos> Confess.<eos> Oliver, we've been betrayed.<eos> Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.
Enjoy your new offices.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Oh, hey. Would you like to see your desk?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here it is. This is your desk.
I was trying to work out where Michael got the porn from.<eos> Here! Your computer.<eos> He got it from you!<eos> That is not what's going on.<eos> What are you even doing with it?
You know, in two weeks, she won't even remember my name.<eos> And in three, she'll have latched he to some other girl to destroy.<eos> Goodmorning, students. This is your principal speaking.<eos> There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.
Any questions?<eos> Is this a knock-through?<eos> Well, in a way, yes.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> - It's like a...
- I wanna see that mirror.<eos> - Not alone, you don't.<eos> - Are you sure we wanna do this?<eos> - Not entirely.<eos> Where is it?
What I've just been told.<eos> Claude has wed.<eos> This very night.<eos> Then there's still a chance.<eos> If she hasn't consummated the marriage, it can still be annulled.
Or a twisted sheet and a chandelier.<eos> I try not to think about those escapes.<eos> It's harder on ceremony days, but thinking can hurt your chances.<eos> My name is Offred.<eos> I had another name, but it's forbidden now.
You don't check in, they move him, but that's okay.<eos> With any luck, I don't need you to talk.<eos> Do tell.<eos> This that, mind-reading device you guys have been screwing with?<eos> 'Cause our intel said it wasn't anywhere near ready.
I'll give you anything.<eos> You got nothing to give me, kid.<eos> I-I have a name.<eos> A name?<eos> I hate to break it to you, but your name's not worth shit.
Where did Franklin find the substance?<eos> Uh, he found it from some colonists in Maryland.<eos> Apparently a farmer from Williamsburg went missing.<eos> Uh, they discovered his body a week later in a cave in the Aberdeen Woods.<eos> I mean, it had been cocooned in this stuff.
Wait.<eos> How does it work?<eos> We've identified a second set of brain waves inside David's head.<eos> Now, this device targets everything that isn't David.<eos> It creates a vortex... A kind of a magnetic field... Which sucks out hopefully every last trace of Farouk.
Because I was young, woefully foolish and...<eos> Unarmed? You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...<eos> What if I told you that the sword was right here, on Earth? And it's already in your possession.
What do you, what do you mean, stop this from happening?<eos> A very long time ago, my wife<eos> Katrina attempted to change history by jumping back into the past using a powerful invocation known as the Traveler Spell.<eos> The Traveler Spell.<eos> It can be located in an ancient volume of black magic known as the Grand Grimoire.
It struck me as a opportune time to jump ship.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You're a fuckin' ninja.<eos> No.<eos> Even though your disclosure just now had absolutely no actionable value, it did reveal tremendous loyalty, so... all is well now.
I may have a sad love life, but I don't need my mommy trying to boost my self-esteem.<eos> And if you really want to give me some confidence, how about a picture of me on your desk, and not just Haley and Luke.<eos> First of all, I didn't give you those flowers.<eos> Second of all, there is a picture of you.<eos> - Where is it? - Mm-hmm.
Where are you based?<eos> Sorry?<eos> At the moment. Do you have an office?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where is it?
Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative.<eos> Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing... and I hope we get to clear some things up for the American people.<eos> Mr. President, the floor is yours.<eos> You can take as long or as short as you like.<eos> If you have any written statement, we will include it after and it will be part of the record.
You're damned right I convened a trial.<eos> I have work to do, Doctor.<eos> How'd you lose the arm, Colonel?<eos> I didn't lose it, Doctor.<eos> I know exactly where it is.
Dr. Bull, one more word from you, and you'll spend the night in jail.<eos> My apologies, sir.<eos> Members of the jury, you are not to question Mr. Laheri's absence.<eos> His testimony was removed from the record.<eos> It does not reflect on the defendant.
I would do anything for you, son.<eos> Now... tell me where your heart is.<eos> I... I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know where it is.
Scratch isn't afraid to plot an elaborate trap.<eos> I want a full breakdown of that house before we set one foot inside.<eos> Spencer.<eos> You can't officially go until you're reinstated.<eos> So that includes going to my apartment, since it's a crime scene.
You know, there's something about... finding gold... that is so difficult to put into words.<eos> It's real difficult.<eos> Taste of it on your tongue.<eos> The feel of it between your fingers, it's... it's electric.<eos> It's like a drug, 'cause it hooks you.
What's wrong with you?<eos> It's supposed to be a celebration.<eos> It's a celebration of your faith, not mine.<eos> Well, that's the virtue of wine.<eos> It doesn't discriminate.
You'll always be my brother.<eos> Everything I own is yours.<eos> No.<eos> I'll never have your name.<eos> And every time my name is spoken, it will be spoken alongside stories of my grandfather.
And this barrier between me and everything<eos> just dissolved.<eos> And I could die, because life is enormous.<eos> And I loved the feeling of dying,<eos> and then it passed.
I mean, even your hilarious attempts to make yourselves unpredictable, just follow the same pattern each time.<eos> Set up, set up, set up.<eos> Big reveal. Which tonight was going to be stroke of midnight, middle of the Thames?<eos> Tell me if I'm warm.<eos> Well, there will be a big reveal, and it will come now.
- And here's Level 4.<eos> This is the interesting stage, the hibernation stage.<eos> Comatose, unresponsive.<eos> The heart eventually stops, or so we thought.<eos> But it actually slows so that it's virtually untraceable.
"Oh, if you'd just seen what a wonderful child he was."<eos> And I thought we were done with the bullshit.<eos> How about this one?<eos> James Holden was conceived by a cult of political extremists as a trick for eight people to claim generational land rights.<eos> Kicked out of the Navy, he fell in with a radical fringe group in the Belt because it reminded him of home.
When you first opened that door and showed me the Urca gold, do you know what I saw?<eos> A solution.<eos> The mortar that would secure the sand beneath our feet.<eos> The thing I could offer to England or Spain or whomever arrived here and threatened to reorder things, and say, "Take this and leave me be."<eos> Everything is dependent upon that gold, and right now it is sitting in a fort with no guns and full of holes.
Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> 'Cause I'm a little shaky.<eos> Thinking how... life with Kiki's so great.<eos> It can all be gone in an instant.
Do you see Eli Condon anywhere?<eos> Where are you, Eli?<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I was at the carnival, but then it was gone, and then I was someplace else, someplace I've never been, but... it felt like I was re-experiencing it, like a memory, which doesn't make any sense.
Hmm. Guilty as charged.<eos> Apparently, that last call to Nate from the burner came in at exactly 5:21 a.m., which is odd, because...<eos> Because the time stamp on the store's security footage had our hit man entering the store at 5:25 a.m.<eos> I love it when we finish each other's thoughts.<eos> Point is, Nate gets a tip about a robbery before it's even started... that's how he was lured there.
We'refightingawar to protect Nassau inwhich our most effective weapon isthefearthatwecan instill in our enemies.<eos> Everything is dependent upon that gold, and right now it is sitting in a fort with no guns and full of holes.
Or maybe I have the wrong David Simkins.<eos> I hear there's two.<eos> Invade my personal life again, and I swear...<eos> Your personal life doesn't interest me, Harlee.<eos> What does is how often it seems to intersect with my investigation.
He wakes up, wanders into the laundromat that pays me for protection.<eos> Donnie said you didn't think the drunk guy was guilty, so... he had to cover our asses because he said you were a good detective.<eos> I never done anything like that before.<eos> Shh, shh.<eos> You have a burden, but you're in the right place for it.
Two people took many days and weeks to plan out hate.<eos> But love responded in an instant.<eos> The bombs went off and wreaked incredible havoc, death, and destruction. But in that immediate instant afterward, people ran toward us.<eos> I first heard the term "Boston Strong" about two days into the investigation.<eos> And for me, it was emblematic of how tough the city and its residents can be.
I know you have someone waiting for you at home.<eos> All that feels so unreal now.<eos> I used to think this place was all about... pandering to your baser instincts.<eos> Now I understand.<eos> It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self.
Before everything, I used to work for the FBI.<eos> I thought you were my friend.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> Don't disrespect that word.<eos> It means something to me.
And I just need you to keep him there and I will--<eos> I will come to you, okay?<eos> So, just wait there.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> No! Where is it?
We're looking for a friend.<eos> - There is a place.<eos> They send you there, you never come back.<eos> You can hear the screams all night.<eos> - This place, where is it?
I am nothing.<eos> I am no more than a blade of grass.<eos> But I am.<eos> You think you know evil?<eos> Here it stands.
You slaughter a train full of innocent people, and you talk of redemption?<eos> Oh, not for me.<eos> I'll writhe in the fires of hell.<eos> But see... you say that word, "innocent."<eos> I don't know what it means.
No one can help you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Young, healthy, a tad unsophisticated, but not bad.<eos> Listen to the heartbeat.<eos> It will tell you when to stop.
Clary?<eos> I... I forgot something.<eos> I forgot, I...<eos> Was it my name?<eos> Because it's Maureen.
It's not here.<eos> - I can't find it. ‭ - Calm down.<eos> Freya, think.<eos> When you were poisoned before, Klaus stole an antidote from Lucien.<eos> It has to be here.
Some bloody their fists trying to keep the Kitchen safe.<eos> Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life all around them.<eos> But this is Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here.<eos> You didn't choose this town. It chose you.
Someone help me, please.<eos> Help me, please.<eos> Uh, this is backed by cold, hard science. India has one of the most specialized flavor profiles of any cuisine in the world.<eos> You don't like Indian food?<eos> I don't think it likes me.
That's right.<eos> People know me, you know?<eos> They trust me to turn it into a mixed-use facility that'll make money, but also won't look like fucking Vegas on the water.<eos> People come to the Keys because it's one of the most unique places in the entire world, right?<eos> They wanna come and they wanna experience that beauty, but they want it unspoiled. They want it, uh... pure.
And please don't draw attention to yourself, hmm?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I must make sure my absence has not been noted.<eos> But I will be back.<eos> Oh, and remember, if any of Grimaud's men ask your name, it is?
Why did you get drunk?<eos> The sea...<eos> It's a bloody death-trap!<eos> I've seen too much.<eos> Since I retired... it... it haunts me.
I don't see anything about medicine.<eos> - It's printed right there. If you don't mix it in with her food she's gonna reject it.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I'll put the medicine in.<eos> Where is it?
Not that I don't admire his stubbornness, but... .. he'll pay for it.<eos> Will I have a chance to say goodbye to my wife?<eos> You will be removed from the court and taken directly to your fate.<eos> "The quality of mercy is not strain'd<eos> "It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath."
She wields a weapon of judgment, one that thirsts for the blood of those that prey upon us.<eos> Link her spirit with this sword.<eos> This blade draws blood from a vampire.<eos> It will connect you.<eos> It will guide you.
He vanished shortly afterwards.<eos> - George?<eos> - Sir, I spoke to somebody at the moving company.<eos> He said when the piano fell and killed Cummersworth, one of the movers that day was a new chap and right after the incident, he disappeared.<eos> - How did it fall on him?
If not that, then... a ghost?<eos> No...<eos> Was I fantasizing?<eos> Her name...<eos> What was it?
She thinks we're fools!<eos> That army could sack the city.<eos> And it will be your fault, Rinaldo!<eos> This city will be destroyed!<eos> Exile may not be what you want, Rinaldo. But it does mean we get to live.
I don't know.<eos> And then what did he say?<eos> That he had to think about it.<eos> I know.<eos> And look, maybe it is a midlife crisis, but... I just started thinking about my life, and-and what I want it to look like going forward, you know?
When will you believe I'd do anything for you?<eos> I think I'm getting there.<eos> Is that?<eos> My heart.<eos> It's beating.
And you brought the prototype with you to the Deviceroy conference?<eos> Yeah. I'd work on it during breaks.<eos> And how can you be sure you didn't lose it during one of those breaks?<eos> My backpack has a power plug.<eos> When I'm not working on the device, it's always plugged in there, charging.
Our prisoner's corpse has been hidden, even from God's sight.<eos> I was keen to see if the Spirits of Salts could dissolve a whole body.<eos> It can.<eos> The Red Knights will strike again, so I will continue to require your particular... skills.<eos> When he threw himself at my blade and it pierced his chest, hot blood spilling onto my hands...
It would appear so.<eos> For you, young man.<eos> George, you must stop this.<eos> Cannot a man spoil his godson?<eos> This new find... what do it mean?
Now!<eos> What is this?<eos> The end of your investigation, I'm afraid.<eos> We're confiscating the footage you were watching.<eos> It and your laptop are being wiped.
comes from a batch of money that was supposed to be destroyed in Iraq.<eos> Yes, and according to the Army, the three men ordered to destroy this cash were your client, his friend Miguel, and Nick, our victim.<eos> You better not be interviewing a suspect in my terrorist attack.<eos> Well, that all depends on how you look at it.<eos> Right now, we're doing a preliminary investigation of a robbery homicide, but it could connect to your case.
You made an astonishing error in judgment...<eos> If you had been anyone else, you wouldn't have been suspended.<eos> You would have been fired.<eos> And I'm done talking about this here... church and state.<eos> My baby is dying, its blood supply is cut off, and it's going to die.
- Would that include the study of flight paths and trajectories?<eos> Now, if you could tell me, before my client's drone is shot out of the sky, is it hovering in a stationary position, or moving toward Dr. Nachmann's home?<eos> Well, that drone actually looks like it's flying away from the house.<eos> So even if Ms. Hamm's drone had attempted a violent or illegal intrusion, it was in fact retreating.<eos> And under Illinois law, including the Castle doctrine, it is illegal to shoot an intruder in the back if he, or in this case it, is retreating.
Oh, I'm not giving up.<eos> I'm just saying there's other things to consider.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Money.<eos> Howard, at the end of the day, all I want to do is milk this place for all it's worth while it's still standing.
Oh, my God!<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'm ashamed and embarrassed by my behavior.<eos> It does not reflect the person that I am either as a lawyer or woman.
So what should we call this brave new world?<eos> I was thinking Flashpoint.<eos> My name is Edward Clariss.<eos> Rivals should know each other's names.<eos> It's like I'll be thinking of a moment from my past and it vanishes.
You two deserve each other.<eos> It should be here.<eos> I'm pretty sure we'd notice a lake.<eos> No, but it should be here.<eos> I mean, where the fuck is it?
Who's under the fort, Dad?<eos> I killed Taylor Shaw.<eos> I can't throw it out.<eos> That box is the last piece you have of him.<eos> Once it's gone, so is he.
Is he going to be all right?<eos> It's way too soon to say.<eos> We've barely started, plus... there's a problem with his heart.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's damaged beyond the nanite repair capability.
Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending that Nicole faces expulsion over a teaspoon of herbs when the Layton girl was selling pills on campus last fall, and yet I just saw her in the hallway.<eos> Okay, what are you doing?<eos> I'm being the feeder.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> We thank you for your consideration, but we don't need it.
Rumplestiltskin, you're back.<eos> I, uh... I did the wash, and I polished the silver like you asked.<eos> Good. Now you can take care of this.<eos> A baby?<eos> But where... where did it come from?
Luckily for those pigeons, crazy enough to never see combat.<eos> Eight out of ten.<eos> There's three more contenders to come.<eos> Catch that pigeon if you can.<eos> Okay, so my contender is a machine so surreal, it's hard to believe it even made it off the drawing board, but for one brief moment during the Second World War, it was a real contender for liberating Nazi-occupied Europe.
And I said we would get you home.<eos> Friend, you have a critter of your own.<eos> Oh, I smell it.<eos> One of the juicy ones.<eos> Where is it?
Are we clear to engage, yes or no? Come on.<eos> Make a decision.<eos> With respect, ma'am, I do not make those decisions.<eos> I am here to advise you on the law!<eos> The law is not here to get in your way, it is here to protect you, in addition, to protect your target.
I forgot send to the teacher long years ago.<eos> And also strange animal in the lake.<eos> To this day, I don't know what it was.<eos> In the water it was weightless... and calm.<eos> It's now floating in my head... in my heart.
Who among us will get to go to your divine kingdom?<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Or what?<eos> You're gonna fucking kill me because I have an opinion?<eos> It's just as valid as yours, man.
After my departure, please ensure that mine is the only longboat that ferries anyone to and from the island.<eos> - The men will resist.<eos> - Then you resist them right back.<eos> They all know that we're headed back for the Urca's gold.<eos> They all know where it is.
The only way to truly ensure that the Urca gold doesn't return here is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge of where it is and how to retrieve it.
Captain Hume.<eos> I understand you hold in your possession 10 pardons for whomever was to deliver you Captain James Flint.<eos> I wonder if I can't do better.<eos> This is Eleanor Guthrie, the trade boss of Nassau, the woman who lorded over a savage pirate kingdom as if it were a plaything.<eos> And without whom it cannot function.
You saw I had the garbage bag with me.<eos> What's with you guys?<eos> - Simply grotesque.<eos> Laura, stop using that word.<eos> It's driving me mad.
You're not seriously going back to work?<eos> What would you like me to do? Curl up in my bed and cry?<eos> -We have to get you off this island.<eos> -I'm not going until I find my baby.<eos> It's still alive, Alan.
But his greatest creation was yet to come.<eos> A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back.<eos> We know what you want-- healthy, natural food that still tastes great.<eos> And we're here to tell you...<eos> It doesn't exist.
No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars, except now all of you people.<eos> Which one is that?<eos> This is actually Ham-uel L. Jackson from the movie, Pork Fiction, it'sextremelyrare,and Iam keepingit.<eos> But still, they no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life.<eos> I opened my box in front of all of my friends, and it was a bunch of Virginia Woolf novels.
I went to see her.<eos> I thought that...<eos> I don't know what I thought...<eos> That I could offer you a hopeful future or that I could take care of your child until you could.<eos> But it is mine.
She might have given you the wrong name.<eos> You said she didn't give you any documentation. Have you tried circulating a photograph?<eos> No offence, but it doesn't sound like she was too keen to be found.<eos> She has a baby.<eos> It has a family.
And I'm not gonna get that if you crush all of their hopes at this invitational.<eos> Please, Mr. Shue.<eos> Look, this place changed your life.<eos> You're reminded of that every night that you go home to your wife and your beautiful baby.<eos> Just... consider paying it back for everything it's done for you.
What did you do to me?<eos> Hope's blood is now in you.<eos> You are now the bait.<eos> And this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
Let's get you back in your proper body, though I'll likely have to torture Freya and Esther to do so, which actually might be quite fun.<eos> No, Nik.<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Eva's gone for good, but her body, this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> I can feel it, and if I leave it, then it dies, and Davina and the others die with it.
Ben Si...<eos> It's your fault.<eos> This is God's punishment.<eos> I hear his heart.<eos> It still beats. I...
Outstanding.<eos> A-and by the way, we heard from Smalls about the terrific work you're doing with our veterans.<eos> Let me tell you, we're grateful to you for encouraging your veteran patients and their families to go to Vet Centers.<eos> We're so glad that, if they need it, the San Antonio Veteran Community can get the free counseling and support they have earned.<eos> We're big believers in counseling and know how much it can help.
But I can tell you there are some choices that are final.<eos> And you never get a second chance.<eos> And I got to say, I would kill for a do over.<eos> So, you want to move out of our apartment?<eos> Yeah, it's stupid to rent when we could own, and it'll be ours.
- Weapons down!<eos> - Knew more of you were coming.<eos> And we're leaving, - just give me the device.<eos> - Come and take it.<eos> Stop. We don't even know what it does!
She said she would hide me, but she lied.<eos> She was gonna give me to the cops.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Did you kill Bug?<eos> This place, no one knows where it is.
Thought maybe that was you.<eos> No... he had never shown me discourtesy.<eos> So, what's our play here?<eos> The wheel constantly turns.<eos> We must adapt to its position, or be crushed beneath it.
With your help, a vaccine could be a year away.<eos> We need the core for our servers.<eos> That algorithm is the lifeblood of our species.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> There is only one true cure, and it's within my reach.
I wasn't.<eos> Don't be afraid, Cisco.<eos> A great and honorable destiny awaits you now.<eos> I only hope that as you're living your great adventure, that you remember who gave you that life.<eos> And that it was given out of love.
Let's see...<eos> Last time we learned that light can be a partical as well as a wave.<eos> Today we'll learn why a light particle has zero mass.<eos> Like the name implies light moves at the speed of light.<eos> And according to Einstein... the mass of a body is infinte when it moves at the speed of light.
Which is better than working here?<eos> She says that her young man wants her to be free in the evenings.<eos> I must ask you to remember, my Lord, that there were six footmen when I first came here and five housemaids.<eos> Now we've got to two of each and no kitchen maids at all.<eos> We must run this place as it should be run.
No...<eos> - No!<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> All this time you spent here, you could've been building worlds.<eos> You could've been redefining life and how we live it.
Do not play games with me.<eos> Where will they go?<eos> Where is your son's body?<eos> Not here.<eos> Where is it?
That's what I want. I want you naked.<eos> "Nirvana! - Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> - Ew! Seeing your interviews makes me think you guys are the most immature pieces of trash ever made.<eos> If you assholes could ever write anything that could come close to anything Guns N' Roses has written, maybe you could talk, but until you sell a few billion more albums, take your head out of your asses and smell the air.<eos> - It smells like Guns N' Roses! - Guns N' Roses!
I'll watch my step, then.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> It's just the way I think.<eos> You have to bend to this life, Daniel.<eos> It does not bend to you.
Haley, what's this about?<eos> Mr. Lawrence has a theory he'd like to share with us.<eos> It's... it's more than a... a theory, sir.<eos> When Drill connects with a child, he apparently leaves something inside them like a... Genetic-tracking device.<eos> I believe it allows him to connect with the child.
I'm your mother?<eos> Am I your mother? In the future, I mean.<eos> Don't catch a cold.<eos> That's what mothers say.<eos> But you don't really catch a cold, it catches you, doesn't it?
Time to pay off your bet.<eos> Meet your flour baby.<eos> [Sighs] You have to care of that as if it's your very own baby.<eos> It's how they teach responsibility to teenagers.<eos> While you're in the station, care for that as if it's your very own.
Of safety.<eos> Of a place where he can... settle among people he's never known... as if he's known them his whole life.<eos> He dreams... of a home.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... there is life out there.<eos> And now... it's here.
Ladies and gentlemen... there is life out there.<eos> And now... it's here.<eos> MOLLY [on TV]: Dreams of home.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, there is life out there.<eos> And now... it's here.
_<eos> And I've done bad things.<eos> But the thing they're hunting me for... this murder they say I committed... that's one thing I know I didn't do.<eos> So, if I could just find someone, anyone I recognize... maybe they could tell me who I was... right before all this started.<eos> And maybe I could clear my name, whatever the hell it is.
Are you sure this is our place?<eos> The key doesn't fit.<eos> Let me.<eos> It looks like our place.<eos> It smells like it.
Yeah, man, I'll get passed around in there like a bong.<eos> - Shut up. - Ow!<eos> You're not going to prison.<eos> The dangers of noise pollution are real.<eos> According to the World Wide Web, it can cause lack of concentration, nervousness, and misunderstandings.
Gerda of course!<eos> She is not as innocent as you think.<eos> She will do anything for Nicklas.<eos> She came to me and talked about the silver.<eos> She said that silver was not a myth; It was really there.
I can't discern from whence you came, but here we abide by the law.<eos> We do not get out and then explain ourselves.<eos> The law is habeas corpus.<eos> You violated it by locking me up here without a cause.<eos> Only it's not applicable to me.
Word of advice, never leave your webcam uncovered.<eos> Have you ever heard of a programme called Face Chaser?<eos> No? It's because the NSA doesn't want you to.<eos> Facial-recognition software.<eos> You scan a photo of who you're looking for, it monitors every security camera, every webcam on earth.
My husband's on his way and he's a cop, so he's gonna make it all better.<eos> Until then, I think maybe we... maybe we just breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> Just listen to your body... it's gonna tell you what you need, and then when it tells you, you can tell me and...
Hopefully, you'll then start producing and distributing the vaccine, and we can get to the task of rebuilding our great nation.<eos> Godspeed.<eos> We have the cure, sir.<eos> Dr. Scott was able to produce it right here on this ship.<eos> Guess you wouldn't have any need for it yourself. The rest of the world, the ones who aren't lucky enough to be naturally immune...
There's a huge tree in the middle of it.<eos> You'd think it was 1,000 years old.<eos> But it's been cut down.<eos> It's just a stump.<eos> It's real.
And despite her worst intentions, you succeeded.<eos> Not at all how I imagined this conversation was gonna go.<eos> Usually, my friends start uncapping the red sharpie right about now.<eos> Maybe it's time you started looking at life from a different perspective.<eos> Because from this view, it looks pretty great.
Get her!<eos> I will love you for the rest of my life.<eos> And I will never let you go again.<eos> I hope she's pregnant soon.<eos> A child is vital, and it will help protect her in France as well.
Problem there is Julia.<eos> She's probably telling him everything she knows about you, which is a lot.<eos> So, you see, your plan has no margin for error.<eos> And that's a big chance to take when the fallout is your brain in a jar.<eos> I still have a human being's body, Jim. And it's tired.
We don't know his signature.<eos> Scopolamine and sevoflurane are both odorless and tasteless, but he introduces the smell of sage to the drugs.<eos> Clever.<eos> But why her and not the others?<eos> The act of recounting a false memory hardens it into fact.
To show you who are your true and only friends, to eliminate your false confidence, and to prove that those elders of yours hiding in the woods have less hold over you than I.<eos> But have no fear.<eos> Your secret about George is safe with me, as long as we are allies.<eos> Isn't it exciting?<eos> Either your life is about to truly start by my side, or it may be over in an instant... your choice.
I cannot believe that after all of this time, I finally know my wife's real name.<eos> It's like something you name a pet. That you hate. Why didn't you ever get it... get it, you know, legally changed?<eos> My dad.<eos> He...<eos> It just meant something important to him, and he begged me to leave it un-until he...
I'm recommending you.<eos> Unless you don't want it.<eos> No, j... I've just heard you say this once before.<eos> About the board seat.<eos> But then I find out it'd been given to Alex Karev.
If you don't want to discuss your feelings about T.J., let's go back to how you feel about Alice.<eos> Thousands of teenage girls go missing every year, and you don't know any of their names.<eos> Why is Jane Doe number 38 more important than all the others?<eos> Because I was... I was around the investigation.<eos> I... I-I knew about it as it was going on.
He was a tough nut to crack in our prison interviews.<eos> But then I thought, why not take on the affect of his wife?<eos> Facial expressions, voice patterns, cadence.<eos> Once I did that, he told me everything I needed to know, specifically, that he was not crazy.<eos> Well, you're the only applicant with this much clinical evaluative experience, but it's not really relevant to what we do here.
- They're putting people in stasis!<eos> - Think of it as a medically induced coma, a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution.<eos> "A better solution." What does that mean?<eos> The ATCU's looking for a cure.<eos> I'm not suggesting that's for everyone, because it's not, but some people might want to ... - We are not a disease.
We would like to help keep her safe.<eos> With everything the city's facing, I thought you could use all the help you could get.<eos> You've been gone.<eos> You don't know what this city's facing.<eos> And I'm not saying it doesn't need saving, but a guy hiding behind a mask isn't going to get it done.
Now, we're here because my sister wanted to give you $50,000 to make this thing go away. But I didn't listen to her, so I'm gonna throw in an extra<eos> $50,000 of my own. It doesn't matter.<eos> Because if you think that we're gonna settle for $100,000, you're wasting our time.<eos> $100,000 isn't to settle this.<eos> It's to have your client admit that you approached him after he had a public episode and then instructed him to say that it was within five minutes of eating one of our muffins.
I was thinking, maybe we should check out Gerard's tomorrow night.<eos> You know, just to make sure it's the right type of venue for introducing our candidate.<eos> Are you asking me out on a date?<eos> To be honest, it's been so long, I don't even know.<eos> I just am... my life is really complicated right now, and I don't think going on a date with my brother's campaign manager is going to make it any easier.
My God!<eos> Let us rejoice!<eos> Let us rejoice!<eos> Hear now this creed!<eos> Contentment thou shall find through suffering and through long years in it.
When someone's wrong, they should admit that they're wrong.<eos> - I'm a tad confused. - Yeah.<eos> Shouldn't Grinder do the big speeches?<eos> Don't mind if I do.<eos> I have an announcement to make, and it's gonna shock a lot of people.
Why should I trust you?<eos> You're not even a doctor. A doctor can't offer you what I'm offering.<eos> Because it's not legal, right?<eos> If your wife is cured, do you care if you broke a few rules?<eos> This treatment you're talking about, what does it involve?
She wears my shower shoes even though they are clearly marked "Sue."<eos> She's pessimistic, and she has her boyfriend over all the time, and they do stuff right in front of me!<eos> Oh! Tacky.<eos> They took my bed so they could make one giant one.<eos> I had to sleep in my desk chair, and it has wheels.
Doesn't make sense.<eos> Which is why I went back and took a closer look at the one you recovered this morning.<eos> I noticed the pulmonary trunk was quite large-- too large, in fact, to be viable for a transplant for PinZ0.<eos> So, I had Sebastian run an expedited DNA test on the heart.<eos> Never guess who it belongs to.
The hunters take the choice cuts.<eos> High-ranking females and their offspring get their share.<eos> (CHATTERING) Males who played no part in the hunt feel hard done by, and become frustrated and sulky.<eos> Meat is a precious treat in the troops' largely vegetarian diet.<eos> But it plays a vital role in chimp society.
I mean, I would be hell mad.<eos> But that doesn't mean I'd go around and kill somebody.<eos> You know, I'd sue just like he was doing.<eos> Suing.<eos> Two weeks before I was released from jail, investigators were gonna bring in pictures to show me of Teresa's body and how it was burnt, and there was still muscle tissues on the bones.
Could be a bit silly with just the two of us.<eos> Did it hurt?<eos> No.<eos> So you choose this life?<eos> It chose me.
Millions of people are watching this broadcast, right now, both here and around the world.<eos> I believe they want the answer to one... simple question.<eos> Why didn't you just stop?<eos> Because regardless of whether the message was getting out there or not... they all deserved to die.<eos> If you believe that we are simply dumb animals that have developed some level of self-awareness, well, then you can rationalize taking a life, because it really doesn't mean anything.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. How many of us, I wonder, can recall a childhood moment when we experienced happiness as a state of being?<eos> That single moment of untarnished joy. That moment when everything in our world inside and out... was alright.<eos> Everything was alright.<eos> But, now, we become a colony of adults and everything is all wrong all the time.<eos> It's as if we were on a quest to get it back, and yet the more we focus on our own personal happiness, the more it eludes us.
Daddy? I still don't get it. Why do we keep having all of these days?<eos> And then, going to bed at night?<eos> And then, having all of these days? And then, going to bed at night?<eos> Well, that's sort of what life is.<eos> When will it end?
I'm not saying you're gonna be together. I don't know that.<eos> And if it doesn't work out, you'll miss her so much you'll barely be able to move.<eos> You'll feel you have no purpose no reason to go on.<eos> But there's nothing to do but wait. Wait and it'll get clear to you.<eos> You'll get on with your life and gifts will come into it.
So now you know what we are.<eos> We're humanity's death sentence.<eos> There has to be a cure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There you have it.
The byzantine politics that I saw taking place here the last couple of weeks had to do with the power of lobbies.<eos> Despite McGovern's best intention, the dietary goals were indeed revised and the words "reduced intake" were removed from the report for good.<eos> Instead, they encouraged Americans to buy leaner products and buy more food with less fat.<eos> And so, the 1980s began with a new health doctrine, and a brand-new market, every food product imaginable reengineered to be low in fat.<eos> When you take the fat out of the food, it tastes nasty.
OK.<eos> Now get your ass out my seat.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to figure out how this damn radio works.<eos> Sean says it doesn't work.
You see, in the real world, we never see things jumping into existence out of nothingness, but atheists want to make one small exception to this rule, namely, the universe and everything in it.<eos> (female student2) But in his book, "The God Delusion,"<eos> Richard Dawkins says that, "lf you tell me God created the universe, then I have the right to ask you who created God."<eos> Dawkins' question only makes sense in terms of a God who has been created.<eos> It doesn't make sense in terms of an uncreated God, which is the kind of God that Christians believe in.
T o the dining room.<eos> (Professor Radisson) Nothing like a nice merlot to take the edge off.<eos> Cheers, everyone.<eos> Mina, this wine is awful.<eos> It's been cooked.
We only do this to make a difference.<eos> That's why you constantly keep going back, keep fighting, keep trying to tell these stories.<eos> Otherwise, my whole life's been for nothing.<eos> You know something?<eos> It's been for something.
They change because Huck changes. Yes.<eos> Keep going.<eos> When he tells the slave hunters that he has no slaves, his lie is credible.<eos> So he lies well.<eos> But what is more important... is that it is an unselfish lie, because it saves Jim.
Right now.<eos> The boat is waiting.<eos> We can be free of this place.<eos> We can have a life together.<eos> And it can start this very minute.
Yes?<eos> We submit that Mr Collard's supposed confession be ruled inadmissible.<eos> What?<eos> On close inspection,<eos> Your Honour will see that it was made under duress and in the presence of clear police intimidation.
Keep your distance.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Nobody's to go near them until they get an order from me.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> If there was any offence, it's just from caring too much.
Or if I were cool.<eos> Is this not working for you?<eos> Do you want your money back?<eos> 'Cause the show is free.<eos> I want my life back, but I can't get it back 'cause it's ruined.
And the way you got out, lying to yourself that the past held no sway over the future.<eos> But in the end, a lot of us are rewarded for our misdeeds, which is why God took your wife<eos> and unleashed you upon me.<eos> This life... follows you.<eos> It clings to you, infecting everyone who comes close to you.
Your original 30-year sentence is reinstated for killing Linda Purcell.<eos> The bottom line, Jack-- it's either death... or you go back to being nobody.<eos> It's your call.<eos> Due to revelations of wrongdoing in the Tarrant case, I am ordering a full investigation into this matter, as well as any other cases handled by former Chief Bernie Michaels.<eos> Uh, look, as an innocent, trusting, and unknowing participant in this miscarriage of justice, I vow here today to follow this investigation, no matter how high it may lead, and to punish any wrongdoers to the fullest extent of the law.
- Seriously?<eos> No, no, no, picture it, picture it, picture it, alright?<eos> You come up this steep rocky trail and then all of a sudden it levels off and it's this beautiful, pristine lake.<eos> When I was a kid this was my favorite place in the whole world.<eos> Now it looks so out of place that high up.
The first people to arrive were the postal police.<eos> The burglary was false.<eos> Glass on top of the disturbed clothing, wrong way around.<eos> Most importantly, the body.<eos> It was covered by a duvet.
Previouslyon"dallas"...<eos> You will screw up.<eos> I mean, everybody does. You just have to get in the dirt with life anyway And kick its ass more than it kicks yours.
He wouldn't be the first man to raise a child who was not his own.<eos> It ain't that simple.<eos> I'm not saying it's easy, but in the long run, it may save a lot of pain.<eos> There's no reason why your husband wouldn't love this child as...<eos> It's coloured.
Thank you, father.<eos> You've been very helpful.<eos> Uh, detectives.<eos> Uh, I don't want anyone to get in trouble for this.<eos> I assume that whoever took the milk needed it, which is why it's there.
-You look well, Moltke.<eos> -Â£20. Carlsbad has worked its magic.<eos> The Kaiser will be excited about the Austrian ultimatum.<eos> Yes, I think he will be.<eos> Because he won't know what it means.
Why?<eos> You don't get to ask why.<eos> If I amend that report, I gotta put my name on it.<eos> Your name?<eos> It ain't worth much right now, anyway.
No. Mum, don't.<eos> My life's finished.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I have to say it.<eos> You've got to live yours, before it passes you by.
You wanna turn them or they wanna be turned or you kill them.<eos> (Siren wailing in distance) Suzanna, you got me!<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> If you really wanna know what I'm after, I just wanna know what it's like to have 5 years, 10, of a real life.<eos> But it's not real.
You can say we had a business relationship, but that you didn't take the picture of me in the bed.<eos> It was Photoshopped.<eos> Whatever it is you need to say.<eos> I'm so sorry, Claire.<eos> I only have one print and it's still here.
What are you looking for in a man?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Whatever you think is best.<eos> Well, what's best is whatever your heart desires.<eos> So what does it desire?
Carter's gonna be an intern at C.A.A. this summer, and I've met a girl that's really special.<eos> Our lives are just beginning.<eos> Why would you want to ruin them?<eos> What about my life?<eos> When does it begin?
I told you she was good at her job.<eos> This is all a big misunderstanding.<eos> I did move some money around, but I was investing it... For you...<eos> for the family.<eos> You shouldn't use that word, Since you don't know what it means.
Because I know... the place where the gods are.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> Your mother's life... is already and always will be<eos> intertwined with your life.<eos> It's no longer my life alone.
And all that "whatever the hell we want"?<eos> You just care about saving your own skin.<eos> Hey! Shooter! Where's my radio?<eos> - Get out of my way.<eos> - Where is it?
There may be a lot more going on here than we realize.<eos> Go on.<eos> We found a photograph and other documents in a safe-deposit box out in Alexandria, belonging to Colonel Hatcher.<eos> What kind of a photograph?<eos> According to his notes, it comes directly from the Iranian Savama files.
I'm a weed grower.<eos> That's why I'm fucking here, for my rights.<eos> My dad recently passed away and I'm here for this fucking cause, and you should be listening to me.<eos> Weed is a medicine.<eos> It fucking always has been, it helps people.
Hungry?<eos> You never should have brought me back.<eos> Eat up.<eos> We've got work to do.<eos> ♪ You feed the madness, and it feeds on you ♪

- We got here as fast as we could.<eos> - Traffic was horrible.<eos> - Do I look like I care?<eos> Get rid of the body before it starts to stink... and the rats start eating it.<eos> - Where is it?
Attendance is kind of mandatory at my house.<eos> Well, just do me a favor and slap me if I use the wrong fork or something.<eos> I am a little out of my element.<eos> What's your element?<eos> Ah, I don't know if there's an actual name for it, but a microwave is usually involved.
You watch!<eos> Now your only chance at being immortal is someone writing a shitty pop song about you, hmm?<eos> About a villain who cries about his Mommy whose hair goes prematurely gray.<eos> The only thing awaiting you is this grave.<eos> I swallowed the origin seed, and now it's trying to devour me!
He builds houses for the poor.<eos> And then a couple nights ago, she went to a club for someone's birthday and I guess...<eos> She got drunk and she started making out with an old boyfriend.<eos> And someone took a picture.<eos> It hit all the gossip sites.
Order in the court!<eos> Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.<eos> Oh, great adventure, buddy.<eos> Rick and Morty go to giant prison.<eos> You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.
But only after I realized that it was working!<eos> The tests were positive and I had to keep going.<eos> Did you ever stop to think once that this is my decision and not yours?<eos> There is no decision, Cosima.<eos> You have one way forward and this is it.
Everything, Mrs. Sadler. Absolutely everything.<eos> You gave me Kira's stem cells?<eos> This is my decision and not yours!<eos> There is no decision, Cosima.<eos> You have one way forward and this is it.
There may be a lot more going on here than we realize.<eos> Go on.<eos> We found a photograph and other documents in a safe-deposit box out in Alexandria, belonging to Colonel Hatcher.<eos> What kind of a photograph?<eos> According to his notes, it comes directly from the Iranian Savama files.
What exactly did you hear?<eos> Something about a box Patrick's supposed to retrieve-- secrets Victoria thinks you're keeping.<eos> My infinity box.<eos> Everything's in there-- my... father's journals, evidence of my takedowns, my identity.<eos> Well, where is it?
Let's do this one last time.<eos> Everyone knows this claim's yielded, and I know that that gold hasn't gone into town.<eos> I got people in places who knows who's weighing what where, who's selling what where.<eos> And your gold ain't sold.<eos> Where is it?
Civilization ain't gone up here.<eos> Not if you don't want it to go.<eos> Oh, it ain't what you want.<eos> It's what nature wants.<eos> And she'll pull the animal right out of you Even if you don't know it's in there.
Oh, I hate this stupid holiday!<eos> The only thing you can do is screw it up.<eos> (gasps) That's it!<eos> Bart, you're a genius!<eos> Well, if you keep throwing the word around, it means nothing.
I often thought... looking at how my mother treats my younger brother<eos> I sometimes felt I could do that better.<eos> You know the fourth commandment.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And it says?
[exhales sharply] But I was the better student.<eos> Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> Kill me. I never said I wanted to kill you.<eos> I said I wanted to destroy you, and to do that, I need your heart.<eos> [grunts] [gasps] Where is it?
Hardly.<eos> You won? Well, don't act so surprised.<eos> As it turns out, Zelena wanted my heart.<eos> It's a good thing I wasn't stupid enough to bring it with me.<eos> Any idea why she wants it?
Let's go.<eos> Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?<eos> It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.<eos> Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?<eos> No, it was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
You'll be witnesses.<eos> I don't want to do this to you.<eos> Then don't.<eos> We've come for the baby, old woman.<eos> Where is it?
Last season on "Arrow"...<eos> This city still needs saving.<eos> Not by the Hood.<eos> It needs a hero.
I mean, you try to be considerate and let her down easy, and next thing you know, you're wearing a dog collar and a leash while she lets you lick peanut butter out of a chew toy between her boobs.<eos> Whoa... Look at this place.<eos> Hello, apartment, good-bye panties, huh?<eos> I don't think this place is for me.<eos> It just doesn't scream "Barry."
No, we are not done here!<eos> I almost died wearing a bedazzled jumpsuit and my life needs meaning.<eos> Stop writing things down!<eos> Mmm. Hey, how'd it go?<eos> What kind of world... Uh-oh. ...are we living in where any two high school kids with a broken condom can screw behind an Applebee's Dumpster, have a baby, give it up for adoption, but not have it go to an adult who is upstanding,
If everyone doesn't betray each other.<eos> That's half the fun, isn't it?<eos> Otherwise, why would I be working with you?<eos> When you met with him before, was it in Woodford's office?<eos> Yeah. How do you think I know where it is? What?
John Alden.<eos> He is just a man.<eos> I am no mere girl to fall to pieces for a man.<eos> True malice, like that which powers the grand rite, ferments best in a loveless heart.<eos> I have looked into your heart, and it is anything but loveless.
No, it hasn't come up, But I'm telling you, They could help with the bakersfield thing.<eos> When that money drops from the colonel...<eos> The colonel. Run that through langley.<eos> Cross-reference with russian military and organized crime<eos> Databases. I'm trying to trace the call, sir, But it's going through multiple exchanges.
Agent Knox, he killed a man, okay, last year.<eos> And we had an eyewitness who was gonna testify against him, but he killed him, too.<eos> You say that, but how do you know that?<eos> How can you prove it?<eos> By finding the body, wherever he put it.
In kung fu, we say... "One hand lies the other hand tells the truth."<eos> Try that again.<eos> If you, one day, make it back to the West... what will you tell men of this strange word, "kung fu"?<eos> Will you tell them that it means to fight?
What the hell have you done to help any of us?<eos> You're going to cooperate.<eos> Including getting Ms. Shumway to hand over that power source.<eos> So this is about that.<eos> You admit you know what it is.
He knows?<eos> And he wants the egg.<eos> No, Jim having it would be a disaster.<eos> Which is why I came to warn you.<eos> He sent me to find out where it is and report back, but I can't do that.
No, it isn't about trust.<eos> Well, then why won't you tell me what's going on?<eos> Please, Mom, I don't want to be alone in this.<eos> I don't want to be either.<eos> I've had this sick feeling in my stomach and it won't go away.
So we can dare to plan our future again.<eos> Like normal people.<eos> Does that mean what I hope it means?<eos> Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to believe me when I said that device was Lady Mary's?<eos> I do believe you. I don't know why she wanted it but I believe you.
Hey. It's good to see you.<eos> Mel. Where's the egg?<eos> It's... gone from Angie's apartment.<eos> But... but Barbie's here.<eos> Why do you want it?
It has a chewed-up tape in it.<eos> I'll say it was broken and they'll buy it.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't need your confession.<eos> It won't change anything.
It appears so.<eos> We couldn't stop the bleeding, so I brought you here.<eos> The blade is Empyrean steel.<eos> It should have killed me.<eos> Where is it?
How do you know that?<eos> She's Mona.<eos> After you left last night, I did some recon.<eos> Alison would never put herself at risk unless she believed her story.<eos> Well, if you believe a lie, it becomes a truth.
The prince is meeting with the most powerful people in the energy complex.<eos> Which means the most powerful people in the world.<eos> These people don't reschedule.<eos> Ms. Jibril is lining up a protest at the Arcadia Policy Council.<eos> If she's part of an assassination plot, we expect it will go down there.
How clear is my thinking?<eos> How good do I feel?<eos> How good do I look?<eos> We need to get that apple away from him.<eos> It makes people evil.
Some men pay good coin for such pleasures.<eos> I wonder sometimes about that mind of yours.<eos> Clear in intent, Lady Empress.<eos> Then be intent on this matter.<eos> To tame an animal, it must fear the raising of your hand.
Coming.<eos> Let's just see how tall you are.<eos> So you've got a really normal, healthy blood pressure... 121 over 79.<eos> Your heart rate's pretty good at 75, so that's pretty good.<eos> Alrighty, so, we'll just have a listen to your heart, see what it sounds like.

James?<eos> John?<eos> Jo-Jo?<eos> My middle name is more important to you than being suspended?<eos> If it's Jo-Jo?
Tell him to put it in the front of the line.<eos> This eyewitness software is incredible.<eos> No more scanning through endless hours of footage. Yeah.<eos> Finn's friend Mark was selling it.<eos> You just punch in the time frame, and that's the only footage it downloads.
They describe him?<eos> Young, male, Caucasian.<eos> Wearing a backpack. Nothing more than that.<eos> Think they were staring at the knife and not his face.<eos> We do have a photograph of him fleeing one of the thefts, but... it is useless.
Now I can't ignore it.<eos> I just felt daddy's death more deeply than you did. No.<eos> No, before daddy died.<eos> There's something you're not telling me. This power,<eos> Whatever you do with it, It won't lighten that burden, whatever it may be.
Frankly, I've never one quite like it before.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think you dropped something.<eos> The unsub took a big risk going back to this location.<eos> It must have special meaning.
I'm the one he's been waiting for.<eos> The Artemis Moon Candle was the last thing my mother gave me before the earth swallowed me whole.<eos> Like in Tremors.<eos> Kenzi's second favourite Kevin Bacon movie.<eos> Demeter knew that Hades abhors light... and that it could illuminate my way home.
I believe in the rule of law, I believe in the need to conduct investigations. But those investigations are supposed to be difficult for a reason.<eos> It's supposed to be difficult to invade somebody's privacy.<eos> Because of how intrusive it is. Because of how disruptive it is.<eos> If we can't... if we don't have our right to privacy, how do we have a free and open discussion?<eos> What good is the right to free speech... if it's not protected... in the sense that you can't have a private discussion with somebody else about something you disagree with.
Whitney found the gold.<eos> Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.<eos> I'm absolutely positive Clyde didn't find the gold.<eos> And how can you be so sure, huh?<eos> Because it's still here.
Because we, your friends, did everything we could to save you.<eos> You prove your arguments with events that never took place.<eos> And now, I fear your happiness has come to undermine your compassion.<eos> My compassion is for you.<eos> As it is yours that rules you in this moment.
Then again, you put me there.<eos> Not now, Mama.<eos> Then when, Lou-Lou? Hmm?<eos> You've wasted so much time on your pathetic plan.<eos> You need to find a way into Mother Grayson's heart or it's gonna close up, just like mine did.
Say one word, it's your last.
What's up?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let her go!<eos> The serum you took.<eos> Where is it?
I can't hear ya. ( speaker beeps )<eos> ( voice garbled ) What?<eos> I think James had been here before and said the room was fairly "dry."<eos> That's the one we used in Chicago, isn't it?<eos> Because it's a television studio, it doesn't have a lot of ambiance, but we actually found out once we got here and we set up the mics, it actually sounded really good...
I'm not talking about bad dreams. I mean nightmares.<eos> The actual word nightmare is an Old English word that means evil spirit.<eos> A maere... M-A-E-R-E... that comes in the night to attack its victim.<eos> Now, in modern times, we've changed that meaning.<eos> I think we've changed it to cover up the truth.
You don't turn this around on me.<eos> You're the one that's being selfish.<eos> We're in a relationship.<eos> But the heart's not like a box that gets filled up.<eos> It expands in size the more you love.
What about it?<eos> Our romantic heroin.<eos> I don't want to end up unhappy.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> You don't really get to choose your ending, it has to follow from what came before.
I'm bloody not all right and I want more chocolate.<eos> Maybe it would help if you talked it through.<eos> What have I missed?<eos> I think the problem might be that you don't really get to choose your ending.<eos> It has to follow naturally from what comes before, or it doesn't feel true.
Who knew that before?<eos> - Bradley Manning's letter to WikiLeaks<eos> What had Manning done?<eos> Was his leak, as the Army had said, a reckless data dump?<eos> Or was this the act of a man who had peeked behind the curtain of a superpower and decided that what it was doing was wrong?
I'll give you a warrior's death, brother.<eos> Why are you bleeding?<eos> We don't understand it.<eos> We have no explanation.<eos> But your huge heart just seems to keep on going, but we don't think it can keep it up for much longer.
They can't bring the dead back to life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, Canon, erm... I wonder if it's not too much bother.<eos> I was showing a snapshot of my nephew, Raymond, to the Major last night, and I think it might have got muddled up with some of his own photographs.<eos> You couldn't ask if it's among his things, could you?
Put it back together and get out of here.<eos> Who sold you that thing?<eos> It's not the device.<eos> The device is good, I have used it before.<eos> And how much did it cost? Me?
I just wanted to say that she's told me.<eos> Told you?<eos> Told you what?<eos> About the hut.<eos> - Wherever it is.
I've always had this feeling no matter where I am in my life...<eos> - That it's either a memory or a dream.<eos> - You've always thought that.<eos> Me too. Like, is this really my life?<eos> Like, is it happening right now?
It's the only thing that's gonna force Jerry's hand.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> We'd have no show.<eos> Well, it's not ours anyway.<eos> It's not your show.
Can anyone tell me - who are we gluing to what and why?<eos> Look, our friend might have lost his wits in prison.<eos> It happens.<eos> A prison, a potion, a periscope, a pig and a paste pot.<eos> If a madman created a scavenger hunt, this is what it would look like.
Maestro, shall we see to his injuries?<eos> They're beyond seeing to and I cannot meet my end here.<eos> In other words, fuck this place.<eos> I want to spit on Vlad's body.<eos> Yeah. Well, you could if we knew where it was.
and his structures are historically rife with hidden doorways,<eos> tunnels.<eos> And judging by the direction of that breeze,<eos> I would say... a passageway most likely lies behind this wall.<eos> I have agreed to Lorenzo's cunning plan of a marriage, only because it will never happen.
So you got that?<eos> Jules!<eos> Oh, dear, dear goodness.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What? Here, sit. Sit in this chair, it has a cushion.
Put your ear here.<eos> On my heart.<eos> - Can you hear it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What is it telling you?
You can't use my apartment!<eos> No, come on, Neal!<eos> Hanging at your place would be so much better than some random coffee shop.<eos> Yeah, but it's not just my place.<eos> It's Amy's, too.
Hit him.<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Do you remember the story I used to tell you of the Emperor Moth?<eos> Just a little thing.<eos> A naturalist once came upon the cocoon of this rare creature, just as it was struggling to emerge in its new form.
Why did you use that world?<eos> 'Cause I don't want you to bother my sister.<eos> Why do you think I would bother her?<eos> I don't want you to think she's the vargulf!<eos> When you use that word, what exactly do you think it means?
Great.<eos> Is it all right if I keep filming?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course.<eos> I would just hope that you would leave this last experience out.<eos> It in no way reflects what you are about to see.
I will never bail you out again.<eos> And I understand why you did this.<eos> Why you do these things.<eos> Control.<eos> 'Cause when you have to eat crap, it just comes piling on, until finally it hits you... literally... that you are completely helpless.
I promise.<eos> But you have to go!<eos> Bo-bo.<eos> Kenzi, I just sent you a photo.<eos> need you to find out what it means.
They did business together.<eos> My father doesn't do business.<eos> He's a killer and a drug dealer.<eos> I know.<eos> I know what it's like. To think your life is one thing, then find out it's another, that it's all a lie.
Because you told me earlier.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I gotta get back to work.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I hit that black box like a hundred times, and it didn't even crack.
OK, go on.<eos> Well, we've been looking into your investments...<eos> OK.<eos> I told Jane to cancel the meeting.<eos> As far as I was concerned, it was being rearranged.
That'll get Dow going.<eos> As much as I'd like to join all the ads making fun of the ubiquitous San Francisco hippie, let's try to trade on the word "love" as something substantial.<eos> I don't think that's possible in this context.<eos> So why are we contributing to the trivialization of the word?<eos> It doesn't belong in the kitchen.
I don't want to ruin it for you, but...<eos> Spot jumps.<eos> Where is the tape, you bitch?<eos> Oliver, is that any way to speak to the mother of your unborn child?<eos> I'm the only one who knows where it is now.
I don't want to lose you, Bob.<eos> Mum...<eos> That don't mean I expect to be pride of place - I don't.<eos> You got your life and I couldn't be more proud of you.<eos> Just make sure you keep it yours.
If this pendant will connect me to Shane, then I can do a protection spell.<eos> Where is the cure? !<eos> Ohh! Where is the cure?<eos> You're human.<eos> Why do you want it anyway?
Heinz beans. Some things never change.<eos> Oh, it's clever.<eos> We're going to lose Jaguar unless an arrangement is made, and it involves you and her.
There is no more we can ask of you.<eos> See heart lifted with welcomed news.<eos> Crassus and his legions are but a day's march from our city.<eos> He will retake it, and in the act end our suffering...<eos> I fear it has just begun.
Look.<eos> I'm the spouse.<eos> Therefore his legal guardian, and I...<eos> Your marriage is domiciled in Massachusetts.<eos> It is not legally recognized in Oregon.
"Why do I love you?"<eos> "I wonder why your heart's... in love with me?"<eos> "There are others waiting... in the line."<eos> "I can't stop my heart, no matter how much I try."<eos> "I try to scare it, but it pays no heed."
Please send help.<eos> I used to live my life at night. In the shadow of my dark passenger.<eos> I lived in shadows for so long until the dark became my world.<eos> But over time, the people in my life flipped on a light.<eos> At first I was blinded, it was so bright.
We bred a corn with a softer husk.<eos> It could be broken down, used in animal feeds.<eos> It saved farmers billions, everyone wanted it.<eos> What does the protein do?<eos> Do? It doesn't do anything.
Patient also has an existing midline incision from prior laparotomy for excision of pancreatic mass.<eos> I am excited by this research project for one reason and one reason alone.<eos> I believe it will save lives.<eos> For over a decade, the left ventricular assist device has meant the difference between life and death for patients whose hearts were too weak to beat on their own.<eos> But it is not without its flaws.
Neigh!<eos> Woof!<eos> Sorry, I'm all over the place like soap in a shower.<eos> Where is it? Where's the soap?<eos> Where has it gone?
They won't accept you, no matter what you do.<eos> Not your son, not any of them.<eos> Yeah, we'll see.<eos> I've already seen, Gold.<eos> I've seen your dark heart, and it always wins out.
But you did not get that from me, all right?<eos> Now where is he?<eos> I mean, I've been doing martial arts for years, right?<eos> But, like, jujitsu really evens me, you know?<eos> It's, like, the only thing keeping me sane, you know?
Compassion, was it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, maybe she just needs a hug.<eos> "I keep looking for my life.<eos> In my eyes, it has been stolen."
He's dead.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't, I can't, I can't.<eos> We all want the cure.<eos> Where is it?
Ok. I just need to make sure that you're ok first.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The cure.<eos> Jeremy, after everything we've been through, it's right there.
It's simple.<eos> God forbid you're right.<eos> Drink?<eos> So, when two people love each other, Sometimes, a child.<eos> It appears in the basket, Dons by gender. And from where?
- No, no, you're confused.<eos> Ivan, it's you that's the bastard.<eos> It's the baby that's the bastard.<eos> For God's sake, Ivan, at least get the word right. Katrina, listen.<eos> No, I will give the baby my name and it will see my face.
Pole-caught tuna. Uh-huh.<eos> Saw it on a menu.<eos> Better fish with poles.<eos> Better for the ocean, too.<eos> Other boats don't care about that, but if we don't take care of the sea, it won't take care of us.
I...<eos> I believe in your message.<eos> I don't have a message.<eos> Of course you do!<eos> You just don't know what it is yet.
There's no way to track where a specific case is going to until after it's been offloaded.<eos> Yeah. And it doesn't explain the rave victims.<eos> It would if we're dealing with two unsubs.<eos> One who alters the drug, another who doses the wine.<eos> But if someone at the club is spiking the wine, how is it ending up in the hands of two Manhattan parents and one underage boy in Harlem?
Hmm. Everybody's got something.<eos> Ooh... this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town.<eos> It got three and a half stars in the Springfield Tire Guide.<eos> When we got married, I promised you a life full of romance.<eos> Now here it is.
Code-named Division.<eos> I always suspected a rival cartel.<eos> But I could never track her down...<eos> The woman in red.<eos> Her name--what is it?
It is imperative that we succeed.<eos> We need her heart.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we cannot restore your powers without the heart of a hexenbiest.<eos> And it must be cut out of her while it's still beating.
Tomorrow, I think.<eos> I must get some clothes now I'm back to normal shape.<eos> I...<eos> I know we never talk about the baby.<eos> But I realise it must be on your mind constantly.
We need to do something, and fast.<eos> Carter, come with me.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> We know that you still got meat in that freezer of yours.<eos> Yeah. And it doesn't belong to either of you.
I want what he has.<eos> I want it back.<eos> I want to be King.<eos> So is that all this child means to you, a grab for power?<eos> What does it mean to you?
The heart of the truest believer.<eos> And when you took that pixie dust, Henry, and jumped off that cliff... (Hollow knock knock) You proved yourself.<eos> You are the lucky owner of that very special heart.<eos> And now?<eos> You... and it... are mine. (Blade zings)
Oh, no. You lost me at Bennigan's.<eos> Whatever happened to Bennigan's?<eos> Mike's a generous big brother...<eos> to a point.<eos> Like, he helps me pay rent on an apartment in the building, but it's in the basement.
I imagine this is difficult for you.<eos> You cannot imagine.<eos> My life has been turned inside out.<eos> You might as well tell me the sun now sets in the east, that babies grow on trees.<eos> But if Barton is embarking on a cure, I want to know what it is because...
He's already killed hundreds.<eos> He'll kill us and anyone else who gets in the way of his science.<eos> Yeah, well, first we have to find him.<eos> He'll go to his lab.<eos> After 500 years, it's still there?
- That's just dry.<eos> - They're empty?<eos> Yeah, we're gonna have to go looking.<eos> Maybe they--<eos> Yeah, there's this box thing that we were told about, and it reveals things.
I stand for no one.<eos> Please, it's not necessary. Have a seat.<eos> You heard the man-- sit down.<eos> Well, now I feel like standing.<eos> But I don't want to stand through an entire meeting 'cause I don't know how long it's gonna last, so I'll sit down.
I take blame for it every day.<eos> I just need to prove it to Irene and to myself that I'm worthy, that I'm good.<eos> Life doesn't stop for you.<eos> It doesn't wait to give you a break.<eos> It just... falls, and it keeps falling.
Sometimes, that tells you nothing.<eos> And sometimes, it can tell a lot.<eos> The make of your weapon tells you if you'll be in open combat or firing from the shadows.<eos> The ammunition you're bringing can indicate whether you're there primarily to defend or to kill.<eos> When you're leaving under cover of darkness under a false name, you can be sure that whatever the job is, it won't be pretty.
An armored car won't drive if its wheels aren't on the ground.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - Who we are isn't important.<eos> - What do you want? You set up a secret communication center for James Kendrick.<eos> Where is it?
Haven't even narrowed down your list of suspects.<eos> We're gonna find out who you really are.<eos> And why those men took you.<eos> They just kept asking me about this box.<eos> And where it was and where I hid it and...
Look at that? You see that?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> First two are fine, right? And notice the sapling.<eos> Stevie, what-- come on, what are you doing?<eos> It moves, explain that to me.
My husband is always all over me.<eos> He can't get enough of me.<eos> How can I raise two when one is so hard?<eos> Why you!<eos> Have the baby. It'll grow on its own.
Fine.<eos> Some of them are fake. But the first one's real.<eos> When you were little, all the other kids were bragging about going to Lake World, so we took you.<eos> But you got carsick, so we gave you medicine.<eos> Not only did it knock you out for the drive, you slept through the whole day.
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down<eos> Let them lay by their helmets and their swords, and both return back to their chairs again<eos> Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound whilst we return these dukes what we decree<eos> Draw near, and list what with our council we have done<eos> For that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled with that dear blood which it hath fostered
And don't worry, Tess will be there with you the whole time. Perfect.<eos> Anyway, it looks like our best option is Zach's body, because there's still a good chance that he's among the John Does waiting to be cremated.<eos> Dare I ask how you actually killed Zach?<eos> It might help us narrow down the search. I broke his neck.<eos> I twisted it right around. Lovely, okay.
You're a lot like your daughter.<eos> Great, now he's broken.<eos> It's a baby sun.<eos> Hey, stay back.<eos> We don't know what it wants.
What is this?<eos> That kingdom fell into war and chaos and ruin...<eos> We've all heard that tale.<eos> Lost kingdom.<eos> Aye, but it's true.
You see,<eos> Western tradition mistakenly assumes that the greatest evils of mankind arise from selfishness.<eos> But in our century, evil has proven to be more radical than was previously thought.<eos> And we now know that the truest evil, the radical evil, has nothing to do with selfishness or any such understandable, sinful motives.<eos> Instead, it is based on the following phenomenon:
Go call the newspapers. Tell the photographers to come!<eos> "A charming pose of baby saleem sinai,"<eos> "born on the exact moment of our nation's independence."<eos> "we shall be watching over your life with the closest attention."<eos> "it will be in a sense, a mirror of our own."
A smooth passage?<eos> He was only 8 and he drowned to death!<eos> How smooth is that?<eos> There are many things in this world that can't be explained.<eos> I didn't choose this life... it chose me.
No, why?<eos> I go home this way a lot, by this tree.<eos> - It's beautiful, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, really beautiful.<eos> Believe it or not I talk to this tree, and it talks back!
My mom tried to kill her boyfriend with one of those golf clubs.<eos> She hit him in the head with a nine iron.<eos> I think it maybe rubbed him the wrong way, so he left us the house, and he moved to Florida.<eos> And Mom let him take my piano.<eos> - It was his piano.
So, Marmande had 4 accounts.<eos> His will is clear about 3 of them.<eos> The 4th, an account in the Bahamas.<eos> contains 30 million.<eos> Does it belong to the bank?
I love you, too, angel.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> People say hell is endless.<eos> They say it's our worst nightmare, the face of our darkness.<eos> But whatever it is, however it is,
Oh, it's so exciting.<eos> They say it's our worst nightmare. The face of our darkness.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> But whatever it is, however it is,
I ought to rap your nose with a newspaper.<eos> This is selfless request.<eos> I need to become whole to help the champion defeat the coming darkness before it consumes us all.<eos> Well, sacred tree has weathered many a storm.<eos> It and I will still be standing long after the Garuda has had his fun.
I have people who can find people.<eos> I could bring her back to you.<eos> Or, if you choose, I can just bring parts of her back.<eos> But isn't it obvious that I'm just going to continue to hurt the people you love until you do the spell.<eos> Now, I know it's in the grimoire, and I know it requires the blood of my siblings, so.
They get your attention, don't they?<eos> I mean, that... that really makes you want to read on.<eos> Miss Pillsbury, I don't sleep around.<eos> That's not me.<eos> - I'm just trying to listen to my heart, and it's like I can't hear what it's trying to tell me.
Andy. Henry got me security access, but I don't see the antenna tower.<eos> I'm about five minutes away.<eos> It's 200 meters high with a big flashing light on it.<eos> Can't miss it, boss.<eos> Found the flashing light, but it's three meters tall, tops.
Marriage certificate.<eos> 18 years?<eos> That's impressive.<eos> Unheard of in show business.<eos> Once the agency signs off on your application, it gets bundled with other applications, then we send it to Beijing, and it gets translated into mandarin.
Are you still in love with him?<eos> He makes me feel like I've got no control.<eos> Isn't that what love feels like?<eos> I don't understand why you're so obsessed with that word?<eos> I don't know what it means.
I want to protect her.<eos> Have you considered that maybe you want to protect something else?<eos> Like what?<eos> This dream of your son being alive.<eos> This event that you're so reluctant to attend, it's all about commemorating Rex.
Slow, deep.<eos> I... I can't.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> Just breathe in and out.<eos> My heart, it... it's pounding.
You can always crown another rat to take over your operation.<eos> 50%.<eos> Now give me my box.<eos> I told you, I don't have it.<eos> Where is it?
Em, do you still have it-- that photo from the locker room?<eos> Yeah, I think so. Why?<eos> Han, what-- what's going on?<eos> There wasn't a birthmark in that photo!<eos> Where is it?
A black temple.<eos> As far as I'm aware this has always been a place of learning.<eos> You built your houses of science and wisdom on these dark shrines, hoping to eliminate them.<eos> But they're still here, buried beneath.<eos> Where is it?
The dead fish?<eos> Weather that transgresses the laws of nature.<eos> - And there's his name.<eos> - Anicetus?<eos> - Does it mean something?
He probably doesn't even recognise me now.<eos> Here.<eos> Come to me the next time you need money... and I'll teach you a lesson.<eos> Respected Shruti's father,<eos> Life is a beautiful journey... who knows what it has in store for us.
My father taught me everything has a price, but not everything should be for sale.<eos> Ever seen a boy blow his brains out in front of you? Unfortunately.<eos> ClearBec was a good company, Mr. Begosian.<eos> Listen to this recording.<eos> It mentions a name, Francisco Francis.
It's our understanding you were scheduled to meet with a member of the press, unfriendly to our cause.<eos> Yeah, your cause... That's what you call it?<eos> It is my duty to protect my country, Mr. Green.<eos> Okay, let me tell you something about your understanding.<eos> It's based on a misunderstanding because I didn't meet with any reporter.
My son...<eos> Is sick because of you!<eos> That apple turnover you gave me... he ate it!<eos> - What?<eos> - It was meant for you!
- Where's what, honey? The baby that shoved its ginormous head out of my cooter for six endless hours last night.<eos> Oh, my, did they lose it?<eos> They showed me the video footage of you taking it. - They were gonna call the police but I said no.<eos> That baby.<eos> Where is it?
It was my last resort.<eos> The only way I could get people to believe me.<eos> No one knew what I had put in motion.<eos> But I knew the officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department could decipher my message.<eos> I needed people with no agenda, people who could right a wrong, who would follow an investigation no matter where it went.
Chronic hoarseness is a symptom of a condition called silent thyroiditis.<eos> But I'm not hoarse. Exactly.<eos> But you were, three years ago.<eos> Silent thyroiditis comes and goes.<eos> And it, in turn, is a symptom of Polyglandular Autoimmune syndrome, type 3. Which makes this is a really bad idea.
And the rest live?<eos> I'll be honest with you - probably not.<eos> The fact that that baby's still alive is my secret weapon.<eos> My ace in the hole.<eos> Won't impress the Old Ones if it's still breathing.
And my nipples are the size of your head.<eos> Sh-sh-sh. Don't cry.<eos> You're gonna make momma leak all over the pretty outfit.<eos> Oh, now your kid's never gonna know what "pretty" means.<eos> Do you really lactate when it cries? Yes.
I know only that three stand for the sands .... and one by word marked as the Undefeated Gaul.<eos> Crixus?<eos> He yet lives?<eos> Only to see sun break dawn once more.<eos> The games come to an end when it sets.
But not because of what you see now.<eos> In a week or so, that green stem and the leaflets that go on top will die, and rot, and disappear.<eos> But beneath the surface of the soil, there is a gigantic tuber, and it's from that that the record breaker will emerge.<eos> This extraordinary event occurs just once every seven years.<eos> It will take two months to complete.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, it's here.
Where is she?<eos> Come on.<eos> Phone.<eos> Activate.<eos> I have a meeting, and I don't know who it's with or where it is or what it's about.
Oh, God.<eos> What?<eos> Mac, you've got to stop what you're doing and go take a shower.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> There's a second creature and it's here.
We think they have an only child.<eos> It's unlikely a sibling would participate in something this extreme.<eos> If they felt responsible for his accident, they might have rationalized doing anything to make him happy.<eos> Well, we doubt murder is something they planned on.<eos> It's more like a lethal side effect of their son's condition.
You have murder in your heart.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> I've been carrying it there for many years.<eos> What do you need to know?<eos> I need to know if... Can I keep this murder in my heart, or will it get out where it can do some real harm?
I can't help it.<eos> I love the sound of bones crunching.<eos> I feel like a God.<eos> I can destroy life.<eos> It's already destroyed.
Now they were conceived as a pair, they were made as a pair.<eos> And I'd imagine worth a whole lot more as a pair.<eos> Great minds, Mr Mullen, great minds.<eos> Except that we've approached the owner on a number of occasions to buy the egg and he refuses.<eos> Drivels on about its aesthetic beauty, how it makes him feel alive just to hold it and we've run out of patience now.
What about the animals that eat the bugs?<eos> Won't they starve?<eos> You're right.<eos> There are bugs in heaven.<eos> But if all the people and all the animals and all the bugs that ever lived go to heaven, isn't it super crowded?
- Well, it's gonna have to be.<eos> - I don't need you.<eos> So, one of two things is gonna happen here...<eos> Either you're going to tell me who your source is or you're gonna crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of, never to be heard from again.<eos> Okay, the reason I stand behind my information is because I'm getting it directly from the FBI.
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"<eos> And that's when I caught sight of myself in the mirror, and I said, "What's wrong with me?<eos> "Why do I have any right "getting stressed out about anything when I know that that light is waiting for me?"<eos> And here's the thing, it's not just when you die.<eos> It's here.
And weren't you confronted about this at the grand jury?<eos> Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm, you have referenced proceedings that resulted in a sealed transcript.<eos> Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer to his own testimony.<eos> This question requires your knowledge of the grand jury investigation.<eos> No, it merely requires Mr. Gardner's knowledge of the grand jury investigation.
Or I'll find you."<eos> Maybe this is a hate crime.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> We got a hit on Voyeur4U.<eos> Who is it?
The heart can't be fooled<eos> The heart is too wise<eos> Forget what you think<eos> Ignore what you hear<eos> Look with your heart, it always sees clear
You'd just be out buying food, cleaning the guest rooms.<eos> - Yeah. (Chuckles) - Uh, where you going?<eos> I'm gonna go buy food, clean the guest rooms...<eos> - Remember, I like red meat.<eos> It does not like me.
Hi, are you an actual human being?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Oh, um, Beth.<eos> And how may I be of assistance tonight, Beth?<eos> Well, um, I'm trying to use your thingy to put my records onto my computer, but it's not working.
Commercial fishing.<eos> A deckhand who got his hand amputated cutting bait is suing the Captain for medical care and damages.<eos> I assume that you're familiar with maritime law?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Then you are aware that it favors the seaman's right to collect.
- You killed Phil Taylor?<eos> I hid key evidence in a homicide investigation.<eos> I should be punished to the full extent of the law.<eos> You took the food?<eos> Where is it?
Has this been happening all day?<eos> Honey, don't worry about it.<eos> How 'bout a snack?<eos> Apparently my stigma hadn't disappeared.<eos> It transferred to my mother.
Prove to me you're my mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Give me proof!<eos> I have a big birth mark.<eos> Where is it?
I believe I will.<eos> You're in a good mood.<eos> Have... have any of you ever had... an experience that... you'd fantasized about, but that you never believed in reality could ever happen?<eos> And then, amazingly, that experience actually occurs.<eos> And remarkably, it's almost exactly what you'd expected it would be.
Where's my old chair?<eos> Well, you know, we donate all of our old furniture to... to one of our charities, so if it's any consolation, it went to a good cause.<eos> It's not. Find out where they took it.<eos> I'll buy it back.<eos> It might be... in a container on a boat, on its way to a girl's school in Gwandara, Nigeria.
Yeah, I'm working undercover at a tanning salon.<eos> Yeah, you wish.<eos> Looks like somebody tried to replace Sam's chair again.<eos> Really, Eric?<eos> It has over 25 points of adjustment.
praise Moses's cock! I am born again!<eos> ( growls )<eos> Amen. Me, too.<eos> ( laughing ) For the first time in a decade, I ate a child.<eos> I took his life inside of me and it was ripe.
I'm sure that as a soldier there have been times when danger has...<eos> But, you've been in life full of...<eos> You faced danger.<eos> You know, a bullett or a mortal shell or a bayonet.<eos> But the fact is you face a kind of danger now, which is... well, it is no less dangerous.
Yeah.<eos> I know it's really confusing, so let's back up.<eos> I'm gonna tell you where that word comes from.<eos> That word comes from the word "nigger".<eos> It's a very mean word that white people use to call black people, and it means that we're not as good or as smart or as human as them.
Okay.<eos> I want to hear this plan.<eos> Hardison, you're gonna be with Sophie.<eos> We were never here in this apartment.<eos> It didn't exist.
- Move. - Aah!<eos> I'll take this way.<eos> Where's my picture?<eos> Vincent.<eos> Now, where is it?
I have important people coming over tonight.<eos> You might think it's cool for you and your important people to route a road through protected land.<eos> I don't.<eos> This town will die if we don't put another road in.<eos> It's already dead.
I never knew that you did that.<eos> You told me about it 20 years later.<eos> Rayna...<eos> You are still my daughter, and believe it or not, I care about your happiness.<eos> I only wish you didn't put it ahead of your own family's.
Yeah, I guessed it was something like that.<eos> It was a stupid mistake and I've had a long time to regret it.<eos> But you were right when you said it didn't matter.<eos> Tell me this is the same, that this baby won't make a difference.<eos> It's a means to an end. That's all.
It's weird and it's a waste of foil.<eos> I'm not taping one of your eyes open either.<eos> Oh, come on, that'll be hilarious.<eos> Mom, this is my boyfriend Jimmy.<eos> Jimmy, this is my mother, who is so self-involved that, though I have now said your name twice, I bet she has no idea what it is.
No, he does it all on the phones.<eos> Did he ever ask you to do anything in relation to the woman I mentioned earlier, Jackie Laverty?<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, we're still looking for her body, Ryan.<eos> Where is it?
We're going to have a baby.<eos> Am I the only one who's terrified?<eos> But why?<eos> Why are you so terrified?<eos> What if it doesn't know not to pick up knives or stick its finger in an electric socket?
Doesn't she have to?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> She may think he drove his wife to suicide, and deserves to rot in prison.<eos> In short, she may not wish to tell the truth to set him free.<eos> Then we need to get a statement from her before she finds out it could overturn the case.
I can just go?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But know this, audrey.<eos> The sky is starting to fall.<eos> While you're out there attempting the impossible, Trying to stay, It will continue to fall faster and faster,
Oh, I'm quite real, I assure you.<eos> I'm just not here.<eos> I have the HG hologram device.<eos> But what I do not have is the astrolabe!<eos> Now, where is it?
Aye, XO.<eos> What's in 'em? Three lives.<eos> So you just left civilization and never looked back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At first I thought this place was just my heritage, but it turned out to be my salvation.
You did this!<eos> - Aah!<eos> That apple turnover you gave me... he ate it!<eos> What?<eos> It was meant for you!
Not everyone can do what we do.<eos> The secrets we live with, the personal sacrifices we make.<eos> I just pray the world's a better place for them.<eos> I didn't choose this life, Owen.<eos> It chose me.
By the way, that's your whore name.<eos> Looks like it's back to selling cakes one car at a time.<eos> I'll just put these "Ludacris Specials" in the display case.<eos> You do that, "Cinnamon."<eos> Oh, no, I actually have a whore name, and that's not it.
Bryan and David would never keep me away from my baby brother or sister.<eos> Oh, Shania, sweetie, this baby isn't related to you.<eos> The doctor planted another lady's egg in me that was fertilized with David's sperm.<eos> Mom, this baby's growing inside you.<eos> It's absorbing all your love and niceness and yogurt.
I got your text, Dr. Saroyan.<eos> Did you need something?<eos> Remember when you wrote my name out in Farsi?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is it here, isn't it?
You're still awake.<eos> Of course I'm awake.<eos> God, it's quiet.<eos> You're out of baby milk.<eos> All it does is eat.
These girls are never, ever gonna forget this experience.<eos> Yeah, I'm hoping that they're repressing the memories as we speak. Thanks.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> So, how's the arm?<eos> It also hates camping.
The vault's software is designed to spit out ten random digits every two minutes.<eos> This makes it impossible to predict the access code at any given moment.<eos> The genius of the original plan is this algorithm.<eos> They hacked the software, fed the equation into it.<eos> It spits out escalating multiples of the number pi every two minutes.
What?<eos> That's why this is so much better than an SLS.<eos> You have long argued that that car is better than this.<eos> It is.<eos> JAMES: You've just been waxing about this car and how wonderful it is.
How we care.<eos> Tony and Kate are gone.<eos> But in their place today we have .their wonderful daughter Jodie and their talented son Mark.<eos> Tony and Kate loved this town.<eos> And looking at all of you here today... it certainly loved them.
I've got you, Frank.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Where's the antidote?<eos> - I can't give it to you.<eos> Where is it? !
- Save it.<eos> - It's not... it's not a dead baby joke.<eos> - Uh-huh. It's not.<eos> It's alive.<eos> What? when you do the thing with the baby, it's alive.
So, what happens now?<eos> I'm gonna go look for trouble.<eos> Of all the Lanterns who have ever worn the ring... there was one whose light shined brightest.<eos> At first, his humanity was thought to be a weakness.<eos> And yet it proved to be his greatest strength.
Shut up. This is our chance.<eos> I don't know why it's happening.<eos> Maybe it's God.<eos> I don't know. But we have a chance to make our life better.<eos> You had your life... and it's gone.
Chill out.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I don't have your money.<eos> And I'm going to stop risking my life to get it for you.<eos> Rodrigo took an egg from your house. It exploded, it's gone, I'm sorry.
It was.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - OK, you know, just, um...<eos> You know, Dad used to say there's only two acceptable reasons not to call in... one's amnesia, one's if you're dead.<eos> I've been thinking more and more about this life, and what it means for people like us.
When you're pregnant, you're really sensitive, and you pick up things like a radio antenna, like all sorts of signals.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What if the baby can feel my thoughts?<eos> What if it knows that I think it's gonna die?
- That's why you tried to throw me out. - Yes.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Send this to Miles.<eos> Tell him to run a search of that logo.<eos> The company it belongs to, CEO, location anything he can find that relates to this guy.
But now I understand.<eos> I sent them there.<eos> The wormhole in Central Park-<eos> I sent them back through time.<eos> Peter, you can stop the destruction before it occurs!
Now we're turning to the light.<eos> We're gonna have the best Christmas ever.<eos> By the way, I need your driver's license.<eos> Can you leave it out on the counter?<eos> What do you need it for?
Sorry, Steve.<eos> She's just so beautiful.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Are you digging for my heart in there, tadpole?<eos> It's there.
Not unlike Lady Heather.<eos> Clearly, Grissom has a yen for sexually adventurous women whose voracious appetites can only be sated by dangerous and unbridled passion.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, at-at least most of the time.<eos> That is, until he realized, of course, that even though you can have sexual satisfaction, it doesn't hold a candle to spirited intellectual stimulation.
I'll never tell you. It's a deep space emotion detector.<eos> The detector can tell you're impressed.<eos> You should be!<eos> Wha?<eos> The marvelous device, it's detecting a massive burst of anger from deep space!
I'll chop a hole, but it's probably not gonna do it.<eos> You'll have to put some food out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They probably got complaints about the smell And came to get the body out of the wall.<eos> You mean it's still in there?
- Where's our wheels?<eos> - Baloo!<eos> Jesus!<eos> We're missing a car!<eos> Where's it gone?
We take photos to keep in the file.<eos> The police officers want to see you.<eos> They have a few questions for you.<eos> Can't it wait? No, it can't.<eos> We have to take the baby and it needs a name.
But it does make you very aware of what you're using.<eos> Everybody that walked by, you could see them examining the street art, trying to understand what it was.<eos> There was a lot of conversation that went on in the street. You were always talking about the project. When people were walking down on Saturday, they wanted to talk about the project.<eos> Over the first three weeks of the project, the average electricity usage of the participants came down by 15%. So it's promising. And we're hoping that that change will be sustained.<eos> I'd thought about energy use in general, but I hadn't thought about how I would change my behavior, I didn't do anything about it. By participating in the project, what it did was just make me act on it as opposed to think nice thoughts about perhaps doing something.
- Absolutely not.<eos> - Well, don't misunderstand.<eos> I mean, the whole marriage would be a complete sham.<eos> I would expect nothing in return.<eos> - Then why would you do it?
And what do you know?<eos> I think I'm getting close.<eos> To what? What's happening, Jonah?<eos> Hmm? Where's the real deviation? Is it actually out here?<eos> Or is it in there?
Only dead flesh.<eos> Watch your back while we're away, mind you.<eos> Don't worry, there are plenty of bullets in my baby.<eos> Buck up!<eos> The beauty of life is that you never know when it will end!
And self-centered.<eos> And you were a really crappy boss.<eos> You really are bad at goodbyes.<eos> But you found your place here.<eos> And you made it a home and...
He is the sum of his actions.<eos> Every decision, no matter how small, speaks to the man.<eos> And the balance of his heart.<eos> And in his breast beats the heart of a lion.<eos> And what does it beat for?
No other pterosaur was even half the size of this one.<eos> And the fact that something so large that could fly, there was almost an aerodynamic question of whether this could even be.<eos> It was a truly astounding discovery.<eos> His creature had wings that were so large, they could easily have spanned the width of this building.<eos> It lived 70 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period.
We could even use automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.<eos> Same goes for transport.<eos> It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.<eos> Electric trams, conveyors, transveyors and maglevs which can take you virtually anywhere in the city, even up and down along with connecting you to other cities as well.<eos> And of course, in the event a car is required it is automated by satellite for safety and integrity.
Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible to build a 2000 square-foot home entirely by the machine, in one day.<eos> The reason that people are interested in automating construction is that it really brings a lot of benefits.<eos> For example, construction is pretty labor-intensive and although it provides jobs for a sector of the society it also has issues and complications.<eos> For example, construction is the most dangerous job that there is.<eos> It is worse than mining and agriculture.
This part of the journey is for you alone.<eos> There is a knight who guards the Tree of Life.<eos> You must defeat him at all costs.<eos> The heart of the tree.<eos> Where is it?
What time was your dinner reservation?<eos> Last night?<eos> 8:30.<eos> What did his heart do at 8:30?<eos> (beeping resumes) It... literally skipped a beat.
Is... is that red?<eos> I only drink white.<eos> Take this away, and let's get a bottle of Chardonnay, okay?<eos> - George, I didn't think you liked white wine.<eos> - Oh, I didn't, until Sophie showed me how wonderful it can be.
Not anymore, father.<eos> What you decide right now determines whether or not He will live or die.<eos> Why are you doing this to me ?<eos> Because I want you to understand that we are all hypocrites.<eos> You preach compassion, where is it now ?
Look around us.<eos> Look at you.<eos> I'm going to fall in love.<eos> It's ridiculous.<eos> They'll agree to a meeting and it'll be decisive.
And that's when Kate arrived to save the day.<eos> But the funny thing was, after everything Ben had been through in the last few hours, he suddenly realized he could save it himself.<eos> We think of law as a bunch of dusty books on the shelf.<eos> But the law is not rigid.<eos> It evolves, and it adapts.
H-how--how could you know that?<eos> I have a picture of him, standing next to you. You're holding his hand and he's smiling.<eos> He's not...hiding behind you like some children do.<eos> It tells me that you encouraged him and you gave him a lot of confidence.<eos> That picture, it doesn't belong to you.
Seriously.<eos> That's all you get, motherfucker.<eos> I was not surprised that Dave asked Krist to play on the record.<eos> I was surprised it hadn't happened any other time in the last 16 years.<eos> You never realize how important the bass sound is to the sound of a band until you put it in another band and go, "Oh, there it is."
And so that was the reason their calculations were wrong.<eos> For decades astronomers searched and searched for Vulcan.<eos> But they never found it, because Vulcan didn't exist.<eos> The explanation, the real explanation, was even more interesting than inventing the planet Vulcan.<eos> Because it required a modification, in fact, a complete rewriting of Newton's law of gravity.
These were profound questions.<eos> And out of those questions arose the science of thermodynamics.<eos> It's when concepts like heat and temperature and energy entered the scientific vocabulary for the first time.<eos> Now, along with that deeper understanding emerged what is probably the most important law of physics for understanding the evolution of the universe and the passage of time.<eos> It's called the second law of thermodynamics.

13 years later, after its mission was almost over, it turned around and took one last picture of its home solar system.<eos> And this is that picture.<eos> And the beautiful thing about this picture is this single pixel of light suspended against the blackness of space.<eos> Because that pixel, that point, is planet Earth, the most distant picture of our planet ever taken at six billion kilometres away.<eos> And whilst I suppose it has very limited scientific value, for me, this tiny point of light is the most powerful and profound demonstration of perhaps the most human of qualities,
Right, Cathy.<eos> Are you looking forward to the hen party, Betty?<eos> Aye, it should be great craic. It should be great craic!<eos> I haven't been to that place in years.<eos> What do you call it?
They're the only places in the universe hot enough and dense enough to fuse atoms together.<eos> Even then, only a fraction of the star reaches the extreme temperatures necessary.<eos> The sun is 6,000 Celsius at its surface, not nearly hot enough to power fusion.<eos> But deep below, where the temperature reaches 15m degrees, the sun fuses hydrogen into helium at a furious rate.<eos> Every second, it burns 600m tons of hydrogen.

These are the remote forests of northern California.<eos> 100 years ago, this whole area was teeming with people, all in search of one element.<eos> And the reason they were here can still be found in the original Sixteen To One Mine.<eos> This once stood at the centre of the California gold rush and, thanks to a quirk of geology, it continues to yield its precious bounty over 100 years later.<eos> You know, the unique thing about this place is that it sits right on the divide between the North American plate and the Pacific plate.
So Rømer had discovered that light doesn't travel instantaneously.<eos> It moves through space with a finite speed.<eos> This remarkable insight led to a measurement of the speed of light.<eos> We now know that light travels at precisely 299,792,458 metres per second.<eos> That means that the time it takes for me to click my fingers, light has travelled around the Earth seven times. Or that it travels 10 million million kilometres in one year. And that's the yardstick we use to measure the universe.
This first light is no longer visible but it's there.<eos> You just need to know how to look for it.<eos> This sea of shifting sand is the Namib Desert, the oldest desert in the world. And as the wind blows the sand off the top of the dunes, this landscape is constantly changing.<eos> This world has been sculpted by the sun.<eos> It drives the winds that shape the dunes and its light paints this place a deep orange.
I need the trilsettum serum.<eos> I don't have any left.<eos> Please. Help me, and I'll help you.<eos> The serum? Why do you need the serum?<eos> Because it's the only thing that's keeping me alive.
Klitschko holds on.<eos> And he's got heart!<eos> On a scale from one to 10, this cut was probably about an eight.<eos> Ten is an arterial cut that has arterial blood squirting out and blood's all over the ring, all over the fighter's face.<eos> The main danger of a cut like this is that it continues to become larger during the fight.
Hello, Hakim.<eos> I came to know that the angels have by mistake given you something that belongs to us.<eos> No one knows about it.<eos> I will bring up the child.<eos> It will help me in my old age.
You are a fine captain... but listen to Barentsz.<eos> He keeps it all up here.<eos> Did you have...<eos> An astrolabe...<eos> What do you need it for'?
Honey... My--my feet are higher than my head.<eos> I'm looking at a guy named Alfonso P. Dick.<eos> If this is forever, I think we gotta dream a little bigger.<eos> I'd love to have a plot in the full sun.<eos> Wouldn't that be awesome? Just to lie in the sun forever and not have it kill you?
Do you understand me? Promise me no one will find out about us.<eos> Where's Stefan?<eos> He gave himself over to Klaus to save his brother.<eos> Just give me the cure and I'll do whatever you want.<eos> You want your cure, there it is.
I'll be damned.<eos> This is not funny, Shawn.<eos> I'm the only sane person working this case and that makes my time even more valuable.<eos> Do you know have any idea how long it took me to find this ridiculous place?<eos> It doesn't have an address.
He was given his grandfather's name-<eos> - Callen.<eos> Yes.<eos> What about his first name?<eos> You know what it is?
I'm here for Mother.<eos> And for Susan.<eos> They're all together now.<eos> Heaven?<eos> Even if it existed, do you actually think that son of a bitch would be there?
No, I'm thinking about something simpler, actually. For us to maybe, uh...<eos> - What is -- what are you --<eos> - What? Nothing.<eos> This guy's buying up a bunch of expensive office equipment, supplies.<eos> The thing is, it never gets dropped off.
You and I both know that that is not true.<eos> I loved you.<eos> I loved Damon too.<eos> Humanity is a vampire's greatest weakness.<eos> No matter how easy it is to turn it off, it keeps trying to fight its way back in.
Great Falls, Montana.<eos> October 19, 1865.<eos> Six months after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, a fur trapper reports what might be the first documented UFO crash in the Old West.<eos> In 1865, the Missouri Democrat reported that a trapper saw a light traveling through the sky at night.<eos> It flew over his camp, broke apart and crashed in the forest some miles away.
Olivia and Lincoln, they went to the morgue to get the other body.<eos> Astrid?<eos> Are you at the morgue?<eos> Yeah, we're just heading to the elevator now-- listen, you have got to evacuate the room. Get the body from the tunnel locked down.<eos> What? It's going to explode and release spores!
Connor.<eos> Yes, yes. Connor.<eos> Connor.<eos> Where is Connor?<eos> There's a--there's a light, and it dances.
Tessa, go.<eos> Just go.<eos> Well, hi, neighbor.<eos> Dinner tonight?<eos> Now, bio scientists have determined that when you remove an animal from its indigenous environment... For example, the Gentoo penguin. ...And deposit said animal into a region that it's not accustomed to it is far more susceptible to infectious disease.
No, Bree.<eos> Ever since you've turned this soup kitchen into a bisque kitchen, the homeless don't feel comfortable here.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just trying to make this place special.<eos> It was already special.
If you want to encounter Mohammed, if you want a way to meet with his ideas one of the greatest places to go is to go to Mecca.<eos> Muslims pray in the direction of Mecca five times a day.<eos> So certainly as a holy shrine it is the center of the Earth.<eos> A Heaven's gate, where the opening of Heaven takes place.<eos> And that's why it is so revered.
Good news.<eos> We found the ear.<eos> I found it.<eos> Uh, I went back to the convention center, stayed there all night, looking through dumpsters and trash.<eos> But guess where it was.
Screw you.<eos> I'm just saying, don't worship the people leaving Greendale.<eos> Worship the people that are here.<eos> Worship this place.<eos> It changes people's life.
What demand?<eos> What Susannah says next...<eos> It concerns you directly, sir.<eos> Just play it.<eos> 'There is only one demand, and it is a simple one.
Well, aside from the obvious creep factor, I don't really feel any different.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I still remember my name.<eos> Still hate anchovies.<eos> The device isn't designed to drain your brain, it simply downloads your consciousness into its memory bank.
I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I can't, either.<eos> My fingers are covered in coupon paper cuts and, well, this salad dressing tastes like douche.<eos> We know you're trying to help us, and we know that you enjoy this life, but it's a God-awful way to live.
But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now.<eos> I... don't... know.<eos> No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant.<eos> I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself.<eos> It knows what it's doing.
You are H-O-T hot.<eos> Oh, my God. What do you say we get out of here before dork girl comes back?<eos> This is exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> I can see the life that I want.<eos> It's just out of reach.
Jai, I don't know why the blonde at 10:00 isn't into Indian guys.<eos> Work advice.<eos> You're the one with Langley dialed.<eos> And you're the one with a connected father and a fat new office under the DCI.<eos> What's it called again?
I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.<eos> I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated...<eos> A word cloud.<eos> This is how we can get gift ideas.<eos> The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears.
The gold?<eos> I mean this has gold on it, too.<eos> And then I thought, maybe, actually, it might be just the very presence of this word, this incredibly powerful word "Qur'an", spelt here with the Q and the apostrophe-A-N.<eos> Is it just that word that gives it it's sacredness?<eos> And then I thought, what about some Muslim equivalent of Sam's mum, trying to desperately get rid of a urinary tract infection. Prayed so hard, that she wore this word away, would it lose some of its sacredness?
♪ And I live in it<eos> ♪ It's 35 and six months old ♪ It's changed a lot since it was new ♪ It's done stuff it wasn't built to do<eos> ♪ I often try to fill it up with wine<eos> ♪ And the weirdest thing about it is ♪ I spend so much time hating it<eos> ♪ But it never says a bad word about me
I prefer it that way.<eos> I don't need a man telling me what to do.<eos> - But what about the baby?<eos> - I got it under control.<eos> But it's gonna burn.
A burial ground.<eos> Or a treasure.<eos> If we look at the pyramids, we cannot really say that we understand everything about the significance of their erection.<eos> But we can assume that this could be the same for our repository.<eos> It will be interpreted the same way as we interpret the pyramids.
I came to collect some things of mine.<eos> - Of yours?<eos> - That I'd left behind when I... When I had to leave.<eos> You had to get your things in my flat?<eos> It sounds silly, but it used to be mine.
That way is East, bro.<eos> That way is East. - We've flown over Mecca now.<eos> - Paki's gone mental, bro.<eos> Mecca is in the East, yeah.<eos> Where the sun... where it rises, you behn choad paki prong!
- We really can come back another...<eos> - Sit the fuck down! Now!<eos> And that I love her.<eos> I love her.<eos> Good God, you toss that word around, but you have no idea what it means!
You were all flawed.<eos> I chose you because you were like me.<eos> You were all alone.<eos> You were all looking for something that you couldn't find out there.<eos> I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you.
Why?<eos> Think of this wine as what you keep calling "hell."<eos> There's many other names for it, too.<eos> "Malevolence." "Evil." "Darkness."<eos> And here it is, swirling around in the bottle, unable to get out, because if it did, it would spread.
There's a secret tunnel that leads to open countryside.<eos> - Is there?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And they think the butler crawled along it and escaped. Crikey!<eos> - Where is it?
For assault and battery.<eos> And home invasion.<eos> And reless endangerment.<eos> * I'm gonna fly on down then fly away *<eos> In my dream, I'm lying on this rickety old bed, And it keeps banging against the wall.
Since you proved incapable of minding your own garden.<eos> I won't have you telling me what to do in my own property.<eos> Look, I'm going right up to the mayor and, um, my cousin is a personal friend of his.<eos> Well, no-one is going to make me chop this tree down.<eos> It's mine.
That lying son of a...<eos> I mean, look at these financials.<eos> The credit crunch wiped him out.<eos> He's maybe three, four months from declaring bankruptcy.<eos> Lundy offers the egg up to the museum for the exhibition so that it falls under their insurance policy, hires a little local muscle to help with the heist tidy payout.
Gratitude seizes the tongue.<eos> Well perhaps a woman will aid in the untangling of it.<eos> Name any slave, and the wet joys of her body are yours.<eos> I confess to certain longings. For one not yet soiled by the other men.<eos> Give name to your desire, and see it fulfilled.
How can saying this out loud be helpful?<eos> If you want to throw a successful dinner party, there are certain rules that must be followed.<eos> If the good silver is used, it must be polished.<eos> If music is played, the volume should be low.<eos> If the guests bring wine, it must be served.
People would part like the Red Sea when I walked down the hallway.<eos> Now I'm invisible.<eos> And you think being seen as a cheap tramp is better?<eos> A bad reputation is better than no reputation at all.<eos> Look, I know that high school feels like your whole life right now, but it's going to end.
I'm alive.<eos> I know.<eos> What did you do ?<eos> "Dad, I didn't do a fucking thing !<eos> I kicked a box and it all blew up !"
I can't afford a new crib.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I'm a part of your team, remember?<eos> I'm gonna get you a crib, okay?<eos> I'll probably have to have it delivered, so you need to be here.
With my poor mistress - and with your husband before that!<eos> You're absolutely raving, girl!<eos> For goodness' sake get a hold of yourself!<eos> You do not deserve to live in this beautiful place! It is mine!<eos> It is mine...
The savior... The one who will lead us all...<eos> The sentient power.<eos> I wonder if he does horoscopes.<eos> You're taking this assignment too personally.<eos> That's because it is personal, Waller.
- Bacon.<eos> Bacon?<eos> Even though he's hideous as, he's still got some cool powers.<eos> He's got the light in his stomach.<eos> I don't really know what it's for, but when he's happy, shit, it gets bright as!
You said you saw more clues from your vision. Work them...<eos> But be quiet about it.<eos> All right.<eos> This business about another blackout... Keep it to yourself.<eos> If we can't tell the world when it's going to happen, that's beyond irresponsible.
But you're using the harness as a safety net.<eos> As long as you know it's there to catch you, you don't have to commit.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't need a safety net.<eos> It's just getting in your way.
we're in trouble!<eos> so I climbed way up high.<eos> The giant tree growing on the island has collapsed down to the roots!<eos> Then that means the felling of the tree was the cause of our magic power drying up?<eos> It is called the Tenrou Tree.

She's not going to keep it.<eos> You gonna get that, or should I?<eos> Heat up the bottle, then.<eos> You have to deal with it, Mike.<eos> Where is it?
It is dangerous.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> Now stop that!<eos> My body has to be good for something.<eos> Why would I have it otherwise?
The airfield, the postcard, the lab... it all fits.<eos> Anyway, what else have we got?<eos> We need the vaccine.<eos> Why didn't you tell us about this airfield before?<eos> We didn't know what it meant.
Answer him.<eos> Cara, stop.<eos> What has she done to me?<eos> She's cast the Maternity Spell.<eos> It replicates the connection between the mother and a child in the womb.
It's so beautiful.<eos> You can't even believe it's real.<eos> He's ready.<eos> The light?<eos> What's it look like?
Of course, they mocked me and said, I'm too ugly anyway.<eos> And even now, that I'm dead and miss you, I'll never regret my decisions!<eos> Never doubt it.<eos> You must listen to your heart and follow its path.<eos> It will always show you the right way.
How small?<eos> Oh, very.<eos> I have developed a device...<eos> It's a balloon, actually, that I insert into the fracture.<eos> And it keeps the cement in place and stops it from leaking.
- Let me go!<eos> - Put her down!<eos> Get her!<eos> The egg!<eos> Where is it?
An occasional sorority girl might, um, You know, help fill you out a little bit.<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's damon.<eos> Maybe this heartache will be good for him.<eos> It'll remind him that he has one, even if it doesn't beat.
Somebody needs to humiliate him like he humiliated our boys. Moustache.<eos> Get me a juice box.<eos> - Now!<eos> - And that somebody is us.<eos> You can vomit into this food, cause it already smells like it.
And until then, all we need to do is just sit back and... watch this little miracle here dazzle us.<eos> - I'm tingling.<eos> - I am, too.<eos> It's like my heart is full for the first time in forever.<eos> God, it's really pounding.
You are a kid.<eos> You never got past high school football, you big bald baby!<eos> Would you just listen to me?<eos> Look, why shouldn't that place cross our wires like it did with the snowmobile or your cell phone?<eos> Look, it's opening up some sort of pathway out there, right?
You always were my favorite, Jim.<eos> My friend, for you.<eos> Stop!<eos> You feed it thoughts of dead cells.<eos> But it calls for the living.
We all know that evil exists.<eos> The newspapers are filled with stories about young girls who suddenly vanish.<eos> But we don't pay attention because we're worried about our marriages... concerned about our friendships... anxious about our employees.<eos> Yes, we don't pay attention to evil because we think it will never come to our house.<eos> But it does.
Let's fire up this intergalactic subway token and send our visitors on a train to nirvana.<eos> I can't.<eos> Once it's activated, it sends all Kryptonians to the new world.<eos> Including you.<eos> I know my destiny and it's here.
So if the geysers on Enceladus are similar, then that raises the intriguing possibility that there's an ocean of liquid water beneath the surface of the moon and it raises a very interesting question because Enceladus is far too small<eos> to have retained any meaningful source of heat at its core, so where does that heat come from?<eos> On Earth, the geysers are driven by the intense temperatures inside the planet, hot enough to melt rock and power volcanoes.<eos> But Enceladus is so tiny that its core should be frozen solid.<eos> Enceladus must be getting its heat from somewhere else, and it's thought that it might come from its peculiar orbit around Saturn.
Brenda Leigh, a word, please.<eos> Uh, it's important.<eos> Your mother has something she wants to say to you.<eos> Oh? Mama, what is it?<eos> Well, you know, you live your whole life in a certain place, it becomes a part of you.
There's five million billion tons of air surrounding the Earth.<eos> That's the equivalent of a weight of one kilogram pressing down on every square centimetre of our bodies.<eos> Or, put it another way, if I'm about a metre square, that's ten tons of weight pressing down.<eos> Now I say pressing down, but that's not entirely right, that's not how air pressure works.<eos> It presses in every direction at once.
Might help with your analysis of the tread pattern. Get us to a make and model of a vehicle sooner.<eos> A man takes a big risk crossing a picket line.<eos> And this concrete tomb just might be a message.<eos> Cases like this bring the term "John Doe" full circle.<eos> It was first used as a legal placeholder during property disputes.
Only stressed.<eos> You notice anything interesting about little moon over there?<eos> Respect, honor, defense of his mom's privates.<eos> He's a principled sociopath.<eos> Maybe. He's ok with danger as long as it sticks to a set of rules.
You can make a father proud!<eos> I'm not your son.<eos> You watch out for those emotional reactions.<eos> The heart.<eos> It'll blind you, son.
Oh no no no.<eos> The one driving wasn't your daughter, but a male student from a fisheries high school.<eos> He does have a temporary license though.<eos> However...a temporary license is still only temporary.<eos> It's not a permanent one, so...
I've done all I can for you.<eos> Now you're on your own.<eos> - But I don't know my way home.<eos> - Just follow the sun.<eos> It'll take you there.
Tonight at 11:00...<eos> ♪ two... Two, three... ♪<eos> Boy, that thing's big.<eos> Fry, is my colossal eye too big?<eos> No, it's what makes you you.
Um...<eos> It is a... compliment. But, I'm not that refreshing.<eos> No, you are. Even your family name.<eos> Kuronuma, too.<eos> But it means black swamp.
